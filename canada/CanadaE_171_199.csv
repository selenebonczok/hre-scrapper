“The report importantly stresses the need to press ahead with truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan government should implement the report’s recommendations in full, in line with the commitments already made in the UN Human Rights Council resolution 30/1. As the High Commissioner has noted, slow progress on these commitments has resulted in few concrete results.
“Amnesty International also calls on the UN Human Rights Council to welcome the High Commissioner’s report and keep the situation in Sri Lanka on its agenda. The council should also reaffirm its support for Resolution 30/1, ensure the Office of the High Commissioner continues to monitor progress on commitments, and urge the Sri Lankan government to meet those commitments in a time-bound manner.”

The campaign Unheard No More: Syrian women shaping Syria’s future illustrates how since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, women have been subjected to multiple violations and abuses including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, abduction and gender-based violence at the hands of the Syrian authorities and other parties involved in the conflict.
The new campaign, being launched on International Women’s Day, invites members of the public to send Syrian women a message of solidarity calling for equal and effective representation in the political process. The campaign aims to amplify the voices of women playing crucial roles as active members of Syrian society by becoming activists, peaceful protestors, organizers of humanitarian relief and founders of organizations and community centres.
“Eight years since the start of the crisis, Syrian women have suffered tremendously over the course of the conflict, yet they’ve not given up and have instead become brave everyday heroes. They are political activists and they report abuses committed by those in power. Many of these women are the sole providers for their families and risk their own lives speaking up,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Campaigns Director.
“Women’s participation in political processes is fundamental for achieving gender equality and human rights for all. The international community, especially Iran, Turkey and Russia, must pressure the Syrian government and armed opposition groups to end sexual and other gender-based violence and discrimination. They must also consult with women and ensure that they are represented effectively in peace talks, negotiations, the drafting of the constitution and other peace-building processes.”
Amnesty International interviewed 12 women activists who fled the Syrian conflict and sought safety in neighbouring countries and elsewhere. The women told the organization how they were arbitrarily detained, abducted and held in poor conditions with limited access to basic services. They also talked about how they were shunned by their families after their release and how they were harassed and received death threats for their humanitarian and political activism, as well as for trying to find out the fate of loved ones who had been forcibly disappeared or abducted. 
“Syrian women must be included in discussions about the past and future of their country, at the local, regional and international level. Ending gender-based discrimination is crucial to ensure accountability and a just society in Syria,” said Samah Hadid.
The women Amnesty International spoke to expressed concern over being under-represented in the decision-making process about Syria’s future. They said that in some instances, only women representing the government or opposition had been included in those discussions.
Background
Since 2011, Amnesty International has documented gender-based violations against women carried out by the Syrian government and armed opposition groups.
The organization’s findings show that women detained by the Syrian authorities have been subjected to invasive security checks upon arrival at detention centres, in some cases, amounting to rape. Women in detention reported either witnessing or having been subjected to sexual harassment or assault by guards. Women were also detained alongside male detainees and watched over by male guards. They also were denied access to medical treatment for chronic illnesses.
Amnesty International has also documented how armed groups in Idlib and Aleppo violated international humanitarian law by abducting women and forcing them to work in kitchens in informal detention centres run by armed groups. They have also been subjected to corporal punishment, such as stoning and flogging including for alleged offences such as sexual intercourse outside marriage.

As part of Amnesty International’s BRAVE campaign to promote the rights of human rights defenders, the mural depicts Afghan women protesting for their rights, demanding equality, and raising their voices for justice.
This is the second mural that Amnesty International has unveiled in Kabul as part of its BRAVE, or “Shuja” (in Dari) campaign. The first mural was consecrated to the memory of journalists who have been killed doing their jobs, depicting the famous Afghan photographer Shah Marai of Agence France Presse holding a camera.
“Afghan women are famous for their resolve and we are celebrating that this Women’s Day. Despite more than 17 years of conflict, they have made remarkable strides. They are lawyers, doctors, judges, teachers, engineers, athletes, activists, politicians, journalists, bureaucrats, run their own businesses and are in the ranks of the military and police,” said Samira Hamidi, South Asia campaigner at Amnesty International.
“These hard-won advances must not be rolled back at any cost. Women have been at the forefront of the calls for peace in Afghanistan. But there can be no peace process worthy of the name that excludes women or compromises on their rights. Afghan women cannot be ignored or silenced.”
Important human rights gains
Under Taliban rule, women’s rights were violated with impunity. Women were not allowed to freely exercise their human rights, including the rights to freedom of movement, to education, and to work.
Now, there is a dedicated Ministry of Women’s Affairs, with departments throughout the country at provincial levels. Afghanistan also has an Independent Human Rights Commission chaired by a renowned woman human rights defender, Sima Samar. And women constitute 27 per cent each of parliament and the civil service.
In 2009, Afghanistan passed the law on Elimination of Violence Against Women, after a hard-fought struggle led by women human rights defenders. The law, which fell into disuse after parts of it were absorbed into Afghanistan’s revised Penal Code, was reaffirmed by President Ashraf Ghani in March 2018.
Enduring challenges
These impressive gains notwithstanding, Afghan women continue to endure great challenges when it comes to their human rights.
In 2018, Afghanistan suffered the highest number of civilian casualties since the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) began recording figures. There were 3,804 deaths and 7,189 people were injured. One in ten civilian casualties were women.
Women continue to face other forms of violence and abuse. As a UNAMA report in 2018 found, there are dismayingly few prosecutions of violent crimes against women. More than half of the 237 cases monitored by UNAMA between 2015 and 2017 were instead referred for ‘mediation’ in violation of the Elimination of Violence Against Women law.
The UNAMA report also found that in 280 murders of women, there were convictions in a mere 50 cases. Most of the cases were not even heard by the courts.
In December 2018, members of Afghanistan’s women’s football team came forward to speak out against the sexual assault and harassment they suffered. At the time, Hafizullah Rahimi, the head of Afghanistan’s Olympic committee, acknowledged: “Sexual abuse does exist, not only within the Football Federation but in other sports federations as well. We have to fight it.” An investigation is currently underway.
Since peace talks between the USA and the Taliban have begun, there has been extremely limited participation of women and no serious discussion on women’s rights.
“It is crucial that Afghanistan builds on the limited but important gains made on women’s rights so that we are able to confront the many challenges that remain. The international community must stand with Afghan women at this crucial time,” said Samira Hamidi.

“This is a shameful decision that will shroud this administration’s actions in even more secrecy with little accountability for its victims.
“The public deserves to know how many civilians are killed by U.S. actions. This is an unconscionable decision and in complete disregard of fundamental human rights.
“It is incomprehensible that this vital work will be left only to human rights organizations such as ours.”
Background
In 2016, Amnesty International USA spoke out on the Obama-era policy documenting standards for airstrikes, when they were first announced, calling for more transparency and accountability.
On June 6, 2018 Amnesty International published a report on air strikes in Raqqa, Syria documenting gaping holes in the US-led Coalition’s insistence that their forces did enough to minimize civilian harm, providing a strong prima facie case that many Coalition attacks that killed and injured civilians and destroyed homes and infrastructure violated international humanitarian law.

On 7 March Malak al-Kashef appeared in front of a Supreme State Security Prosecutor, who ordered her detention for 15 days pending investigations for “aiding a terrorist organization” and “misusing social media to commit a crime punishable by law”. The police then took her to an undisclosed location, where they detained her incommunicado until 10 March, when her lawyer was able to confirm that the police is detaining her in solitary confinement at al-Haram police station in Giza. Her detention is up for renewal again on 19 March, when the prosecutor will decide whether to release her or extend her detention.
 *****
Fears are growing for the safety and wellbeing of Malak al-Kashef, a transgender woman seized during a police raid from her home in Giza in the early hours of 6 March and who has not been heard from since, Amnesty International said.
Malak al-Kashef was taken by police to an undisclosed location. Her lawyers have not been able to locate her and police stations have denied she is in their custody.
“There are real fears for the physical safety and psychological wellbeing of Malak al-Kashef. Egyptian authorities have a horrific track record of persecuting people based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, including through carrying out forced anal examinations which amount to torture,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International believes that Malak’s arrest relates to her calls for peaceful protests following a major train crash in Cairo’s central train station on 27 February that killed at least 25 people.
“Malak al-Kashef appears to have been detained solely for peacefully exercising her rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Instead of holding her in an undisclosed location, the authorities should release her immediately and unconditionally,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“Due to her gender identity, Malak is at increased risk of torture by the police, including rape and sexual violence, as well as assault by other detainees. The Egyptian authorities are responsible for her physical and psychological safety. They must immediately reveal her whereabouts, and pending her immediate and unconditional release, ensure that she is protected from torture and other abuses.”
Dozens of people have been arrested in recent days over anti-government protests relating to last week’s train crash that killed at least 25 people and injured many others. At least 32 people remain in pre-trial detention over unfounded charges relating to the peaceful expression of their opinions.
Malak al-Kashef is a transgender woman who is undergoing gender affirming surgery. However, she has not yet managed to have her gender identity officially recognized and is therefore registered as male in official documents. Her lawyers have sent appeals to the office of the Public Prosecutor and the Minister of Interior asking about her whereabouts.
In recent years, Egypt’s authorities have waged a sinister campaign targeting LGBTI people and carried out dozens of arrests and forced anal examinations in blatant violation of international law.

“This decision highlights the Thai authorities’ abuse of judicial powers to restrict the peaceful association and expression of the political opposition. This far-reaching measure raises strong concerns about the human rights to freedom of association and expression in the period leading to the elections.
“We call on the military government and all election candidates to commit to protecting these fundamental rights during the elections – and for the next government to undertake deep reforms to end the continued decline in human rights protections. 
“Serious human rights violations have flourished in Thailand’s past decade of political instability, including these last four years of military rule. Sweeping and vaguely worded legal restrictions, including a ban on meetings of five or more persons for ‘political’ purposes, have facilitated a wide-ranging attack on political opponents and civil society.”
Background
The Constitutional Court today ruled that the Thai Raksa Chart Party should be dissolved. It determined that the party’s nomination of Thun Kramom Ying Ubolratana Rajakanya was ‘hostile to the constitutional monarchy’ and in breach of the Political Parties Act 2017. It also ruled that the party executives should be banned from competing in elections for 10 years.
Ahead of the elections scheduled for 24 March 2019, Amnesty International has put forward a Human Rights Agenda which outlines nine top human rights issues that parliamentary candidates, and those elected to the next government, must prioritize. These include the rights to freedom from torture and enforced disappearance, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and association, and the right to privacy in the design of cybersecurity measures.

The South Sudanese government, and particularly its National Security Service (NSS), is allegedly responsible for widespread human rights violations including arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture and ill-treatment in detention, which are committed with rampant impunity.
This is the first time ever that the South Sudan government has been taken to the regional court for human rights violations committed by the NSS.
“Amnesty International welcomes this judicial development which offers a ray of hope for the people of South Sudan who have endured seemingly endless human rights violations and abuses with no justice in sight until now,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
On 6 March, the East African Court of Justice sitting in Arusha, Tanzania, upon hearing an application by the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU), summoned South Sudan’s Advocate-General to appear before it on 25 March.
He will be required to explain why Kerbino has still not been presented before a competent and impartial court, 10 months after his arrest on 27 April 2018. He will also have to explain why the authorities froze Kerbino’s assets and closed his bank accounts, and why he was not granted formal access to his family, doctors and lawyers.
Kerbino Wol was arbitrarily arrested and detained without charge after presenting himself to the NSS in response to the security agency’s summons. He was initially detained at the Blue House detention centre, which is notorious for torture and other ill-treatment.
Following a riot at the Blue House detention centre on 7 October 2018, he was reportedly put under solitary confinement, after which his health seriously deteriorated, Amnesty International has confirmed.
Several days after the riot, the authorities seized Kerbino properties and froze his personal and business bank accounts.
“This court decision could open up a much-needed alternative pathway for justice for victims of human rights violations in South Sudan because the national justice system has failed dismally,” said Seif Magango.
“The government of South Sudan must see this as a wake-up call and reform its national justice system and take its obligation to investigate and prosecute alleged human rights violations seriously.”
Background
Kerbino Wol is one of hundreds of people illegally arrested and detained without charge by South Sudanese authorities for months, sometimes even years. Yet the release of detainees is a key pillar of the September 2018 peace agreement. While a few detainees have been released, many remain locked up, and arbitrary arrests by the NSS continue with impunity.

The crucial statement, due to be delivered at a Human Rights Council session on Thursday, is expected to address Saudi Arabia’s use of counter-terrorism legislation to persecute people peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression and assembly, and the killing of Jamal Khashoggi.
“This initiative at the UN Human Rights Council offers a rare opportunity for states to take a strong public stand against the catalogue of human rights violations by the government of Saudi Arabia.  States who stay silent risk abdicating responsibility at a crucial moment and sending a dangerous message that Saudi Arabia can continue to commit egregious abuses without being held to account,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“States, including key allies of Saudi Arabia, must use the joint statement to demand the immediate and unconditional release of the group of detained women human rights defenders and all others who have been detained solely for their criticism of the government.”
As a member of the Human Rights Council, Saudi Arabia is required to uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights. Yet the government has consistently failed to implement key recommendations to address its dire human rights record.
Last week, Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution announced that it had concluded its investigations into the cases of a group of human rights defenders, including women activists, who have been detained without charge since May 2018, announcing they will soon face charges and be referred to court.
The charges listed by the prosecutor are the same as those the prosecution said several women human rights defenders confessed to last year. At least 10 human rights defenders, including several of the women activists were tortured including by being sexually abused and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment during the first three months of their detention last year. The activists were detained incommunicado during that period, with no access to their family or lawyers. Women human rights defenders detained in Saudi Arabia last year include Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Shadan al-Anezi and Nouf Abdulaziz.
Saudi Arabia’s authorities have repeatedly denied that any of the activists were tortured.
“The Saudi Arabian authorities have an abysmal track record when it comes to fair trials. Pending their release, Saudi Arabia must urgently grant independent monitoring bodies immediate and unfettered access to the detained activists to investigate these shocking torture allegations,” said Heba Morayef.
The killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi is another emblematic example of the extreme lengths to which the Saudi Arabian authorities have been prepared to go to crush peaceful dissent.
The government of Saudi Arabia has also severely restricted freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, detained human rights defenders, religious clerics and critics and called for the execution of activists and religious clerics facing grossly unfair trials. Despite limited reforms, women continue to face systemic discrimination in law and practice under the repressive guardianship system.
“The international community has a duty to hold Saudi Arabia to account for its grim human rights record. Human Right Council members have a particular responsibility to take strong and collective action as a first step towards accountability for Saudi Arabia’s litany of appalling abuses,” said Heba Morayef.

Since January...","An investigation by Amnesty International has revealed that dozens of Egyptian human rights defenders have been targeted by phishing attacks since the beginning of this year, putting them in grave danger amid Abdelfattah al-Sisi’s government’s intensifying crackdown on dissent.
Since January 2019 Amnesty Tech has analyzed dozens of suspicious emails sent to Egyptian human rights defenders, journalists and NGOs. The organization found that the emails used a technique known as OAuth Phishing to gain access to private accounts, and that attacks spiked during key political moments such as the anniversary of Egypt’s uprising on 25 January. 
“These digital attacks appear to be part of a sustained campaign to intimidate and silence critics of the Egyptian government. Over the past year Egyptian human rights defenders have faced an unprecedented assault from the authorities, risking arrest and imprisonment whenever they speak out, and these chilling attempts to target them online pose yet another threat to their vital work,” said Ramy Raoof, Tactical Technologist at Amnesty Tech.
“President al-Sisi’s government’s crackdown on freedom of expression is growing worse by the day, and it is more important than ever that human rights defenders can communicate online without fear of reprisal. There are strong indications that the Egyptian authorities are behind these attacks. We are calling on them to stop their relentless attack on human rights defenders and respect the rights to privacy, freedom of expression and association.”
The digital attacks documented by Amnesty International occurred between 18 January and 13 February 2019. OAuth Phishing is a technique which abuses a legitimate feature of many online service providers that allows third-party applications to gain access to an account. For example, an external calendar application might request access to a user’s email account to add upcoming events or flight times. With OAuth Phishing, attackers craft malicious third-party applications that trick targets into giving them access to their accounts. 
Amnesty International has released a detailed analysis of these attacks as well as information on how to protect against this kind of phishing.
Attacks coinciding with political events
The attacks documented by Amnesty International coincided with a number of important events that took place in Egypt at the start of this year. In the run-up to the eighth anniversary of Egypt’s 25 January uprising, Amnesty International recorded 11 phishing attacks against NGOs and media outlets. There was another burst of attacks during French President Emmanuel Macron’s visit to Cairo to meet with President al-Sisi on 28 and 29 January. The attacks peaked on 29 January, the day that President Macron met with human rights defenders from four prominent Egyptian NGOs. Later, in the first week of February, several media organizations were targeted, many of whom were reporting on the process of amending the Egyptian Constitution that had just started.
In recent years the Egyptian authorities have ramped up harassment of civil society through a repressive law imposing harsh restrictions on NGOs, and have launched criminal investigations against dozens of human rights defenders and NGO staff for “receiving foreign funding”. Investigative judges have also ordered a travel ban against at least 31 NGO staff, and asset freezes of 10 individuals and seven organizations. Dozens of human rights defenders are being held in lengthy pre-trial detention on absurd charges.
The selective targeting of human rights defenders and the timing in relation to specific political events suggests this wave of attacks is politically, rather than financially, motivated. The list of individuals and organizations targeted in this campaign of phishing attacks has significant overlaps with those targeted in an older phishing attack wave, known as Nile Phish, disclosed in 2017 by Citizen Lab and the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). Almost all the targets of Nile Phish were being investigated by the Egyptian authorities in relation to “foreign funding”.
“We are urging Egyptian human rights defenders to be vigilant and to contact Amnesty Tech if they receive any suspicious emails,” said Ramy Raoof.
“Until the Egyptian government ends its appalling assault on civil society, activists and human rights defenders must ensure they are keeping themselves safe while they carry out their important work.”

Seo Ji-hyun, South Korea’s #MeToo pioneer 
Seo Ji-hyun is a bona fide trailblazer in South Korea, spawning a #MeToo movement that has exposed several public figures for their acts of abuse. In January 2018, Seo, a public prosecutor, accused her boss of groping her at a dinner. When she complained, he retaliated by having her transferred to a remote town. In January 2019, he was sentenced to two years in prison for abusing his power. Since Seo’s courageous decision to go public, other women have followed suit, leading to a string of charges against a number of alleged abusers. “The only power I had was the truth,” says Seo. “And the only thing I could do was speak the truth.” Watch her story.

Loujain al-Hathloul, freedom fighter in Saudi Arabia 
In a society where women’s movement and behaviour are controlled by men and the government, Loujain chose a different route. She’s made headlines around the world for her audacious efforts to secure freedom for women in Saudi Arabia. She once live-tweeted herself driving into the country from the United Arab Emirates – and was detained for 73 days as a result. An early proponent of the right to drive movement, Loujain and her fellow activists scored a victory for women’s rights when the driving ban was finally lifted in June 2018. But Loujain and other woman’s rights activists are still in prison, locked up since May 2018. Held without charge, they are accused of being “Agents of Embassies”, and have been tortured and sexually harassed in prison. In a recent CNN article, Loujain’s brother, Walid, said his sister is “the hero of many women and girls across Saudi Arabia and throughout the world,” adding: “We cannot stand by and watch her suffer.” Neither should we. Make your choice and support Loujain and her fellow activists today.

Nancy Arias Arteaga & Esperanza Lucciotto: two mothers for justice in Mexico 
Nancy (pictured) and Esperanza have made the only choice they could: they’re demanding justice for the murders of their daughters, Alondra and Karla. Alondra was found dead in her apartment, having endured constant abuse from her boyfriend. Karla had accused her boss of sexually harassing her and was later found murdered at her workplace. Mexico has one of the highest rates of murders of women in the world. In 2017 alone, 3357 women were murdered there. Such murders happen in a landscape shaped by entrenched inequalities between the genders and a brutal devaluing of women’s lives. Esperanza’s dogged determination to have her daughter’s killer brought to justice has seen her threatened and harassed. But neither she nor Nancy are giving up. “I don’t want other girls to go through this,” says Nancy. “I do what I do in honour of Alondra’s memory.” Help Nancy and Esperanza today.

14 brave women say no to hate in Poland 
When demonstrators called for a “white Poland” during an independence march in 2017, 14 women chose to defy the racism and fascism on display. Their message was simple: “Fascism stop”. But their choice – of equality and unity over hate and division – made them a target for attack. A group of demonstrators kicked, spat at and screamed at the women. “They first pulled away our banner, then started tearing our clothes and kicking us. I was kicked several times in my back,” recalls Elzbieta, one of the women. Instead of properly investigating the assault on the women, the authorities convicted them of obstructing a lawful assembly. On 13 February, a judge ordered the investigation into the assault to be re-opened. Now, the prosecutors must find the attackers – not justify their violence. The 14 women continue to stand strong. Let’s stand with them.

Joey Joleen Mataele, living life on her terms in Tonga 
When Joey was 14, she chose to live as the woman she knew she was – a decision that put her at odds with family and school friends who only saw her as the male body she was born in. Joey is a Leiti, a community of – in Western terms – LGBTI+ people with deep roots in Tonga’s cultural past. Pre-colonial Tonga had a very fluid notion of gender which allowed Leitis, who include trans people, to thrive. But with the advent of colonialism and Christianity, attitudes towards Leitis have been tainted by prejudice. “When I was 14, I got raped by my father’s head of security,” says Joey. “My father said, ‘He asked for it.’ He told me so many times to stop acting like a woman. And I think that’s when I decided that I am not going to tolerate any more of this. I decided to leave school because I couldn’t handle the harassment, the physical abuse. That’s when I made the decision: I am going to be somebody someday.” Today, Joey defends the rights of Leitis in Tonga.  Watch her story.

The Coalition calls on all states, including Canada, to ban the sale or transfer of weapons to any government where there is risk that those weapons might be used in this conflict.
Since October 2018, the Canadian government has said that it would be difficult to suspend the contract selling the LAVs to Saudi Arabia.
As the humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate, almost two thirds of the Yemeni population require humanitarian aid.
Canada provides humanitarian assistance to Yemen and  at the same time, is helping arming one of the parties in the conflict. Other countries, including Denmark, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Greece and Austria, have either suspended or terminated arms transfers to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
The Coalition calls on the government to cancel the export permits in question. There may be financial penalties associated with the cancellation, but this cannot take priority over Canada contributing to war crimes in Yemen.
Canada must exercise its sovereign authority and suspend the transfer of LAVs to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Des ONG maintiennent que le Canada doit prendre une décision concernant la vente de véhicules blindés légers à l’Arabie saoudite 
Montréal, 5 mars 2019 – Une coalition d’organisations canadiennes de la société civile a écrit une lettre ouverte (insérer le lien menant vers la lettre) au premier ministre Justin Trudeau pour exprimer leurs inquiétudes par rapport aux exportations canadiennes de véhicules blindés légers (VBL) vers le Royaume d’Arabie saoudite.  
La coalition demande à tous les États, y compris au Canada, d’interdire la vente ou le transfert d’armes à tout gouvernement qui risquerait de les utiliser dans le conflit au Yémen. 
En octobre 2018, le gouvernement canadien avait déclaré qu’il serait difficile de suspendre le contrat de vente de VBL à l’Arabie saoudite.  
Actuellement, la crise au Yémen continue de se détériorer et près des deux tiers des Yéménites ont besoin d’aide humanitaire.  
Le Canada offre à la fois de l’aide humanitaire au Yémen et fournit des armes à une des parties impliquées dans le conflit. D’autres pays, dont le Danemark, la Finlande, l’Allemagne, la Suisse, la Grèce et l’Autriche, ont soit suspendu soit mis fin au transfert d’armes vers l’Arabie saoudite.  
La coalition demande au gouvernement de révoquer les permis en question. Les pénalités qui pourraient être imposées à la suite de cette annulation ne doivent pas empêcher le Canada de s’assurer qu’il ne contribue pas à des crimes de guerre au Yémen. 
Le Canada doit exercer son autorité souveraine et suspendre le transfert de VBL au Royaume d’Arabie saoudite.

Amade Abubacar was arrested on 5 January for documenting deadly attacks by armed groups against civilians in Cabo Delgado province, and is believed to be in a critical condition in detention. Amnesty International is calling for his immediate and unconditional release.
“Allegations that Amade Abubacar is being ill-treated and denied medical treatment must be investigated thoroughly and transparently and all those suspected of criminal responsibility brought to book. Amade is languishing in jail for simply doing his job as a journalist, exposing the suffering wrought on civilians by deadly attacks in Cabo Delgado,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“Mozambican authorities must either charge Amade with a recognizable criminal offence or release him immediately and unconditionally and allow him to continue to do his job without fear of reprisals. His continued detention is a mockery of media freedom in Mozambique.”
Amade is being held at the Mieze Correctional Centre in Pemba district, Cabo Delgado province. His prison cell is overcrowded, and he has been denied his right to receive family visits.
Possible torture and denial of medical treatment
Amnesty International has been reliably informed that Amade has been suffering from a range of health problems since the start of his detention, including constant headaches and diarrhea. Prior to his arrest, Amade was in good health but his condition has deteriorated rapidly while in detention. 
The organization is concerned that Amade could be in need of urgent medical attention and that he may not be receiving necessary and adequate medical treatment.
“We fear that Amade’s health is now in critical condition and his life may be at risk. His original detention was an affront to media freedom and now the authorities seem intent on compounding this shocking injustice by keeping him in detention,” said Deprose Muchena.
On 25 January representatives of the Mozambican Bar Association visited Amade alongside his lawyer at the prison. However, he was denied any private consultation with the representatives during this visit.  He spoke to representatives in front of prison authorities. He told representatives that he had been subjected to different forms of ill-treatment by the military, including physical aggression and forcing him to sleep handcuffed. He has also complained of being denied food. Amnesty International believes this amounts to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or even torture.
“Amade Abubacar is a prisoner of conscience who is being detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. He should not have spent a single night in detention and must be immediately and unconditionally released,” said Deprose Muchena.
Background
Amade Abubacar is a journalist at the Nacedje Communitary Radio in Cabo Delgado. He was arrested on 5 January while covering attacks on civilians by armed groups. The attacks have escalated since the beginning of October 2017, with more than 100 people killed and hundreds of others having fled their homes.
As part of a strategy to suppress media attention on the attacks, believed to be carried out by members of a local armed group known as “Al-Shabab”, Mozambican authorities have arbitrarily detained journalists reporting the story.

Denmark’s reputation for gender equality masks a society with one of Europe’s highest levels of rape, where flawed legislation and widespread harmful myths and gender stereotypes have resulted in endemic impunity for rapists, Amnesty International said in a report published today.
“Give us respect and justice!” Overcoming barriers to justice for women rape survivors in Denmark reveals that women and girls are being failed by dangerous and outdated laws and often do not report attacks through fear of not being believed, social stigma and a lack of trust in the justice system.
“Despite Denmark’s image as a land of gender equality, the reality for women is starkly different, with shockingly high levels of impunity for sexual violence and antiquated rape laws which fail to meet international standards,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“The simple truth is that sex without consent is rape. Failure to recognise this in law leaves women exposed to sexual violence and fuels a dangerous culture of victim blaming and impunity reinforced by myths and stereotypes which pervade Danish society: from playground to locker room, police station to witness stand.”
Despite recent steps by the government to improved access to justice for survivors, rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the women who experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017 (estimates vary from 5,100 according to the Ministry of Justice to 24,000 according to a recent study), just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions.
Deeply entrenched biases within the justice system are among the reasons for the low conviction rates. Lack of trust in the system together with fear of not being believed and self-blame are all factors that result in under-reporting.
Harrowing experience
The research, based on interviews with 18 women and girls over the age of 15 who have experienced rape, as well as NGOs, other experts and relevant authorities, found that survivors often find the reporting process and its aftermath immensely traumatizing.
Many are met with dismissive attitudes, victim blaming, and prejudice. Survivors told Amnesty International that the fear of not being believed or even being blamed and shamed by police and justice officials were among the primary reasons for not reporting rape.  
Kirstine, a 39-year-old journalist, tried four times to file a report of rape with the police. On her second attempt she was taken to a police cell and warned that she could go to prison if she was lying. She described how the reporting process meant “enduring new fear, shame and humiliation” and told Amnesty International: “If I was 20 years old, I wouldn’t have proceeded after the first attempt.”
Another woman told Amnesty International how intimidated she felt going to the police: “I was just one 21-year-old woman, sitting there with two guys looking at me, saying, ‘are you sure you want to report this?’…I was just a young girl ‘claiming’ to have been raped.”
While there are National Police Guidelines on handling rape cases, current police practice remains inconsistent and often falls short of both these guidelines and of international standards.
The women and girls who do report rape face lengthy journeys through the courts and the experience can be harrowing and deeply unsatisfactory.
Emilie told Amnesty International she definitely would not go to the police if she was raped again. “When they really push me in court, it is almost like experiencing it all over again, and then you end up feeling worse about yourself, feeling like ‘it’s my fault, it was me who did something wrong.’”
Definition of rape based on violence
Under the Istanbul Convention, ratified by Denmark in 2014, rape and all other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature must be classified as criminal offences. However, Danish law still does not define rape on the basis of lack of consent. Instead, it uses a definition based on whether physical violence, threat or coercion is involved or if the victim is found to have been unable to resist.
The assumption in law or in practice that a victim gives her consent because she has not physically resisted is deeply problematic since “involuntary paralysis” or “freezing” has been recognized by experts as a very common physiological and psychological response to sexual assault.
This focus on resistance and violence rather than on consent has an impact not only on the reporting of rape but also on wider awareness of sexual violence, both of which are key aspects in preventing rape and tackling impunity.
Change in legislation needed
The Danish government has recently established an expert group to recommend initiatives that can help rape victims to receive adequate support and professional treatment when they navigate the system. While Amnesty International welcomes these initiatives, the government needs to take much bolder steps and change the legislation to be based on consent.
Although amending current rape laws would be a vital step towards changing attitudes and achieving justice, much more is needed to effect institutional and social change. The authorities must take lawful steps to ensure that rape myths and gender stereotypes are challenged at all levels of society and that professionals working with rape survivors receive adequate continuous training. In addition, broader sexuality education and awareness-raising programmes are needed from a young age.
“By amending its antiquated laws and ending the insidious culture of victim blaming and negative stereotyping that currently exists in legal proceedings, Denmark has an opportunity to join the tide of change that is sweeping Europe. This tide, led by courageous women, has led to eight countries in Europe adopting consent-based rape definitions,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“This tide of change in Denmark and other parts of Europe can help ensure that women are better protected from rape and will mean that future generations of women and girls will never have to question whether rape is their fault or doubt that the perpetrators will be punished.”

Background
Amnesty has analysed rape legislation in 31 countries in Europe and found that only 8 out of 31 countries have consent-based legislation in place. These are Sweden, the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany, Cyprus, Iceland and Belgium.
In the other European countries, for the crime to be considered rape, the law requires for example the use of force or threats, but this is not what happens in a great majority of rape cases.
As activists, including Amnesty, continue to raise their voices for ‘Yes’, Denmark is poised to follow suit and authorities in countries such as Finland, Greece, Spain, Portugal and Slovenia are also considering such changes.
Amnesty will continue to monitor the situation across Europe and campaign for consent-based legislation and challenging rape myths throughout the region. In April 2019, 11 years after its Case Closed report, Amnesty will also publish a regional report on access to justice for rape in four Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden).

“The suspension of Prime TV is a ploy to muzzle independent voices in Zambia and to undermine the right to freedom of expression and media freedom. It is clearly intended to send a chilling message that journalists need to self-censor or face dire consequences. 
“This unlawful suspension must be immediately lifted to allow Prime TV to continue telling the Zambian story as it unfolds. Zambia can only benefit from the plurality of media voices.”
Background 
The Independent Broadcasting Authority informed Prime TV of its suspension for 30 days earlier today, citing failure to comply with the conditions of its broadcasting license by the station.
Media freedom has been under attack in Zambia in recent years. In 2016, authorities sanctioned the closure of the The Post newspaper, one of the country’s longest serving independent newspapers. Its owner, Fred M’embe, and news editor, Joseph Mwenda, had been previously brutalized by the police for the newspaper’s critical reporting.

“Mahmoud Abou Zeid’s long overdue release brings to an end a painful ordeal for him and his family. As a prisoner of conscience, he should never have been forced to spend a single minute behind bars – let alone five and a half years.
“After his release, he faces ludicrous probation measures which require him to spend 12 hours of each day at a police station from 6pm to 6am for the next five years. These outrageous measures will severely restrict his liberty and should be lifted immediately.
“Mahmoud Abou Zeid was arrested and imprisoned solely for doing his job as a journalist. His conviction, more than five years later, on trumped-up charges during a grossly unfair mass trial alongside more than 700 other defendants was a mockery of justice.
“Mahmoud Abou Zeid has been the victim of an appalling injustice and the authorities must offer full reparation for this outrageous violation of his human rights.”
Background
Mahmoud Abou Zeid was arrested at the Rabaa al-Adawiya sit-in in Cairo on 14 August 2013 while on assignment for the London-based photo agency Demotix. He was arrested along with two foreign journalists who were released the same day.
He was charged with 24 offences, including murder. During his trial, the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that Mahmoud Abou Zeid was responsible for the offences with which he was charged.
He was convicted in September 2018 in a mass trial of more than 700 people, including senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, and was sentenced to five years in prison, which he had already served in pre-trial detention, plus a fine followed by five years of probation. A six-month prison term was added to his sentence because he could not afford to pay the fine.

This call follows Amnesty’s own investigation of the blaze’s aftermath, which revealed signs of an elaborate attack that may amount to an assassination attempt.
“It has now been weeks since this terrifying fire, and authorities do not seem to be handling the case with any seriousness or urgency. Despite the many threats Murdani has received over the years in relation to his work, and even days before the blaze, the police have publicly mooted theories to cast a respected environmental activist in a negative light,” Amnesty International Indonesia’s Executive Director Usman Hamid said.
A fire engulfed the house in Menemeng village in Lombok, NTB, in the early hours of January 28, while Murdani, his wife, their four-year-old daughter and 17-year-old son were asleep.
On January 30, Amnesty International visited the house, interviewed Murdani and his family members as well as witnesses and local police to collect evidence on the incident.
“Several fires were started outside the house, ostensibly blocking out potential escape routes,” said Usman Hamid. “The only water source in the compound was also blocked.”
Neighbors who intervened to put out the fire found that the water sewage dyke located in Murdani’s back yard was dried out. They told Amnesty that this was very unusual, as water flows through the dyke every day, and that they found a deliberate blockage about 400 meters down from Murdani’s house.
“We call on the police to thoroughly investigate the case and bring perpetrators to justice. It is also imperative for the police to provide effective protection to Murdani and his family members after the attack,” Usman said.
A systematic arson attack
Amnesty’s investigation found that fires were started in four different spots in the compound. The largest fire started from Murdani’s minivan, parked adjacent to the house. The assailants set fire to the vehicle by burning a pillow and a t-shirt underneath it with gasoline. This fire was the most elaborate of the four, and burned half the house down.
As the fire engulfed the house, Murdani took the daughter in his arms and jumped down from the first floor to make an escape as the staircase was ablaze. His wife and son screamed loudly from the window on the second floor, calling out to neighbors for help.
Murdani tried to exit the building through the living room door but found the assailants had also set fire to it. Not giving up, Murdani tried to escape through the kitchen but found that exit was also engulfed in a separate blaze. He managed to escape through the main door, which is made of iron and located facing the main street.
Attack on a human rights defender
Murdani has been advocating a number of environmental and humanitarian issues in the tourism and natural resources-rich province including waste management, illegal logging and sand mining, as well as natural disaster relief.
In the past years, he has been very vocal to help farmers to reject attempts by local businessmen to eye 200-hectare land for sand mining.
In 2016 Murdani received a death threat through an SMS from an unidentified sender, saying that he had been a ‘disturber’ for challenging illegal sand mining activity.
The SMS message read: “if you still want to live, you must stop interfering with the sand mining business.”
Murdani had reported the 2016 death threat to the police but they did not take any action. Since the death threat, Murdani’s house was stoned by unidentified people, including days before the arson attacks.
Police responses and failures to identify perpetrators
Murdani told Amnesty International that his wife and  17-year-old son were still traumatized after the arson.
“If the police do not find the perpetrators, the community and everyone who campaigned against mining  will feel threatened. They could experience the same thing that I did. So, it is important for the police to find the assailants and bring them to justice,” Murdani said.
On January 30, Central Lombok police investigation head stated to the Lombok Post that the police were investigating whether Murdani had burned his own house down. In an interview with Amnesty International, the Central Lombok police chief subsequently denied all statements published by the paper.
“The police investigation must give adequate consideration to whether the attack was related to his work as human rights defender,” Usman Hamid said.
On 13 February, the Central Lombok police hold a meeting with Murdani and his team of lawyers. They said that they had questioned around 30 witnesses in the case. The police cited three possible motives for the attacks: his campaign against sand mining, alleged debts, and his rivalry with other candidates during the previous village head elections.
Perpetrators of attacks against human rights defenders are rarely brought to justice. Other unresolved cases include the acid attack against Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) investigator Novel Baswedan in April 2017, the arson attacks on the houses of KPK chairman and deputy chairman, Agus Rahardjo and Laode Muhammad Syarif in January 2018 , as well as against Indonesia Corruption Watch (ICW) activist Tama Satya Langkun in 2010.
“Human rights defenders working to protect the environment and opposing corruption are too often the target of attacks in Indonesia. It is imperative that the authorities provide them with a safe and enabling environment to carry out their work. This includes ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice,” Usman said.

The organization has previously...","A resolution on prisoner transfers adopted today by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) must be followed by concrete steps to ensure that human rights of prisoners are respected while they are in transit, Amnesty International said today. The organization has previously documented the appalling conditions in which prisoners in Russia are transferred, and called on the Russian authorities to implement the PACE recommendations immediately.
“Prisoner transfers are often deliberately hidden from the public gaze, meaning people are subjected to appalling abuses without scrutiny. In Russia, where prisoners are often sent to remote locations to serve their sentences, people spend weeks or even months in cramped, windowless trains with no access to the outside world. While their families wonder where they are, prisoners suffer the miseries of infrequent toilet access, scant drinking water and severe overcrowding,” said Heather McGill, Researcher in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regional Office of Amnesty International.  
“The resolution by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is a welcome move which shines a light on the need to protect prisoners from these kinds of abuses, in Russia and elsewhere. We are calling for states to implement these recommendations and ensure that the rights of prisoners are respected at every stage of their imprisonment.”
The PACE recommends the states to revise the European Prison Rules to include specific guarantees relating to transportation. In particular, it recommends that states must ensure essential safeguards against torture such as access to doctors and lawyers. They must ensure that prisoners are not transported in overcrowded conditions, that transfers are limited in time and take the shortest possible routes, and that communication with the outside world is only restricted in exceptional circumstances. Moreover, the resolution urges states to allow prisoners to inform their families and lawyer immediately of their transfer to another institution. 
In a 2017 report, Prisoner Transportation in Russia: Travelling into the Unknown, Amnesty International documented serious human rights violations during prisoner transfers in Russia. The case of Victor Filinkov and Yuliy Boyarshinov, two youth activists arrested on terrorism related charges and believed to have been tortured to extract confessions, serves as a recent example of the ongoing problem. Arrested in Saint Petersburg in January and April 2018 respectively, on 20 July Filinkov and Boyarshinov were transported to an undisclosed location. Their whereabouts were unknown for more than two months, before it was revealed that they had been transported from Saint Petersburg to Penza – via a circuitous route measuring far more than the 1200 km that separates the two cities.
“We are calling on the Russian authorities to ensure that prisoners serve their sentences in the same region as their home, as required by national legislation. They should also shorten journey times to a minimum not exceeding a few days at most and improve conditions on trains,” said Heather McGill.
“It’s also essential that families or legal representatives are informed about plans to move a prisoner, and their intended destination, before they are moved. Prisoner transportation has been a blind spot for too long.” 
Background
Russia’s detention centres, partly an inheritance from the GULAG era, are located in sparsely populated parts of the country such as the far north and the far east, and there is a longstanding practice of sending prisoners to serve their sentences in these remote locations. Women and juveniles in particular serve their sentences very far from home because of the small number of dedicated detention centres. During transit, prisoners are not allowed to communicate with relatives or lawyers for weeks or even months, which may result in enforced disappearance, and suffer appalling conditions of detention violating the prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment. Moreover, the fact that the prisoners serve their sentences thousands of kilometres from home violates their rights to private and family life.

Since...","Algerian security forces must refrain from using excessive or unnecessary force to disperse peaceful demonstrations against President Abdelaziz Bouteflika’s bid for a fifth term in office, said Amnesty International, ahead of a fresh wave of protests planned tomorrow all over the country.
Since 22 February, a series of largely peaceful demonstrations have taken place across the country including protests by lawyers, students and journalists opposing a fifth mandate for President Bouteflika, who has been in power for nearly 20 years, in the upcoming presidential elections on 18 April.
“As tensions rise amid growing protests, we are appealing to the Algerian authorities to exercise restraint, respect the rights of demonstrators and not to use excessive or unnecessary force to quell peaceful protests,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International. 
“The world’s eyes are on Algeria right now and how the government chooses to respond to these demonstrations will be a crucial test of its commitment to upholding the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
“Security forces must only use force as a last resort and even then, it should only be used proportionately and when absolutely necessary.”
The vast majority of protests have been peaceful, but some protesters responded by throwing stones after law enforcement officers used tear gas.   
Algeria’s authorities have allowed the demonstrations to take place despite a blanket ban on protests in the capital Algiers since 2001.
However, at least 41 protesters have been arrested since the demonstrations began last Friday, according to official figures. Most were arbitrarily detained for a few hours before being released. In addition, today, at least four journalists were detained while participating in and covering a protest calling for freedom of the press; they too were subsequently released.
“Targeting protesters with arbitrary arrest or prosecutions would be a flagrant violation of the right to freedom of expression and assembly. Algerian authorities must ensure their actions do not violate the country’s own constitution or its international obligations,” said Magdalena Mughrabi. 
“They must also guarantee the right to freedom of movement for protesters and ensure journalists are able to report freely on the demonstrations with no censorship of media coverage.”

The organization has highlighted its serious concern over the draft “Law on Information Technology Crimes” in an open letter signed by nine other NGOs. The letter was submitted to the Iraqi authorities this morning and warns that the proposed law would “establish a climate of self-censorship in the country.”
“If passed, this draconian cybercrime law will be a devastating blow for freedom of expression in Iraq. The vague and overly broad wording of the law means it could easily become a tool for repression in a country where the space for critical voices is already severely restricted,” said Razaw Salihy, Iraq researcher at Amnesty International.
The proposed law would criminalize acts that fall under freedom of expression and give Iraqi authorities excessive powers to impose harsh sentences, including life imprisonment, for vaguely worded offences such as undermining the country’s “independence, peace and political, military security and economic interests”.
Background:
During protests in southern Iraq and Baghdad in September 2018 to demand access to jobs, basic services and medical care the Iraqi security forces shot, beat and detained protesters. Iraqi authorities severely restricted access to the internet, including social media sites. Peaceful protesters who were fired on by security forces, believe the authorities deliberately disabled internet access as they were unable to share images and videos depicting the abuses.

This plan forces asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico while their claims are reviewed. It is being implemented alongside ongoing large-scale illegal pushbacks at the border.
Charanya Krishnaswami, advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA, issued this statement:
“The Trump administration is not only abandoning people in their most desperate hour, it is actively putting them in harm’s way. Forcing people seeking protection in the United States to stay in Mexico while their claims are processed is irresponsible, cruel, and a stark violation of international law.
“By pushing people back to Mexico, the United States is putting asylum-seekers at risk of exploitation, sexual assault, murder, and even the possibility of being disappeared. If authorities expand this plan, people seeking protection will face the impossible choice of taking any risks necessary to seek safety or returning back home to danger.
“The administration must immediately stop playing with people’s lives and put an end to this heartless plan.”
For years, Amnesty International has documented the dangers faced by people seeking protection while traveling through Mexico. As recently as fall 2018, researchers observed Mexican immigration officials forcibly returning people seeking protection back to their home countries, in violation of international law.

This is as many as were executed in the whole of 2018 and represents a shocking spike in the use of the death penalty in the country, Amnesty International said today.
“This confirms our fears that South Sudan authorities have absolutely no respect for the right to life as they continue to totally disregard the fact that the world is moving away from use of the death penalty,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
In December 2018, Amnesty International raised the alarm that the eastern African country had in that year executed more people than in any other year since its independence in 2011.
The executions in 2018 followed the transfer of at least 135 death row prisoners from county and state prisons to Wau Central Prison and Juba Central Prison, which are equipped with gallows to carry out executions.
Six of this year’s victims were executed in Juba Central Prison, while at least one was executed in Wau Central Prison. All the victims were men. The country executes people by hanging.
“We are shocked and dismayed that executions have become the order of the day in South Sudan. Rather than execute people, the authorities should rehabilitate prisoners and make them well-adjusted individuals that can contribute positively to society,” said Seif Magango.
Amnesty International has established that at least three of the executions undertaken in February 2019 were shrouded in secrecy; the family of the three related men was not informed of their impending execution and only learnt of the death of their loved ones after they had been executed.
“These reports are extremely concerning, and we cannot even begin to imagine how the families must be feeling. South Sudan must immediately commute all death sentences to terms of imprisonment, establish an official moratorium on executions and take steps, without delay, to abolish the death penalty,” said Seif Magango.
Amnesty International established that at least four of the seven executed men had been convicted of murder. The country’s Penal Code also allows for the use of the death penalty for bearing false witness resulting in an innocent person’s execution, terrorism (or banditry, insurgency or sabotage) resulting in death, aggravated drug trafficking and treason.
Background
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to execute the prisoner.
The death penalty – the premeditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the state in the name of justice – is the most fundamental denial of human rights. It violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

Tunisian authorities have launched an appeal to overturn a 2016 court ruling which concluded Shams was not in breach of the law, following previous attempts to shut the organization down. The authorities appealed the decision on the grounds that Shams’ stated goals contradict Tunisia’s religious principles and culture.
“The Tunisian authorities’ shameful attempts to dissolve the organization Shams are a devastating blow to LGBTI rights in Tunisia and a despicable assault on the right to association and freedom of expression. These efforts expose the Tunisian government’s deeply entrenched discriminatory and homophobic attitudes, which blatantly contradict international human rights standards,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“Tunisia has been celebrated for being one of the only countries in the region that fosters an open space for civil society. But such judicial harassment casts serious doubt on Tunisia’s commitment to upholding the right to freedom of association.”
Shams, founded in 2015, has been advocating for the repeal of Article 230 of Tunisia’s penal code, which criminalizes same-sex sexual relations. The organization has also condemned prosecutions of gay people involving forced anal examinations, campaigned against discrimination, and provides support to LGBTI people in Tunisia.
In January 2016, the government’s secretary general filed a complaint against Shams on the grounds that its objectives violate Tunisia’s Law on Associations, leading to the suspension of the organization’s activities for 30 days. In February 2016, the Tunis Court of First Instance issued a ruling that Shams was not in breach of the law and lifted the suspension.
Three years later, in January 2019, the Tunisian government appealed the court ruling through a petition from the head of state litigation which states that “the concept of sexual minorities that Shams adopts is illegal and contrary to our religious dictates and our society’s Arabic and Islamic culture.” Shams received the appeal on 20 February 2019.
The appeal petition also accuses Shams of violating a governmental decree by opening a branch in the town of Sousse without following the proper legal procedures.
“Tunisia’s authorities should be protecting organizations that fight all kinds of discrimination and defend the rights of minorities including LGBTI people, not trying to crush them out of existence,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“Instead of resorting to judicial harassment to silence Shams, Tunisia’s authorities should be working to urgently revise discriminatory laws to bring them in line with international human rights standards. They must start by repealing Article 230 and decriminalizing same-sex sexual relations.”
Article 230 violates Tunisia’s own constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of association and equality between all citizens, as well as breaching the country’s international human rights obligations. The impact of this law also creates a permissive atmosphere for hate crimes against people suspected of engaging in same-sex relations.
Despite the fact that a draft law to decriminalize same-sex relations was submitted to Tunisia’s parliament last year, LGBTI people continue to come under attack.
During 2018, at least 115 people were arrested in relation to their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity, according to Damj, a Tunisian NGO working on LGBTI rights. At least 38 people were later charged and convicted under Article 230. Arresting and detaining someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity is a violation of their human rights.
The police also continue to subject men accused of same-sex relations to forced anal examinations, in violation of the prohibition against torture under international law. Trans people continue to face harassment from the police and live in constant fear of being arrested under vague laws relating to public decency.

The women, who are aged 18 and 20 and are known as Reem and Rawan, fled Saudi Arabia after suffering repeated beatings by male family members and being treated “like slaves”. They arrived in Hong Kong last September when trying to reach Australia. They were blocked from continuing their journey by Saudi consular agents at Hong Kong International Airport. The sisters subsequently learned that their passports had been revoked, making it impossible for them to extend their visas to remain in Hong Kong.
The sisters have been allowed to stay in Hong Kong as “tolerated” overstayers. That period of toleration is set to expire on 28 February. Hong Kong authorities could extend the period of toleration, which would allow the women to explore third country resettlement options.
“Reem and Rawan must not be sent back to Saudi Arabia – this would place them in grave danger. They fled the Kingdom after repeated abuse by male relatives and they are at real risk of serious human rights violations if they are forcibly returned,” said Kate Schuetze, Amnesty International’s Refugee Researcher.
“The Hong Kong authorities have a duty to allow Reem and Rawan to stay in Hong Kong or let them travel to a country where they would be safe and can seek asylum. The women’s lives are at risk if the Hong Kong authorities do not fulfil their responsibilities.”
The sisters would likely face criminal charges for leaving their homes without the permission of their male guardian under repressive male guardianship laws, for escaping the country and for renouncing Islam. In Saudi Arabia, “apostasy” is a serious crime that carries the death penalty. The two women also fear physical violence and retribution from male members of their family.

In an open letter published today, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, urges President Sirisena to fulfil Sri Lanka’s international commitments, respect the right to life, and shun executions that have been proven to have a unique  deterrent effect on crime.
“Executions, Mr. President, are not a show of strength but an admission of weakness,” Kumi Naidoo writes in the open letter. “They represent the failure to create a society where the protection of the right to life triumphs over the temptations of vengeance.”
“For those of us who believe that human life must hold the highest value, taking it away is the lowliest act. We understand this clearly when a person commits murder, but we choose to forget it when the state puts someone to death, inflicting the same pain and loss on others who bear no responsibility for the crime.”
Extensive criminological studies have demonstrated that the death penalty has no unique deterrent effect. The similar-sized cities of Hong Kong and Singapore have taken different paths. Hong Kong abolished the death penalty more than half a century ago, while Singapore retains it. The murder rate in both cities, however, has remained remarkably similar.
Even in countries that retain the death penalty, Kumi Naidoo points out in his letter, “there is a growing recognition that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent for drug-related crimes.”
The Islamic Republic of Iran has been one of the world’s most prolific executioners, putting thousands of people to death. In recognition of this fact, Iran has now amended its drug laws, resulting in a significant decrease in executions of people convicted of drug-related offences.
Kumi Naidoo also warned Sri Lanka against pursuing the path of the Philippines, which President Sirisena recently visited and has applauded as an example to follow.
“Under President Rodrigo Duterte,” Amnesty International’s Secretary General writes, there has been “a horrific wave of extrajudicial executions of suspected drug offenders over the past three years.”
“Far from ridding the streets of crime, this murderous campaign has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people – including dozens of children – in what may amount to crimes against humanity.”
The killings in the Philippines, which have overwhelmingly targeted people living in impoverished neighbourhoods, are currently the subject of a preliminary examination by the Office of the Prosecutor at the International Criminal Court.
In the open letter, Amnesty International urges the President Sirisena to: 
Immediately halt plans to execute at least 13 people, and review all cases of people under sentence of death with a view to commuting their sentences to terms of imprisonment 
Establish an official moratorium on executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty, in line with seven resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly since 2007, including most recently resolution 73/175 of 17 December 2018 which Sri Lanka supported

Responding to the UNAMA`s report, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner Samira Hamidi said:
“The UNAMA report on civilian casualties in Afghanistan is deeply alarming. It reports 10,993 civilian casualties, including 3,804 civilian deaths and 7,189 injuries. The shocking number of dead and injured civilians in Afghanistan once again demonstrates the need for victims to access justice and reparations, and the need to create an environment of accountability.”
The increase in civilian casualties have been attributed to attacks perpetrated by Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) such as the Taliban, Daesh/Islamic State Khorosan Province (ISKP) along with pro government forces as well. According to the report, “2018 witnessed the highest number of civilian casualties ever recorded from suicide attacks and aerial operations.” 
“Women and children continue to bear the brunt, suffering the worst of the violence. 927 children were killed in 2018 which is the highest number recorded and is extremely disturbing,” said Samira.
“The authorities in Afghanistan must ensure respect for the rights of the victims of these attacks during any peace negotiations, which must include their participation and consultation in the process. All parties to the conflict must immediately end attacks directed at civilians and must prioritise steps to prevent harming civilian and civilian objects during combat.”

International arms trade and lucrative business deals fuel cycle of abuse 
Lack of accountability drives widespread repression and civilian suffering  
Small advances on women’s rights and efforts to tackle past abuses due to civil society campaigns 
The international community’s chilling complacency towards wide-scale human rights violations in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has emboldened governments to commit appalling violations during 2018 by giving them the sense that they need never fear facing justice, said Amnesty International as it published a review of human rights in the region last year.
The report Human rights in the Middle East and North Africa: A review of 2018 describes how authorities across the region have unashamedly persisted with ruthless campaigns of repression in order to crush dissent, cracking down on protesters, civil society and political opponents, often with tacit support from powerful allies.
Jamal Khashoggi’s shocking killing in October 2018 sparked an unprecedented global outcry, spurring a Saudi Arabian investigation and even prompting rare action from states such as Denmark and Finland to suspend the supply of arms to Saudi Arabia. However, key allies of the Kingdom, including the USA, UK and France, have taken no such action and, as a whole, the international community has failed to meet demands by human rights organizations for an independent UN investigation capable of delivering justice.
“It took Jamal Khashoggi’s cold-blooded murder inside a consulate to prompt a handful of more responsible states to suspend arms transfers to a country that has been leading a coalition responsible for war crimes and has helped create a humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen. Yet even the global outcry over the Khashoggi case has not been followed by concrete action to ensure those responsible for his murder are brought to justice,” said Heba Morayef, Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“Across MENA throughout 2018 thousands of dissidents and peaceful critics have been victims of shameless government violations on a shocking scale, amid deafening silence from the international community.”
Amnesty International’s report reveals that the crackdown on dissent and civil society intensified significantly in Egypt, Iran and Saudi Arabia during 2018. These three states are emblematic of the inadequacy of the international response to rampant government violations.
In Iran, a wave of mass protests was violently suppressed, with thousands arrested and detained throughout the year. However, the response from the European Union, which has an ongoing human rights dialogue with the country, was muted.
During 2018 Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway announced suspensions of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In contrast, the USA, UK and France are among states that have continued to export weapons that have enabled the Saudi Arabia-led coalition to target civilians, schools and hospitals during the conflict in Yemen in violation of international law. On a domestic level, Saudi Arabia continued its clampdown on civil society activists and women human rights defenders were detained and tortured in custody.
States including France and the USA have also continued to supply Egypt with weapons used for internal repression amid a widespread crackdown on human rights. Today Egypt has become a more dangerous place for peaceful critics than at any other time in the country’s recent history.
The USA has also committed to provide Israel with US$38 billion in military aid over the next 10 years despite the impunity that Israeli forces enjoy and the vast number of human rights violations they continue to commit in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces killed at least 180 Palestinians last year, including 35 children, during protests for the right to return of refugees, according to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights. While a UN Human Rights Council commission of inquiry was set up to look into the killings, Israel has refused to co-operate with the inquiry and has faced little to no pressure to do so.
“Time and again allies of governments in the region have put lucrative business deals, security co-operation or billions of dollars’ worth of arms sales before human rights, fuelling abuses and creating a climate where MENA governments feel ‘untouchable’ and above the law,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“It’s time the world followed in the footsteps of states such as Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway, which have announced suspensions of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, sending a clear message that flouting human rights has clear consequences.”
Amnesty International is calling on all states to immediately suspend the sale or transfer of arms to all the parties to the conflict in Yemen, on the one hand, and to Israel, on the other, until there is no longer a substantial risk that such equipment could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international human rights or humanitarian law. The organization is also urging all states to give greater support to international mechanisms aimed at securing justice for victims, such as the UN inquiries into the Gaza killings, and into violations in Yemen and Syria, as well the International Criminal Court.
Unbridled repression of dissent
The vacuum of accountability throughout the region has meant that authorities in MENA have had free rein to imprison peaceful critics, restrict the activities of civil society or use arbitrary arrest, detention and excessive use of force against protesters demanding their rights.
In Iran, 2018 was designated by Amnesty International as a “year of shame”, during which the authorities arrested more than 7,000 protesters, students, journalists, environmental activists, workers and human rights defenders, many arbitrarily. Women’s rights defenders protesting against the discriminatory and abusive practice of forced hijab (veiling) were among those who paid a heavy price for their peaceful activism.
In Saudi Arabia, authorities arrested and prosecuted government critics, academics and human rights defenders. In a wave of arrests in May 2018 at least eight women human rights defenders who had campaigned against the ban on women drivers and the guardianship system were detained without charge. Virtually all human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia are now behind bars or have been forced to flee the country.
In Egypt, authorities intensified their crackdown on dissent in the run-up to the presidential elections. They arrested at least 113 people solely for peacefully expressing critical opinions; and enacted new laws to further silence independent media. Two women were arrested for speaking out against sexual harassment on Facebook. One of them, Amal Fathy, had a two-year prison sentence against her upheld.
In Iraq security forces shot beat and arrested protesters. In Morocco dozens were sentenced to lengthy prison sentences for participating in protests.
In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain prominent activists Ahmed Mansoor and Nabeel Rajab were punished with heavy prison terms of 10 and five years respectively for their social media posts.
In Algeria activists and bloggers came under fire for comments critical of the government posted on Facebook.
Jordanian, Lebanese and Palestinian authorities also arbitrarily detained activists and others for voicing criticism of the authorities or peacefully taking part in demonstrations.
“Across MENA with virtually no exceptions governments have displayed a shocking intolerance for the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” said Heba Morayef.
“Protesters who took to the streets to defy oppression and peaceful critics who dared to speak out have paid a heavy price. Some are facing years behind bars simply for expressing their opinions as governments impose ludicrously harsh sentences to intimidate activists into silence.”
Civilian suffering in armed conflict
The international community’s continued supply of arms to MENA governments and their repeated failure to push for accountability for war crimes and other violations of international law has had devastating and far-reaching consequences.
In Libya, Syria and Yemen, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law continued to be committed in 2018. Even as armed hostilities decreased in Iraq and Syria the levels of civilian suffering remained high.
Israel’s military occupation continued to inflict suffering on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Its policies of expanding illegal settlements and its relentless blockade on Gaza are grave violations of international law.
In Syria, government forces continued to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, while Russia and China have helped obstruct accountability for these crimes.
Amnesty International’s research has also revealed how hundreds of civilians were killed and thousands injured by the US-led coalition forces during its Raqqa offensive to oust the Islamic State armed group, including in attacks that violated international humanitarian law. In both Syria and Iraq coalition forces have been slow to acknowledge and explain civilian deaths caused during their operations.
In Yemen, while some European countries have suspended arms transfers to coalition members Saudi Arabia and the UAE, other countries, including the USA, UK and France, have continued to supply billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment, some of which have been used to commit violations of international humanitarian law during the conflict.
In Libya, the international community’s failure to push for effective accountability mechanisms in forums such as the UN Human Rights Council has emboldened parties to the conflict to continue to commit abuses with complete disregard for international law.
“For too long the lack of international pressure to ensure that warring parties committing war crimes and other violations of international law are held to account has allowed perpetrators of atrocities across MENA to escape unpunished. Accountability is essential – not only to secure justice for victims of these crimes, but to help prevent an endless cycle of violations and yet more victims,” said Philip Luther.
Glimmers of hope for human rights
Amidst the widespread repression and violations that marked 2018, there were some limited improvements for the rights of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people.
Across the Maghreb laws including provisions to combat violence against women came into effect and the State of Palestine repealed a provision that allowed suspected rapists to escape prosecution by marrying their victim, following in the footsteps of a number of other MENA states.
In Saudi Arabia authorities finally lifted a ban on women drivers – even as they imprisoned women human rights defenders who had campaigned for this very right.
While same-sex sexual relations remain criminalized across the region, there were two small victories for LGBTI rights in countries where there has been strong civil society mobilization on the issue: in Tunisia, where a draft law was submitted to parliament decriminalizing same-sex sexual relations, and in Lebanon, where a court ruled same-sex consensual sex was not a criminal offence.
In a region dominated by entrenched impunity these two countries also took steps towards accountability for past violations. In Lebanon, parliament passed a law creating a commission to investigate thousands of enforced disappearances during the civil war after years of campaigning by Lebanese civil society. In Tunisia, the Truth and Dignity Commission overcame repeated attempts by the authorities to hamper its work.
“Against a backdrop of overwhelming repression some governments have taken small steps forward. These improvements are a tribute to courageous human rights defenders across MENA and serve as a reminder to those who regularly risk their freedom to stand up against tyranny and speak truth to power that they are planting true seeds of change for the years to come,” said Heba Morayef.

The Sudanese authorities must end measures taken under the state of emergency to violently crush dissent amid ongoing nationwide protests in the country, Amnesty International said.
Following the declaration of a state of emergency on Friday, the government has deployed large numbers of security forces – including the army – to target protesters.
Thousands of Sudanese people are again protesting today in various parts of the country. Security officers today invaded the Ahfad University for Women in Omdurman dispersing students with teargas and beatings.
“The state of emergency is being used by the Sudanese authorities as a justification to flagrantly increase the use of live ammunition and tear gas against protesters, and to torture detainees without any restraint,” said Joan Nyanyuki Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The Government of Sudan must immediately stop using these extreme measures under the state of emergency to intimidate the Sudanese people and prevent them from exercising their freedom of expression. The people have a right to peacefully protest the social, political and economic conditions in the country.”
On Sunday, security forces fired live ammunition and teargas at protesters in Khartoum state, injuring at least three people. Another group of officers forced their way into the University of Medical Sciences and Technology (UMST) campus in Khartoum where students were peacefully protesting. They fired tear gas into classrooms, beat up students and arrested dozens of them.
In Khartoum’s Burri and Omdurman’s Alabasyia districts, large numbers of security officers drawn from the Sudan Armed Forces, the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) and the police force were deployed. These officers forced their way into people’s homes in Burri on Sunday, firing tear gas, beating up people and confiscating mobile phones.
On Saturday, the security forces broke into a medical doctors’ residence near the Khartoum Teaching Hospital, beat up doctors and arrested more than 40 of them on accusations that they were organizing the protests.
“This brutal crackdown on the Sudanese people immediately following the announcement of the state of emergency is disturbing,” warned Joan Nyanyuki.

Hajar Harb, a Palestinian journalist from Gaza, released an investigative report on al-Araby TV  on 25 June 2016 highlighting that the ministry, which is run by the Hamas de-facto administration, was profiting by arranging illegal medical transfers out of the Gaza Strip for people who did not need treatment. She has been charged with a series of offences including defamation and the publication of false news.
“The prosecution of Hajar Harb is an outrageous assault on media freedom. The authorities in Gaza are blatantly seeking to punish her for exposing corruption within the Hamas administration. The authorities must drop all the charges against her immediately,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“It is deeply alarming that Hajar Harb is facing six months in jail simply for doing her job. If her conviction on trumped up charges is upheld it would have a chilling effect on freedom of expression in Gaza.”
After the report was broadcast, Hajar Harb was summoned for police interrogation at least four times during June and July 2016. Each interrogation session lasted between three and four hours. During these sessions she described to Amnesty International how she was verbally abused and “treated as a criminal not a journalist that made an investigative report that is very important to this country.”
She also told Amnesty International that she was verbally harassed and received threats from a number of doctors in Gaza, even though none of their names, faces or job titles were featured in the report.
“I was cursed with bad words, threatened with physical harm and even accused of being a collaborator with Israel by spreading rumours on Facebook by some doctors in Gaza,” she told Amnesty International.
Two doctors filed a complaint against her and in October 2016 she was charged with the publication of false news, defamation, causing strife, and being an imposter.
Hajar Harb was tried in her absence, while she was in Jordan receiving treatment for breast cancer. On 4 June 2017 she was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 1,000 ILS (276 USD). She appealed against the court’s decision.
“I sometimes question myself and say, what have I done? I’m paying the price of doing an investigative piece about corruption in Gaza. How is this fair?’’ Hajar Harb told Amnesty International, explaining that she has had problems with other employers since the report was published.
As political in-fighting between Fatah and Hamas continues, authorities in the West Bank and Gaza have used threats and intimidation against activists and journalists to suppress peaceful expression, including reporting and criticism.
“Palestinian journalists should be able to carry out their work free from threats, harassment or intimidation,” said Saleh Higazi.
“Instead of trying to suppress the work of the media, the authorities in the West Bank and Gaza should be working to protect the right to freedom of expression and hold those who threaten, intimidate and harass journalists accountable.”
Background:
According to the Palestinian Center for Development and Media Freedoms, a Ramallah-based NGO, in 2018 the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank were responsible for 77 attacks on media freedom during the year. These included arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment during interrogation, confiscation of equipment, physical assaults and bans on reporting. The Hamas authorities in Gaza were responsible for 37 such attacks.

Some women were incorrectly told the procedure is reversible. Others were separated from their babies until they consented to a tubal ligation. 
Forced and coerced sterilizations of Indigenous women are a result of systemic bias and discrimination against Indigenous peoples in the provision of public services in Canada, a pattern well known and acknowledged by government. They are an assault on the cultural integrity of societies that have already endured grave human rights violations including forced assimilation. 
Sterilizing women without their free, full, and informed consent is a form of violence and torture. Measures to prevent births within ethnic or racial groups is explicitly prohibited by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 
Everyone who can get pregnant has the human right to make decisions around if, when, and how to create a family. Everyone has the right to live free from violence and discrimination. And everyone has a right to health. 
The federal government is responsible for taking a leadership and coordination role in investigating this issue, stopping it, and ensuring justice for survivors. 
Provinces, territories, and medical colleges also have a role to play given provincial/territorial jurisdiction over healthcare in Canada. Call on the authorities in the province or territory where you live, as well as medical bodies, to end sterilization of Indigenous women without their consent. 
Please write to the provincial/territorial government and the medical body where you live.

(Manila, February 22, 2019) — The Philippine government should drop the politically-motivated charges against Senator Leila de Lima, a prominent critic of President Rodrigo Duterte’s abusive “war on drugs,” Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and FORUM-ASIA said today. De Lima has been arbitrarily detained inside the headquarters of the Philippine National Police since February 24, 2017, in violation of her constitutional rights as a sitting senator and in contravention of international human rights law.
The arbitrary detention and mistreatment of Senator de Lima is emblematic of the deteriorating situation for all human rights defenders in the Philippines, the organizations said.
“Senator de Lima’s two years in custody show the lengths the Duterte administration will go to stifle dissent and threaten human rights defenders who demand accountability for violations,” said John Samuel, executive director of FORUM-ASIA. “The government’s fabricated charges against her only reflect how compromised its institutions have become under the present administration.”
De Lima was the first politician to be targeted by Duterte’s administration after he became president in June 2016. However, de Lima has faced Duterte’s ire since 2009 when, as Chairperson of the National Commission on Human Rights, she launched an investigation into extrajudicial executions by the so-called “Davao death squad” in Davao City, where Duterte was mayor for more than two decades.
In August 2016, de Lima, as Chairperson of the Senate Committee on Justice and Human Rights, started an investigation into the killings that began immediately after Duterte took office. Duterte and his allies in the executive and legislative branches responded with a year-long smear campaign against de Lima, in President Duterte’s words, to “destroy her publicly.” Legislators blocked the committee’s investigation and instead started an inquiry into her alleged romantic affairs – even threatening to make public a purported sex video of hers — and her alleged links with people convicted and imprisoned for drug-related offences.
The authorities used her alleged links to imprisoned drug offenders, which rest mainly on the testimonies of these convicted individuals, to justify her arrest and detention in February 2017.
“Senator de Lima is a brave champion of human rights, detained solely for her criticism of the Duterte administration,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s East and South East Asia and the Pacific Regional Director. “As one of the only leaders bold enough to oppose Duterte’s murderous “war on drugs,” she has faced prolonged arbitrary detention. This is a blatant attempt to silence her courageous voice as she continues to speak out against widespread human rights violations, including thousands of extrajudicial executions of mostly poor and marginalized people.”
The authorities have mistreated de Lima and further violated her human rights whilst in detention. She has been held practically in isolation in Camp Crame, the police headquarters, and rarely allowed visitors. Delegations from foreign governments have been prevented from seeing her or have had a difficult time doing so. She has been denied the use of electronic devices and has only been able to continue to issue press releases and public updates criticizing the “war on drugs” by writing them in longhand.
During trips to court for pretrial hearings, police escorts have attempted to prevent her from speaking to journalists, for instance coughing loudly in unison so that no one could hear what she was saying. On numerous occasions, as videos and photos show, her police escorts have physically obstructed her from speaking.
The pattern of abuse against de Lima is consistent with the administration’s campaign to target and harass critics both in the Philippines and abroad. Those who have spoken out against the “war on drugs” — among them United Nations and European Union officials – have been disparaged and harassed by social media trolls and the government media, often by the president himself. Journalists, most notably Maria Ressa of the news and commentary website Rappler, have been charged with criminal defamation and other politically motivated offenses to intimidate and silence them. Some foreigners have been arrested and deported simply for peacefully expressing their views.
The Duterte administration has rejected numerous calls from various independent organizations, among them the Inter-Parliamentary Union, to release de Lima. It has rejected attempts by United Nations human rights experts to investigate the thousands of extrajudicial executions committed in the context of the “war on drugs” and has threatened the International Criminal Court’s Chief Prosecutor after a preliminary examination into extrajudicial executions was launched.
“De Lima’s prolonged detention is the culmination of President Duterte’s long demonization campaign against a critical sitting senator,” said Brad Adams, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch. “These preposterous charges against her should immediately be dropped and the senator released.”

The organization has learned that Mohammad Kalhori, Barzan Nasrollahzadeh and Shayan Saeedpour, who were all convicted for separate crimes that took place while they were minors, are at risk of imminent execution.
“The Iranian authorities must act quickly to save these young men’s lives. Failing to stop their execution would be another abhorrent assault on children’s rights by Iran. International human rights law strictly prohibits the use of the death penalty against people who were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Its use is horrendous in all circumstances but is even more appalling when it is used as punishment against people who were under 18 when the crimes took place and within a judicial system that is blatantly unfair.”
Iran is one of a handful of countries that continue to execute juvenile offenders in flagrant violation of international law. Over the past three years the Iranian authorities have stepped up such executions.
The organization is aware of more than 90 cases of people in Iran currently on death row for crimes that took place while they were under 18, though the real number is likely to be far higher.
“The Iranian authorities have a horrific track record of putting juvenile offenders to death in flagrant violation of international law and its own human rights obligations,” said Saleh Higazi.
“Instead of sending more juvenile offenders to the gallows the authorities must commute all death sentences and immediately reform Iran’s Penal Code to abolish the use of the death penalty against all those who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime. This should be a first step towards abolishing the death penalty completely.”
As a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child Iran is legally obliged to treat everyone under the age of 18 as a child and ensure that they are never subject to the death penalty.
Amnesty International has also noted an alarming pattern of the Iranian authorities scheduling executions of juvenile offenders at short notice to minimize the chances of public or private interventions to save people’s lives.
Mohammad Kalhori was 15 years old when he was arrested in December 2014 over the fatal stabbing of one of his schoolteachers. Branch One of the Provincial Criminal Court of Lorestan Province found him guilty of murder in March 2016. He was initially sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay “blood money” (diyah) to the victim’s family. In its verdict, the court relied on a state medical opinion which concluded that he did not have “mental growth and maturity” at the time of the crime.
However, the verdict was overturned on appeal by the Supreme Court and
in January 2017, Branch Two of the Provincial Criminal Court of Lorestan Province dismissed any arguments about Mohammad Kalhori’s “mental growth and maturity” and convicted him of murder sentencing him to death. At least two judicial reviews of his case since then have been rejected and his family have now been told by the prosecutor’s office that his death sentence will be implemented soon.
Under Iran’s Islamic Penal Code judges have the discretion to replace the death penalty with an alternative punishment if they determine that the juvenile offender did not understand the nature of the crime or its consequences, or that there were doubts about his or her “mental growth and maturity” at the time of the crime.
Barzan Nasrollahzadeh was arrested by Ministry of Intelligence officials at the age of 17 in Sanandaj, Kurdistan Province in May 2010. He was held for several months in a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Sanandaj without access to his family or a lawyer. He has said that during this period he was tortured, including with an electric-shock device, by being suspended upside down, and beaten. After his trial in August 2013, he was sentenced to death after being convicted of “enmity against God.” He is currently held in Raja’i Shahr prison, Karaj. His request for judicial review of his case has been rejected, which means that his sentence may be sent for implementation soon.  
Shayan Saeedpour was arrested at 17 after surrendering himself at a police station for the murder of another person during a fight in August 2015. In October 2018 branch One of Kurdistan’s criminal court sentenced him to death for first degree murder and to 80 lashes for drinking alcohol.
Amnesty International is calling on Iran’s parliament to urgently amend Article 91 of the 2013 Islamic Penal Code to abolish the death penalty for crimes committed by people under 18 in line with Iran’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).
The organization is also calling on doctors affiliated with Iran’s Legal Medicine Organization, an organization which provides courts with medical opinions on the “maturity” of persons convicted of crimes committed when they were still children, not to give medical legitimacy to judicial processes that lead to executions of people who were under 18 at the time of the crime.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to execute the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life.

Real leaders keep human rights alive. They don’t try to stifle them by placing unreasonable restrictions and barriers on NGOs to prevent them from carrying out vital human rights work. Nor do real leaders use bullying techniques or tie up NGOs in red tape in a bid to silence them. 
Yet as more self-proclaimed ‘tough guy’ leaders have emerged on the world stage in recent years, these are exactly the kind of bullying tactics they have resorted to in their attempts to target and attack already marginalised communities. 
As Amnesty International’s new report on the global crackdown on civil society globally reveals, since 2017 almost 40 pieces of legislation designed to hamper the work of civil society organizations have been put in place, or are in the works, globally. 
From Hungary to the USA, we have witnessed the terrible impact this is having on people who are coming together to defend human rights. Activists working for the rights of women, LGBTI people, refugees and migrants and the environment are among the worse affected. 
Take Saudi Arabia, where the murder of Jamal Khashoggi has opened many people’s eyes to the grim reality of how dissenting voices are treated. 
One of the ways the Saudi government is clamping down on dissent is by denying the registration of new organizations and disbanding them if they are deemed to be “harming national unity”. Under this policy, no independent human rights organization has been able to register, and women’s rights groups have been particularly targeted. 
Women human rights defenders such as Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, and Aziza al-Yousef, among several others, remain arbitrarily detained, without charge and with no access to lawyers. 
As our report attests to, burdensome registration requirements, obstacles to access funding and other restrictions based on vague notions of “national security” or “traditional values” disproportionally affect women and marginalized groups. 
What is extremely alarming is how these repressive laws are fast expanding around the world, even in countries traditionally regarded as more open to civil society. President Donald Trump’s reinstatement of the so-called “Global Gag Rule”, which he implemented as one of his first priorities in office in 2017, is a case in point. The rule blocks US health assistance, often in the form of vital funding, to any NGO that uses its own funds to provide abortion services, counselling, referrals or indeed tries to advocate for decriminalizing these services. 
This has not only resulted in preventing millions of women and girls globally to access life-saving sexual and reproductive health services, it has also impacted organizations providing care for other health issues like HIV and malaria. 
These restrictions are not just affecting women’s rights activists and the communities they work with. Migrants and refugees have long been targeted by politicians wielding a toxic “us vs them” rhetoric, and those attacks are now increasingly expanding to include groups showing solidarity and providing assistance to those in need. 
In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s government has presided over the passing of xenophobic laws designed to target individuals and organizations that provide support to refugees and migrants. Under the “Stop Soros” package of laws passed in 2018, the simple act of preparing or distributing pamphlets containing information on migration could be a criminal offence. This legislation is so broadly worded, it is farcical. 
But Hungary is not alone. Australia’s Border Force Act of 2015 has been one of the most egregious examples of how governments have tried to stifle solidarity with refugees: the Act prevents law enforcement officials from speaking out about any abuse or medical negligence committed in Australia’s offshore detention centres. Anyone that does could face a two-year jail term. 
In their attempts to demonize and vilify already marginalized minority groups, governments are intent on dragging everyone into their net, especially the activists who dare to stand up for the rights of others. 
This is an issue that concerns all of us, not just NGO workers. Because the end result, if governments are allowed to continue with these tactics, is a world in which we are more divided than ever, and in which fewer people are willing or able to stand up for the rights of marginalised communities.

It has been eighteen months, but it feels like forever.” Mohammed Ali, a...","Balukhali Refugee Camp, Bangladesh 
“We’ve been through this before, but never like this.  Never so many people.  And now it feels like it might go on and on. It has been eighteen months, but it feels like forever.” 
Mohammed Ali, a 65-year-old farmer, was returning from his fields to his home in the village of Kyein Chaung, in the Township of Maungdaw, in Myanmar’s Rakhine State in early September, 2017.  And the attack began. The village was surrounded by government soldiers who began shooting at villagers and setting fire to houses as they advanced. The people of Kyein Chaung knew what was coming as they had already seen dead bodies floating down the stream from other neighbouring villages. 
“There was only one thing to do.  We knew we had to leave and we ran.  And fortunately, no one in our own family was injured or killed. But we heard cries around us.  We knew that could easily have been us. And it was only good luck that it was not.” 
Mohammed fled along with 10 other family members, including his mother, wife, children and grandchildren, the youngest being 10 years old.  And since that time they have been living in the Balukhali Refugee Camp, across the border in Bangladesh, for nearly 18 months.  Safe from the attacks of the Myanmar military, but still not free. 
“We have never really been free, long before the violence that brought us all here in 2017.  We are not even recognized as citizens, in our own country.  Here in Bangladesh we are safe, and for that we are very grateful to the government for allowing us across the border.  But we are not free.  We have no freedom of movement.  We have to stay in the camps, which are so overcrowded. If we try to go anywhere else we are stopped at the checkpoints and sent back.  It feels like a prison.” 
Mohammed thinks of the future and what lies ahead for his family. He particularly thinks of his children and grandchildren. 
“There is much talk about what they plan to do with us.  Last year they wanted us to return to Myanmar. But no one wants to go back there at this time, because there has been no progress.  It would be returning to exactly what we left.  Without a promise that we will be recognized as full citizens, with equal rights, that is not an option. My children deserve better than I had.” 
“And the Bangladesh government says they might send us to Bhasan Char [an island in the Bay of Bengal].  I would rather die.  They cannot separate us by sending some of us to an island that would be cut-off from the rest of us.  Our unity cannot be broken. That is what keeps us strong after everything that has happened. And it would be inhuman for anyone to be sent to such a place.  There will be flooding when the monsoons come.  There is no safety and security there.” 
For Mohammed, it comes down to education. 
“The way ahead for us is not clear.  We can’t go back, but we can’t stay like this.  And the best hope for making things better is to make sure our children are going to school.  Right now there is very little available for them.  The very young children have fun playing and learn a little in the Child Friendly Spaces. But there is nothing for the older children.” 
“I see young people sitting around with nothing to do and I worry.  Learning is what will give them hope and ideas.  I am helping as I can.  I take some children aside and teach them what I can.  Others are doing that also. But I am old, and I am not a teacher.  They need real schools with real teachers.”  
“This is so important for their future.  It is so important for our future.” 
Amnesty International echoes Mohammed’s hope and expectation. It is time for steps to be taken by the government of Bangladesh and the international community, working together, to ensure education of good quality is available in the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.

Laws Designed to Silence: The Global Crackdown on Civil Society Organizations reveals the startling number of countries that are using bullying techniques and repressive regulations to prevent NGOs from doing their vital work. The report lists 50 countries worldwide where anti-NGO laws have been implemented or are in the pipeline.
“We documented how an increasing number of governments are placing unreasonable restrictions and barriers on NGOs, preventing them from carrying out crucial work,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“In many countries, organizations who dare to speak out for human rights are being bullied into silence. Groups of people who come together to defend and demand human rights are facing growing barriers to working freely and safely. Silencing them and preventing their work has consequences for everyone.”
In the past two years alone, almost 40 pieces of legislation that interfere with the right to association and are designed to hamper the work of civil society organizations have been put in place or are in the works around the world. These laws commonly include implementing ludicrous registration processes for organizations, monitoring their work, restricting their sources of resources and, in many cases, shutting them down if they don’t adhere to the unreasonable requirements imposed on them.
A global problem
In October 2018, Pakistan’s Ministry of the Interior rejected registration applications from 18 international NGOs, and dismissed their subsequent appeals, without giving a reason.
NGOs in Belarus are subjected to strict state supervision. Working for those NGOs whose registration request is rejected (often arbitrarily) is a criminal offence.
In Saudi Arabia, the government can deny licenses to new organizations and disband them if they are deemed to be “harming national unity”. This has affected human rights groups, including women’s human rights groups, who have not been able to register and operate freely in the country.
In Egypt, organizations that receive funding from abroad need to comply with stringent and arbitrary regulations. This has led many human rights defenders being banned from travel, having their assets frozen and prosecuted. Some could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted of receiving foreign funding.
“Amnesty International’s offices around the world have also come under attack. From India to Hungary, authorities have abused our staff, raided their offices and frozen their assets in a further escalation of their attack on local organizations,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Locked up for failing to comply
Many countries, such as Azerbaijan, China and Russia, have introduced further registration and reporting requirements for NGOs. Failure to comply means imprisonment, a punishment Azerbaijani human rights defender Rasul Jafarov, interviewed for the report, knows all too well.
“I was arrested in connection with activism and demonstrations carried out with my Human Rights Club,” said Rasul, who was released from prison in 2016, after being detained for over a year. “This created an awful atmosphere. Those not arrested or investigated had to close their organizations or stop their projects. Many left Azerbaijan to work abroad.”
This restrictive regulation means NGOs are under constant scrutiny by the authorities. In China, new legislation tightly controls the work of NGOs from registration and reporting to banking, hiring requirements and fundraising.
In Russia, the government has labelled NGOs who receive foreign funding “foreign agents” – a term synonymous with “spy”, “traitor” and “enemy of the state”. The government applies this legislation so broadly that even an organization supporting people with diabetes was heavily fined, put on the “foreign agents” register and forced to close in October 2018. Medical, environmental and women’s groups have also come under fire.
Ripple effect
The repressive policies of the Russian government have caused a ripple effect reaching several other countries.
In Hungary, a number of NGOs are being forced to label themselves as “foreign funded” as the government seeks to discredit their work and turn the general public against them. Organizations failing to comply with these rules face high fines and ultimately the suspension of their activities. Organizations working in support of migrants and refugees have been purposefully targeted and their staff harassed after a new set of laws were passed in June 2018.
“We don’t know what is going to happen to us and other organizations, and what laws will be passed next,” said Aron Demeter, from Amnesty International Hungary.
“Several members of our staff have been subjected to online trolling, abuse and threats of violence. Some venues refused to host our events and there were schools that refused to hold human rights education activities for fear of repercussions.”
In some countries, the attack on NGOs is particularly targeted against organizations that defend the rights of marginalized groups. Those promoting women’s rights, including sexual and reproductive health and rights, LGBTI rights, the rights of migrants and refugees and environmental groups are among the worst affected.
“No one should be criminalized for standing up for human rights. World leaders should be aiming to guarantee equality and ensure people in their countries have better working conditions, proper health care, access to education and adequate housing – not targeting those who demand them,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Human rights defenders are committed to creating a better world for everyone. We’re not going to give up the fight, because we know how important this work is. World leaders reiterated their commitment to provide a safe environment for human rights defenders at the UN Headquarters in December 2018 during the 20th anniversary of the Declaration on HRDs. They must now ensure it becomes a reality.”
According to CIVICUS, a global alliance of civil society organisations and activists, Amnesty International’s report has come at a pivotal time.
“This report is timely given the proliferation of restrictions on the legitimate work of civil society organisations,” said Mandeep Tiwana, Chief Programmes Officer from CIVICUS. “By shining a spotlight on the challenges, those who support civil society and human rights values can help stem the tide.”

“This is a huge step forward for marriage equality in Taiwan. The draft law is the first of its kind in Asia to allow same-sex marriage. It sends a strong message to the Taiwanese people and the world that Taiwan chooses love over hate, and equality over discrimination.
“We welcome the bill proposed by Taiwan’s Executive Yuan. It pursues the equal protection of the freedom of marriage for two persons of the same sex, upholding the principles and spirit as laid out in the Constitutional Court’s ruling on 24 May 2017.
“There are some areas where this separate law falls short of genuine marriage equality. This will require future reforms to fully align opposite-sex and same-sex marriage in law.”
Background
On 20 February, Taiwan’s Cabinet put forth a draft law on same-sex marriage. The new draft law, called “The Enforcement Act of the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748”, will grant same-sex couples essentially equal rights to legally marry. The rights and obligations applied to opposite-sex couples under the existing regulations in the Civil Code will also be applied to same-sex couples.
The draft law includes provisions that encompass inheritance rights, medical rights, mutual support and financial obligations, adoption of biological children of one spouse and divorce.
The draft law also makes the crime of “adultery” applicable to same-sex unions. Taiwan’s criminal code allows for a married person who commits “adultery” to be imprisoned for up to a year. Under international law, criminalizing consensual sex between adults, whether inside or outside marriage, is a human rights violation.
The draft has been sent to the Legislative Yuan on 21 February for review. Taiwan’s parliament is expected to take a final vote on the proposals by 24 May, a deadline for legislation set by the Constitutional Court’s ruling.
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch wrote a joint letter to Taiwan’s Executive Yuan in December 2018 to urge them to table a comprehensive piece of legislation for recognizing and protecting same-sex unions in Taiwan.

Kamto, the president of the Cameroon Renaissance Movement (Mouvement pour la Renaissance du Cameroun-MRC) is the first of a group of 131 people arbitrarily arrested last month and charged by the military court with rebellion, hostility against the homeland, incitement to insurrection, offence against the president of the republic,  and destruction of public buildings and goods, to be summoned by an investigating judge. They all face the death penalty which is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and a violation of the right to life.
“It is horrifying that the Cameroonian authorities are considering sentencing Maurice Kamto to death simply for daring to participate in a peaceful protest. He is one of many people who have been caught up in a wave of mass arrests as authorities attempt to silence their critics,” said Marie-Evelyne Petrus Barry, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa regional director.
“As well as having their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly crushed, many of Cameroon’s opposition members are now facing unfair trials by military courts. We are calling on authorities to end this ruthless assault on dissenting voices. Civilians should not be tried by military courts and should not face the death penalty for exercising their human rights.”
International and regional human rights bodies including the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights consider that military courts should not, in any circumstances whatsoever, have jurisdiction over civilians. This is also recognized in the Principles of fair trial in Africa.
Following his arrest on 28 January, Maurice Kamto, who was also a presidential candidate, spent two weeks in detention, during which time his lawyers and family saw him only once. He is detained at Yaoundé Principale Prison along with six MRC supporters and officials. The rest of the 131 are detained in a different prison. Amnesty International considers that they should have never been arrested in the first place.
On 19th February, 12 of another group of 15 opposition members arrested on 26 January in Yaoundé appeared before an ordinary court. According to the prosecutor they had been arrested for attempting to participate in a banned demonstration. The hearing was postponed until 25 February. 
“Authorities should stop being less and less tolerant of criticism and take concrete actions to promote human rights,” said Marie-Evelyne Petrus Barry.

Pressures on pro-democracy activists 
Authorities in Senegal should take all appropriate measures to ensure that the Presidential election is held in a climate that is free from violence and respects the freedom of all people to express their views, Amnesty International said ahead of Sunday’s presidential polls.
On 11 February during campaign rallies, two people were killed in the south eastern town of Tambacounda. Many others, including journalists, were injured following violent clashes between supporters of incumbent President Macky Sall who is seeking a second term, and those of El hadj Issa Sall, one of the opposition candidates.
“It is unacceptable that people are killed during political rallies. Those responsible for these acts must be identified and brought to justice in fair trials,” said François Patuel, Amnesty International’s West Africa researcher.
“While authorities should protect and promote human rights in the context of elections, particularly the right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, all candidates should also remind their supporters to refrain from using violence in any circumstance.”
Senegal’s election campaigning started on 4 February. A week later, it was marred by the killing of two people in Tambacounda. Macky Sall’s backers said campaign posters for their candidate were sabotaged by the opposition. Clashes turned deadly when a young supporter of Macky Sall was stabbed to death.
Several individuals in El hadj Issa Sall’s procession were filmed carrying machetes. They were stopped, arrested and disarmed by security forces and are now being prosecuted.
Journalists caught up in violent reprisals
As reprisals for the killing, groups of youths drove motorcycles to chase El hadj Issa Sall’s procession throwing stones and projectiles. A 22-year-old motorcycle driver was hit by a car and later died.
The President of Motorcycles Drivers of Tambacounda told Amnesty International that 14 drivers were injured.
The reprisals also led to material damage. At least two vehicles were burnt. These include the bus carrying around 27 journalists covering El hadj Issa Sall’s campaign. The journalists’ equipment was also damaged. Amnesty International spoke to three journalists who confirmed they were injured, with trauma to the mouth, muscle soreness and stitches. The other journalists ran away to escape the violence. 
“Journalists do essential work to keep the public informed, often in difficult circumstances including during and after the election process. They must be protected to do their work freely, and without fear of attacks or threats,” said François Patuel.
Pressures on pro-democracy activists
Civic space has also shrunk in recent months, with pressures on non-governmental organizations and pro-democracy activists increasing.
In November last year, at least four International non-governmental organizations (INGOs) were summoned by the police as part of an investigation into the sources of funding of pro-democracy civil society organization Y’en a marre (Enough is Enough). Y’en a marre are a group of rappers and journalists who joined forces in January 2011 to encourage young people to register to vote in the country’s election and exercise their right to freedom of expression.
The representatives of the INGOs were questioned for several hours without access to a lawyer. One of the INGOs had its authorization to operate in Senegal repealed on the basis that it “participated to irregular funding operations to an association which does not enjoy the status of public utility”. It had to cease all its activities in Senegal. The others have their authorizations under review.
The Ministry of Interior argues that Y’en a marre which has remained active since the 2012 election, undertaking advocacy, monitoring and education on land reforms, constitutional reforms and electoral processes, is not eligible to receive foreign funding as it does not “enjoy the status of association with status of public utility”.
“The fact that the investigation into Y’en a marre started a few months before the elections when the association has existed for years, clearly indicates that the aim is to intimidate civil society groups ahead of the elections,” said François Patuel.
‘’Questioning whether pro-democracy movements can access international funding and putting pressure on their funders is a major setback for Senegal.”
A large number of activists in Senegal use their online presence for civic and political engagement. As elections approach, Amnesty International calls on the authorities not to arbitrarily restrict access to the internet and ensure that journalists, human rights defenders and pro-democracy activists can continue to carry out their work.
“Whoever wins the elections has an opportunity to put human rights at the centre of the agenda,” said Francois Patuel.

0,Malawi: Minister’s shameful denial comments fueling attacks against persons with albinism,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/malawi-ministers-shameful-denial-comments-fueling-attacks-against-persons-with-albinism/,"The Minister of Homeland Security’s comments that attacks on persons with albinism have not reached crisis levels will only embolden those perpetrating the assaults and are a disturbing reminder of the government’s inaction on the issue, Amnesty International said today. Malawi is experiencing...","The Minister of Homeland Security’s comments that attacks on persons with albinism have not reached crisis levels will only embolden those perpetrating the assaults and are a disturbing reminder of the government’s inaction on the issue, Amnesty International said today.
Malawi is experiencing a resurgence of attacks against persons with albinism, with two fatalities and three abductions since 31 December 2018. Two of those who were abducted were later rescued by community members, one remains missing.
“The latest comments from Minister Nicholas Dausi are yet another indication that persons with albinism in Malawi are on their own when it comes to their safety and security,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“For years, people with albinism have been living at the mercy of criminal gangs who target them for their body parts. The recent spike in attacks shows that the government, despite amending the Anatomy Act and the Penal Code to ensure stiffer penalties, hasn’t lived up to its commitments on protecting this group.”
Latest attacks
On the night of 31 December, eight people broke into Yasin Phiri’s house, a 54-year-old person with albinism, while he was sleeping in Kande, Nkhata Bay. The suspected perpetrators grabbed him and brutally killed him as his nine-year-old son, George, looked on in horror.
According to eyewitnesses, the criminal gang hacked off both of Phiri’s arms, removed his lower teeth, cut off his private parts and removed one of his lungs.
In another case, six masked men broke into 14-year-old Goodson Makanjira’s home on 13 February. His body was later found dumped in the Dyamphi River in Dedza, 85km south of Lilongwe. The killers removed his teeth, hands and private parts.
On 22 January, a one-and-a-half-year-old Eunice Nkhonjera was abducted from her house in Lulanga Village in Karonga District in the northern region. Baby Eunice and her mother Loveness Nkhonjera were sleeping when some unknown people broke the door and entered their home in the early hours of the morning. Her mother woke up at around 4 am only to realize that her daughter was missing. Eunice has not yet been found. Two other abductions were thwarted by community members.
“The authorities must promptly, thoroughly and effectively investigate the recent attacks against people with albinism and ensure that suspected perpetrators are brought to justice for these gruesome attacks in fair trials. People will albinism cannot continue to live in fear in their own country.”
Background
Amnesty International has documented an unprecedented wave of killings and other human rights abuses including abductions and robberies against persons with albinism in Malawi since November 2014.
Persons with albinism are targeted for their body parts in the belief that they contain magical powers. The current population of people with albinism in Malawi is estimated at between 7,000 and 10,000, representing a ratio of 1 in every 1,800 persons.

“These outlandish allegations are an attempt to rewrite history and to silence some of Turkey’s most prominent civil society figures who now face the prospect of being tried by Turkey’s deeply flawed justice system.”
“Almost six years after the Gezi Park protests saw tens of thousands of people peacefully protesting against state repression, this indictment – if accepted by the court – could see the accused facing a lifetime behind bars without the possibility of parole.”
“The Gezi protests were overwhelmingly peaceful with people simply exercising their rights. They were met by arbitrary and abusive force by police. It should be the authorities’ denial of these rights and the police violence against peaceful protestors that should be examined by the courts, not these 16 civil society figures who have not committed any crime.
“These charges must be dropped and Osman Kavala, who has been in jail on pretrial detention for almost 16 months, and Yiğit Aksakoğlu, who has been in prison for four months, must be immediately released.”

“The authorities under Nicolás Maduro are trying to use fear and punishment to impose a repulsive strategy of social control against those who demand change. His government is attacking the most impoverished people that it claims to defend, but instead it murders, detains and threatens them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
Venezuela has suffered a major crisis of massive human rights violations for years, with shortages of food, medicines, hyperinflation, violence and political repression forcing more than three million people to flee the country since 2015.
Faced with this bleak reality, thousands have taken to the streets to demand a change in government. From 21 to 25 January, numerous demonstrations were registered, many of them in impoverished areas, where protests demanding this change had not previously been so visible. There is a strong presence of pro-Nicolás Maduro armed groups (commonly known as “colectivos”) in these areas, where residents depend to a large extent on the currently limited state programs to distribute staple foods.
In just five days, at least 41 people died during these protests, all of them from gunshot wounds. More than 900 were arbitrarily detained, and just on 23 January (the day that demonstrations were held across the country), 770 arbitrary arrests were reported.
During a research mission in the states of Lara, Yaracuy, Vargas, and different locations in Caracas, from 31 January to 17 February, Amnesty International gathered more than 50 testimonies and documented 15 emblematic cases, including some of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law. The findings of this investigation will soon be fully expanded on in a public report.
The evidence gathered in these different locations shows typical patterns. These indicate that the state authorities carried out selective extrajudicial executions as a method of social control using the Bolivarian National Police (PNB), mainly through its Special Actions Force (FAES), against people who participated in some way in the protests. The more impoverished areas of Caracas and other parts of the country were particularly affected and stigmatized, registering the highest numbers of victims, who were later presented as “criminals” killed in clashes with the authorities.
Extrajudicial executions
Amnesty International documented six extrajudicial executions at the hands of the FAES in several locations across the country, all with a similar modus operandi. In each case, the victims were in some way linked to the protests that had been held in previous days and the criticism that several of them had made against Nicolás Maduro had gone viral on social networks.
The six victims were all young men whom authorities publicly described as having been killed in clashes with the FAES. This public security force tampered with the crime scenes and portrayed the victims as delinquents, saying that several of them had a criminal record, in an attempt to justify their deaths.
“As we have seen many times in Venezuela, the authorities want us to believe that those who died during the protests – mainly young people from low-income areas – were criminals. Their only crime was daring to ask for change and to demand a dignified existence,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
Luis Enrique Ramos Suárez was 29 years old when FAES officers executed him on 24 January in the city of Carora. The day before, a voice note announcing protests against Nicolás Maduro and Carora’s mayor’s office had gone viral. In this voice note, Luis Enrique was mentioned by his nickname as one of the organizers.
On 24 January, more than 20 heavily armed and mostly masked members of the FAES illegally raided the Ramos Suárez household and mistreated the 10 family members who were present, including six children. After identifying Luis Enrique by his nickname, they made him kneel in the middle of the room while one officer took photos and others beat him.
They locked the other family members in different rooms of the house, threatened them and beat them in different parts of the body. They then forcibly removed them from their home and transferred them in a PNB convoy to a location two kilometers from the house. Minutes later, they shot Luis Enrique twice in the chest. He died immediately.
According to the testimonies obtained, after executing Luis Enrique, FAES officers fired inside the house to simulate a shootout. In addition to fabricating evidence, they tampered with the crime scene, dragging the corpse to a vehicle in which it was finally transferred to the morgue, thus violating the minimum protocols for criminal investigation.
Excessive use of force
Amnesty International also documented the cases of two young men killed and a young man wounded by firearms at the hands of state security forces while participating in protests. Both the PNB and the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) participated in operations of this nature.
Alixon Pizani, a 19-year-old baker, died on 22 January from a bullet wound to the thorax while protesting with a group of friends in Catia, west of Caracas. According to witnesses, an officer wearing a PNB uniform mounted on a motorcycle fired a handgun at random into the crowd, seriously injuring two people.
Without receiving any help from the authorities, Alixon was transferred to a health center, where he died. Alixon’s family says that FAES officials began firing rounds at his friends and relatives at the hospital entrance, who immediately took refuge inside. To date there is no evidence that the public prosecutor’s office has initiated an investigation.
Arbitrary detentions
According to Venezuela’s Foro Penal, the authorities detained 137 children and adolescents throughout the country from January 21 to 31. Of those cases, Amnesty International documented the arbitrary detention of six people, including four teenagers who participated in a protest, or simply watched it from close by, in the city of San Felipe on January 23.
In an interview with Amnesty International, they said that upon being arrested, the authorities beat them, called them “guarimberos” (protestors who use violence) and “terrorists”, exposed them to irritant substances, deprived them of sleep, and threatened to kill them. According to their testimony, the officials who detained them belonged to several different state security forces and were accompanied by people dressed in civilian clothes.
“Arbitrarily detaining more than a hundred adolescents and subjecting them to cruel treatment, which at times may have constituted torture, shows how far the authorities are willing to go in their desperate attempts to stop the protests and subdue the population,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
The four teenagers were accused of crimes that, according to national law, they should not have been held in detention for, yet they were imprisoned for eight days by court order. They spent four of those days at the Rehabilitation Center for Minors, a military institution where they had their heads shaved and were forced to sing phrases like “We are Chávez’s children”.
On 29 January, one of the judges in charge of three of these cases publicly stated that she had been ordered to keep the adolescents in custody, despite there being no legal justification. After making this complaint, she was removed from her position and left the country. The four adolescents are awaiting their trial and remain subject to restrictions on their freedom.
The young men expressed how frustrating it was to live in an economic, social and political crisis at their age, where studying, eating or finding clothing is a daily challenge. Some expressed their desire to leave Venezuela in search of a better future.
Preliminary recommendations
The Venezuelan authorities must put an end to the policies of repression that they have developed in recent years and fulfill their obligation to guarantee justice, truth and reparation for victims of human rights violations or crimes under international law.
“The Venezuelan justice system seems to have a policy of abandoning the victims of human rights violations. The few people brave enough to file reports are left defenseless and in danger due to the lack of a response from the authorities,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
Due to the severe obstacles that obstruct the path justice in Venezuela, Amnesty International calls on the United Nations Human Rights Council to take action to address the total impunity that prevails in Venezuela, through the creation of an independent investigative body to monitor and report on the human rights situation in the country.
In addition, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should consider these facts, and if it deems them well founded, incorporate them as part of the preliminary examination already underway on Venezuela.
Finally, countries genuinely concerned about the human rights situation in Venezuela should explore the application of universal jurisdiction, which serves as an alternative path to justice for victims that cannot access it locally.
“International justice is the only hope for victims of human rights violations in Venezuela. It is time to activate all available mechanisms to prevent further atrocities,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

“By carrying out the executions of these nine men today Egypt has demonstrated an absolute disregard for the right to life.
“Those responsible for the attack that killed Egypt’s former public prosecutor deserve to be punished but executing men who were convicted in trials marred by torture allegations is not justice but a testament to the magnitude of injustice in the country.
“These executions are a stark demonstration of the government’s increasing use of the death penalty, bringing the total number of death sentences implemented in the past three weeks to 15. Egyptian authorities must urgently halt this bloody execution spree which has seen them repeatedly putting people to death after grossly unfair trials in recent weeks. 
“The international community must not stay silent over this surge in executions. Egypt’s allies must take a clear stand by publicly condemning the authorities’ use of the death penalty, the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.”
Background:
The nine were among 28 men sentenced to death for the killing of the former public prosecutor in an attack in Cairo that took place in June 2015. Several of the men said they were forcibly disappeared and tortured in order to confess to the killing.

Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life.

Here’s what you need to know:
1 – EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE
Much of the current unrest in Venezuela can be traced back to 29 March 2017, when the Supreme Court of Justice – backed by President Nicolás Maduro – moved to take over the National Assembly, where the opposition holds a majority. This triggered protests that were repressed by the Maduro administration with the unlawful and disproportionate use of force. Between April and July 2017, more than 120 people were killed, around 1,958 were injured and more than 5,000 were detained amid mass protests.
2 – MASS PROTESTS
In 2018 there were 12,715 protests across the country, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict. These have continued in 2019 after President of the National Assembly Juan Guaidó called for mass demonstrations against Maduro.
Amnesty’s report ‘Nights of Terror’ revealed how Venezuelan security forces and government-sponsored civilian armed groups have violently broken into people’s homes as a way of intimidating them against taking part in demonstrations or any other form of protest.
3 – REPRESSION ESCALATING
State authorities have undertaken a systematic policy of repression throughout the crisis, but recent patterns suggest this is intensifying.
In the report ‘This is no way to live’, Amnesty revealed how state-backed security forces were using lethal force with intent to kill against the most vulnerable and socially excluded people in the country under the pretext of “fighting criminality”.
There have been numerous reports of human rights violations against protesters in early 2019, particularly in poor areas hardest hit by the crisis, and where pro- Maduro armed groups are concentrated. Venezuelan civil society organizations say 41 people have died in this year’s protests.
4 – CHILDREN AMONG DETAINED
State authorities have used the justice system to illegally harass those who think differently. According to the Venezuelan organization Foro Penal, 988 people were arbitrarily detained between 21 and 31 January 2019.  Among those detained were 137 children and adolescents, of whom 10 are still in detention. There have also been allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of detainees. Foro Penal estimates the number of people currently detained for political reasons is 942.
5 – CIVILIANS TRIED IN MILITARY COURTS
Arrested protesters have frequently been tried in military courts, which is against international law. Those prosecuted have faced charges such as “association with intent to incite rebellion” and “attacking a sentinel”, which are specifically designed for military personnel. It is yet further evidence of the authorities’ determination to silence dissent.
6 – THREE MILLION REFUGEES AND MIGRANTS
It is estimated that more than three million people have fled Venezuela since 2015, equivalent to 10% of the population, according to UN figures. The majority have sought refuge in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Most have cited the denial of their rights to health and food as their main reason for leaving. In other words, they are fleeing for their lives. Amnesty International has urged governments across Latin America and the Caribbean to give Venezuelan refugees access to the asylum application processes in their countries.
7 – CRACKDOWN ON FREE SPEECH
There have been numerous reports of violations of the right to freedom of expression, including the arbitrary detention and/or deportation of at least 19 media workers, both nationals and non-nationals. In January 2019, at least 11 journalists were detained in a single week.
8 – ECONOMIC MELTDOWN
Inflation in Venezuela stood at a staggering 1,698,4882% in 2018, according to the National Assembly. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that in 2019, the annual inflation rate will reach 10,000,000%. Meanwhile, the official minimum wage in Venezuela is US$6 a month – and this is the income of a large part of the population. The inevitable outcome is that many people cannot afford basic goods.
Shortages of basic supplies such as food and medicine have left millions of Venezuelans facing alarming living conditions which are getting worse every day. Measures adopted by the state authorities have hit wages and workers’ rights. Up until 2013, the Venezuelan authorities had made great progress in terms of economic and social rights, but this trend has been emphatically in reverse in recent years.
9 – GOVERNMENT IN DENIAL
Nicolás Maduro has repeatedly denied that the country is experiencing a human rights crisis. More damaging still, he has refused to recognize the shortages of food and medicines. The few public official statistics on the welfare of the population are contradicted by the reports of independent bodies.
Because the authorities have denied these shortages, they have not accepted the international humanitarian assistance that has been repeatedly offered. This has had a catastrophic impact, especially on the most vulnerable.
10 – DAMAGING US SANCTIONS
On 28 January, the US government announced new measures that prevent the Venezuelan state oil company from exporting crude oil to the USA while stopping US suppliers selling the products that Venezuela needs to process its heavy crude oil. Given that the Venezuelan economy is heavily dependent on oil exports and that the USA is one of Venezuela’s main trading partners, these measures are likely to make life even harder for people living in the country.

“The Haitian authorities must not only ensure that people are able to peacefully protest and guarantee the life and physical integrity of those who choose to demonstrate, but also give full consideration to the grievances sparking the protests and meaningfully address the underlying causes of the political and economic crisis.”
Since 2018, Haiti has seen regular protests demanding transparency in relation to the use of Petrocaribe funds. According to the World Bank, Haiti remains the poorest country in the Americas, with 59% of the population living below the national poverty line, and 24% below the national extreme poverty line.

In an open letter released today, the organization and six other NGOs urged Novalpina to publicly commit to accountability for NSO Group’s past spyware abuses, including the targeting of an Amnesty International employee and the alleged targeting of Jamal Khashoggi.
Danna Ingleton, Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech, said:
“Novalpina’s executives have serious questions to answer about their involvement with a company which has become the go-to surveillance tool for abusive governments. This sale comes in the wake of reports that NSO paid private operatives to physically intimidate individuals trying to investigate its role in attacks on human rights defenders – further proof that NSO is an extremely dangerous entity.
“We are calling on Novalpina to confirm an immediate end to the sale or further maintenance of NSO products to governments which have been accused of using surveillance to violate human rights. It must also be completely transparent about its plans to prevent further abuses.
“This could be an opportunity to finally hold NSO Group to account. Novalpina must commit to fully engaging with investigations into past abuses of NSO’s spyware, and ensure that neither NSO Group nor its previous owners, Francisco Partners, are let off the hook.”

The men were convicted after an unfair trial over the 2015 killing of Egypt’s former public prosecutor, and have been moved from their prison cells to the appeals prison in preparation for their executions. During the trial some of the defendants said they were forcibly disappeared and tortured to confessing to the crime.
Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International’s North Africa Campaigns Director said:
“Time is running out to save the lives of these nine men. The Egyptian authorities have an opportunity to do the right thing by immediately halting any plans to carry out these executions.
“There is no doubt that those involved in deadly attacks must be prosecuted and held accountable for their actions but executing prisoners or convicting people based on confessions extracted through torture is not justice.
“The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman and irreversible punishment and its use in Egypt is even more appalling given the authorities’ track record of handing out death sentences after grossly unfair trials. At least six men have already been executed earlier this month after unfair trials. Instead of stepping up executions the Egyptian authorities should take steps to abolish the death penalty once and for all.”
Background:
The nine men were among 28 men sentenced to death for the killing of the former public prosecutor in an attack in Cairo that took place in June 2015. Several of the men said they were forcibly disappeared and tortured in order to confess to the killing.
On 25 February 2018, the Court of Cassation upheld the decision against the nine men and commuted the sentence of six others to life imprisonment. Thirteen other men were convicted in absentia, and one of them was forcibly returned to Egypt from Turkey in January. Under Egyptian law, those sentenced in absentia are entitled to a retrial once in custody.
So far, at least six people have been executed in Egypt in 2019 after trials marred by claims of torture.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life.

In a new report, “No Shame in Diversity”, the organization uses case studies in Iceland to show how the lack of rights-based healthcare protocols mean that people born with variations of sex characteristics – who sometimes describe themselves as ‘intersex’ – face stigma and discrimination and are often subjected to harmful surgery. 
A Bill that could help stop this – the Bill on Act on Sexual and Gender Autonomy – is expected to come before the Icelandic Parliament at the end of February but it lacks essential protections for children. In particular, it includes no provisions to end “normalising” non-emergency, invasive and irreversible surgeries on children born with variations of sex characteristics.
Amnesty International has highlighted how, despite the fact that Iceland is ranked top of the World Economic Forum Global Gender Gap Index, the Icelandic authorities have as yet failed to put in place rights-based healthcare protocols and ensure that people with variations of sex characteristics can access healthcare that is appropriate for their needs.  
“Iceland has a reputation for gender equality, yet the way the Icelandic health system treats intersex people is deeply troubling. Intersex children and adults are seen as problems that need to be fixed and the fact that they cannot access healthcare centred on their human rights can cause a lifetime of physical and mental suffering,” said Laura Carter, Researcher on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at Amnesty International.
“The people that we spoke to said they felt doctors didn’t listen to what they wanted for themselves or their children, instead opting to ‘normalise’ the bodies of intersex people through invasive surgery or hormone treatment. There have recently been some shifts in attitude, largely thanks to the tireless work of intersex activists, but a climate of misinformation and stigma means intersex people are still being harmed.”
Amnesty International is calling on the Icelandic government to put in place clear human rights guidelines and effective social support to ensure people with variations of sex characteristics can access the highest attainable standard of health.
It is estimated that there are around 6,000 people in Iceland with sex characteristics – genitals, gonads, hormones, chromosomes or reproductive organs – which vary from the established norms for ‘male’ and ‘female’. Amnesty International found evidence that in Iceland, people who are born with variations of sex characteristics struggle to access healthcare that is appropriate and centres on their human rights, which in some cases can cause lasting harm.
Individuals who spoke to Amnesty International reported that the lack of appropriate treatment had a detrimental impact on their quality of life for many years. In some cases, this was compounded by a lack of access to medical records, with people not being given full information about what was done to their bodies.
Kitty, an intersex activist who founded the organization Intersex Iceland, said:
“Good healthcare is so hard to get because we are seen as ‘disorders’ that need to be fixed… A lot of the health issues that arise are because of the treatment that we got as children. We wouldn’t have all these cases of osteopenia or osteoporosis if we hadn’t gone through gonadectomies as children and incompetent hormone therapy as teenagers.”
She added:
“I would like for these variations to be something as normal as anything else. I don’t want people to have to hide, to be ashamed. I want to see an understanding and acceptance that diversity exists and it’s good and fine.”
Amnesty International is calling on the government of Iceland to take concrete steps to protect and promote equality for individuals with variations of sex characteristics in law and practice. The upcoming Bill on Act on Sexual and Gender Autonomy presents an opportunity to address this. However, as currently drafted, it misses the opportunity to end medically unnecessary sex-“normalising” surgery, sterilisation and other treatments practised on intersex children without their informed consent.
Amnesty International is also calling on the Icelandic government to create a specialised, multidisciplinary team for the medical treatment of children and of adults with variations of sex characteristics. The organization is also calling on the Icelandic government to develop and implement a rights-based healthcare protocol for individuals with variations of sex characteristics to guarantee their bodily integrity, autonomy and self-determination. The government should ensure that no child is subjected to non-emergency, invasive and irreversible surgery or treatment with harmful effects.
Background
The terms used to refer to variations of sex characteristics are diverse, and in some cases, contentious. This report frequently uses the term ‘intersex’, which is widely used and with which many individuals with variations of sex characteristics globally self-identify. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with variations of sex characteristics identify as intersex.

Abdirahman, a popular Somaliland poet...","Permit Peaceful Expressions of Dissent
Somaliland authorities should immediately and unconditionally release from arbitrary detention Abdirahman Ibrahim Adan, a poet also known as “Abdirahman Abees,” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today.
Abdirahman, a popular Somaliland poet and British dual citizen, has been held at the central prison in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, for over a month, solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression.
Police officers arrested him on January 12, 2019 as he was having lunch at Hargeisa’s Lake Assal Hotel. The day before, he had recited a poem at the Mansoor Hotel that highlighted various human rights concerns in detention in Somaliland such as police brutality, arbitrary detention, and degrading treatment of prisoners.
According to Abdirahman’s lawyers, he was formally charged on February 18 under Article 269 of the Somaliland penal code for “insulting the police and the government”. On February 19, they appointed a judge and set an initial hearing date of February 21, 2019.
“Instead of harassing, intimidating and detaining critics, the Somaliland authorities should focus on investigating the mistreatment of detainees that Abdirahman describes in his poem. Somaliland authorities should end the crackdown on peaceful dissent and respect, protect and promote the right to freedom of expression of everyone in Somaliland,” said Sarah Jackson, deputy director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes at Amnesty International. 
Abdirahman’s lawyers said that the police did not produce an arrest warrant or any other court order allowing for his arrest. He was held at the Criminal Investigation Department’s Counter-Terrorism Unit for three days, then transferred to Hargeisa Central Police Station for one night, and then on to Hargeisa Central Prison, the lawyers said.
Before reciting his poem on January 11, Abdirahman told the audience that he had been detained briefly in February 2018 for being “arrogant” with police. He described his shock at the deplorable conditions in the police station and said he saw a woman whom he believed to have a mental condition in chains and four 14-year old boys accused of breaking a mirror being held with adults who had been arrested for murder and other serious offenses. Abdirahman said he had decided to write the poem because of that experience. The poem calls on the Somaliland government to reform its prisons and criminal justice systems.
On January 13, the deputy head of police, Abdirahman Liban Foohle, and the police spokesperson and the head of traffic police, Colonel Feysal Hiis Elmi, confirmed the arrest and detention. In a statement, the police accused the poet of “defaming the security forces and the state.”
Somaliland’s 2001 Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of expression and of the media in “accordance with the law.” But the penal code, which came into force in 1964, includes a number of vaguely defined and overly broad criminal offences, including offending the honor and prestige of the head of state, insulting a public officer or institution, or contempt against the nation, state or flag. These can be punished by sentences of up to three years in prison.
The Somaliland government has increased its clampdown on dissent since the current administration took office in December 2017. The authorities target poets, journalists and perceived critics – particularly those who speak out on alleged politically sensitive issues, including the border tensions with Puntland and unity with Somalia.
In April 2018, three people – Naima Ahmed Ibrahim, a popular poet; Mohamed Kayse Mohamud, a blogger; and Boqor Osman Aw-Mohamud, a traditional elder – were convicted under vague criminal provisions for public criticism of public officials and government policies. All three later received presidential pardons.
On February 10, the regional court in Hargeisa suspended the Foore newspaper for one year and fined the editor, Abdirashid Abdiwahab Ibrahim, three million Somaliland shillings (US$300) for publishing news about the building of a new presidential palace in Hargeisa. The newspaper was accused of spreading misinformation.
According to the Human Rights Center, a leading human rights organization in Somaliland, the Somaliland authorities arrested 28 journalists for their work or for social media posts in 2018 alone. This points to a worrying trend of restricting the right to freedom of expression in Somaliland.
“The Somaliland authorities should immediately and unconditionally release Abdirahman and allow public space for criticism, including on contentious issues such as detention conditions,” said Felix Horne, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The ongoing detention of Abdirahman and the broader crackdown on dissent fly in the face of Somaliland’s international obligations to freedom of expression.”

“Authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Maryam Aiwasu who has done nothing more than speaking up for women’s rights. Her arrest appears to be an attempt to intimidate and harass both her and other women supporting #ArewaMeToo – a movement seeking justice for victims of sexual violence in Nigeria.
“While arresting Maryam, the police attempted to gain access to her laptop and mobile phone by force; this is clearly an effort to access the sensitive evidence she and other human rights defenders have been gathering to seek justice for victims of sexual violence.
“Maryam and the other brave human rights defenders working with the #ArewaMeToo movement must not be silenced or punished for the vital work they do. For too long, Nigeria’s women have been facing various kinds of sexual violence that seldom receives proper attention from the country’s law enforcement agencies. It is unacceptable that women working on behalf of these victims are subjected to such arrest and intimidation, and we fear that these actions may prevent victims of sexual violence from pursuing justice.”

“President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s unfortunate comments are deeply troubling and unwarranted. Coming off the heels of Amnesty International’s expose of a systematic targeting of dissent during the national ‘stay-away’ period, they affirm that his government used security forces, including military personnel, to brutalize people who were protesting. This latest threat is a sinister hint that the situation could become even worse.
“If his government wants to build an inclusive country that is based on respect for human rights, President Mnangagwa should accommodate differing views, whether they please his government or not.”
Background
Amnesty International recently released a briefing that documented a systematic crackdown on dissent during the national stay-away between 14 and 16 January.
In it, the organization exposes a crackdown on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as the authorities sought to crush protests against fuel price hikes. In the process numerous serious human rights violations were perpetrated including killings and torture.

Equatorial Guinea named a French anti-corruption lawyer in an arrest warrant against 16 people, in apparent retaliation for his involvement in a money laundering trial against the president’s eldest son, nine human rights and anti-corruption groups said today.
The warrant accuses the 16 targets of laundering money and helping to finance “terrorism and the proliferation of arms trafficking in Central Africa.”
Named in the warrant are also people already in police custody accused of participating in a December 2017 coup attempt. They have been unable to communicate with their families or lawyers since their arrest, raising serious concern about their risk of torture and other ill treatment and in some cases their right to life, the organizations said.
“The Equatorial Guinean government has used every trick in the book to shield the president’s son from credible allegations of stealing more than €100 million (US$113 million) in public funds to live a life of luxury in Paris,” said Tutu Alicante, director of EG Justice, an organization that advocates human rights and transparency in Equatorial Guinea.
“Now it seems they are fabricating charges to retaliate against those who helped a French court convict him for his crimes.”
The groups are Human Rights Watch, EG Justice, Sherpa, Amnesty International, Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF), FIDH under the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, Corruption Watch UK, Rights and Accountability in Development, and World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) under the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
Equatorial Guinea’s National Security Ministry released a media statement on January 23 accusing the 16 people of money laundering and financing terrorism. The list included William Bourdon, the lawyer who founded the French anti-corruption legal advocacy group Sherpa, and spearheaded lawsuits in France against close relatives of several heads of state accused of embezzling public funds. The statement does not provide any evidence for its allegations.
“What we are seeing in Equatorial Guinea right now is not new but part of the government’s longstanding pattern of silencing critical voices. Officials regularly harass, intimidate, and arbitrarily detain human rights defenders, lawyers, political opposition members, and anyone else who dares speak out against government abuses,” said Marta Colomer, Amnesty International West Africa Campaigner.
In 2008, Sherpa filed a criminal complaint on behalf of Transparency International – France against Teodorin Nguema Obiang, the son of Equatorial Guinea’s president who at the time was the forestry minister, alleging he spent more than €100 million (US$113 million) stolen from the public treasury in France on a mansion, a fleet of supercars, art, jewelry, and other luxury goods. French law allows civil groups to file criminal complaints.
In 2017, the French court convicted Nguema Obiang in absentia, gave him a three-year suspended sentence and a €30 million (US$34 million) fine. The Equatorial Guinean government aggressively defended Nguema Obiang, going so far as to appoint him vice president soon after the court ordered the case to proceed to trial and suing France in the International Court of Justice, claiming that it had violated Nguema Obiang’s diplomatic immunity. The charges brought against the instigators of the trial appear to be an attempt to retaliate against them and further discredit the trial.
At least two of the people named in the arrest warrant, Onofre O. Otogo Ayecaba and Hector-Santiago Ela Mbang, were taken into police custody in Equatorial Guinea on 28 December 2017, a day after a failed coup. They were arrested along with dozens of others accused of participating in the coup. Their trial related to the coup is expected to take place over the coming weeks, although there are credible concerns that both men have been killed in custody. 
A lawyer representing Ela Mbang and nine other detainees told the organizations that no lawyers or family members have been permitted to communicate with them since their arrest, nor have their lawyers been kept apprised of legal developments in the case. Then on February 11, an independent news source reported that the family of Otogo Ayecaba received his body from the authorities.
Soon after Ela Mbang was arrested, he was made to go on state television and appear to implicate specific people in the coup. His lawyer said the government did not acknowledge detaining his client. He said he fears that Ela Mbang may now also be dead and that his name is on the arrest warrant to lay a foundation for the government to claim that he is not in custody, but is at large.
Credible allegations of torture and death in another recent case involving political opposition members heighten concern for these detainees. In December 2017, shortly after the coup attempt, police arrested 147 members of a political opposition group called Citizens for Innovation (CI), many of whom allege that they were tortured in detention. Two members died in detention, which lawyers familiar with the case allege was due to torture.
Some of the remaining 13 people included in the warrant from January 2019 are seeking asylum outside the country, while the whereabouts of others are unknown.
“Given the government’s dismal track record of abuse, the international community should be sounding alarm bells over the treatment of these detainees,” said Sarah Saadoun, a business and human rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.
“Foreign embassies in the country should demand to see the evidence justifying the arrest warrant and insist that lawyers be given access to the detainees already in custody. The embassies should monitor the case closely to ensure they receive fair trials.”

The organization has examined an official document which confirms there is an open-ended ban on family visits in a number of sections at two major prison complexes in Cairo and Alexandria.
Amnesty International has also recorded at least 61 cases of people who were prevented from receiving family visits for protracted periods – in some cases for up to two years –  at Tora prison in Cairo and Borg al-Arab in Alexandria. The total number of detainees barred from receiving family visits at these two prisons is likely to be much higher.
“Egypt’s arbitrary and unlawful restrictions on family visits are depriving scores of detainees of their rights to keep in touch with family members, and often also of the chance to receive medication, food or clothing from their loved ones during their detention,” said Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International’s North Africa Campaigns Director.
“The Egyptian prison authorities must urgently lift the cruel and punitive restrictions on family visits at Tora and Borg al-Arab. Such restrictions violate both Egyptian and international law and have detrimental effects on the psychological wellbeing of detainees and their relatives.”
The official prison document seen by Amnesty International lists a number of sections of the two prison complexes where detainees are not allowed family visits. These sections are known to house people being held in pre-trial detention and prisoners convicted for expressing their political opinions or otherwise exercising their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The total number of prisoners affected by the decision is not clear. 
Many of the detainees whose cases were recorded by Amnesty International were denied visits for several months at time. Some have not been allowed to see their families for up to two years. At least eight of them were allowed to receive one family visit recently.
Among those who have been denied family visits for years is former President Mohamed Morsi, who has only been allowed three visits since he was first detained more than five years ago. The last visit was in September for 25 minutes only. His son and a number of Muslim Brotherhood leaders and their families have also been denied family visits for years.
More recently, the authorities have also prevented a number of imprisoned activists from receiving family visits. The authorities recently denied family visits to human rights lawyer Mohamed Ramadan, political activist Shady al-Ghazali, former victim of enforced disappearance Islam Khalil and satirist Shady Abu Zeid. All are currently detained for peacefully expressing themselves.
“The profiles of detainees who have been targeted with these measures suggest the authorities’ use of restrictions on prison visits is politically motivated and is intended to deliberately punish political opponents and dissidents,” said Najia Bounaim. 
“Egypt has an obligation to treat detainees in its care humanely. There can be no justification for denying detainees contact with their families for prolonged periods of time.”
Amnesty International has previously noted that prison authorities frequently deprive prisoners in solitary confinement from family visits for prolonged periods of time and do not grant them any privacy during visits when these do take place.
Even when visits were allowed, former detainees told Amnesty International that these were often cut short. In some cases, the visit lasted only around two minutes. A number of detainees at both Tora and Borg al-Arab prisons also said there are no phone booths to use and the prison authorities do not provide any means for them to make phone calls.
In some cases, in addition to their psychological impact, Amnesty International’s research found that restrictions on family visits had a detrimental impact on detainees’ physical health as many prisoners rely on family members bringing them medication and winter clothes. 
Background:
Under international law and standards, including the Mandela Rules setting out minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners, banning family contact is prohibited. Restrictions imposed on the means of contact with family members may only be temporary and as strictly required for the maintenance of security and order.

“Despite today’s verdict, serious questions remain about whether all those responsible have been brought to justice. Myanmar’s authorities have shown time and again that they are unable to conduct credible investigations or ensure accountability, and this has perpetuated a climate of impunity in the country. This long and tortuous trial has done little to bring light to the assassination of one of the country’s most prominent lawyers. 
“Although no-one sentenced to capital punishment has been executed since 1988, we are disturbed that two of the defendants have been sentenced to death. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all circumstances and without exception.”  
Background 
Ko Ni was a prominent lawyer and adviser to Aung San Suu Kyi and her party the National League for Democracy. He was shot dead at Yangon airport in 29 January 2017 after returning from a leadership conference in Indonesia.
Four people were arrested and charged in connection with the assassination of Ko Ni. Gunman Kyi Lin and Aung Win Zaw, a former military officer who recruited him, were each sentenced to death after being found guilty of premeditated murder. Two other men were sentenced to five and three years in prison. A fifth suspect Aung Win Khine, a former military officer and the alleged mastermind of the assassination, has yet to be apprehended.
Kyi Lin also received a 20-year prison sentence after being found guilty of causing the death of taxi driver Ne Win, who was killed while attempting to apprehend the fleeing gunman.

According to promotional materials for the UAE’s IDEX2019 arms fair, the Minimi will be among the thousands of types of weapons available for sale. Manufactured in Belgium’s Wallonia region by FN Herstal, it is among an array of arms transferred by the Belgian Walloon authorities to the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led coalition in recent years for use in the armed conflict in Yemen.
An Amnesty International investigation last week documented the same weapon type being used by “The Giants,” a Yemeni militia that is backed and supplied by the UAE but not accountable to any government.
“It’s a jarring sight to have FN Herstal hawking the Minimi in the UAE after we exposed how the Emiratis illicitly gave this weapon to an unaccountable militia in Yemen,” said Patrick Wilcken, Arms Control and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International.
“The Belgian authorities and FN Herstal must not sell more weapons to any forces fighting in Yemen, and particularly the UAE – the very country that is recklessly siphoning off arms to fighting forces, some of which are committing war crimes in Yemen.”
The Minister-President of Belgium’s Walloon region, Willy Borsus, called for an investigation in response to Amnesty International’s findings last week.
“We are eager to see the outcome of this investigation soon and hope it will lead to policy changes that bring Wallonia in line with its international obligations. Under the Arms Trade Treaty and EU Common position on arms exports, Belgium has legal obligations not to transfer arms to the coalition fighting in Yemen,” said Philippe Hensmans, Director of Amnesty International Belgium Francophone. 
“Any states doing so are signalling that money speaks louder than their stated commitment to international law.”
According to publicly available data, since the outbreak of the Yemeni conflict in March 2015, Western states and others have supplied the UAE with at least US$3.5 billion worth of arms. Among them are heavy conventional weapons – including aircraft and ships – small arms, light weapons and associated parts and ammunition.
Despite the UAE and militias it backs being implicated in war crimes and other serious violations, the following states have recently supplied the Emiratis with arms: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Finland, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the USA, among others.
Arms and defence industry companies from all the above countries are displaying their wares at IDEX2019.
Amnesty International’s recent investigation documented some of these arms in the hands of “The Giants” and other unaccountable fighting forces in Yemen, including the Security Belt and Elite Forces. The proliferation of these groups is a recipe for disaster for Yemeni civilians who have already been killed in their thousands, while millions more are on the brink of famine as a direct result of the war.
“The ongoing carnage against civilians in Yemen – including at the hands of the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition and the militias it backs – should give serious pause to all states supplying arms,” said Patrick Wilcken.
“It beggars belief that they would continue to market and sell billions of dollars’ worth of advanced weaponry to armed forces that are committing war crimes and exacerbating the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.”
An Amnesty International campaign calls on its supporters around the world to demand that all states stop the flow of arms that are fuelling war crimes and serious human rights violations in Yemen.
Background
The International Defence Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) runs from 17-21 February. Held every two years in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, it bills itself as one of the biggest arms bazaars in the world.
According to Emirati state media, more than 1,300 exhibitors from 62 countries will be taking part in IDEX and its partner expo, NAVDEX. Exhibitors include other arms manufacturers whose goods have been seen in the hands of unaccountable militias in Yemen, including Bulgaria’s small arms manufacturer, Arsenal, and US armoured vehicle manufacturers Oshkosh and Navistar Defense. 
International arms fairs and exhibitions like IDEX are one of the main ways for governments and defence industry associations to promote and broker international sales of weapons, munitions, and other military and security equipment and services.

‘The European Parliament’s resolution on Saudi Arabia is an important step which acknowledges the incredible courage of these imprisoned men and women, several of whom have been tortured for demanding the end of the male guardianship system, campaigning for women’s right to drive and tirelessly defending human rights.’
‘After the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, EU High Representative Federica Mogherini assured the European Parliament that the EU would support human rights activists “regardless of geopolitics”. It is time for them to come good on this promise and speak out for Saudi detainees, as silent diplomacy has thus far failed to protect them.’
‘These brave women and men must be immediately and unconditionally released, together with all human rights defenders imprisoned for their peaceful activism in Saudi Arabia. Until that happens, the Saudi authorities must accept the European Parliament’s demand to give international monitors unrestricted access to them.’

Background
Amnesty International has collected credible information that several of the activists arbitrarily detained in the May 2018 crackdown were tortured, sexually harassed and otherwise ill-treated during the first three months of their detention.
Women human rights defenders Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Shadan al-Anezi and Nouf Abdulaziz among others remain in detention without charge and with no legal representation.
Activists have also reported the detention of other women’s rights activists and academics, including Mayaa al-Zahrani, Dr. Abir Namankani, Dr Ruqayyah al-Mharib and Dr. Hatoon al-Fassi.
Shi’a activist Israa al-Ghomgham and her male co-defendants, who are in prison for participation in peaceful protests, before the country’s counter-terror court. The public prosecution dropped the demand for Israa al-Ghomgham’s execution this month but the four men on trial, including her husband, still face the death penalty and she now faces a prison sentence for her peaceful activism.

We all have that one person we immediately connect with. Someone who you know will always be part of your life. The person you can easily talk to, even though it has been months if not years since you last saw one another. For me, Eman Al Nafjan is such a person. Someone I am proud of, who inspires and makes me laugh. 
We met in 2010 while I was living in Saudi Arabia. Eman introduced me to Saudi culture and cuisine, and taught me useful Arabic phrases. She took me around the magical souks in Riyadh.
We used to spend hours discussing all aspects of life. At that time, she was working as an English teacher at a university while completing her PhD in linguistics. Since 2010, our tradition has been to meet once a year to enjoy new places, visit museums and catch up. We are both morning people, but Eman is up earlier than most. Even on holiday, I would often find her sitting at a table, very early in the morning, with a cup of strong coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other.
Last May, Eman was detained by Saudi authorities along with Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, and four other women’s rights activists for promoting social rights.
Eman is open-minded and loves to push boundaries no matter the risks. Even when she disagrees with someone, it is always possible to talk to her openly. She is a scholar with a thirst for knowledge and culture. She is the mother of four children, the eldest a teenager and the youngest only a toddler. She is a loving mother who puts her children first. Caring and worrying about them like mothers do. Wanting them to see the world and its cultures. Teaching them to be good, kind people. She has been a source of advice and inspiration in my own motherhood. Once, she read a picture book to my young child, improvising a story about the importance of sharing. That is who Eman is and what she stands for: justice, kindness and love. Eman does not like to be apart from her children, especially when they are very young. That is why her arrest is heart-wrenching. It is distressing to know that she has been forcibly separated from her children for seven months, missing out on many important milestones for each child.
Despite having children, she invests much of her time and energy in causes bigger than herself and in promoting social rights. She started her blog Saudiwoman.me in 2008, two years before we met. It was her platform to air her opinions about society. As Iman herself writes, she is proud of Saudi Arabia, its history and accomplishments. Her aim was to correct misunderstandings and talk about the Saudi society. She is a strong woman with a sharp pen, which quickly led to attention and requests from international media, including The Guardian, Foreign Policy, New York Times and others.
I am writing this because I want the world to know who Eman al Nafjan is. A kind, beautiful soul who has been wrongly detained. The seriousness of the baseless allegations and the media campaign against her is worrying. Peaceful campaigning and freedom of speech are never a crime. More worrying is the horrible news about torture and the condition of many women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia today. Their lives are in danger. 
I am concerned about Eman’s wellbeing. I think about her every day. Especially in the evening, when I can kiss my children good night, knowing Eman misses out on kissing hers.
Eman, the world has not forgotten about you. You might be silenced, but we will continue to speak up for you until you are released and reunited with your children again.
T.K. (full name not used) is writing this supporting piece for Amnesty International Norway’s campaign to free the Saudi women who have been imprisoned since May 2018. 
Today the European Parliament will hold an urgent debate on the situation facing women’s human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia.
Amnesty International has urged EU countries to end their silence on Saudi Arabia’s systematic violations and to call for the immediate release of these brave women’s rights defenders.

“Just days after the National Bureau of Investigation announced that it will indict Maria Ressa for cyber libel, a warrant for her arrest was served today. Amnesty International Philippines condemns the arrest based on a trumped-up libel charge. This is brazenly politically motivated, and consistent with the authorities’ threats and repeated targeting of Ressa and her team. Authorities should end this harassment, drop the charges, and repeal this repressive law.
“In a country where justice takes years to obtain, we see the charges against her being railroaded and the law being used to relentlessly intimidate and harass journalists for doing their jobs as truth-tellers.”
Background
On 29 May 2012 Rappler published a story, written by former reporter Reynaldo Santos Jr., alleging that a car used by former Chief Justice Renato Corona during his impeachment trial belonged to a businessman, Wilfredo Keng, who has alleged ties to human trafficking and drug smuggling rings.
On 10 January 2018, Keng filed a “cyber libel” complaint against Santos, Maria Ressa, and six members of Rappler’s board of directors under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. The National Bureau of Investigation subsequently dismissed the complaint because the report preceded the enactment of this law.
In a January 2019 decision obtained by Rappler this week, the Department of Justice revived the charges against Ressa and Santos, as well as Rappler Inc., on the grounds that the news article was updated in February 2014, and is therefore actionable.
Maria Ressa and Rappler Inc are already facing charges of tax evasion which Amnesty has condemned as politically-motivated. Rappler has been a consistent critic of President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration, publishing detailed investigations into some of the thousands of extrajudicial executions committed by police and other unknown armed persons during drug-related operations.

“These legislative initiatives put at risk the progress of the last decade in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations in Guatemala. These advances have been possible thanks to the valiant and tireless efforts of the victims, their legal representatives, prosecutors and the people and civil society organizations that defend human rights. These laws would also put in doubt the future of the fight against impunity,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
The possible approval of law 5257, under discussion for the third time, which proposes amending the Law on Non-Governmental Organizations for Development, constitutes a threat to the rights to freedom of expression and association in Guatemala. It would impose excessive controls and onerous requirements for the registration and operation of NGOs in the country.
It would also grant broad powers to the government to permanently suspend the activities of an NGO for reasons such as “disturbance of public order,” an ambiguous term whose interpretation could lead to the arbitrary closure of civil society organizations and worsening criminalization through the imposition of criminal sanctions against the human rights defenders that work in them.
“In the context of repeated acts of stigmatization, smear campaigns and other constant attacks by private actors and the Guatemalan authorities against organizations and human rights defenders, law 5257 seems to be another attempt to hinder the work of those who work for justice and human rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
The proposed law 5377, which will be debated for the second time, would grant amnesty to those accused of serious crimes committed during the country’s internal armed conflict – such as genocide, torture and enforced disappearances – in violation of Guatemala’s international obligations not to let such acts go unpunished. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and other international human rights bodies have reiterated that amnesties for crimes under international law or serious human rights violations are incompatible with states’ obligations to investigate, prosecute and punish those responsible for these crimes.
After decades of impunity, in 2008 the first cases of human rights violations committed during the internal armed conflict were brought to justice, resulting in the conviction of at least 30 former military commanders, military commissioners and former members of the Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil (PAC) for the crimes of torture, enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, sexual violence and sexual slavery.
Despite the advances made in these historical trials, to date thousands of victims are still waiting for justice in Guatemala. If law 5377 is approved, ongoing investigations into these crimes would be suspended, and those convicted by Guatemalan courts during the last decade would be released within 24 hours.
“Law 5377 represents a serious threat to the rights of thousands of victims of the country’s internal armed conflict to learn the truth and to obtain justice for the atrocities that they and their families suffered. Moreover, the release of convicted persons would place at grave risk those who participated in these historic trials, including the victims, witnesses, their legal representatives, experts and prosecutors,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
Instead of approving laws 5257 and 5377, which would bring serious setbacks in the struggle for justice and human rights, Amnesty International calls on Guatemala’s Congress to guarantee the rights of victims of human rights violations and ensure a safe environment for the human rights defenders who support them every day.

The executions brought the total number of executions in Egypt to six within a span of two weeks.
Responding to the news, Amnesty International’s North Africa Campaigns Director Najia Bounaim said:
“These executions, which come just days after three other people were put to death in separate cases, mark an alarming escalation in executions so far this year.
“The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and its use is appalling under any circumstances, but it is even more so given that all six execution
victims were sentenced based on confessions they said were extracted under torture. The shocking flaws in Egypt’s justice system have seen hundreds sentenced to death after grossly unfair trials in recent years.
“The Egyptian authorities should stop all further executions and immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty completely.”
Background:
On 13 February Egyptian authorities put to death three people who were convicted of killing a police officer in Kerdasa, Giza on 19 September 2013.  One of the three men convicted was forcibly disappeared for three days before appearing before a prosecutor and being charged. The lawyers of all the defendants claimed that the men were tortured into confessing to the murder.
On 7 February Egyptian authorities executed three men who had been sentenced to death, in a politically motiva
ted case, for the killing of a judge’s son in the town of Mansoura in 2014. The men said they had been tortured into confessing to the crime.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, or method of execution.

“The passing of the Medivac Bill is a welcome step towards humanity for the refugees on Manus and Nauru. It is reassuring that public opinion is finally being reflected in parliament through the many people that fought so hard to get the bill through.
“In Hakeem’s case the Australian government recognised this and worked hard to ensure he was returned to Australia. But many other people with the same recognised refugee status as Hakeem remain detained in terrible conditions on Manus and Nauru.
“Most of the people on Manus Island and Nauru are recognised refugees who have proven their lives would be in danger if they were returned to their countries of origin. You can’t demonise the refugees on Manus and Nauru on one hand while welcoming others and praising their contribution to Australia.
“We are disappointed by the announcement today that Christmas Island is to reopen. We have seen time and time again that offshore processing is broken and creating yet another offshore centre for sick refugees will not fix the issue. Re-opening Christmas Island is nothing short of a cruel and unnecessary political stunt

Esther Kiobel, Victoria Bera, Blessing..."," Dutch court will today hear the first arguments in an historic case against Shell, in which the oil giant stands accused of instigating a raft of horrifying human rights violations committed by the Nigerian government against the Ogoni people in the 1990s. Esther Kiobel, Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula are suing Shell over what they say is its role in the unlawful arrest, detention and execution of their husbands by the Nigerian military, following a brutal crackdown on Ogoni protests against Shell’s devastating pollution of the region.
“Over the years, Shell has continually fought to make sure the this case is not heard in court. They have the resources to fight me instead of doing justice for my husband,” said Esther Kiobel.
Amnesty International, which is supporting the plaintiffs and legal team bringing the case, has independently documented Shell’s role in killings, rape and torture carried out by the Nigerian government in its effort to crush protests. Barinem Kiobel, Baribor Bera, Nordu Eawo and Paul Levula were hanged in 1995 after a sham trial. Their widows are now demanding compensation and a public apology from Shell. Five other men, including protest leader Ken Saro-Wiwa, were executed alongside them and they have become collectively known as the Ogoni Nine.
“This will be the first time, in a battle for justice spanning more than two decades, that Esther Kiobel and her fellow plaintiffs get the chance to tell their stories in court. These women believe that their husbands would still be alive today were it not for the brazen self-interest of Shell, which encouraged the Nigerian government’s bloody crackdown on protesters even when it knew the human cost,” said Mark Dummett, Business and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Despite a cache of evidence against Shell, the company has managed to dodge justice for years and until now has never had to answer in court for these allegations. Tomorrow is an historic moment which has huge significance for people everywhere who have been harmed by the greed and recklessness of global corporations.”
Taking a powerful multinational to court for harm it has caused overseas is an agonizingly long process. Esther Kiobel first filed a case against Shell in New York in 2002, but in 2013 the US Supreme Court ruled that the US did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. This meant that the US courts never got to examine  the substance of the allegations against Shell.
The four plaintiffs accuse Shell of being instrumental in the unlawful arrest and detention of their husbands; the violation of their husbands’ physical integrity; the violation of their right to a fair trial and to life, and their own right to a family life. Amnesty International supported Esther Kiobel’s legal team to bring the case to the Netherlands in 2017, and detailed Shell’s role in the arrests and executions in a briefing, In The Dock.  The plaintiffs are also calling for the court to order Shell to hand over more than 100,000 internal documents crucial to the case. Shell’s lawyers have refused to do so, even though these documents were submitted as evidence in the US case.
“It’s time to bring an end to decades of impunity for Shell,” said Mark Dummett.
“These women’s courage, resilience and determination to clear their husband’s names and bring Shell to account is inspirational. They have the support of Amnesty International activists all over the world.” 
For a full background to the case see Amnesty’s briefing In The Dock. For more information about Esther Kiobel’s battle for justice see One Woman Vs Shell
The hearing will take place at the District Court of The Hague on 12 February.

There have been several instances of violence at election campaign rallies in some states in recent months, including the deaths of four people in Kano state in clashes between rival political supporters in December 2018.
“The election-related violence in states such as Kano, Kwara, Kogi, Rivers, Taraba and Bayelsa is deeply troubling and, if not urgently addressed, will undermine respect for human rights throughout the election period,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.
“Amnesty International has received reports of supporters of some politicians violently targeting political opponents, real or perceived. The authorities must stamp out any potential impunity by ensuring these incidents are investigated and that those suspected to be responsible are brought to justice.”
In other pre-election violence, one person was killed and many were injured when an All Progressives Congress (APC) rally in Sagbama, Bayelsa state turned violent on 3 February.
Previously, a 12-hour curfew was imposed in Wukari, Taraba state last month following violent clashes between supporters of the APC and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the two main political parties.
“Authorities must put in place measures to ensure politicians and their supporters do not infringe on human rights. They must make clear that there is zero-tolerance for human rights violations and that anyone suspected of wrongdoing will be brought to justice,” said Osai Ojigho.
Recently, a PDP politician in Kaduna was caught on video asking his supporters to attack anyone who voted for a different political party in a volatile southern part of the state.
“The authorities must fully investigate all allegations of incitement to violence and other human rights abuses before, during and after the elections and ensure that suspected perpetrators are brought to justice,” said Osai Ojigho.
“Political parties and candidates must publicly condemn any advocacy of hatred or incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.
“The authorities must also ensure that international and national civil society groups and agencies that will monitor the elections are able to do so in safety.”

The Kenyan police and the South Sudanese authorities should ensure effective, transparent and impartial investigations into the enforced disappearance of two South Sudanese critics in Nairobi more than two years ago, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today.
On January 17, 2019, a Kenyan High Court ended its 24-month oversight of the police investigation into the disappearances of Dong Samuel Luak, a prominent South Sudanese lawyer and human rights activist, and Aggrey Idri, a member of the political opposition. They were snatched off the streets of Nairobi on January 23 and 24, 2017 respectively. The families had initiated the petition for judicial review following concerns that the Kenyan Police had not effectively investigated.
“The families of Dong Samuel Luak and Aggrey Ezbon Idri have waited patiently for the truth for two years, their lives in limbo,” said Jehanne Henry, associate Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “But this decision which lets Kenyan police off the hook, risks sending this case into oblivion and denying the families justice.”
The men’s disappearance is believed by their families and many who follow South Sudanese politics to be the result of collusion between South Sudan and Kenya, but both governments have denied having custody of the men, or knowledge of their whereabouts.
The Kenyan police have not officially requested information from the South Sudan government, nor has South Sudan’s government investigated the disappearances or officially requested information about the case from the Kenyan authorities.
Soon after the men were forcibly disappeared, their families filed a case before a Kenyan High Court seeking a writ of habeas corpus, to require the government to produce them in court. The court denied that petition, saying it could not establish that Luak and Idri were in custody but that a “criminal abduction by unknown persons” had taken place and that the police should thoroughly investigate the matter.
However, police investigations stalled. On April 20, 2017, the families sought judicial review and an order to the police to investigate the disappearance of the two men more thoroughly. In the following months, the court noted gaps in the police investigation, including the failure to seek information from the South Sudanese authorities and to interview witnesses and Kenya’s intelligence service. At a hearing on February 5, 2018, the police said they could not access some of the witnesses and they had no further leads but would keep the file open.
But the January 17, 2019 final judgement dismissing the petition stated that the police had acted “prudently and within the law.” The court said it is required to respect the police approach and timeline, and that families should pursue alternative administrative remedies such as filing a complaint with the Internal Police Oversight Authority. The decision ends any judicial oversight into the police action on the case.
“How long will this charade go on as the families of Luak and Idri continue to languish in agony over their loved ones?” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
Credible sources told both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch that they had seen both men in National Security Service (NSS) detention in Juba, South Sudan, on January 25 and 26, 2017. Information from South Sudan indicates that the men were moved from there on January 27 to an unknown location. Human rights organizations have documented the many serious human rights violations by NSS agents, including unlawful detention, ill-treatment, torture, and death in custody.
There have been more reports from former detainees corroborating that Dong and Aggrey were in South Sudanese custody in January 2017. In late 2018, a former detainee, William Endley, told the media that he had seen Aggrey and that others had confirmed seeing Dong at the prison in the NSS headquarters. But South Sudan’s government has remained silent and failed to investigate these reports.
If the two men are in the agency’s custody, as evidence strongly suggests, they are both at risk of abuse, including torture, the organizations said.
Dong was a registered refugee in Kenya, where he had lived since August 2013. Aggrey relocated to Kenya on a visitor’s pass after the conflict in South Sudan broke out in mid-December 2013 and was legally in the country at the time of his disappearance. Any acquiescence or cooperation by Kenyan authorities to the forced return of either man to South Sudan is a serious violation of Kenya’s international obligations. 
This is not the first time that a South Sudanese refugee was forcibly disappeared from Kenyan territory, with the apparent agreement of the Kenyan government, and illegally returned to South Sudan. In December 2017, South Sudanese political opposition official, Marko Lokidor Lochapo was forcibly disappeared from the Kakuma refugee camp. He was detained without charge in the notorious “Blue House” detention facility in Juba until October 25, 2018.
In November 2016, Kenya deported James Gatdet Dak, then the spokesman for South Sudan’s political opposition, to South Sudan under great protest. Gatdet was subsequently sentenced to death by hanging for treason but pardoned on October 31, 2018. Gatdet’s account of his illegal deportation confirms collaboration between the highest levels of the Kenyan and South Sudanese governments.
The South Sudanese government’s inaction and unwillingness to investigate the disappearances and the status and whereabouts of Dong and Aggrey is an abdication of its binding legal obligations, demonstrates total disregard for the men’s fundamental rights, and exacerbates their families’ concerns, the organizations said.
“My biggest fear is to become a widow,” said Aya Benjamin, Idri’s wife. “When I think about it, my heart hurts. We are limited in our daily lives and usual activities and I have become depressed. I am not as hopeful as I was two years ago.”
“Dong’s disappearance has psychologically affected all of us especially his four daughters. He is their best friend,” said Polit James, Dong’s younger brother. “The hardest question I face is ‘Where is daddy? When is he coming home?’ You sometimes find them crying and writing emotional letters in their notebooks.”

Constitutional arrangements are no excuse for inadequate or delayed action.
Climate change negatively impacts a range of human rights – civil, cultural, economic, political and social – and if not addressed urgently these impacts, which are already affecting millions of people across the planet including in Canada, will result in even more devastating harm on a massive scale. A recent report from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that not exceeding a global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels is an absolute imperative to avoid the worst consequences for human rights in the coming years. The UN Panel further warns that the world has only 12 years to halve carbon emissions in order to reach that 1.5°C target. The message is therefore clear: governments need to take effective and concrete action with no further delays.
As part of its climate change strategy the Canadian government has required all provinces and territories to implement a price on carbon by 2019. Saskatchewan’s plan only partially meets the required federal standard and therefore the province will be subject to a carbon pricing system imposed by the federal government. The government of Saskatchewan will be before the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal this week in a case which will determine whether the federally-imposed carbon tax is constitutional. The governments of Ontario and New Brunswick are intervening in support of Saskatchewan’s position that it is not constitutional. The government of British Columbia is supporting the federal government’s assertion that it is.
Given its impact on human rights, governments have binding legal obligations – in addition to meeting their commitments under the Paris Agreement – to address climate change, including by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They must do so as quickly and effectively as possible, while also ensuring that their efforts fully respect and protect human rights. Carbon pricing, including carbon taxes, is among the strategies that can help to meet those obligations.
Careful policy design is necessary to ensure that vulnerable populations who are already struggling to make ends meet are not disproportionately affected by such policies. For example, to prevent regressive effects on low-income households, a portion of carbon pricing revenues can be passed on to low-income families in the form of a rebate. The Canadian government claims that almost all families in Saskatchewan will end up with more money in their pockets, and low-income families will benefit most. That promise would need to be rigorously monitored to ensure that carbon pricing does not deepen inequality in one of the world’s wealthiest countries, where too many people are living in poverty. In addition, mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that up-front payments related to the carbon tax do not put excessive burdens on low-income households.
To meet their human rights obligations, government authorities at all levels must, as a matter of urgency, fully cooperate with each other and not unfairly block or obstruct efforts to move forward with emissions reductions. Furthermore, living up to those obligations must not in any way be unduly hampered or impeded by relying on constitutional arrangements with respect to the division of powers between different levels of government. What matters is those in power working together to reduce carbon emissions, uphold human rights and tackle climate change; and doing it immediately, effectively and cooperatively.
Additionally, to be effective in mitigating climate change, carbon pricing needs to be combined with removal of subsidies to the fossil fuel sector as a matter of priority. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Canada provides hundreds of millions of dollars in fossil fuel subsidies.
While Canada’s carbon pricing plan is expected to substantially reduce the country’s carbon emissions, it will not be enough to achieve the country’s emission reduction targets, which are already considered insufficient to meet the objective of avoiding exceeding a global warming level of 1.5°C. Therefore, governments at all levels in Canada must take further initiatives to reduce carbon emissions and increase their emission reduction commitments for 2030, in line with the Paris Agreement and their human rights obligations.
If governments fail to act effectively to curb climate change, it could result in widespread violations of multiple human rights including the right to life, right to health, right to water, right to food, the right to housing and the rights of Indigenous peoples. The clock is ticking. It is not the time for political and constitutional disagreements among different levels of government in Canada. It is the time for unified action.

As I arrive in Bangladesh, joining an Amnesty International delegation that is here for two weeks to meet with and hear from Rohingya refugees in the country, a specific question comes to mind. In this world of ours – a world marked of late by far too much conflict, hate and division – when and why is a crisis no longer seen to be a crisis? 
In a world which feels to have an ever-shortening attention span and seems only able to give real attention to two or three emergencies at once, we forget and move on from today’s or this week’s crisis more quickly than ever. 
Meanwhile, politicians regularly bandy the word crisis about to inflame tensions and score political points when it isn’t a crisis by any measure; be it Donald Trump’s manufactured border wall crisis or the overblown rhetoric around a supposed-influx of refugees crossing the Canada/US border. We see quick resort to the word crisis in those situations, largely to undermine support for refugee protection. 
That certainly describes the circumstances faced by the Rohingya people. No longer on the front page. Not at the top of everyone’s Facebook feeds. No upcoming special meetings at the UN Human Rights Council or Security Council. 
And that is a key reason why we are here. 
In the fall of 2017, international attention (including in Canada) was transfixed on the massive human rights and humanitarian crisis that was unleashed when Myanmar’s security forces mounted an unrelenting campaign of attacks against Rohingya villages. It was by no means the first episode of cruelty the Rohingya have endured at the hands of the military and even the public in Myanmar; as the systemic, deliberate discrimination they face, enshrined in law, goes back decades and is so entrenched as to constitute the international crime of apartheid. But it was, by far, the very worst, ever. 
Within only a few months, 700,000 Rohingya had fled across the border into Bangladesh, joining some 300,000 refugees who have fled there in previous years, such that Bangladesh, an already over-crowded country with a high proportion of the population living in poverty, is now sheltering one million Rohingya refugees. And some eighteen months after the violence and attacks that forced them from their homes, there has been no improvement on the ground in Myanmar, no renewed sense of dignity and protection, and no prospect of being able to return home safely in the foreseeable future. Quite the contrary, we have documented fresh attacks by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State in recent weeks, including shelling villages, blocking access to food aid and detaining civilians. 
Conditions in the refugee camps are extremely difficult. That we know even before we arrive in the Cox’s Bazar region of Bangladesh. The levels of funding that UN agencies and humanitarian organizations receive from donor governments are far below what is needed. Prospects for education and livelihoods in refugee communities are minimal at best. And there have been off and on suggestions that the Bangladesh and Myanmar governments may be readying to encourage refugees to return. Sounds like a serious, continuing crisis. 
Over these two weeks we will hear directly from Rohingya refugees living in the camps – from elders and from the young, from women and men, and from those who have been here for many years and others perhaps only for a few months. 
Above all we will listen to their experiences; and what action is needed to ensure their rights are respected and upheld. 
What, of course, needs to happen in Myanmar, including justice and accountability for those responsible for this crisis, such that conditions improve, and safe and voluntary return is possible? 
What is lacking in the camps, be it measures to improve safety for women and girls, provide schooling for children, or institute support and livelihood programs for refugees, all with an eye to recognizing that this is a crisis that is not ending anytime soon? 
What about impending worries such as returns to Myanmar or relocation elsewhere in Bangladesh, including possible plans to turn a low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal into a refugee camp? 
What about the role of the international community? How to generate more financial assistance, to meet short term needs but also longer-term development? And what about the possibility of resettlement opportunities for some refugees, to Canada and elsewhere? 
And all of this in a world which has, to put it mildly, shown less compassion and understanding and more fear and punishment to refugees as of late. 
For Amnesty, the bottom line is how to strengthen solidarity with Rohingya still in Myanmar and the one million living as refugees in Bangladesh – from Canada and elsewhere around the world – in the face of a crisis that is, yes, absolutely still exactly that.

With the newly formed Lebanese government setting its agenda focused on the economy and the fight against corruption, the authorities must prioritize human rights and address the issues that are essential to ensuring a more just and equitable future for the people in the country, said Amnesty International.
“For too long, people have suffered the consequences of political deadlock and a lack of accountability, which in turn have contributed to ongoing violations of human rights, including the economic and social rights of the vast majority of the population,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Research.
Amnesty International has identified nine core issues which are essential to tackling human rights violations in Lebanon. These include upholding the rights of women, LGBTQI people, refugees and migrant domestic workers, protecting freedom of expression and abolishing the death penalty.
“For the first time in years, Lebanon finally has an elected parliament and a cabinet. It is high time decision-makers engage in meaningful reforms prioritizing the public interest. Authorities have a responsibility to respect, protect and the fulfil the human rights of the people in the country and ensure a more just and equitable future for everyone,” said Lynn Maalouf.

Operation involves units responsible for past atrocities
5,200 civilians displaced since December 
Myanmar security forces have shelled villages and blocked civilians from accessing food and humanitarian assistance in Rakhine State, Amnesty International said today, amid a crackdown since armed attacks by the Arakan Army in early January. Security forces have also used vague and repressive laws to detain civilians in the area.
“These latest operations are yet another reminder that the Myanmar military operates without any regard for human rights. Shelling inhabited villages and withholding food supplies are unjustifiable under any circumstances,” said Tirana Hassan, Director of Crisis Response at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International has received reports that army divisions involved in atrocities against the Rohingya in August and September 2017 have been deployed to Rakhine State again in recent weeks.
“Despite international condemnation of the Myanmar military’s atrocities, all evidence suggests that they are brazenly committing yet more serious abuses,” said Tirana Hassan.
These violations come after a UN Fact-Finding Mission called for the criminal investigation and prosecution of senior Myanmar officials for crimes under international law against the Rohingya population in Rakhine State, and against ethnic minorities in Kachin and northern Shan States.
Arakan Army attacks
On 4 January 2019 – Myanmar’s Independence Day – an ethnic Rakhine armed group known as the Arakan Army carried out coordinated attacks on four police posts in northern Rakhine State, reportedly killing 13 police officers. The Arakan Army has fought the military as part of an alliance of armed groups in northern Myanmar and, as it has moved its attention to Chin and Rakhine State in recent years, has clashed sporadically with security forces there.
Days after the 4 January attacks, Myanmar’s civilian government instructed the military to launch an operation to “crush” the Arakan Army, which the government spokesperson referred to as a “terrorist organization”. The military has since moved considerable assets and troops into the region, which local activists and media reports have said include soldiers from the 99th Light Infantry Division (LID). Amnesty International and others implicated that division in atrocities against the Rohingya in 2017 and against ethnic minorities in northern Shan State in 2016.
According to the UN, more than 5,200 men, women and children had been displaced by the ongoing fighting by 28 January. They are overwhelmingly from predominantly Buddhist ethnic minorities, including the Mro, Khami, Daingnet and Rakhine.
Amnesty International interviewed by telephone 11 people affected by the fighting, as well as humanitarian officials and local activists in Rakhine State. Most said they fled their villages after the security forces shelled nearby or placed restrictions on food.
Unlawful attacks
Three people from Auk Pyin Nyar, a predominantly ethnic Mro village in Tha Lu Chaung village tract, Kyauktaw Township, told Amnesty International that two artillery or mortar shells exploded within a hundred metres of their village on 21 December 2018. As the villagers fled early the following morning, they heard more shells exploding nearby.
“I heard the explosions of heavy artillery and people even got dizzy,” a 64-year-old farmer recalled.
Another farmer from the same village, who returned days later to collect some belongings, said money was stolen from houses after people fled. He blamed Myanmar soldiers, who were seen in and around the village at the time.
A 24-year-old man from a predominantly ethnic Mro village in Tha Yet Pyin village tract, Buthidaung Township, similarly described hearing artillery or mortar shells exploding around his village on 13 January 2019. The villagers fled to the local monastery and then, later that day, to an informal displaced persons camp in Done Thein village, in neighbouring Kin Taung village tract. The man returned to his village four days later, to collect family registration documents, and saw damage to some houses in the village, as well as the local school. He said money had been taken from some houses, at a time when the Myanmar security forces controlled access to the village.
Media reports have detailed several other incidents. The Irrawaddy and Radio Free Asia reported that a seven-year-old boy named Naing Soe was critically injured when an artillery shell exploded near his home in Tha Mee Ha village tract, Rathedaung Township, around 26 January 2019. Radio Free Asia said that the Myanmar military fired into the village after soldiers triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) nearby. Both news outlets reported that the Myanmar military looted valuables from the village. The Irrawaddy also reported that on 16 January 2019, two brothers, aged 18 and 12, were seriously injured when an artillery shell exploded by their house in Maungdaw Township.
Although Amnesty International could not definitively determine the Myanmar military’s responsibility for each individual attack that injured civilians or damaged or destroyed civilian property, such unlawful tactics have long been a hallmark of the military’s operations against armed groups. In a June 2017 report, Amnesty International documented in detail indiscriminate shelling by the Myanmar military during its operations in Kachin and northern Shan States, which killed and injured civilians and displaced thousands.
“These unlawful attacks are sowing fear in many villages,” said Tirana Hassan. “Hundreds, if not thousands, of civilians have been displaced from their homes as a direct result.”
Restrictions on food and aid access
A 34-year-old woman from a remote ethnic Mro village in Kyauktaw Township told Amnesty International that Myanmar soldiers and police restricted the amount of rice that could be brought to her village. The villagers were already experiencing shortages of basic food supplies, as the fighting that erupted nearby in December 2018 prevented them from harvesting rice or bamboo, a key cash crop.
As the situation worsened, a group of people from the village, including the 34-year-old woman, went to a police station and military checkpoint near Taung Min Ku Lar village to request permission to carry rice back to their village. She said the security forces told them they could bring a maximum of six pyi (a Burmese unit equivalent to a 2.56-litre container) of rice and would need an authorization letter from the security forces.
“We talked among ourselves that it was impossible to live in our village anymore,” she told Amnesty International. “We didn’t want to move to a [displaced persons] camp, but we couldn’t trade what we found in the forest, and we couldn’t get through enough supplies.”
The village emptied, as did several neighbouring villages facing similar circumstances.
A local activist told Amnesty International that he had helped obtain recommendation letters from the police to allow people to move around Kyauktaw Township, but the authorities are still stopping people from carrying food, claiming that it is to curtail supply lines to the Arakan Army.
The Myanmar authorities have also imposed further restrictions on humanitarian access in Rakhine State. On 10 January, the Rakhine State government barred all UN agencies and international humanitarian organizations, except the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and World Food Programme (WFP), from operating in five conflict-affected townships. Many organizations have had to stop their humanitarian assistance, undermining emergency response and relief efforts in one of Myanmar’s poorest and most underdeveloped regions.
The Rakhine State authorities have, along with ICRC and WFP, provided some cash and in-kind assistance to people displaced by the fighting, but recipients described it as insufficient and inconsistent. Several humanitarian officials said the restrictions also seem to be a way to keep international eyes off the military’s operations.
Use of abusive laws and possible arbitrary detention
The Myanmar security forces also appear to be using abusive laws to detain and prosecute civilians for allegedly supporting the Arakan Army, raising concerns about arbitrary detention and potential ill-treatment.
In the days after the 13 January 2019 fighting in Tha Yet Pyin village tract, police took in an ethnic Mro village leader, Aung Tun Sein, and at least 10 other men for questioning. They were subsequently released, but, several days later, Aung Tun Sein was summoned to a Border Guard Police (BGP) post. He has been in detention since, currently in Buthidaung jail.
In a June 2018 report, Amnesty International documented torture and other inhuman treatment against Rohingya men and boys held in BGP posts in northern Rakhine State.
Family members and other village leaders were unable to determine Aung Tun Sein’s whereabouts for more than a week after he was detained. The military has reportedly accused him of informing the Arakan Army about the military’s movements. A person from the village said Aung Tun Sein was facing charges under the Unlawful Associations Act, a vague and repressive law that the Myanmar authorities often use to prosecute activists, journalists, and others in conflict areas.
Local activists and media reports suggest that arbitrary detentions and the use of vague and repressive laws have been commonplace during the latest military operation in Rakhine State. The Irrawaddy reported that 26 people were arrested on 4 February for alleged unlawful association with the Arakan Army. They also reported that around 30 village administrators submitted resignation letters in January, out of concern they might be wrongly prosecuted for unlawful association.

In a new report, Côte d’Ivoire:...","Authorities in Côte d’Ivoire must end arbitrary arrests and harassment of people for perceived critical views and dissent, and immediately and unconditionally release those detained, Amnesty International said as next year’s presidential elections approaches.
In a new report, Côte d’Ivoire: A fragile human rights situation, submitted ahead of the country’s UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in May, the organization highlights key human rights concerns including the use of repressive laws to crackdown on dissent.
“The Ivorian authorities’ use of repressive laws amid a crackdown on the right to freedom of expression has resulted in the arbitrary detention of scores of people simply for peacefully exercising their human rights,” said François Patuel, Amnesty International’s West Africa Researcher.
“As next year’s presidential election approaches, the authorities should take immediate action to ensure people can freely express their opinion without fearing arrest. They must respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights before, during and after the election.”
At least 17 journalists have been arbitrarily detained in the last five years while the National Council of the Press has repeatedly sanctioned newspapers with suspensions and hefty fines. It has particularly targeted publications expressing perceived critical views about the authorities and close to opposition groups.
On 12 February 2017, six journalists were arrested and detained in Abidjan for their coverage of the mutinies. They were denied access to a lawyer while in police custody and subsequently charged with “publishing false news” and “inciting soldiers to mutiny”. They were released on 14 February 2017 but remained under police investigation.
Besides the journalists, political opponents and bloggers are also judicially harassed simply for expressing their opinion. On 29 January 2019, Alain Lobognon a Member of Parliament was charged with dissemination of false information and incitement to revolt and sentenced to one year in jail with a fine of around 460 Euros (300,000 Cfa).

Peaceful assemblies organized by civil society organizations and opposition groups are regularly banned and dispersed with excessive use of force by the police and gendarmerie.
On 22 August 2018, the security forces dispersed a peaceful assembly organised by the Coalition Together for Democracy and Sovereignty (Coalition Ensemble pour la démocratie et la souveraineté) calling for reform of the Independent Electoral Commission. More than 40 protestors were arrested, including senior opposition figures.
“Arbitrary arrests and judicial harassment of activists and opposition leaders are part of a sustained attack on dissenting voices in Côte d’Ivoire,” said Francois Patuel.
The report also documents cases of torture and other ill-treatment particularly at the National Surveillance Directorate (Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, DST), in police and gendarmerie stations or during demonstrations. On 8 November 2018, online activist Soro Tangboho also known as Carton Noir was arbitrarily arrested in the northern town of Korhogo. He was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment for having streamed live on Facebook police officers who were, according to him, extorting money from motorists. He was beaten in the premises of the police station where he spent two nights before being transferred to the DST.
Another example included in the report is the case of blogger and journalist Daouda Coulibaly who was assaulted by police officers while covering an opposition protest in Abidjan on 22 March 2018. He was kicked, beaten with batons on his knees and dragged on the ground. Amnesty International is not aware of any legal proceedings brought against the suspected perpetrators of torture and other ill-treatment or their hierarchy.
152 people died in detention
Investigations by Amnesty International have revealed that prison conditions in Côte d’Ivoire are inhumane, leading to a high number of deaths in custody. At least 152 people have died in detention since August 2014. In July 2018, some 16,000 people were detained across 34 prisons with a combined capacity of only 8,639. Around 5,800 of those in prison were held in pre-trial detention. Others were held in unofficial detention centres, including the DST.
“The authorities should launch a prompt, independent, impartial, effective and transparent investigation into allegations of human rights violations, identify and bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for these abuses, including torture and deaths in custody”, said Francois Patuel.
Offices of human rights organizations ransacked
Côte d’Ivoire is the first African country to have adopted a law to protect human rights defenders in 2014, with its decree of implementation adopted in 2017. Yet, human rights defenders often receive threats and their offices are regularly burgled. Over the last four years, the offices of six of the main human rights organizations have been ransacked, some repeatedly. Despite filing complaints to the police, no one has been brought to justice in relation to these crimes.
Impunity for human rights violations
Despite President Ouattara’s expressed commitment to ensure justice in all cases of violations of human rights, only those suspected of being supporters of former President Laurent Gbagbo have been tried for serious human rights violations committed during and after the 2010 election.
Members of the Republican Forces of Côte d’Ivoire (Forces Republicaines de Côte d’Ivoire, FRCI), loyal to President Ouattara, suspected to be responsible for serious human rights violations, have not been brought to justice. These include the killing of more than 800 people in Duékoué (West) in April 2011, and the killing of 13 people at internally displaced people camp in Nahibly (West) in July 2012.
Several FRCI officials charged with crimes against humanity retain senior positions within the security forces and some were promoted in January 2017.  
The 6 August 2018 Ordinance adopted by President Ouattara, granting amnesty to 800 people accused or convicted of crimes relating to the 2010-2011 crisis or charged with attacks against the state, including Simone Gbagbo, denied victims the right to truth and justice.
“To prevent further violence in the context of the forthcoming election, the authorities must live up to their commitment of addressing past human rights violations including by taking immediate action to bring suspected perpetrators to justice in fair trials,” said Francois Patuel.

The Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have yet to come to terms with the trauma they had experienced in Myanmar. Ahmer Khan visited Cox’s Bazar to document in photographs the Rohingya people with what they held dearest to them during their troubled escape from home…writes Saad Hammadi 
Last November, when word spread of a possible repatriation of a few thousand Rohingya refugees, hundreds sought sanctuary in other camps in Cox’s Bazar to escape a forced return and avoid being identified. 
In the desperately overcrowded camps across Ukhiya in Cox’s Bazar, many Rohingya refugees have still not recovered from the trauma they experienced in Myanmar. That painful escape from home still haunts them. 
On 25 August 2017, Myanmar’s military launched a deadly crackdown on the Rohingya people from the country’s northern Rakhine state. Homes were razed, villages burned down, women and children raped, and thousands killed in grisly crimes against humanity. 
The military crackdown prompted more than 720,000 Rohingya men, women and children to flee their homes and seek refuge in Bangladesh. Many of these people have fled their homes with whatever they could put together, starved, as they walked through the hills across Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships to finally reach Tombroo, Teknaf, Shah Pari Dweep and other bordering areas of southern Bangladesh. 
When the security forces came for them, the only option for many was to get away on foot. Even as the hundreds of thousands made it to Bangladesh, some however, succumbed to their wounds and illness on their way. 
Amina Khatoon, 40, used a split bamboo pole to shoulder her ailing mother, with the support of a cloth tied to it. Her mother passed away before they could reach Bangladesh. The remains of the bamboo pole is all she has to remember her. 
Many refugees who made it to Bangladesh hold smallest of their possessions close to their heart. In the sudden exodus, a few carried with them just a Quran, a few their identity cards. 
Others brought with them essential items such as a cooking pot or the stick that had helped 100-year-old Naseema Khatoon make the arduous journey.

Naseema Khatoon, 100I am very old and I could walk all the way to Bangladesh only with the help of this stick. This is the only thing I could take with me from my home. We stayed inside a cave when our villages was being burnt down by the military. 
In Ukhiya, for days many were stranded in the forests on the two sides of the highway. They had finally managed to squeeze themselves into the already overcrowded Balukhali and Kutupalong camps. The refugees have settled for the smallest of space that they could find for themselves to spend the nights in the threadbare camps on the mud mounts in the hill areas. 
The makeshift homes built using tarpaulins and bamboos make a temporary shelter of roughly 20 to 35 square-feet each, for about four to 10 members of a Rohingya family. The camps are densely populated with 60,000 to 95,000 people per square kilometre, even more than the most densely populated cities in the world today. There are close to one million Rohingya refugees in the camps stretched across 6,000 acres, making the camps near Cox’s Bazar the largest refugee camp in the world. 
Bangladesh has generously allowed a huge population of the refugees into the country despite its own economic and demographic challenges. It is a low-income country and world’s most densely populated. The only space for the refugees could be found when the authorities cut down forests in the hills of Cox’s Bazar.

The International Criminal Court has launched a preliminary investigation into the deportation of the hundreds of thousands of the Rohingya refugees from Myanmar into Bangladesh. It is critical that the international bodies continue their efforts to bring the perpetrators of the crimes committed against the Rohingya people in Myanmar to accountability. 
In the meantime, until the conditions are safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable for the Rohingya refugees to return to their homes, the international community must take shared responsibility for the fate of the Rohingya people. While their efforts must afford Bangladesh with financial and technical assistance to tackle the crisis, countries must look at the potential of the Rohingya people as part of third country relocation in the event of a long-term crisis situation, where judicial investigation and justice for the Rohingya can take time and a repatriation may be too soon, too dangerous.

“The reports of the Iranian prison guards’ reckless and heavy-handed response to protests at Shahr-e-Rey prison are deeply alarming. Many prisoners were reported to have received hospital treatment for the effects of tear gas.
“Prison authorities must refrain from using unnecessary and excessive force against prisoners. Instead of carrying out violent raids against prisoners, they should be working to address the inhumane and squalid conditions at Shahr-e Rey prison.”
Background:
The unrest began during the night of 7 February when the women prisoners tried to raise awareness that one of them needed medical care. Reports also suggest that some prisoners organized a protest by banging their hands on the doors of their cells in protest against the fact that their names have not been included on a list of thousands of prisoners due to be pardoned for the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Amnesty International has previously documented the appalling ill-treatment of prisoners at Shahr-e Rey prison. The facility is a disused chicken farm that holds prisoners in overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, without access to safe drinkable water, decent food, medicine and fresh air.

President Abdelfattah al-Sisi of Egypt will assume the position of the chairperson of the African Union on 10 February during its 32nd ordinary session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
“During his time in power President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has demonstrated a shocking contempt for human rights. Under his leadership the country has undergone a catastrophic decline in rights and freedoms,” said Najia Bounaim, Amnesty’s North Africa Campaigns Director.
“There are real fears about the potential impact his chairmanship could have on the independence of regional human rights mechanisms and their future engagement with civil society.”
Since 2015, Egypt has orchestrated a vicious and sustained political attack against the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR), the mechanism that aims to monitor African states’ human rights records. Dozens of cases alleging serious human rights violations have been lodged against Egypt at the ACHPR.
The Egyptian authorities have carried out mass killings of protestors, widespread enforced disappearances, and sentenced hundreds to death following unfair trials. The authorities have also orchestrated the worst crackdown on freedom of expression in the country’s recent history.
The Egyptian parliament is currently considering a number of proposed constitutional amendments that would expand the scope of military trials, undermine judicial independence and allow President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to potentially stay on as a president until 2034. 
“The African Union member states must ensure that Egypt, as political head of the organization for 2019, upholds the African Union’s values and principles, including respect for human and peoples’ rights”, said Najia Bounaim.
Amnesty International also called on Egypt to ratify key African Union human rights treaties including the Maputo Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, the Protocol on the Establishment of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance.”

Amnesty...","A new briefing by Amnesty International documents how the Zimbabwean authorities have mounted a brutal crackdown and violence against protesters, using killings and torture, among other serious human rights violations to crush protests against fuel prices which began on 14 January.
Amnesty International interviewed relatives of some of the 15 people who have been killed by security forces since the start of protests, and detailed how authorities have used lethal and excessive force such as tear gas, baton sticks, water cannons and live ammunition to silence dissent.
“The Zimbabwean authorities have resorted to the most brutal tactics imaginable to crush demonstrations against fuel hikes. Killings, reports of rape by military personnel and widespread arbitrary arrests of many protestors and non-protestors, have cast doubts on hopes that President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government might mean a better future for Zimbabweans where respect for human rights is the norm,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“Scores of human rights defenders, activists, opposition and civil society leaders suspected of organizing protests have gone into hiding fearing for their lives as a state-sponsored witch-hunt continues, and several women are fearing the worst after reportedly being raped by uniformed soldiers.”
On 14 January, Zimbabwe’s main labour organization called for a nationwide ‘stay-away’ in protest of 150 percent fuel hikes announced by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. In response, the government deployed military, police and intelligence units in cities and other residential areas, setting in motion one of the most brutal crackdowns in Zimbabwe’s recent history.
More than 1,000 people arrested
In the new briefing ‘Open for business, closed for Dissent’, Amnesty International has documented cases of torture, mass arbitrary arrests and detentions as well as routine denial of bail in fast-tracked trials. More than 1,000 people have been arbitrarily detained following the protests, with some having been brought to court in trials that do not meet international fair trial standards.
Witnesses have told Amnesty International of widespread torture and other ill-treatment including being made to roll in sewage or ashes from burnt tires.
The organization is also aware of at least 13 cases of rape and other sexual assault against women by police and military officers. The organization has independently verified internal police reports implicating military personnel in murder, armed robbery and rape.
Dozens of people have been confirmed dead following the national ‘stay-away’ protests. For example, Elvis Nyoni was gunned down on 14 January by riot police outside Chishawasha Flats in Mbare. He was trying to help an old woman holding a baby who was suffocating from tear gas when he was shot.  
In another case, an informal trader, Solomon Nyaruwa, was shot dead on 15 January by an unidentified police officer in Marondera, a town in Mashonaland East, about 72km from Harare. He had gone into town to collect a debt when he was shot while fleeing with other protestors.
Kelvin Tinashe Choto, a 22-year-old football player from Chitungwiza, a residential suburb outside Harare, was shot in the head and killed by security forces outside his home on 14 January during protests. He died on the spot and his body was taken to Makoni police station by angry residents.
“He was my only son and his future was bright. I have been robbed by the state,” Kelvin’s father told Amnesty International.
Systematic use of torture
Scores of people, including children, have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment either as a punishment for suspected involvement in the protests, or as a warning to deter their involvement. Amnesty international has seen footage and photos of victims who have injuries from beatings. A local legal NGO, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZHLR), has confirmed that more than a dozen people they represented have reported being tortured.
Amnesty International has confirmed that doctors have attended to 343 cases of people injured during protests and after arrests. Of these, 78 people had suffered gunshot wounds and four had been bitten by dogs which were set on them by the authorities. Others had been kicked with boots or beaten with blunt instruments like wooden logs, and some had been dragged across tarmac. The true number of injuries is likely to be higher as many people were too frightened to seek medical treatment and most public hospitals were inaccessible to people injured during protests.
Targeting of activists and protest organizers
Many prominent human rights defenders, activists, civil society and opposition leaders have been targeted by the police for their real or perceived role in organizing the protests.
Evan Mawarire, a well-known local pastor and activist, was arrested by police at his home in Harare in the early hours of 16 January. A dozen police officers armed with AK-47s picked him up and he was later charged with inciting public violence and “subverting a constitutional government”. Mawarire has been outspoken about the hardships being faced by many people under the current economic climate. He was granted bail after spending a fortnight in jail. Mawarire has long been targeted by the authorities, and he was previously arrested in 2016 when he spoke out against allegations of corruption in former president Robert Mugabe’s government.
Japhet Moyo, the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the labour organization that called for the national ‘stay-away’, was arrested on 21 January at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport. He was charged with attempting to subvert a constitutional government. Moyo appeared in court on 23 January 2019 and was denied bail. He was later granted bail on 1 February. President of ZCTU, Peter Mutasa, was detained on similar charges and he was granted bail on 1 February. Many others are either in hiding or have fled the country.
Amnesty International is calling on Zimbabwean authorities to immediately end the crackdown on human rights and end attacks on peaceful protesters, human rights defenders, activists, civil society leaders and opposition supporters. All victims of excessive use of force must have access to justice and an effective remedy, including adequate compensation and guarantees of non-repetition. Suspected perpetrators must be brought to justice in fair trials.
“The Zimbabwean authorities will never be able to convince anyone that the country is open for business if they continue to crackdown on anyone who dares to criticize them. People must be allowed to peacefully express their opinions, even if the government doesn’t like them,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
“Other members of the international community also have a role to play, including those that embraced president Mnangagwa’s ‘new dawn’. The time has come for them to take an unequivocal stand and publicly condemn the escalating human rights violations in Zimbabwe.”

In the words of our current global Secretary General, Kumi Naidoo, the findings in the report are deeply troubling, particularly to hear employees “speak of a culture of secrecy and mistrust where discrimination, bullying and abuse of power have been condoned.”
In responding to the report Kumi Naidoo has committed to moving Amnesty International’s organizational culture “towards more compassion and respect” as a priority. Under his leadership, and in consultation with staff at the International Secretariat, an implementation plan is being developed as a matter of urgency, to be presented by the end of March 2019.
The report looks at longstanding shortcomings at our international office, which deepened during the recent very important process of transitioning that office, historically centralized in London, to a number of regionally-based offices around the world. It is, however, also being taken very seriously by national sections of Amnesty International everywhere, including Amnesty International Canada. We will ensure that any relevant lessons learned and associated recommendations are taken up at our level as well, in the context of our regular employee engagement reviews and other staff well-being processes.  This report from our international office underscores why that must be a top priority and must always be accompanied by concrete and deliberate measures.
Amnesty International cares deeply for the well-being and rights of individuals and communities with whom we work. This international report underscores how crucial our responsibility is for the well-being and rights of the individuals who carry out that work, and the enormous cost of not swiftly and adequately addressing concerns that arise.
As Kumi Naidoo has noted, “with the increasing pressure on human rights defenders globally, Amnesty International needs to be stronger and more effective than it has ever been, and our resolve and fortitude must start from within … staff wellbeing is now our absolute priority and will be at the heart of everything we do.”

Investigate death of PTM activist Arman Luni
Disclose whereabouts of human rights defender Gulalai Ismail 
The Pakistani authorities must immediately and unconditionally release protestors belonging to the peaceful Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) who have been arbitrarily detained, Amnesty International said today.
At least 19 people were arrested from cities across Pakistan on 5 February 2019 as the PTM marked a global day of peaceful protests calling for an end to discrimination against Pashtuns in Pakistan and for an end to enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and other human rights violations.
Amnesty International also calls on the Pakistani authorities to investigate the killing of activist Arman Luni, who appears to have been the subject of an extrajudicial execution, and disclose the whereabouts of the well-known human rights defender Gulalai Ismail, who may have been subjected to an enforced disappearance.
“These protestors must be released immediately and unconditionally. They are prisoners of conscience and have done nothing but exercise their peaceful and lawful right to protest against human rights violations and call for end to them,” said Rabia Mehmood, South Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.
“It is shocking that the Pakistani authorities have resorted to such heavy-handed methods even as senior government officials have clearly acknowledged that the PTM has legitimate grievances that must be addressed. To add insult to injury, the crackdown follows the horrific death of Arman Luni, one of PTM’s activists.”
Death of Arman Luni
The 5 February protests took place as PTM activists were mourning Arman Luni, a teacher and a member of PTM’s core committee from Baluchistan province, who apparently died at the hands of the police on 2 February in Lorelai.
Arman Luni and his sister, Wrranga, also an active PTM member, were subject to threats since last year, forcing the family to relocate from Quetta to Qila Saifullah in the north of Baluchistan province.The authorities have yet to register a police case into the circumstances of Arman’s death and have not shared details of his post-mortem with his family. There were also attempts to stop PTM activists from attending his funeral.
“There must be an immediate and effective investigation into the death of Arman Luni. There are credible accounts that he may have been beaten to death while in custody. Extrajudicial executions are a stain on Pakistan’s human rights record and were one of the reasons why the PTM took to the streets. The Pakistani authorities must hold the perpetrators accountable and end the culture of impunity around these grim practices,” said Rabia Mehmood.
Detention of Gulalai Ismail         
Gulalai Ismail, the founder of the Seeds of Peace network and the 2017 winner of the Anna Politkovskaya award, has gone missing following her arrest on 5 February. Her family, friends and lawyer are unable to establish her whereabouts.
Gulalai Ismail is a prominent PTM supporter and women’s rights activist who was placed on Pakistan’s Exit Control List, which prohibits her from leaving the country, in October 2018. The authorities claim that she is involved in “anti-state activities”. She was also charged with “rioting” and “incitement” for participating in a peaceful PTM rally in the northwest town of Swabi.
“We are deeply concerned about the fate of Gulalai Ismail. Her whereabouts must be established immediately. The charges against her are an outrage. She has merely exercised her rights to peaceful freedom of assembly and expression. No harm must come of her,” said Rabia Mehmood.
Widening crackdown against PTM
Despite public statements from senior government officials recognizing that the PTM has legitimate concerns that must be addressed, Pakistan’s authorities appear to be intensifying their crackdown against the movement.
Over the past year, dozens of its members and supporters have been arrested, arbitrarily detained, intimidated and threatened with violence. Across the country, their rallies have been banned or disrupted, denying them the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.
In June 2018, 37 PTM activists were arrested on charges of sedition. The following month, PTM’s social media lead, Hayat Preghal, was arbitrarily detained and then jailed for more than two months for comments he made online that were deemed critical of the Pakistani military establishment.
On 21 January 2019, Alamzaib Khan, another PTM activist, was detained at gunpoint in Karachi and charged with “rioting” and “inciting hatred” for participating in a demonstration. He remains behind bars.
Last month, Pakistan’s top military spokesperson, Major General Asif Ghafoor, said: “Till such time that the PTM is peaceful and they stick to their genuine demands, which are natural in a post-conflict environment, the state is committed to take care of them.”
Prime Minister Imran Khan, who himself addressed a PTM rally in Islamabad in 2018, vowed last year to take up the issue of security checkpoints, landmines and enforced disappearances with Pakistan’s army chief.
“The Pakistani authorities have made encouraging pledges to address the serious human rights violations highlighted by the PTM. They should honour those commitments and allow the PTM activists to exercise their rights freely and without fear,” said Rabia Mehmood.

“Truong Duy Nhat’s disappearance is deeply alarming. He is a former prisoner of conscience who was repeatedly targeted by the Vietnamese authorities. We know from several sources that he travelled to Bangkok to claim asylum. No-one has seen or heard from him since 26 January.
“Thai authorities must immediately investigate these multiple reliable reports of abduction from members of the Vietnamese exile community, corroborated by Nhat’s colleagues at Radio Free Asia, who have now raised the alarm. Viet Nam security forces have abducted exiles and refugees from Thailand and elsewhere in the past. Truong Duy Nhat is at a clear risk of torture or other ill-treatment if his abduction is confirmed.
“Vietnamese authorities have been silent over Truong Duy Nhat’s disappearance. They must come forward with any information about his whereabouts and ensure his safety and freedom of movement.”
Background
 Truong Duy Nhat, a Vietnamese journalist and commentator, was jailed from 2013 to 2015 on charges of “conducting propaganda against the state.”
Since his release, Truong Duy Nhat pursued his work as an independent journalist. In December 2018, he received reports that he was likely to be re-arrested and noticed a heightened police presence near his house.
In early January 2019, he travelled to Thailand. On 25 January, he submitted an asylum claim at the Bangkok office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). He sent his relatives two photos of himself at the UNHCR gate. He has not been seen or heard from since the following day, 26 January.
According to media reports, Truong Duy Nhat was seized by unidentified men in a shopping centre called Future Park on 26 January. Amnesty has confirmed this with independent confidential sources who requested anonymity for their own security.

The heartbreaking absurdity of the fact that Canada continues to maintain that the United States is a ‘safe’ country for refugees was apparent with every interview, observation or meeting I had as our six-country Amnesty International delegation moved along the US/Mexico border this past week.
Far from being safe, it is beyond question that the frightening reality for refugees and migrants in the United States is one of unrelenting human rights violations.  Rather than pretending otherwise, it is time for Canada to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement that shuts down access to official border posts for refugee claimants crossing into the country from the United States.  Instead, Canada should be exerting all possible pressure on the Trump Administration to end the deepening and dehumanizing assault on the safety and dignity of refugees and migrants.
A safe country?  Certainly not the experience of the three LGBT teens who have fled frightening violence and discrimination in Honduras and needed the protective presence of twenty international observers, including our Amnesty delegation, simply to make sure that US border guards at the crossing between Tijuana and San Ysidro did not unlawfully turn them away as they tried to lodge their claims for asylum.  They were allowed in but only after a tense standoff and threats from both US and Mexican officials.  They have now disappeared into the harrowing world of US immigration detention.
A safe country?  That is most assuredly not the word that Valquiria would use.  Having fled terrifying threats of violence from criminal gangs in Brazil, she and her young son were detained as soon as they made their asylum claims at the Ciudad Juárez/El Paso border.  But US officials forcibly separated her from 7-year-old Abel the next day.  She has not seen her son, now residing with his father in Boston, for more than ten months and has no idea when they might be reunited.  Her sobs as she described the agonizing pain of being apart from him brought all of us to tears.
Those two accounts are not the exception. They are the norm.  The US asylum and immigration enforcement system has deteriorated to such an extent that its entrenched hallmarks have become cruelty, punishment, arbitrariness and a wholesale lack of accountability.
While we were at the border one more mean-spirited layer kicked-in.  Expected for some time, the US has now put into force the cruelly-misnamed Migrant Protection Protocols, under which many asylum-seekers will be forced back into Mexico to wait out the processing of their claims.  But the average processing time is close to two years; and Mexico is a notoriously perilous country for many of those who will be returned, particularly Central Americans.  These forcible returns stand to violate the most essential right enshrined in international refugee law, the protection against refoulement to danger.
It has echoes of the Canada/US agreement, only this time it is the United States essentially declaring Mexico to be safe.  One wonders if dominoes of designating safe third countries might start to cascade southwards.
In his single-minded campaign to secure billions of dollars to build his infamous and cruel wall, Donald Trump repeatedly insists that the US faces a crisis at the border with Mexico.  Crisis yes, but it is a human rights crisis, not a national security emergency.
And how should Canada respond to our neighbour’s human rights crisis?
Lifting the Safe Third Country Agreement would mean desperate refugees are not forced to turn to irregular and potentially dangerous border crossings to be able to make claims for protection in Canada.
Lifting the Safe Third Country Agreement would mean that the toxic and inflammatory accusations of “illegal” queue-jumpers would subside as refugee claimants overwhelming instead turn to official border posts to make their claims.
And lifting the Safe Third Country Agreement would mean that Canada could credibly stand up for the rights of LGBT teens seeking safety and mothers forcibly separated from their children in immigration detention, rather than silently siding with the US authorities who cavalierly torment and punish them.
What will it take and how much worse must it get, before Canada does the right thing?
The denial and the excuses must end now.

A shorter version of this article originally appeared on The Georgia Straight.
When governments rely on court-granted injunctions to define the “rule of law” in respect to Indigenous land occupations, they risk breaching their Constitutional and international human rights obligations and undermining the profound public interest in meaningful reconciliation.
Case in point: the injunction currently being enforced against Wet’suwet’en land and water defenders in British Columbia.
When the BC Supreme Court granted Coastal Gaslink a temporary injunction against named and unnamed individuals “occupying, obstructing, blocking, physically impeding or delaying access” to a bridge and service road on Wet’suwet’en territory, the court set in motion events that led to the high-profile, forcible arrest and removal of land defenders on Jan. 7.
In granting the injunction, the BC Supreme Court failed to weigh the implications of potential harm to the rights of Indigenous peoples – rights that are inherent and protected in the Constitution and under international law. In fact, the word “rights” and “title” are nowhere to be found in the court’s summary analysis.
Instead, as has become common practice, the court easily concluded that the injunction had to be granted to protect the financial interests of a private corporation. The BC Supreme Court found that the company, Coastal Gaslink, faces significant financial losses – “in the range of several hundred million dollars” – as construction delays “could jeopardize the entire project.”[1]
But what of the defendants? What harm do the Wet’suwet’en face?
The BC Supreme Court decision was vague on details when discussing risks to the Wet’suwet’en, stating only that any such harm “will be relatively minimal.”[2]
Among the factors utterly overlooked in this decision is the harm done by overriding the power and authority of Indigenous peoples to make their own decisions about the use of their traditional lands, thus supplanting Indigenous peoples’ own systems of governance and decision-making.
Respecting Indigenous laws and goverance systems
Indigenous peoples’ own laws and governance systems are inextricably part of their cultures and identities. Canada’s long history of imposing laws and policies on Indigenous peoples – with what the Truth and Reconciliation Commission identified as a genocidal intent – has eroded and undermined Indigenous peoples’ own institutions and traditions. The continued struggle of Indigenous peoples to revitalize, maintain, and practice these traditions should be met with support from all levels of government, as well as a clear commitment not to repeat the crimes of the past.
International human rights law requires governments to respect, protect, and promote the right of Indigenous peoples to make their own decisions about their lives and futures according to their own customs and traditions. This obligation flows from the right of self-determination,[3] which lies at the heart of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
The Declaration affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making “through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision-making institutions” (Article 18). Additionally, resolution of disputes must give “due recognition to [I]ndigenous peoples’ laws, traditions, customs and land tenure systems” (Article 27).
“The deck is stacked”
In the context of injunction decisions, some Canadian courts have recognized the need for more rigorous analysis to account for the rights at issue. The Ontario Superior Court, for example, noted that “injunctions sought by private parties to protect their interests should only be granted where every effort has been made by the court to encourage consultation, negotiation, accommodation and reconciliation among the competing rights and interests.”[4]
However, in Coastal Gaslink’s case, the BC Supreme Court authorized police action against the Wet’suwet’en hereditary Chiefs and their supporters without deeper consideration of such obligations – obligations rooted in Canada’s human rights commitments and enshrined in the Constitution. And this case is not unique.
John Borrows, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Law at the University of Victoria, notes “the deck is stacked” against First Nations in injunction hearing as “economic interests are often given greater weight than justice issues.”[5] As a result, it is often easier for a corporation to get an injunction to remove an Indigenous blockade or camp than it is for Indigenous peoples to obtain an injunction to protect their rights and halt irreversible harm to their lands.
In fact, by giving greater weight to economic harm than to the duty to uphold human rights, courts have created an incentive for governments and corporations to plunge ahead with projects in the face of Indigenous peoples’ still unaddressed concerns. After all, by pushing construction ahead governments and corporations can show courts that their investments will be at risk if a project is delayed to properly consider the rights of Indigenous peoples.
Witness the recent court decision on the Site C injunction, for example. Last year, the BC Supreme Court denied West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations a temporary injunction to halt or limit construction on a hydro mega-project that threatens their Treaty-protected hunting and fishing practices. Although the project was approved without any consideration of whether it would violate Treaty-protected rights, the provincial utility company rushed to begin construction even while First Nations legal challenges were being brought before the courts. Despite this fraught context, the BC Supreme Court concluded that the risk of “irreparable harm” from project delays weighed against any restriction on construction.
Further, the court noted that some First Nations had signed benefit agreements with the project proponents and so there were “Aboriginal interests on both sides.”[6] Although in doing so the court appears to have given consideration to Indigenous peoples, this reasoning (which makes an appearance in the Coastal Gaslink injunction decision as well[7]) is simply another example of how Indigenous rights are denigrated in the injunction process.
The human rights of Indigenous peoples—protected by Treaty, enshrined in the Constitution, and recognized under international human rights law—are not mere “interests”. There is a clear, established public interest in ensuring the highest standard of protection and fulfilment of these rights. They cannot be fairly or appropriately equated to simple financial interests, even the financial interests of other First Nations.
In light of this persistent and systemic failure to properly consider Indigenous rights at the injunction stage, the continued association of court injunctions with “rule of law” rings hollow. Federal, provincial, and territorial governments need to engage in good faith, and with real political will, in ensuring that Indigenous rights and title are recognized and upheld. In the meantime, their human rights obligations mean that they should, at the very least, be standing alongside Indigenous rights defenders in the courts to insist that their rights not be ignored or pushed aside for another day.

At the southern border, his obsession with divisive symbols like a wall is just part of his continued efforts to stigmatize people desperately in need of protection.

Centennial College Writes for Rightsby Loni Welch, Student, Centennial College 
Wide eyed, passionate and ready to join the fight for equal rights and justice in the world, is perhaps a good way to describe the newest cohort of international development students at Centennial College, Progress Campus. Though small, the group of eleven were more than enthused to put pen to paper and write to government officials around the world on behalf of the oppressed and marginalized. 
Marilyn McKim of Amnesty International Canada visited the group during their weekly Human Rights and Development class in November 2018 to speak about Amnesty International’s advocacy work and the Write for Rights campaign. After explaining the history of how Amnesty International was formed and the concept of the Write for Rights campaign, there was no shortage of willingness among the group to take up the challenge. 
 
Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign is a global letter-writing campaign and the world’s largest human rights event. Millions of letters are written each year in support of persons around the world suffering grave human rights abuses. These letters are written by average people like me and the other students at Centennial College, so virtually anyone with a desire to do so can get involved. Last year the campaign recorded 5 million letters. Perhaps the target for this year is 6 million. What’s more, the campaign this year is all about writing for the rights of millions of women around the world fighting for their rights and the rights of their communities. 
It is often said that the pen is mightier than the sword. So with swords in hand, the students gallantly inked their concerns on paper urging officials to end the oppression and marginalization of women around the world. Some of the cases included women fighting to defend their rights to their land, women advocating for the rights of women of colour, women facing refoulement, disabled women and so on. The group also had the opportunity to send letters of encouragement and solidarity to the women on whose behalf they wrote. 
 
The International Development programme at Centennial College has a heavy focus on poverty reduction, development and human rights and prepares students to play an active role in tackling developmental challenges around the world. Amnesty International’s Write for Rights event was the perfect introduction to global advocacy for the students.

The investigation, “When arms go astray: Yemen’s deadly new threat of arms diversion to militias,” shows how the UAE has become a major conduit for armoured vehicles, mortar systems, rifles, pistols, and machine guns – which are being illicitly diverted to unaccountable militias accused of war crimes and other serious violations.
“While the USA, the UK, France and other European states have rightly been criticized for supplying arms to Coalition forces, and Iran has been implicated in sending arms to the Huthis, a deadly new threat is emerging. Yemen is quickly becoming a safe haven for UAE-backed militias that are largely unaccountable,” said Patrick Wilcken, Arms Control and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Emirati forces receive billions of dollars’ worth of arms from Western states and others, only to siphon them off to militias in Yemen that answer to no-one and are known to be committing war crimes.
“The proliferation of these fighting forces is a recipe for disaster for Yemeni civilians who have already been killed in their thousands, while millions more are on the brink of famine as a direct result of the war.”
The armed groups on the receiving end of these dodgy arms deals – including “The Giants”, the Security Belt and Elite Forces – are trained and funded by the UAE, but are not accountable to any government. Some of them stand accused of war crimes, including during the recent offensive on the port city of Hodeidah and in the UAE-backed network of secret prisons in southern Yemen.
States supplying arms to UAE
According to publicly available data, since the outbreak of the Yemeni conflict in March 2015, Western states have supplied the UAE with at least US$3.5 billion worth of arms. Among them are heavy conventional weapons – including aircraft and ships – small arms, light weapons and associated parts and ammunition.
Despite the serious violations attributed to the UAE and militias it backs, the following states have recently supplied the Emiratis with arms: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czechia, France, Germany, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the UK and the USA, among others.
Amnesty International analysed open-source evidence around the battle for Hodeidah and found that military vehicles and weapons supplied to the UAE are now widely in use by militias on the ground.
A wide variety of US-supplied armoured vehicles equipped with heavy machine guns, including M-ATV, Caiman and MaxxPro models, have been documented in the hands of UAE-backed militias Security Belt, Shabwani elite forces and “The Giants”.
Belgian Minimi light machine guns, also likely sold to the UAE, are being deployed by “The Giants”. Other weapons used by UAE-allied militias in Hodeidah include Serbian-made Zastava MO2 Coyote machine guns and the Agrab armoured-truck-mounted Singaporean 120mm mortar system – the UAE is the only country known to purchase this combined weapon system.
Elsewhere in Yemen, the UAE has directly trained and funded militias including the Security Belt and Elite Forces, which operate a shadowy network of secret prisons known as “black sites”.
Amnesty International and others have previously documented these forces’ role in enforced disappearances and other violations at these facilities – including detention at gunpoint, torture with electric shocks, waterboarding, hanging from the ceiling, sexual humiliation, prolonged solitary confinement, squalid conditions and inadequate food and water.
The UAE-backed militias running these black sites wield Bulgarian rifles and drive US armoured vehicles.
Violating the Arms Trade Treaty
Many of the states that continue to supply arms to the UAE are party to the global Arms Trade Treaty. Some have other legal obligations as EU members or under domestic laws not to transfer arms being used to commit war crimes. By persisting in transferring arms to the UAE, despite overwhelming evidence those arms are being used in war crimes and other serious violations in Yemen, they are flouting these obligations.
Amnesty International calls on all states to stop supplying arms to all parties to the conflict in Yemen until there is no longer a substantial risk that such equipment would be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Norway have recently announced suspending arms transfers to the UAE.
“As the next round of peace talks on Yemen’s conflict looms, arms-supplying states need to reflect hard on how their arms transfers are continuing to directly and indirectly fuel war crimes and other serious violations. The proliferation of unaccountable, UAE-backed militias is worsening the humanitarian crisis and posing a growing threat to the civilian population,” said Patrick Wilcken.
“Only a handful of countries have done the right thing and stopped the conveyor belt of arms to the Yemen’s devastating conflict. Others must follow in their footsteps or they will share responsibility for the devastating toll these billions of dollars’ worth of arms transfers are wreaking on civilians in Yemen.”
The Canadian context
This new report cites Canada for having provided aircraft, as well as military parts and components to the United Arab Emirates, an active participant in the conflict in Yemen. Moreover, Canada risks complicity in war crimes against Yemen, as the federal government has yet to terminate the multi-billion-dollar sale of Light Armoured Vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, the bulk of Canada’s arms sales are bound for the US – a country that directly supplies arms to the Emirates. Many of those arms transfers do not require an export risk assessment and permit, in direct contravention of the Arms Trade Treaty. While Canada is poised to accede to the UN Arms Trade Treaty with the recent passage of Bill C-47, Amnesty International is urgently calling for further reforms to ensure that Canadian law and practice fully complies with the treaty.

“This regressive law, if passed, will endanger children’s lives rather than reduce crime. Let’s remember that the so-called ‘war on drugs’ – in whose name this law was drafted – is a reckless war on the poor that has already left tens of thousands dead, including children.
“Today the government takes another harsh step, by opening the door to the criminal prosecution of young children including for drug-related offences. In a climate where the police act as judge, jury and literally, executioner, this bill risks enabling further abuses of power.
“The Philippine authorities claim the draft law is designed to rehabilitate children. If that was the goal, they would focus on fulfilling their obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and existing juvenile welfare laws. The Philippine Senate should reject this deeply dangerous bill.”
Background
During the 2016 election campaign, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte vowed to clamp down on crime. As part of this promise, he pledged to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility, sparking widespread condemnation from children’s rights organisations and the international community, including the UN.
During the review of the Philippines’ human rights record before the UN Human Rights Council on 8 May 2017, numerous states called on the authorities to refrain from lowering the minimum age of criminal responsibility and instead ensure the effective implementation of the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006.
On 28 January 2019, the House of Representatives approved on third and final reading a bill that would lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility from 15 to 12 years old. The Senate is considering its own version of the bill.
If approved by Congress, the proposed legislation would amend Republic Act 10630, which sets the minimum age of criminal liability at 15 years old. Currently, children under the age of 15 in the Philippines are exempt from criminal liability, but subject to intervention by the government under the provisions of the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006. The Act takes into account the best interests of children in conflict with the law, including their need for adequate protection, rehabilitation and re-integration into society.

In a new briefing, “Reality Check: The state of migrant workers’...","With less than four years to go until the 2022 World Cup, the Qatari authorities risk falling behind on their promise to tackle widespread labour exploitation of thousands of migrant workers, Amnesty International said today.
In a new briefing, “Reality Check: The state of migrant workers’ rights with less than four years to go until the Qatar 2022 World Cup”, the organization examines Qatar’s high-profile reform process and reveals how much work the authorities still need to do to fully respect and protect the rights of around 2 million migrant workers.
“Time is running out if the Qatari authorities want to deliver a legacy we can all cheer – namely a labour system that ends the abuse and misery inflicted upon so many migrant workers every day,” said Stephen Cockburn, Deputy Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International.
“The Qatari authorities have been taking some important steps to protect labour rights, but much more needs to be done. Holes in the reforms to date mean many workers are still stuck in harsh conditions, vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, while those who return home do so empty handed, with no compensation and no justice.”
Amnesty International is calling on Qatar to fully abolish the abusive kafala sponsorship system which, despite a few recent changes, continues to tie workers to unscrupulous employers for up to five years.
In November 2017, Qatar signed an agreement with the UN International Labour Organization (ILO) to revise its laws in line with international labour standards.
Since then, the authorities have passed several pieces of legislation aimed at benefiting migrant workers, including introducing a temporary minimum wage, introducing a law for domestic workers, setting up new committees to address labour disputes and establishing a workers’ support and insurance fund.
The authorities also ended the requirement for employees to obtain an “exit permit” requiring their employer’s permission to be able to leave the country for most migrant workers.
However, limitations in some of the reforms introduced so far mean many migrant workers in Qatar are still at risk of forced labour, restrictions on their movement and other abuses.
Under the kafala system, which remains firmly in place despite partial reforms, workers still cannot change jobs without their employers’ permission. They face criminalization for ‘absconding’ and risk having their passports confiscated.
The temporary minimum wage is just over $200 per month, while new labour courts intended to tackle cases of abuse including non-payment of wages are overwhelmed with cases and hundreds of workers have returned home without justice or compensation.
Domestic workers, meanwhile, are still required to obtain an “exit permit” in order to leave the country, and a weak domestic workers law introduced in 2017 means many remain vulnerable to abuse.

During the next session of the Human Rights Council, from February 25 to March 22, 2019, the Council will consider the outcome report of China’s November 2018 Universal Periodic Review, at which Chinese officials denied allegations of grave human rights violations in Xinjiang.
“The magnitude of abuses allegedly occurring in Xinjiang demand uncompromising scrutiny from the Human Rights Council,” said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director at Human Rights Watch. “The Human Rights Council’s integrity demands that states not allow China to hide behind its membership or economic might to escape accountability.” The Chinese authorities have detained Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims – outside any legal process – in “political education” camps for their perceived disloyalty to the government and Chinese Communist Party. In those camps, they are subjected to forced political indoctrination, renunciation of their faith, mistreatment, and, in some cases, torture. Numerous UN experts, treaty bodies, and the High Commissioner for Human Rights have expressed grave concern about the situation in Xinjiang and called for unrestricted access to the region. China has not responded positively to these requests. In December and January, the government arranged visits for some journalists and diplomats to what they claim to be mere “vocational training centers.”
Following those visits, Chinese state media asserted that visitors found the conditions there “impress[ive]” and detainees “in good spirits.”
“China has had multiple opportunities over the past year to answer serious questions about the horrendous situation in Xinjiang, and at every turn provided narratives that strain credibility,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“China should recognize that only an international fact-finding mission can separate facts from fiction and set the record straight.” The proposed resolution would urge the High Commissioner for Human Rights to dispatch a fact-finding mission to assess the situation and report to the Human Rights Council at its next session. The resolution should also welcome China’s expression of willingness to allow access by international experts, and stresses that such access must be independent, unrestricted, and unsupervised. China should also be reminded of its obligations as a member of the HRC to “uphold the highest standards of human rights” and to “fully cooperate with the HRC.”
The statement was issued by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Service for Human Rights, and the World Uyghur Congress, and is being endorsed by a broad range of organizations regionally and globally. “The deterioration in human rights in the country is a long-standing concern, but this is a tipping point. No country in the world should be able to get away with arbitrarily detaining a million of its own people,” said Philip Lynch, Director of International Service for Human Rights. “A resolution mandating a fact-finding mission is the bare minimum members of the Human Rights Council should do if they take their obligation to promote human rights seriously.”
“For too long Uyghurs and other Muslims have suffered gross repression at the hands of Chinese authorities,” said Dolkun Isa, President of the World Uyghur Congress. “We are now looking to the HRC to act – and get to the truth.”

 “Today’s judgment is a blow for the recognition of transgender people. It is a missed opportunity to address the discrimination transgender people in Hong Kong face.
“No one should be forced to undergo gender affirming surgery in order to have their gender legally recognized. We urge the government to do the right thing and end this discriminatory and highly intrusive policy irrespective of today’s ruling.
“The government should also swiftly introduce comprehensive legislation against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status.”
Background
Henry Edward Tse, Q and R are three transgender men born female. They sought a judicial review after the government refused to legally recognize his gender unless he underwent gender affirming surgery. They feared such medical treatment would damage their health.  
Forcing people to undertake medical treatment in order to obtain legal gender recognition violates their right to the highest attainable standard of health. Amnesty International believes a new legal gender recognition procedure must be quick, accessible and transparent, and should not include any requirements for medical treatments of any kind as a precondition.

The organization also analyzed satellite imagery which shows hundreds of burned structures in the town. Many of the destroyed structures only date back to 2017, suggesting they were shelters for internally displaced people who came to Rann seeking protection.
“We have now confirmed that this week’s attack on Rann was the deadliest yet by Boko Haram, killing at least 60 people. Using satellite imagery we have also been able to confirm the mass burning of structures as Boko Haram unleashed a massive assault on Rann, most of which is now destroyed,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.
“This attack on civilians who have already been displaced by the bloody conflict may amount to possible war crime, and those responsible must be brought to justice. Disturbingly, witnesses told us that Nigerian soldiers abandoned their posts the day before the attack, demonstrating the authorities’ utter failure to protect civilians.”
Inadequate security
Alleged withdrawal of troops triggered a massive exodus of civilians to Cameroon, as fear spread that Boko Haram would take advantage and attack the town. At around 9 a.m. on 28 January, a group of Boko Haram fighters arrived on motorcycles. They set houses ablaze and killed those left behind. They also chased after those who attempted to escape and killed some people outside the town. Eleven bodies were found within Rann town, and 49 bodies were found outside.
Amnesty International was informed that about 50 people have not been accounted for. Those who took part in the burial explained what they saw.
According to an eyewitness: “Ten of us [Civilian Joint Task Force] came from Cameroon to Rann for the burial. When we arrived, we found and buried 11 corpses within the town, but the soldiers told us that they buried several others yesterday [30 January] who had decayed. Outside the town, we recovered and buried 49 dead bodies all with gunshot wounds.”
Aid agencies have reported that some 30,000 civilians have fled for the border with Cameroon in recent days, joining a further 9,000 who fled Boko Haram’s previous attack on Rann on 14 January.
Satellite evidence of mass burning
Amnesty International analyzed satellite images from 30 January 2019 showing hundreds of structures burned in the east, south and southeast of Rann. Environmental sensors detected fires in the area on 28 and 29 January.
In the 14 January attack, Boko Haram burned well over 100 structures in other areas of Rann. These two recent attacks have left most of the town heavily damaged or destroyed.
Amnesty International is calling on Nigerian authorities to investigate the withdrawal of security forces of the Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) from Rann, which may have left tens of thousands of civilians exposed to this latest deadly attack.
“Boko Haram has consistently deliberately targeted civilians in Rann, which makes the Nigerian authorities failure to protect people all the more unacceptable,” said Osai Ojigho.
“The authorities on both sides of the border must provide the supplies and safety that these people require. The Cameroonian authorities must also desist from forcing people to return until conditions are safe and they choose to do so voluntarily.”

“The news that Saudi Arabia’s authorities have dropped their outrageous call for Israa al-Ghomgham to be executed comes as a huge relief. However, while her life is no longer at risk, she is still facing a ludicrous prison sentence simply for participating in peaceful demonstrations.
“Saudi Arabia’s prosecutors must now immediately drop their call for the death penalty against four other defendants facing trial alongside Israa al-Ghomgham. All have been detained for exercising their peaceful right to freedom of expression, association and assembly.
“The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment – its use is horrific in all circumstances – but resorting to execution as a means to punish peaceful protesters in violation of international law is particularly appalling. The authorities must take steps to abolish the death penalty.
“Instead of treating peaceful protesters as criminals and resorting to extreme measures to intimidate them into silence, Saudi Arabia’s authorities must ensure that Israa al-Ghomgham and all others detained solely for exercising their right to peaceful dissent are released immediately and unconditionally.”
Background:
Israa al-Ghomgham was arrested along with her husband Mousa al-Hashim in December 2015 for their roles in participating in protests for greater rights and reforms for the Shi’a minority in the eastern Qatif province in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings. She is facing trial before Saudi Arabia’s notorious Specialized Criminal Court which deals with counter-terrorism cases, along with five other individuals Ahmed al-Matrood, Ali Ouwaisher, Mousa al-Hashim, Khalid al-Ghanim and Mujtaba al-Muzain.
They are facing a series of charges including  “participating in protests” which is punishable under Royal Decree 44/A, a follow-up decree to the 2014 Law for the Crimes of Terrorism and its Financing.

“The Australian Defence Force’s latest admission that its air strikes killed civilians during the battle for Mosul in 2017 is a step in the right direction. Once again, the Australian government has proven more willing to take responsibility for causing loss of civilian life than its coalition partners, including the UK, USA and France.
“The matter must not end here, however. The ADF should continue to lead by example by providing the further details necessary to help an independent assessment of whether this attack and its operations in Mosul complied with international humanitarian law. We know that an Australian plane struck a target in West Mosul and unintentionally killed up to 18 civilians in a nearby house. In order to understand how this happened the ADF needs to disclose more information, including the type of weapon used in the strike, the nature of the target, what measures were taken to ensure that the target was a military objective, whether other means or methods of attack that would have minimized the risk to civilians were considered, and what was done to collect information about the presence of civilians in the vicinity.
“The ADF has taken a positive step by acknowledging that their attacks resulted in civilian casualties. What they must do now is provide the victims’ families with the best chance of achieving justice and accountability. The way to do this is to release the further information required.”
Background 
The Coalition’s battle to wrest Mosul from the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS) began in October 2016 and ended in July 2017. Throughout the campaign, and especially in its later stages in West Mosul, the Coalition relied heavily upon air power, despite the presence of civilians trapped in the city by IS. Amnesty International revealed the effects of this upon the civilian population with its July 2017 report, At Any Cost: The Civilian Catastrophe in West Mosul, Iraq.
On 31 January 2019, the Australian Defence Force’s Air Marshal Mel Hupfeld acknowledged that as many as 18 civilians were killed in an attack on a target in West Mosul in which two Australian Super Hornet F-18 jets were involved on 13 June 2017. This follows a previous ADF admission on 28 March 2018 that it killed two adults and injured two children in a strike on Mosul that came to light following Amnesty International investigations on the ground.

Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director, said:
“The UAE authorities are trying to brand 2019 as the “year of tolerance” and are now seeking to cast the Pope’s visit as proof of their respect for diversity. Does this mean they are ready to reverse their policy of systematic repression of any form of dissent or criticism?
“Since 2011, the authorities have systematically cracked down on their critics, including activists, judges, lawyers, academics, students and journalists by way of arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearance, torture and other-ill-treatment.
“It will take more than symbolic meetings to gloss over the UAE’s appalling human rights record. The fanfare around Pope Francis’ visit will be missed by the many human rights defenders, including Ahmed Mansoor, Nasser bin Ghaith and Mohammed al-Roken, who are serving lengthy prison sentences simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression. We are calling on Pope Francis to raise the issue of their incarceration with his hosts, and urge their immediate and unconditional release.
“If the Emirati authorities are really serious about reform, they should repeal laws and end practices that perpetuate discrimination, and release all prisoners of conscience.”

The eight men were shot dead by police after they allegedly tried to steal from a shop. Three policemen were also injured during the confrontation.
The organization has independently verified the harrowing images, taken after the men were shot dead following a confrontation with police on 25 January in Betroka, southern Madagascar.
“These brutal killings are the latest example of Madagascar’s security forces resorting to excessive and lethal force with impunity,” said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“The Malagasy authorities must launch a prompt, effective and independent investigation into the incident, including these killings and, if an excessive or unnecessary use of force is demonstrated, bring those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in fair trials.”
Around 4,000 people have been killed in southern Madagascar in the past five years – including alleged thieves, police, soldiers and civilians – in the context of the government’s crackdown on cattle thieves, according to official figures.
“President Andry Rajoelina has committed to tackling the systematic killings of people associated with cattle rustling – he must start by ensuring that security forces are strictly guided by the law when responding to such crimes,” said Tigere Chagutah.
“As well as ending this culture of killings, the authorities must also stamp out the impunity associated with it.”
Under Malagasy and international law, police are only allowed to use force as a last resort, and even then they can only use the bare minimum to prevent further loss of life.

“It is extremely alarming to see reports of at least four political activists and one other who have been disappeared over the last few days. The Pakistani authorities must immediately launch an independent investigation to determine the fate and whereabouts of the missing people. If they are in state custody, authorities must either release them or produce them in the court immediately and charge them with a recognizable criminal offence.
“While the Pakistan government is amending the Penal Code to make enforced disappearances a criminal offence, they must also take urgent measures to address this egregious human rights violation and bring all those responsible to justice in fair trials.
“In some parts of the country, people forcibly disappeared are languishing in detention while their relatives are left without any information on their fate and whereabouts. Pakistani authorities must put an end to this cruel practise.”
Background
One of the four people who disappeared over the last week was released today.
Enforced disappearances are a longstanding problem in Pakistan. According to the country’s own Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, there are more than 1,800 unresolved cases where the fate and whereabouts of the individuals remain unknown. According to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, they have received more than 700 urgent appeals regarding enforced disappearances in Pakistan.
Victims of enforced disappearances in Pakistan include political activists, students, human rights defenders, lawyers, journalists, members of religious groups and various ethnic minorities.

El Paso, Texas 
So many times over the past two years, since Donald Trump’s presidency and assault on the rights of refugees and migrants began, I have asked myself: what more will it take for the Canadian government to agree that the United States is not “safe” when it comes to refugee protection? 
And while I do not have the answer yet, as the accounts of utter contempt for international obligations and the lack of even a minimal sense of compassion mounted during our visit to Tijuana, El Paso and Ciudad Juárez this week, as a Canadian I felt a deepening sense of shame that this remains an open question. 
What more will it take? 
That question was on my mind as more than twenty advocates from four organizations and at least six different countries came together as a protective force to accompany three LGBT teens from Honduras to the border, in their effort to lodge asylum claims with US officials. Their courage was immense, yet they bristled with fear, knowing there was a good chance that their journey to safety could abruptly end at the hands of a Mexican or US border guard ruthlessly sending them away. 
What more will it take? 
That question was on my mind as Valquiria, an asylum-seeker from Brazil, sobbed while talking to us of the pain of more than ten months of being forcibly separated from her young son, taken from her just 24 hours after they arrived at the El Paso border. She has not seen him since. And even though Valquiria’s plight has been featured in an Amnesty International report and global Urgent Action, immigration authorities continue to refuse her the humanitarian release from custody that would reunite her with 7-year-old Abel. 
What more will it take? 
That question was on my mind as a I spoke with 16-year-old Carlos from Honduras, who had arrived in Tijuana with last year’s Migrants Caravan, but has been fearful ever since of taking the next step of trying to make an asylum claim with US officials. He worries about the risk that he would be turned away and lose the minimal sense of safety he has at the migrants shelter that presently offers him a bed at night. 
What more will it take? 
That question was on my mind yesterday as I heard Claudia’s incredible account of the arduous and dangerous 7-month journey she took with her husband from their home in Cuba through 11 countries to reach the border at El Paso. Claudia, now 6 ½ months pregnant, was hopeful that their number on the list was going to come up the next day and it would be their turn to cross the border. I could not help but be buoyed by her optimism. But my heart sank today when reports emerged of several Cubans already in immigration detention in El Paso who have felt such despair at their conditions that they have resorted to a hunger strike and may soon be force-fed by authorities. Will anything better await Claudia? 
The list of adjectives that our delegation kept turning to in an effort to describe the human rights crisis on the US/Mexico frontier grew long: cruel, arbitrary, unlawful, punitive, harsh, abusive, secretive, unaccountable and, simply, mean. 
Never, anywhere, did I hear an account that even remotely brought to mind the word that Canada continues to hold on to in describing refugee protection in the United States: safe. Not even close. 
Throughout the week I was humbled to meet with courageous and dedicated activists, lawyers, social workers and other concerned advocates who are engaged in a phenomenal struggle for rights and justice, on both sides of this border. They responded in anguished disbelief when I told them of Canada’s insistence that the United States is safe for refugees. 
In fact, it is increasingly not even safe for these human rights defenders themselves, many of whom regularly face growing levels of harassment, intimidation, obstruction and threats from both US and Mexican officials. 
We even experienced that ourselves, when our group was threatened with arrest while accompanying the three Honduran teens to the border. We had broken no laws. 
And on two separate occasions while crossing back into the United States, members of our Amnesty International delegation were aggressively questioned by border guards about posters and other materials we were carrying, apparently because of their radical and subversive messages about protecting families and welcoming refugees. 
During this journey along the southern US border, my heart and mind repeatedly turned to the northern border. And what I felt was a sense of disgrace that Canada continues to enforce the Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement and maintain the absurd fiction that the United States has a robust asylum system (as I have heard Canadian officials describe it).

That means refugees in the United States, wanting and needing to access refugee protection in Canada, have had to resort to irregular and potentially dangerous border crossings to get here. 
That means that politicians and commentators have spun an inflammatory and untrue narrative of Canada facing waves of illegal migrants sweeping across the border from the United States. 
And it means that the Canadian government has remained entirely and completely silent as this wrenching siege against the rights, safety and dignity of refugees and migrants in the United States has grown more insidious and sinister. 
I think of the conviction of the three Honduran teenagers as I watched them walk through the turnstile and across the border knowing that they almost certainly face more torment and uncertainty at the hands of US authorities. I think of Valquiria’s deep well of sadness but also her steadfast conviction that she must speak out if these injustices are to be exposed and addressed. 
And I demand that same conviction from Canada

“A free press is fundamental for the defence of human rights in any country in the world. The Venezuelan authorities must guarantee that journalists are able to work in safe conditions without fear of reprisal, immediately order the unconditional release of all members of the press who remain in detention and refrain from deporting foreign journalists covering the ongoing protests and institutional crisis.”

Roman Zaitsev was indicted last night under Russia’s repressive “undesirable organizations” law for sharing Open Russia’s articles about activist Anastasia Shevchenko and an Amnesty statement calling for her release. In a further tragic twist this morning, Shevchenko’s 17-year-old daughter died in hospital. The authorities refused Shevchenko permission to visit her until hours before she passed away.
“The government’s crackdown on Open Russia is not only absurd and vicious; it has also reached a new level of cruelty. The persecution of Roman Zaitsev for supporting Anastasia Shevchenko, just at the time of her profound personal tragedy, says a lot about Russia’s heartless ‘justice’ system,” said Marie Struthers, Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International.
“If merely sharing a piece of news about an opposition group becomes a reason for prosecution it potentially puts at risk thousands of people who have reposted, retweeted or quoted Open Russia materials.”
The Prosecutor’s Office of the Central District of Volgograd last night charged Roman Zaitsev, Open Russia’s regional coordinator, with “carrying out the activities of an undesirable organization”.
He is being prosecuted for reposting Open Russia’s news and messages of solidarity for Anastasia Shevchenko, who is a prisoner of conscience.
Anastasia Shevchenko became the first ever person to be criminally charged with “repeated participation in the activities of an undesirable organization” when she was placed under house arrest on 23 January. If convicted, she could face up to six years in prison for her peaceful activism.
A week after Shevchenko’s arrest, her eldest daughter Alina was hospitalized and died of an acute respiratory condition (obstructive bronchitis). The authorities initially dismissed Shevchenko’s request to visit her eldest daughter, who lived in a boarding school for children with special needs.
It was only late last night, hours before her daughter’s passing, that Anastasia was finally given permission to see her.
“The callousness of the Russian authorities’ campaign against Open Russia is unconscionable. Not only has the state placed an innocent person under house arrest for her peaceful activism, but in an act of ultimate cruelty it denied Anastasia Shevchenko the chance to take care of her dying daughter,” said Marie Struthers.
“Anastasia must be freed now, and the spiteful campaign against Open Russia and all peaceful dissenting voices in Russia must end.”

In its prevailing form, the model for advancing with natural resource extraction within the territories of indigenous peoples appears to run counter to the selfdetermination of indigenous peoples in the political, social and economic spheres.”– former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, James Anaya, 2011. 
The governments of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and BC Premier John Horgan have both made welcome and important commitments to upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples, including implementing the key international human rights instrument protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
However, events of the last month —  the forcible arrest of land and water defenders opposing a pipeline on Wet’suwet’en territory and the strong condemnation of the Site C dam by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination —  have focused public attention on the wide gulf between rhetoric and reality. 
At the heart of the matter is the right of free, prior and informed consent, well-established in international law and repeatedly affirmed in the UN Declaration. 
The Horgan and Trudeau governments both claim to respect FPIC. Both are eager to talk about agreements that have been reached with Indigenous peoples. Yet both have demonstrated that they are prepared to ignore the voices of Indigenous peoples when they say ‘no’, even to the point of standing by while police enforce an injunction against traditional authorities whose decisions were ignored in the project approval process. 
Such a selective approach to their human rights obligations is contrary to the letter and spirit of the human rights standards the Trudeau and Horgan governments claim to champion. 
One of the crucial purposes of human rights instruments like the Declaration is to hold governments to a higher standard when there is a conflict between what is politically opportune and what is right. By all means, governments and corporations should be encouraged to seek agreements with Indigenous peoples. But the real test of reconciliation is how they respond when Indigenous peoples say ‘no’, or ‘not yet’. 
Free, prior and informed consent – or FPIC – flows from the right of all peoples to self-determination. Over and over again, the Declaration affirms that Indigenous peoples have the right to make their own decisions about their lives and futures according to their own laws and traditions. This is fundamental. Anything less is a continuation of the structures and practices of colonial domination that the Declaration repudiates. 
FPIC is also a necessary counterpart to the recognition of Indigenous peoples’ continued ownership of their lands and territories. As the Supreme Court said in the Tsilhoqot’in decision, title means the power to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to how the land is used. 
Finally, FPIC is also an essential safeguard for rights that have been systematically abused by colonial states. Quite simply, Indigenous peoples’ control of decisions affecting their lives and futures is the best counter-weight to systemic discrimination in federal, provincial and territorial decision-making. 
In this light, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett was absolutely correct when she said that FPIC is at the “heart” of the Declaration. 
The central importance of FPIC to protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples is precisely why it’s unacceptable for governments to pick and choose when to respect FPIC based on their own agendas. Doing so leaves Indigenous peoples at risk of the very harms that the Declaration seeks to prevent. Ignoring Indigenous peoples when they say ‘no’ also calls into question of those legitimacy of the agreements that are reached. Quite simply, entering into an agreement only because you don’t think there’s any other choice is duress, not consent. 
In other words, a selective approach to FPIC reinforces rather than transforms the underlying unjust relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples. 
It is true that there are circumstances in which the exercise of free, prior and informed consent must be tempered in order to respect and uphold the rights of others. Such a circumstance is provided for in the provisions of the UN Declaration. The Declaration states that the rights of Indigenous peoples shall be subject to “only such limitations as are determined by law and in accordance with international human rights obligations” and that such limitations must be “non-discriminatory and strictly necessary solely for the purpose of security due recognition and respect for others and for meeting the just and most compelling requirements of a democratic society.” 
Does the construction of an oil and gas pipeline or a hydro-dam pass this threshold? Probably not. 
Despite the growing hyperbole around energy development projects, it would be hard to characterize any one project proposal as “strictly necessary.” Projects can be redesigned, finding new routes in the case of pipelines or alternative sources of power in the case of hydro-electric dams. Projects can be delayed until an agreement can be reached. And they can also be abandoned in favour of other projects where consent can be obtained. 
Without a doubt, there can be serious economic consequences for not proceeding with a particular project. But at the same time, there are also financial costs and social and environmental harms that would be avoided. Finding the right balance between benefits and harms is a crucial matter of debate and public policy. But in the end, no matter what balance the government of the day choses to strike, it cannot casually ignore rights protected in international law and the Constitution. Such checks on the decision-making powers of government are a fundamental principle of a Constitutional democracy and of the international human rights system. And nowhere are they more important than when it comes protecting the rights of Indigenous peoples. 
Centuries of colonial laws and policies – which, as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded, were designed with genocidal intent –  have had a devastating impact on health and well-being that Indigenous peoples are working with strength, resilience and determination to overcome. What is required of federal, provincial and territorial governments is active collaboration with Indigenous peoples to right these wrongs and prevent further harm, even if doing so has a cost for Canadian society at large. 
This is what reconciliation requires, not lip service to human rights standards when it is convenient.

Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Alex Neve is currently part of a delegation of senior Amnesty leadership who are visiting the Mexico/USA border to witness the impacts of US policy on migrants and asylum seekers.  
The polarizing and politicized discourse about refugees, migrant and border policy in the United States revolves around ugly chants and a long list of terms and agencies that are at once sinister and incomprehensible: #BuildTheWall, Migration Protection Protocols, ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), Customs and Border Patrol, pushbacks and zero-tolerance. 
But what is truly at stake and so lost in the swirling toxic debate are peoples’ hopes, lives and rights. 
Valquiria and her 7-year-old son Abel, fleeing death threats from criminal gangs in Brazil, came to the US border at El Paso, Texas on 16 March 2018 to make a claim for asylum. They were taken into detention; as is usual, almost automatic. The next day, without explanation, Valquiria was forcibly separated from Abel. She has not seen him since, more than 10 months later. She remains locked up. Abel was released and is now living with his father, who has also made a claim for asylum, in Boston. 
Our Amnesty International delegation visited with Valquiria in detention this morning. Her case was included in our report last year, USA: ‘You don’t have any rights here’ and has been featured as an Urgent Action and appeal case in Canada and around the world. 
There is absolutely no justification for how Valquiria and Abel have been treated. Their asylum claims were made together. There is no doubt about their family relationship. Their papers are in order. An asylum officer has found that her fear is credible but concluded that because her persecutors are criminals and not the state and that there are other places she could live in Brazil, her asylum claim would not be accepted. That ruling is being appealed. 
Meanwhile, Valquiria and Abel remain apart. It seems clear this is part of the Trump Administration’s mean-spirited and punitive assault on the rights of refugees and migrants; striking at the heart of the love between parents and their children in an attempt to shut down the border, wall or no wall. 
Valquiria’s emotions during our visit were wrenching. Between sobs she talked of how painful it is to be apart from Abel, who doesn’t understand why his mother is not with him and why he is in jail. She described how difficult and lonely it is to be the only person in the detention centre who speaks only Portuguese. She remains bewildered at how she is being treated. 
All that anguish, yet she was also so strong. She never wavered from her conviction that publicizing her ordeal was the right thing to do, necessary not only to right the wrongs done to her and Abel, but to help others suffering similar cruel treatment in the US immigration and asylum system. 
She shared her gratitude for all the letters and petitions that have been signed and sent on her behalf and welcomed ongoing pressure. “I’m waiting for a miracle,” she told us; a miracle that will come from continuing to insist that her right to freedom and Abel’s right to be with his mother are upheld. 
Valquiria is one of the fortunate few in immigration custody. She has a dedicated lawyer, Eduardo Beckett, exploring all possible options to win her freedom. Most asylum seekers do not have legal counsel and must navigate this labyrinth of injustice alone. 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump tweets and headlines and newscasts repeat his belligerent rhetoric that there is a grave security crisis – even a national emergency – along the US/Mexico border. And that the only fix is to build the infamous border wall he has repeatedly promised. 
Not so. The only emergency along this border is contempt and disregard for human rights. Tearing apart a mother and her young son, for absolutely no valid reason; that is where the true crisis lies. 
We will continue to push for Valquiria to be released on humanitarian grounds and reunited with Abel. 
And to make it clear. This border does not need a wall. It most certainly does not need more cruelty. It needs compassion. And for human rights to prevail.

For the second time in less than two years, a violent homophobic crackdown has left LGBTI people in Chechnya fearing for their lives. Earlier this week the Russian LGBT Network confirmed reports that the Chechen authorities have resumed large-scale arrests of individuals believed to be gay or lesbian, imprisoning and torturing them.  
According to the organization’s protected sources, around 40 people have been arrested since December and at least two people have died under torture. Police have also reportedly demanded that families of gay and lesbian people commit “honor” killings against their relatives and provide evidence of their murders.  
These appalling reports follow a previous “gay purge” in 2017, which saw hundreds of men detained and tortured and put Chechnya’s dismal human rights record back in the global spotlight.  
I visited the Chechen capital Grozny several times last year. Each time I was struck by the contrast between the shining glass skyscrapers, luxury boutiques and fashionable cafes which line the streets of the city and the almost palpable fear in the air. People choose their words carefully when they speak.  
Arranging meetings with human rights activists requires intricate planning to ensure their anonymity and safety are preserved. The stakes could not be higher: Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has presided over a years-long campaign of harassment, intimidation and violence against human rights activists, which has seen several prominent figures killed for their work and several others imprisoned.  
The people who have documented the attacks on LGBTI people have acted with unimaginable courage, risking arrest, torture, ill treatment and even death if they are identified.  
Behind the glossy facades of the new buildings which keep springing up around Grozny, the walls of homes, shops and offices are crowded with portraits of Kadyrov. It is almost impossible to watch TV or listen to the radio without hearing his name.  
This is a good metaphor for how fear of Kadyrov permeates every aspect of life in Chechnya, and how his system of absolute rule has broken down law and order inside the republic. Anyone who dares to complain about officials or their policies faces public humiliation or worse. Typical punishments for dissent include being forced to make a televised apology, having your house burnt down or having fabricated criminal charges slapped on you.  
With Kadyrov’s face everywhere, it is easy to forget whilst you are in Grozny that Chechnya remains a part of the Russian Federation, which is a signatory to many international human rights treaties. When news of the 2017 crackdown broke, Russian human rights activists and journalists appealed to the federal authorities, demanding an investigation and immediate action to protect the lives of LGBTI people in Chechnya.  
Maxim Lapunov, so far the only victim to speak publicly about his ordeal, filed a formal complaint with the Russian authorities in September 2017. In harrowing detail Maxim described being held for 12 days in a blood-soaked cell, beaten with sticks and having a plastic bag placed over his head. 
In November 2018, after months of denials and obfuscation, the Russian authorities said they were unable to confirm Maxim’s claim and refused to open a criminal investigation into the allegations.  
This crushing blow for justice rang alarm bells for many activists in Chechnya, who knew that without accountability it was only a matter of time before the Chechen authorities resumed their atrocities. Sadly, they have already been proved right.  
In December 2018, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe published a report in which it accused Russia of shielding Chechen officials from scrutiny. Kadyrov knows he has carte blanche when it comes to human rights abuses.  
Nevertheless, following the 2017 crackdown sustained international attention did succeed in temporarily halting the arrests. This shows that Chechen and Russian authorities are not immune to criticism. The international community, therefore, can play an important role in pressurising political elites into acknowledging their crimes and taking meaningful steps to bring those responsible to justice. 
In 2017 the Russian LGBT Network, supported by other NGOs, helped evacuate hundreds of people from Chechnya and in some cases relocated them elsewhere. Several countries, including Canada, France, Germany and Lithuania granted asylum to dozens, though sadly they stand out for their generosity, and other governments were reluctant or too slow to offer protection. 
This time, governments should be prepared to expedite the asylum process so that anyone who wants to leave Chechnya can do so promptly and safely. Above all, they should make it clear to the Chechen authorities that they are watching, and that these horrendous crimes do not happen in darkness.

In a new report,...","Online booking giants Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor are fuelling human rights violations against Palestinians by listing hundreds of rooms and activities in Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land, including East Jerusalem, Amnesty International said today. In a new report, ‘Destination: Occupation’, the organization documents how online booking companies are driving tourism to illegal Israeli settlements and contributing to their existence and expansion.
Israel’s settling of Israeli civilians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime. Despite this, the four companies continue to operate in the settlements, and profit from this illegal situation. 
One of the settlements included in Amnesty International’s report is Kfar Adumim, a growing tourism hub located less than two kilometres from the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, whose imminent and complete demolition by Israeli forces has been given a green light by Israel’s Supreme Court. The expansion of Kfar Adumim and other surrounding settlements is a key driver of human rights violations against the local Bedouin community.
“Israel’s unlawful seizure of Palestinian land and expansion of settlements perpetuates immense suffering, pushing Palestinians out of their homes, destroying their livelihoods and depriving them of basics like drinking water. Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor model themselves on the idea of sharing and mutual trust, yet they are contributing to these human rights violations by doing business in the settlements,” said Seema Joshi, Amnesty International’s Director of Global Thematic Issues.
“The Israeli government uses the growing tourism industry in the settlements as a way of legitimizing their existence and expansion, and online booking companies are playing along with this agenda. It’s time for these companies to stand up for human rights by withdrawing all of their listings in illegal settlements on occupied land. War crimes are not a tourist attraction.”
Airbnb’s policy
In November 2018 Airbnb pledged to remove all listings in settlements in the West Bank, following investigations by Al Jazeera and Human Rights Watch.  However it did not extend its commitment to occupied East Jerusalem, which is also occupied territory, and where it has more than 100 listings in settlements. Amnesty International is calling on Airbnb to implement its announcement and remove all its listings in settlements in occupied territory, including East Jerusalem. Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor should remove all their listings in the OPT.
Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, wherever they operate in the world. Until they remove listings in settlements, all four companies in Amnesty International’s report are in breach of these responsibilities in relation to their activities in the OPT, as well as their own corporate standards.
Promotion of settlement businesses
All four companies in Amnesty International’s report have listings in settlements including East Jerusalem. At the time of writing: 
US-based Airbnb currently has more than 300 listings of properties in settlements in the OPT.
US-based TripAdvisor lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafés, hotels and rental apartments in settlements in the OPT.
Booking.com, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, lists 45 hotels and rentals in settlements in the OPT.
US-based Expedia lists nine accommodation providers, including four large hotels, in settlements in the OPT. 
Profiting from violations
Between February and October 2018 Amnesty International visited four Palestinian villages close to Israeli settlements, as well as the Silwan neighbourhood of East Jerusalem and a Palestinian community in Hebron. All these locations are close to lucrative tourist attractions run by settlers.
Amnesty International found that Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor not only play a significant role in driving tourism to illegal settlements, they also mislead their customers by failing to consistently indicate when listings are located in Israeli settlements.
“Tourists coming here are brainwashed, they are lied to, they do not know this is our land,” said a Palestinian farmer living next to Shiloh settlement, where the Israeli government is funding a large visitor centre to draw tourists to an archaeological site.
The two Palestinian villages next to Shiloh have lost more than 5,500 hectares (55 square kilometres) of land since the late 1990s. Many people have moved away, and those who stay say they are subject to frequent attacks by armed settlers. Airbnb, Booking.com and TripAdvisor all feature listings in Shiloh, but only Booking.com explains that its listing is located inside an Israeli settlement.
In recent years the Israeli government has invested huge sums to develop the tourism industry in settlements. It uses the designation of certain locations as tourist sites to justify the takeover of Palestinian land and homes, and often deliberately constructs settlements next to archaeological sites to emphasize the Jewish people’s historic connections to the region.
Amnesty’s report highlights how the Israeli government allows and encourages settlers to exploit land and natural resources that belong to Palestinians, and how Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor also benefit from this exploitation.
“These companies promote visits to nature reserves, encourage tourists to go on walking trails and desert safaris, and entice visitors to taste wine from local vineyards,” said Seema Joshi.
“Despite the fact that these are illegally appropriated Palestinian natural resources, these activities only benefit settlers and the online companies that do business with them.”
The war crime experience
Amnesty International documented the stark contrast between the tourist experiences on offer in the settlements and the human rights violations inflicted daily on Palestinians in the same areas.
Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor all provide listings for holiday rentals and desert camping “experiences” run by settlers in or near Kfar Adumim settlement.  Some 180 residents of Khan al-Ahmar are at risk of being forcibly evicted by the Israeli army to make way for the illegal expansion of Kfar Adumim and other settlements in the area. Such forcible transfer of people in occupied territory constitutes a war crime. The Israeli authorities have offered the villagers a choice of two possible destinations: a site near the former Jerusalem municipal garbage dump, near the village of Abu Dis, or a site next to a sewage plant close to the city of Jericho.
“Desert Camping Israel”, promoted by Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia, allows guests to pay up to US$235 a night to “experience the tranquillity of the desert and get a taste of warm Israeli hospitality”. TripAdvisor also lists a national park, a museum, a desert tour and a Bible-themed attraction on land near to Kfar Adumim.
“The camping experiences on offer are located on land which the Bedouin used to use for herding. As Kfar Adumim settlement has grown many Bedouin herders have lost their livelihoods and now depend on humanitarian aid,” said Seema Joshi.
“Every penny these companies earn from promoting tourism in Kfar Adumim is a profit from human rights violations. The fact that settlers are using Bedouin culture to draw in tourists adds insult to injury.” 
Inextricably linked to settlement expansion
Amnesty International also visited Khirbet Susiya village, where Palestinian residents live in temporary shelters after they were forcibly evicted from much of the area to make way for the expansion of the neighbouring Susya settlement. The Israeli authorities have blocked water cisterns and wells in Khirbet Susya, and in 2015 the UN estimated that about a third of villagers’ income was spent paying for water.
Susya is built around the ruins of an archaeological site, which at the time of writing was featured on both Airbnb and TripAdvisor along with photographs of places that travellers could visit, including the ruins, an olive grove, winery and vineyard, as well as a large swimming pool in the settlement.
The Israeli government’s development of archaeological sites in settlements like Susya and Shiloh is pivotal to its plans to develop and expand the settlements.
“Promoting these sites to a global audience facilitates the Israeli government’s settlement goals, which is where international tourism companies become essential,” said Seema Joshi.
“The archaeological site in Susya like many other tourist attractions in or near settlements is driving human rights violations against neighbouring Palestinians. By promoting sites like these, online booking companies are complicit in the Israeli government’s illegal endeavour to expand the settlements at all costs.”
The need for legislation
It is not just the tourism industry which is profiting from, and contributing to, illegal settlements.  Hundreds of millions of pounds’ worth of goods produced in Israeli settlements are exported internationally each year, despite the fact that most countries around the world have officially condemned the settlements as illegal under international law.
As well as calling on individual companies to stop doing business in and with the settlements, Amnesty International is calling on governments to make this mandatory through regulation, and to introduce laws prohibiting the import of settlement goods.
“It’s not enough to condemn the settlements as illegal but allow the commercial activities that make them profitable to continue,” said Seema Joshi.
The Irish parliament is currently in the process of approving a landmark bill which would prohibit trade in goods and services with settlements, and Amnesty International is calling on other countries to follow this lead.
Company responses
Prior to publication, Amnesty International wrote to the four companies and provided each with an opportunity to respond to its findings. Booking.com and Expedia provided responses, but Airbnb and TripAdvisor did not.
Amnesty International reviewed the responses in detail and took appropriate account of information provided in updating its findings. Copies of the companies’ responses can be found in the Annex to this report.

At Afghanistan’s Universal Periodic Review last week, member states of the UN Human Rights Council emphasized that the Afghan government needs to do more to introduce a protection mechanism for human rights defenders, implement existing laws, enhance women’s participation, and protect civilians in conflict.
“There have been some welcome advances when it comes to human rights, but there is much more that the Afghan government can do to fulfil its international human rights commitments,” said Samira Hamidi, South Asia Campaigner at Amnesty International.
“A key area of concern is the plight of human rights defenders, who face an even more precarious situation even as the threats to them have risen. There is also an urgent need for stronger investigations and prosecutions to ensure accountability for human rights violations and abuses. And the peace process currently underway must ensure respect for human rights and the rights of victims under international law and other serious violations and abuses of human rights.”
In the first nine months of 2018, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 2,798 civilians were killed and 5,252 injured. The civilian casualties were principally caused by attacks by armed groups but also included airstrikes by government and international forces.
Even as civilian casualties remain near record highs, European countries have continued to forcibly return Afghans in breach of the principle of non-refoulement, putting people at risk of serious human rights violations.
According to a survey published by the International Organization for Migration last May, there are more than 3.5 million displaced people in Afghanistan. One in six Afghans in the country is either an internally displaced person or a returnee.
“It is crucial that the Afghan government make the protection of civilians and support for displaced people a priority. The government must also stop cooperating with forced returns, make clear that returnees are being put in harm’s way, and urge the international community to halt these returns immediately,” said Samira Hamidi.
Background
The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) is a periodic review of the human rights records of all 193 UN Member States. The UPR is a significant innovation of the Human Rights Council which is based on equal treatment for all countries. It provides an opportunity for all States to declare what actions they have taken to improve the human rights situations in their countries and to overcome challenges to the enjoyment of human rights.

Background
Yesterday, opposition party leader Maurice Kamto, president of Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon (MRC), who according to the electoral commission came second in the October 2018 presidential election was arrested in the capital Douala along with two of his supporters Albert Dzongang and Christian Penda Ekoka. They were brought to the Yaoundé ‘’Police Judiciaire’’ and were not allowed to meet their lawyers.
In parallel, two other members of the MRC were arrested. They are Alain Fogue, treasurer of the party and Célestin Djamen who was taken by the police from Douala general hospital where he was undertaking medical care after being wounded by bullet during the weekend protest.
Last weekend the MRC called for public protests or “marches blanches” across the country to protest against alleged mass irregularities in the electoral process.
More than hundred protesters were arrested in Douala, Yaoundé, Dschang, Bafoussam and Bafang. Around 50 were released on Sunday and the remaining have been placed under administrative custody.

“Asia Bibi must finally get her freedom and an end to her ordeal. After nine years behind bars for a crime she didn’t commit, it is difficult to see this long overdue verdict as justice. But she should now be free to reunite with her family and seek safety in a country of her choice.
“The authorities must also resist and investigate any attempts to intimidate the Supreme Court. They have a duty to protect against threats of violence to harm religious minorities or the lives of judges or other government officials.
“This shameful delay in enforcing Asia Bibi’s rights only reinforces the need for the Pakistani government to repeal the blasphemy laws as soon as possible, as well as other laws that discriminate against religious minorities and put their lives in danger.”
Background
Asia Bibi, a Christian farm worker, was sentenced to death for blasphemy in 2010. In late October 2018, Pakistan’s Supreme Court acquitted her of all charges and ordered her immediate release. In the face of pressure from parts of the public involving threats of violence and unrest, the government backtracked and agreed to stop Asia Bibi leaving the country until the Supreme Court heard a “review petition” in her case. She has remained in protective custody since.
On 29 January 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed the review petition and upheld its acquittal.
Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are over broad, vague and coercive. They have been used to target religious minorities, pursue personal vendettas and carry out vigilante violence. On the basis of little or no evidence, the accused struggle to establish their innocence while angry and violent groups of people seek to intimidate the police, witnesses, prosecutors, lawyers and judges.

“Today’s deplorable verdict against Liu Feiyue has nothing to do with justice. He is the latest victim of the Chinese government’s sustained assault against those defending human rights. He is a Prisoner of Conscience who must be immediately and unconditionally released.
“Through his website, Liu Feiyue shone a light on the human rights violations faced by many people in China. But instead of addressing these abuses when they are exposed, the authorities have instead decided to unjustly silence Liu Feiyue.  He should not have been prosecuted nor spent a single day in prison for solely exercising his right to freedom of expression.” 
Background
Liu Feiyue is the founder and director of the Hubei-based human rights website, “Civil Rights and Livelihood Watch” (msguancha.com). The website reports on human rights violations suffered by members of grassroots communities in China, particularly those who have lost their homes due to forced land evictions and petitioned the government to seek redress. The website also posts and reposts other activists’ statements on the detention of human rights defenders and calls for their release.
Liu Feiyue is one of several individuals who have been targeted by the authorities for running human rights related websites. Zhen Jianghua, executive director of “Human Rights Campaign in China”, was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment on 28 December 2018, whileHuang Qi, founder and director of Sichuan-based website “64 Tianwang”, was secretly tried on 14 January 2019 and is awaiting his verdict.
Liu Feiyue was sentenced at Suizhou City Intermediate People’s Court in Hubei province on Tuesday morning.  He was tried on 7 August 2018, but his sentence was not handed down until today. He was placed under criminal detention on 18 November 2016 and formally arrested on 23 December 2016 on suspicion of “inciting subversion of state power”.

Tijuana, Mexico 
We began the day walking across the border between the United States and Mexico, separating San Ysidro, California and Tijuana. We ended the day back at that exact same border post, accompanying three courageous LGBTQ teens from Honduras as they sought, against considerable odds, to lodge their asylum claims with US officials. 
In between we had ample occasion to see and hear firsthand that despite Donald Trump’s toxic rhetoric, the only crisis that is playing out along this frontier is a politically-driven one that spreads distortions and fear on the backs of people – mainly, but not only, from Mexico and Central America – who are fleeing terrifying persecution, endemic violence and grinding poverty. 
It is a crisis of conscience, compassion and justice. 
Crossing into Mexico this morning, our first views were of the wall that already exists along this part of the border. We came back to that wall or saw it a distance several times during the day. It was a stark reminder that the border debate has come down to determination to erect obstacles and deepen divides when what is needed is a commitment to rights and justice that begins long before people make the wrenching decision to leave their homes and head north in the first place. 
We met with Mexico’s National Institute of Migration, the government body charged with border and immigration responsibility. We left with a picture of an agency whose resources and capabilities are overwhelmingly outstripped by a multiplicity of counterpart agencies on the other side of the border; and which struggles to in any way keep apace, let along stand up to the increasingly insidious practices of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Customs and Border Patrol. 
We spent time at the largely volunteer-operated Padre Chava shelter for migrants – those who have yet to make their asylum claims at the border and those who have been deported back from the United States and at the, again, impressively overwhelmingly volunteer-run Al Otro Lado initiative, which offers a range of legal, protection, food and health programs for migrants. 
 
I came away from those two centres filled up with anguished personal accounts, revealing statistics and overviews of a wide range of programs that filled me with immense gratitude and respect for committed staff and a constant flow of volunteers; but also despair and outrage that it has come to this. Programs that rely on grit and benevolence in the face of billions of dollars devoted to enforcement devoid of compassion. 
And so it was that what should have been a simple and straightforward matter became a tense and uncertain exercise. Three LGBTQ teens from Honduras, whose refugee claims are clearly strong and well-founded, needed more than 20 advocates from Amnesty International and three other organizations to accompany them to the border tonight, to ensure that their entirely lawful request for protection would be treated seriously and lawfully. 
Because they are minors, their claims had to be accepted, exempted from all the unlawful excuses and bureaucracy that can keep other refugees waiting on the Mexican side of the border for months to file their asylum requests. Yet there was every reason to believe that they might be turned away and turned back instead to Mexico where they are certainly not safe. Activists on the ground here can quickly recite a sad, long list of such cases. 
There were so many points along the way when it could have gone awry, including when Mexican officials might have forced them back, or private security contracted by the Mexican government might have intervened. We made it past those pitfalls and arrived at the turnstile which is the entry point into the United States. 
Without documents the three teens were told they could not come through. When they made their asylum claims they were told they had to leave and add their names to the unofficial list that determines which individuals can come to the border on which day to make their claims. That was outright wrong, as it is US policy at the highest level that unaccompanied minors do not have to wait the weeks or months for their name to slowly climb to the top of “the list”. 
We made it clear that these three teens were not going away, nor were we. We were told a supervisor was on the way. A Mexican immigration official was sent out to talk to us. We did not go away. 
And they did relent, begrudgingly. Amnesty International USA’s Director Margaret Huang and a colleague from Amnesty International Mexico were eventually allowed to accompany the three boys through the turnstiles and into a back office where their claims were lodged and they were taken into custody.

How upside-down it is that we have come to see victory in three vulnerable refugees being taken into the cruelty of US immigration detention. But that is precisely what it has become. 
Just for a moment, all in the same experience this evening: the heartlessness of US border policy; the brave determination of three young refugees; and the vitality of solidarity and support. 
Those three teens, brave but afraid, are very much in my heart tonight.

What Amnesty International is hearing from northern Manitoba directly parallels the pattern of systemic violence that Amnesty International documented in its 2016 report on the social impacts—and notably, the gender impacts—of work camps and other aspects of energy development in northeast British Columbia. The concerning allegations underscore just how important it is that the voices of Indigenous peoples – especially Indigenous women – are heard and listened to when decisions are made about large dams and other resource development projects.
“We believe it is critical that the province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro make it a real priority to work in collaboration with First Nations to address historic wrongs and prevent further human rights violations,” said Jackie Hansen, Gender Rights Campaigner with Amnesty International Canada.
Much of Amnesty International’s research and advocacy on the rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada has been driven by requests from Indigenous advocates, leaders and community members. Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) recently approached Amnesty International and shared concerns about the harmful impacts of energy development on community members, and most notably on Indigenous women and girls. On January 23, 2019 at the Chiefs General Assembly on Health Transition and Transformation, MKO chiefs passed a resolution calling for an inquiry into racism, discrimination, harassment, and sexual violence against Indigenous community members at past and present hydroelectric development projects in northern Manitoba, and in the resolution specifically expressed support for Amnesty International to further study this issue with impacted First Nations. Amnesty International appreciates the inclusion of collaboration between Amnesty International and MKO in the resolution. Amnesty International has every intention of looking more deeply into the concerns raised by MKO leadership, York Factory First Nation, and grassroots advocates this year.

“The crackdown on peaceful protests across several cities undermine the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Cameroon. The authorities must end repression of protests and uphold the country’s constitutional and international human rights obligations.
“Peaceful demonstrations are systematically banned in Cameroon in a bid to repress any dissent and more than hundred protesters were arrested over the week-end. 
“Several protesters, including a lawyer and an activist, were beaten and were wounded by shots from security forces.

Background
On Saturday 26 January, opposition party Movement for the Renaissance of Cameroon (MRC), the party of Maurice Kamto who arrived second at the October 2018 presidential election, called for public protests or “marches blanches” in all over the country to contest alleged mass irregularities during the electoral process.
Security forces, in response to the protests-which were not authorized- used excessive force against demonstrators. Seven people were shot and injured in the city of Douala, while other protesters were beaten.
More than hundred protesters were arrested in Douala, Yaoundé, Dschang, Bafoussam and Bafang. Around 50 were released on Sunday and the remaining have been placed under administrative custody. 
Rene Emmanuel Sadi, the Government spokesperson, denied use of live ammunition against protesters but social media are still showing sequences of automatic gunfire in Douala and a member of the riot police shooting at the legs of a protester.

“Today’s verdict is a gross injustice. It’s outrageous that Wang Quanzhang is being punished for peacefully standing up for human rights in China. He must be immediately and unconditionally released.
“In the three years leading up to his sham of a trial, the authorities disappeared Wang Quanzhang into a black hole, where he was likely tortured. Wang’s family, who continue to be harassed by the authorities, didn’t even know if he was alive until recently. His continued imprisonment only prolongs their suffering.”
Background
Wang Quanzhang was the last lawyer awaiting a verdict in connection with the Chinese government’s mass crackdown in 2015, which targeted nearly 250 human rights lawyers and activists.
Wang was sentenced today at Tianjin Municipal No.2 Intermediate People’s Court. His trial on 26 December 2018 followed more than three years in pre-trial detention. His wife, Li Wenzu, was blocked by the authorities from leaving her apartment complex ahead of the trial to stop her from attending.
Wang Quanzhang was originally detained by police on 3 August 2015. It was only in July 2018 that a lawyer informed his family that Wang was alive and being held in Tianjin.
Before his detention, Wang Quanzhang worked on issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government, such as defending religious freedom and representing members of the New Citizens’ Movement, a network of grassroots activists who promote government transparency and expose corruption. Due to his role in representing such cases, Wang faced frequent intimidation prior to his detention.

“Today’s verdict is yet another nail in the coffin for the right to freedom of expression in Bahrain and exposes the country’s justice system as a complete farce. The decision to uphold Sheikh Ali Salman’s conviction and life prison sentence following an unfair trial highlights the authorities’ determination to silence critical voices.
“The Bahraini authorities must quash Sheikh Ali Salman’s conviction and release him immediately and unconditionally. They should also rescind the decision to dissolve the two opposition political groups, al-Wefaq and Wa’ad, and guarantee the right of everyone to freedom of association.”
Background:
Sheikh Ali Salman is the Secretary General of Bahrain’s main political opposition group, al-Wefaq. He has been repeatedly arrested and charged for his perceived critical views of the authorities.
The case against Sheikh Ali Salman is based on recorded telephone conversations he had with the-then Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al Thani, in 2011.
On 4 November 2018, he was sentenced to life imprisonment after being convicted of trumped-up spying charges. Two other al-Wefaq members, Ali al-Aswad and Sheikh Hassan Sultan, were convicted in their absence during the same trial.
In December 2018, Sheikh Ali Salman finished serving a separate four-year prison sentence handed to him on 16 June 2015 after an unfair trial on charges related to his perceived critical political views.
Opposition parties al-Wefaq and Wa’ad were both prevented from participating in Bahrain’s elections in November 2018.

As the tenth anniversary of the end of Sri Lanka’s internal conflict looms in May, progress on UN Human Rights Council Resolution 30/1 has proceeded at a glacial pace, the hopes of the victims of crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses during the conflict have been reduced to a flicker.
“Where we have seen welcome and notable progress, it has been frustratingly slow. Meanwhile other commitments have seen no progress at all, especially when it comes to accountability. With the ten-year anniversary of the end of the conflict fast approaching, how much longer must the victims wait for the justice, truth and reparation they deserve?” said Dinushika Dissanayake, South Asia Research Director at Amnesty International.
“The Sri Lankan government and the international community must ensure that work on Resolution 30/1 is a priority going forward. Any extensions given to the Sri Lankan authorities must include clear, time-bound deadlines for delivery. The transitional justice process must not fall of the agenda.”
Glacial progress on disappearances, reparations and land
The new briefing, Flickering Hope: Truth, Justice, Reparations and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence in Sri Lanka, highlights key advances made – including the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons (OMP), the publication of the office’s interim report, and the return of land that was long occupied by the military to communities in the orth.
However, as the briefing points out, the recommendations of the interim OMP report have yet to be implemented. An Office of Reparations Bill was passed in October 2018, but the office itself has not been established.
While substantial portions of land occupied by the Sri Lankan military for several years has been returned, communities remain displaced. By some estimates, the total land occupied by the military amounted to tens of thousands of acres. In October 2018, President Maithripala Sirisena finally called on the authorities to return land in the north and the east to its rightful owner by the end of the year. The authorities are yet to fully comply with this request.
Scant progress on accountability
There have been welcome investigations opened into cases of attacks on journalists, human rights defenders, religious minorities and civil society organizations. These investigations, however, have not resulted in any convictions.
There has also been dismayingly limited progress on accountability for torture, rape, sexual abuse and gender-based violence. Delays in prosecutions also extend to human rights abuses committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
Under Resolution 30/1, a judicial mechanism – including the participation of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, also referred to as ‘hybrid courts’ was proposed by the Sri Lankan government. To date, there has been no progress on this front. In fact, the government has only backtracked on its own commitment.
Legal reforms
One of the most notorious drivers of abuse during the conflict years in Sri Lanka, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, still remains on the books and has not been repealed. The proposed law to replace the PTA – the Counter Terrorism Bill- does not meet international law and standards. In the present form, it will remain open to abuse by the security forces as the PTA. The law relating to victims and witness protection also needs to be amended to bring it in line with international law and standards.

Dozens of civil society leaders, activists, opposition leaders and suspected organizers of the national protests against a massive increase in fuel prices have gone into hiding, fearing for their lives.
At least 12 people have been killed and dozens more injured by the security forces since protests began on 14 January. Up to 700 people, including minors, have been detained after being arrested on trumped-up charges, or brought before courts in hearings that do not meet fair trial standards. Hundreds have been denied bail.
“The onslaught by the security forces in Zimbabwe has seen people killed, arbitrarily arrested, abducted, reportedly raped and jailed on suspicion of taking part in the protests. Children as young as 11 years old have been detained on frivolous charges,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“The Zimbabwean authorities must immediately halt their menacing threats towards civil society leaders, activists, opposition leaders and suspected organizers of protests. The authorities must ensure that those who violated and continue to violate human rights face justice.”
Amnesty International has documented a systematic pattern of human rights violations, including restrictions on public assembly, excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests and internet shutdown by the security forces throughout the national stay-away.
The call for people to stay at home and not report for work was prompted by President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s announcement of a 150 percent increase in fuel prices on 12 January. An uneasy calm has since returned to Zimbabwe following days of disruptions to businesses because of the crackdown.
Excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests
The Zimbabwean security forces responded to the protests by deploying the military, the police and intelligence agents. Security forces used excessive and lethal force to disperse protesters with tear gas, batons, water cannons and live ammunition.
The crackdown also resulted in mass arbitrary arrests and beatings of protesters. Security forces conducted door-to-door searches and arrested those they suspected of organizing the stay-away.
Between 600 and 700 people, including activists and civil society leaders, have been arbitrarily detained, many of them on trumped-up charges.
Well-known local pastor and activist, Evan Mawarire, was arrested at his home in Harare in the early hours of 16 January. A dozen police officers armed with AK-47s picked him up and he was later charged with inciting public violence. This charge was then amended to subverting a constitutional government. He is being detained at Harare Central Remand Prison after being denied bail on 18 January.
Internet shutdown
A national internet shutdown was sanctioned by the authorities on 15 January, resulting in an information blackout across the country. Internet access has since been sporadic, affecting many people who rely on it for financial transactions such as buying basic goods due to the shortage of cash in the country. 
Security forces have also targeted the doctors providing much-needed medical treatment to injured people both in hospitals and in prisons, preventing them from doing their work. Three medical doctors, who are members of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), were denied access to injured people in police detention and prison. Authorities have accused a local medical NGO, Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, of supporting the protests by treating the injured.
“A Zimbabwe that is prosperous and based on the rule of law will never be built by brutalizing dissent. The authorities must immediately stop this merciless crackdown on activists, civil society leaders and others who are guilty of nothing more than exercising their right to freedom of expression,” said Deprose Muchena.
Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to demonstrate genuine commitment to human rights including by fully respecting, protecting, promoting and fulfilling the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association, expression and fair trials.
The organization is also calling on the authorities to respect human rights of everyone, including political opponents, human rights defenders and activists, civil society leaders, journalists and other people with differing views perceived to be critical of the authorities.
“President Mnangagwa has called on all Zimbabweans to come together during this difficult moment. That must include respecting human rights,” said Deprose Muchena.
Background
On 12 January, President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced a fuel price hike, which took effect on 13 January. The prices of both diesel and petrol, required for the transportation of people and consumer goods in Zimbabwe, went up by 150 per cent.
In response, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), the largest labour organization in the country, called for a national stay-away, beginning on 14 January.
The authorities responded with a nationwide crackdown to suppress the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression.

The delegation will be traveling from January 27 to 31. They will be meeting with Mexican and US authorities, documenting conditions at shelters in Tijuana for families and individuals whom the US had denied access to asylum protections, and meeting with non-governmental organizations directly working with asylum-seekers and migrants in El Paso.
The delegation includes ; Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada ; Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA; Tania Reneaum, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico; Colm O’Gorman, executive director of Amnesty International Ireland; Philippe Hensmans, director of Amnesty International Belgium; and John Peder Egenes, head of Amnesty International Norway. They will be joined by Mary Meg MacCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center.
Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, stated:
“We have come together to show the US government that the eyes of the world are on the southern border. While President Trump continues to fight for a border wall, thousands of children and families are being forced to wait for protection while enduring dangerous conditions in Mexico.
“The US government has manufactured this crisis, defying international law while heartlessly putting families and individuals in harm’s way. Families and individuals traveling to the border are not a national security crisis—they are people like you and me, except that they have left their home to seek protection from persecution and violence. We must not abandon those who have lost everything and are trying to rebuild their lives.”
Amnesty International has previously documented the range of human right violations committed by the US government against people seeking asylum at the southern border with Mexico, including illegal pushbacks, ill-treatment in immigration detention, and devastating policies such as family separation and detention.

These reports follow similar testimonies from November 2018 into the torture of a number of the activists, and highlight the urgent need to allow independent monitors access to those in detention, the organization said today.
According to the testimonies, a total of ten human rights defenders were tortured, sexually abused, and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment during their first three months of detention, when they were held in an informal detention facility in an unknown location.
One woman activist was wrongly told by an interrogator that her family members had died, and was made to believe this for an entire month. According to another account, two activists were forced to kiss each other while interrogators watched. One activist reported that interrogators had forced water into her mouth as she was shouting while being tortured. Others reported being tortured with electric shocks.
“We are extremely concerned about the wellbeing of these activists, who have been in arbitrary detention for around nine months simply for standing up for human rights,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
“The Saudi Arabian authorities have repeatedly proven themselves unwilling to effectively protect detainees from torture, or to carry out impartial investigations into claims of torture in custody. That is why we are calling on Saudi Arabia to give independent monitoring bodies immediate and unfettered access to the detained activists.”
In November 2018 Amnesty International documented how several activists who had been in arbitrary detention since May 2018, including a number of women, had been repeatedly tortured by electric shocks and flogging, leaving some unable to walk or stand properly. The new testimonies reveal that more activists from this group were subjected to this kind of torture.
In December 2018, Amnesty International wrote to the Saudi Arabian authorities requesting that independent monitoring bodies, including international organizations such as Amnesty International or UN human rights mandates, be given access to the human rights defenders, but the organization has received no response to date.
After Amnesty International and others reported on the claims of torture and sexual harassment in November, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Media dismissed the claims, calling them “baseless”. In December, Amnesty International received information that Saudi Arabia’s government-aligned Human Rights Commission (HRC) had met with the detained women and questioned them about the claims of torture. Following the Saudi Arabian HRC’s visit, officials from Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution also reportedly visited the detained activists in prison to investigate the claims of torture.
“We are calling on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all human rights defenders who are being detained solely for their peaceful human rights work,” said Lynn Maalouf.
The organization is also calling on the authorities to allow for independent monitors to investigate these claims, to establish the facts in an impartial manner, and identify those responsible.
Background information:
Several activists who were arbitrarily detained in the May 2018 crackdown, including women human rights defenders who were tortured, sexually harassed and otherwise ill-treated during the first three months of their detention, remain in detention without charge and with no legal representation.
In December, some of the human rights defenders were moved from Dhahban Prison in Jeddah, where they had been detained since August, to Al-Ha’ir Prison in Riyadh. They included: Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Shadan al-Anezi and Nouf Abdulaziz.
Samar Badawi and Amal al-Harbi are currently detained in Dhahban Prison in Jeddah. Nassima al-Sada, who has also been detained since June 2018, is now detained in al-Mabahith Prison in Dammam. So far none of the human rights defenders have been officially charged or referred to trial.
Others who have been in arbitrary detention without charge since the wave of arrests in May 2018 include Abdulaziz al-Mish’al and Mohammad al-Rabe’a. Mohammad al-Bajadi, founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, and Khalid al-Omeir, an activist who has served a prison sentence for his human rights activism, also remain in detention without charge.
Activists have also reported the detention of other women’s rights activists and academics, including Mayaa al-Zahrani, Dr. Abir Namankani, Dr Ruqayyah al-Mharib and Dr. Hatoon al-Fassi. In December, prominent lawyer and human rights advocate Dr. Ibrahim al-Modeimigh, who was detained in the May 2018 crackdown, was released. The conditions of his release remain unknown.

At least 4 journalists arbitrarily detained last year
Raiding of media organizations is increasing climate of fear 
The clampdown by Nigerian authorities on the press, including by raiding media organizations and arbitrarily detaining journalists, is having a chilling effect preventing people from freely expressing themselves, Amnesty International said today.
In 2018, at least four journalists were arrested in Nigeria, double the number in 2017, the organization revealed as it launches “Press For Freedom” a campaign to support freedom of expression in Nigeria. In the first week of 2019 alone, security forces raided the Abuja and Maiduguri offices of the Daily Trust newspaper, arresting two reporters and confiscating computers and mobile phones.
“We launched this campaign because there is an increasing climate of fear across newsrooms in Nigeria as it becomes harder for journalists to do their job. More and more, the authorities are responding to critical reporting with arrests, raids and intimidation,” said Osai Ojigho, Director Amnesty International Nigeria.
“Journalists are coming under attack in Nigeria, facing increased risks simply for publishing articles and demanding accountability from the authorities. This is totally unacceptable. The authorities must immediately put an end to the hostile environment journalists are facing.”
Amnesty International has been examining cases of journalists who were detained, threatened or intimidated over the past five years. Investigation reveals a disturbing escalation in the authorities’ threats and attacks against Nigerian journalists who have expressed critical opinions of the government on both conventional and social media.
In some cases, security forces intimidated journalists who had asked probing questions or expressed critical opinions of government policies.
Journalists arbitrarily detained and threatened
In 2018, journalists Tony Ezimakor of the Daily Independent, Musa Abdullahi Kirishi of the Daily Trust, Samuel Ogundipe of the Premium Times and Olanrewaju Lawal of the Daily Sun were detained at various times, just for carrying out their jobs.
The year before, Dapo Olorunyomi, publisher of the online newspaper Premium Times, was arrested alongside Evelyn Okakwu, a correspondent, when security personnel raided their office on 17 January 2017. The arrest came after the newspaper had published a story about the Nigerian Chief of Army Staff, alleging that he had not declared a property he owned in Dubai in breach of the Army Code of Ethics. Both journalists were later released without charge.
On 23 July 2016, Abiri Jones, a publisher of Weekly Source, was arrested by members of the Department of State Services, Nigeria’s secret police, and held incommunicado without access to family or lawyers for two years. He was released in 15 August 2018.
In August 2016, an arrest warrant was issued against journalist Ahmed Salkida after having reported on the ongoing Boko Haram conflict. He was accused of ‘links’ to Boko Haram. Though he was not charged he has since received death threats.
In October 2018, publisher Ja’afar Ja’afar at the online Daily Nigerian also received several death threats against himself and his family after publishing videos of a serving governor allegedly receiving a bribe.
“Federal and state authorities must ensure journalists are able to exercise their right to freedom of expression as provided for in international human rights law and the Nigerian constitution. The government must ensure that state officials do not harass and intimidate anyone who expresses opinions that those in power dislike,” said Osai Ojigho.
Raids and confiscations
Over the past two years, two radio stations critical of the government were stopped from broadcasting. The facilities of Breeze FM in Lafiya, Nasarawa state, and Fresh FM in Ibadan, Oyo State, were demolished by state authorities allegedly for their non-compliance with land administration laws. Both stations were previously harassed by the authorities and were part of a targeted campaign to silence dissenting voices.
In January 2017, security forces raided the Abuja office of Premium Times and held journalists under siege for several hours.
In June 2014, military officers tried to stop the circulation of several publications by confiscating copies of Nigeria’s Leadership, Daily Trust, The Nation and Punch newspapers. They also harassed distributors of these papers to prevent people from buying copies.
“Journalists must be free to investigate and report on issues of human rights and public interest. The authorities must immediately stop their campaign of stifling the press and silencing dissenting voices. No one should be punished for asking questions or expressing their opinion on the government,” said Osai Ojigho.

Tens of thousands took to the streets to demand greater protections for human rights during the 25 January revolution of 2011, but under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi the space for dissent is being crushed out of existence.
Over the course of 2018, the Egyptian authorities arrested at least 113 people simply for peacefully expressing their views. Many were detained without trial for months and then prosecuted on charges including “membership of terrorist groups” and “disseminating false news” in unfair trials, including in front of military courts.
“Today it is more dangerous to openly criticize the government in Egypt than at any other time in the country’s recent history. Those living under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi have experienced an unprecedented assault that has seen those who peacefully express their views treated as criminals,” said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.
“Over the past year, people who dared to criticise the government have been arrested and sent to prison, often held in solitary confinement or subjected to enforced disappearances simply for posting their opinions on social media, giving media interviews, denouncing sexual harassment and even for supporting certain football clubs. In some cases, those arrested had done nothing at all. Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s administration, Egypt has been converted into an open-air prison for critics.”
In the wake of the crackdown on freedom of expression, Amnesty International launched the campaign Egypt: Open air prison for critics, to put pressure on the Egyptian authorities to end attacks on the right to freedom of expression and ensure everyone is able to express their views and opinions without fear of reprisals.

0,Mexico: State protection measures were not enough to prevent the killing of environmental defender Julián Carrillo,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/mexico-state-protection-measures-were-not-enough-to-prevent-the-killing-of-environmental-defender-julian-carrillo/,"The Mexican state failed in its obligation to ensure the effective protection of the environmental human rights defender Julián Carrillo, said Amnesty International in the report Caught between bullets and neglect: Lack of protection for defenders of the territory in the Sierra Tarahumara,...","The Mexican state failed in its obligation to ensure the effective protection of the environmental human rights defender Julián Carrillo, said Amnesty International in the report Caught between bullets and neglect: Lack of protection for defenders of the territory in the Sierra Tarahumara, published today, three months after his death.
“The Indigenous Rarámuri people of the community of Coloradas de la Virgen have for years faced a series of attacks and threats because of their work defending human rights and their ancestral territory,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“The killing of Julián Carrillo is the most obvious and appalling evidence of the Mexican authorities’ failure to comply with their obligation to guarantee effective protection from all types of violence, threats or reprisals resulting from their work defending human rights.”
On 24 October 2018, armed men entered the community of Coloradas de la Virgen, in the northern state of Chihuahua, and killed Julián Carrillo, an Indigenous Rarámuri leader. He had previously been the victim of threats and harassment linked to his defence of ancestral territory in the Sierra Tarahumara. At least five other members of his family have been killed in recent years.
Three months after his death, the Mexican authorities have still not identified those responsible and brought them to justice. Amnesty International calls on the Mexican state to take urgent measures to end impunity for attacks against inhabitants of Coloradas de la Virgen, and to carry out thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the killing of Julián Carrillo and other members of his family.
In 2014, following its assessment of the serious threats that Julián Carrillo faced, the Ministry of the Interior’s Protection Mechanism for Human Rights Defenders and Journalists granted him protection measures. However, the measures – which included satellite phones, panic buttons and police escorts when he travelled – were not enough to prevent him being killed.
Amnesty International has found that the authorities’ analysis failed to take into account the context of poverty, marginalization, discrimination, lack of access to basic services, the presence of organized crime or the inaccessibility of the Sierra. As a result, the measures were not adequate or sufficient to respond to the structural causes of violence in Coloradas de la Virgen or to guarantee the safety of those defending human rights and Rarámuri territory.
Amnesty International urges Mexico’s new federal government to develop, as a matter of urgency and in consultation with civil society and human rights defenders, a comprehensive public policy to ensure that defenders can carry out their work in the country in safety.
“The Mexican authorities cannot continue to limit the protection of human rights defenders to a mechanism that does not work,” said Tania Reneaum, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico.
“The government must adopt without delay a comprehensive public policy that addresses the structural causes that give rise to the dangers facing human rights defenders. Defending the territory and the environment should not be a death sentence.”
Additional information
Weeks before his murder, Julián Carrillo said in an interview with Amnesty International that his greatest concern was the high level of violence in Coloradas caused by the presence of organized crime and the divisions in the community created by the granting of ejido (communal land ownership) rights to people who do not belong to the community.
According to Julián Carrillo and other members of the community, organized criminal networks have appropriated Indigenous territory to sow illicit crops, especially cannabis and opium poppy. Many members of the community have been displaced to nearby cities and Indigenous leaders and their families have received numerous threats, including death threats.
In September 2018, Julián Carrillo told Amnesty International that he believed that his relatives were threatened and killed because of their work defending human rights and their territory. He also revealed that he had received threats for denouncing the effects of organized crime in the territory of Coloradas.
Approximately two weeks before Julián Carrillo was killed, members of the community reported to various state and federal authorities that a mining concession on their territory had been granted to three individuals, and they requested urgent measures to guarantee the safety of members of the community in Coloradas given the situation of extreme violence generated by organized crime.
Days later, Amnesty International observed a community assembly in which Julián Carrillo expressed opposition to the mining concession because of its environmental and social impact and because it could lead to a rise in violence in the area.

“The Chinese authorities have serious questions to answer over the detention of Yang Hengjun, but it could be months before we find out anything more about his condition or what they’re accusing him of doing.
“If it’s true that Yang is being held under ‘residential surveillance in a designated location’, then there is cause for serious concern over his wellbeing. Facing up to six months in incommunicado detention at an unknown location with no contact with the outside world, Yang Hengjun is at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment.
“These conditions are simply unacceptable. We urge Chinese officials to be transparent, disclose where he is held and grant Yang Hengjun immediate access to both a lawyer of his choosing and Australian consular officials. There are no excuses for the Chinese authorities to deny Yang these rights.”
Background
Yang Hengjun, a prominent writer and occasional critic of the Chinese government, was detained on Saturday when he arrived in Guangzhou in southern China from New York. The Australian citizen was recently a visiting scholar at Columbia University in the US.
In recent years, the Chinese authorities have increasingly used “residential surveillance in a designated location” to detain activists, human rights lawyers and government critics. Under this system, people suspected of “terrorism”, major bribery or state security offences can be held outside the formal detention system at an undisclosed location for up to six months, with no contact with the outside world, leaving the detainee at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

0,Canadian company before Supreme Court of Canada in major corporate accountability case,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/canadian-company-before-supreme-court-of-canada-in-major-corporate-accountability-case/,"On January 23, an important legal case against Nevsun Resources will be heard before the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2014, three Eritrean men filed a claim against Nevsun seeking accountability for disturbing human rights abuses -including allegations of torture and forced labour – during the...","In 2014, three Eritrean men filed a claim against Nevsun seeking accountability for disturbing human rights abuses -including allegations of torture and forced labour – during the construction of the company’s gold and copper mine in Bisha, Eritrea. According to documents filed in the BC court, the company had prior knowledge of the country’s National Service Program and understood the likelihood that its business relationships would involve the use of conscripted labour. The United Nations has said that the widespread use of forced labour in the country may constitute a crime against humanity. 
The plaintiffs are asking Canadian courts to hold Nevsun accountable for benefitting from violations of their human rights. Bringing these crimes to justice is vital because impunity only fuels the belief that those responsible for corporate crimes are untouchable. 
For more than a decade, human rights defenders and their civil society partners in Canada have brought case after case before Parliament, in which defenders have outlined the human rights abuses they experienced in the context of Canadian mining operations. 
In 2018, the federal government was forced to respond to this crisis: it announced the establishment of an Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise to investigate such complaints and hold corporate actors to account. But we’re not there yet. One year on, Canada has yet to establish the Ombudsperson and Canadian courts have yet to hold a mining company accountable for human rights abuses at any Canadian overseas mine. There are two more civil lawsuits currently before Canadian courts for human rights abuses at Canadian mines in Guatemala. 
On Wednesday, Nevsun will make three arguments to the Supreme Court of Canada in its attempt to have the case against it overturned: it will claim that Canada does not have jurisdiction to rule on the validity of the acts of sovereign, foreign governments within their own territory. In other words, Nevsun will argue that Canada has no right to rule on the validity of Eritrea’s national service program.   
It will also argue that Canadian courts should not be able to regulate Canadian corporate actions abroad when those companies are in partnership with foreign governments. Finally, it will argue that Canadian courts should not apply international law principles to private actors, like companies; only States should be subject to international law principles. 
However, the Eritrean government isn’t on trial in Ottawa this week: Nevsun is. And Amnesty believes that corporate actors should not be able to dodge accountability for their part in human rights abuse allegations by using procedural manoeuvers such as the ones Nevsun has put forward.  
Amnesty International will be in court tomorrow as an expert intervener in the proceedings. Please check back for our analysis and further action.

Eritrea’s National Service program obliges young Eritreans to participate in 6 months of military training and 12 months of military deployment or government service. In 2002, the government extended the 18-month service period – with little to no pay- to an indefinite period of time, although the government promised in 2014 to end indefinite national service. There is no evidence it has done so, nor that it has demobilized those already in the national service for more than 18 months. 
The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea noted that many national service conscripts lack adequate food, shelter, water, hygienic facilities, and medical services. Young people who try to evade or desert from Eritrea’s national service program often find themselves facing arrest and arbitrary detention; some are captured, punished and sent for military training. Those detained do not have access to lawyers or family members during their incarceration. 
Amnesty calls on the Eritrean government to demobilize national service conscripts who have served more than 18 months of service and provide reparations, including compensation proportionate to excess time served. We also call on Eritrea to end the practice of assigning National Service conscripts as labour to private companies. Finally, we call on the government of Eritrea to ensure conscripts are provided with accommodations and conditions which comply with international human rights standards, guaranteeing their rights to food, water, adequate housing and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.

The organization has today revealed staggering new figures showing the extent of the Iranian authorities’ repression during 2018. Over the course of the year, more than 7,000 protesters, students, journalists, environmental activists, workers and human rights defenders, including lawyers, women’s rights activists, minority rights activists and trade unionists, were arrested, many arbitrarily. Hundreds were sentenced to prison terms or flogging and at least 26 protesters were killed. Nine people arrested in connection with protests died in custody under suspicious circumstances.
“2018 will go down in history as a ‘year of shame’ for Iran. Throughout the year Iran’s authorities sought to stifle any sign of dissent by stepping up their crackdown on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, and carrying out mass arrests of protesters,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director.
“The staggering scale of arrests, imprisonments and flogging sentences reveal the extreme lengths the authorities have gone to in order to suppress peaceful dissent.”
Throughout the year and particularly during the months of January, July and August, the Iranian authorities violently dispersed peaceful demonstrations, beating unarmed protesters and using live ammunition, tear gas and water cannons against them. Thousands of people were arbitrarily arrested and detained.
Some of those swept up in the wave of arrests during the January protests were students, human rights defenders and journalists. Also targeted were the managers of channels on the popular mobile messaging application Telegram, which was used to disseminate news about the protests and to mobilize demonstrators.
Overall in 2018, whether in the context of protests or as a result of their work 11 lawyers, 50 media workers and 91 students were detained arbitrarily.
At least 20 media workers were sentenced to harsh prison or flogging sentences after unfair trials. One journalist, Mohammad Hossein Sodagar, from the Azerbaijani Turkic ethnic minority, was flogged 74 times in the city of Khoy in West Azerbaijan province after being convicted of “spreading lies”. Another media worker, Mostafa Abdi, who is an administrator of the Majzooban-e-Noor website, which reports on human rights abuses against the Gonabadi Dervish religious minority, was sentenced to 26 years and three months in prison, 148 lashes, and other punishments.
In addition, at least 112 women human rights defenders were arrested or remained in detention in Iran during 2018.
Women’s rights defenders
Throughout 2018, brave women’s rights defenders across the country joined an unprecedented protest movement against the abusive and discriminatory forced hijab (veiling) laws in Iran. Women took to the streets and stood on top of raised structures in public places, silently waving their headscarves on the ends of sticks. In response, they suffered a bitter backlash from the authorities, facing violent assault, arrest and torture and other ill-treatment. Some were sentenced to prison terms after grossly unfair trials.
Shaparak Shajarizadeh was sentenced to 20 years in prison, 18 of which were suspended, for her peaceful protest against forced hijab. She fled Iran after she was released on bail and has since described in media interviews how she was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in solitary confinement and denied access to her lawyer.
Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human rights lawyer and women’s rights defender, who represented Shaparak Shajarizadeh, was herself arrested on 13 June 2018 for defending protesters against forced hijab. She faces several national security-related charges which could see her sentenced to more than a decade in prison, in addition to the five-year sentence she is already serving for her work against the death penalty.
“Throughout 2018, the Iranian authorities waged a particularly sinister crackdown against women’s rights defenders. Instead of cruelly punishing women for demanding their rights, the authorities should put an end to the rampant and entrenched discrimination and violence they face,” said Philip Luther.
Workers’ rights and trade unionists
The year 2018 also saw Iran engulfed in a deepening economic crisis which triggered numerous strikes and spurred workers to take to the streets in their thousands to call for better working conditions and protections by the government. Delays and non-payment of wages amidst high levels of inflation, skyrocketing living costs and poor working conditions also provoked protests.
Instead of addressing their complaints, however, the Iranian authorities arrested at least 467 workers, including teachers, truck drivers and factory workers, summoned others for questioning and subjected many to torture and other ill-treatment. Dozens were sentenced to prison terms. Iranian courts also handed down flogging sentences amounting to a total of nearly 3,000 lashes against 38 workers.
On 10 May, the Iranian authorities violently dispersed a peaceful protest by teachers in Tehran, who were calling for higher wages and better funding of the country’s public education system. By the end of the year, the authorities had arrested at least 23 teachers following nationwide strikes in October and November. Eight were sentenced to between nine months and 10 and a half years in prison, 74 lashes each, and other penalties.
Throughout the year, at least 278 truck drivers were arrested and some threatened with the death penalty after they took part in nationwide strikes demanding better working conditions and higher wages. Following strikes in February and November, dozens of striking workers from the Haft Tapeh Sugar Cane Company in Shush, south-west Iran, were arrested.
“From underpaid teachers to factory workers struggling to feed their families, those who have dared to demand their rights in Iran today have paid a heavy price. Instead of ensuring workers’ demands are heard, the authorities have responded with heavy handedness, mass arrests and repression,” said Philip Luther.
Ethnic and religious minorities
During 2018, Iran also intensified its discriminatory crackdowns against religious and ethnic minorities by arbitrarily arresting and imprisoning hundreds, and curtailing their access to education, employment and other services.
Members of Iran’s largest Sufi order, the Gonabadi Dervish religious minority, faced a particularly vicious crackdown after a peaceful protest they held in February 2018 was violently quashed. Hundreds were arrested and more than 200 were sentenced to a total of 1,080 years in prison, 5,995 lashes as well as internal “exile”, travel bans, and bans on joining political and social groups. One person, Mohammad Salas, was sentenced to death after a grossly unfair trial and swiftly executed.
At least 171 Christians were arrested in 2018 solely for peacefully practising their faith, according to the organization Article 18. Some received sentences of up to 15 years in prison.
The authorities also continued their systematic persecution of the Baha’i religious minority, arbitrarily detaining at least 95, according to the organization Baha’i International Community, and committing other abuses against them.
Hundreds of people from ethnic minority groups including Ahwazi Arabs, Azerbaijani Turks, Baluchis, Kurds and Turkmen have also faced human rights abuses including discrimination and arbitrary detention. 
Hundreds of Ahwazi Arabs were rounded up after protests in April over a state TV broadcast which excluded Ahwazi Arabs from a map showing the location of Iran’s ethnic minorities. In October, following a deadly armed attack on a military parade in Ahvaz the previous month, more than 700 Ahwazi Arabs were detained incommunicado according to activists outside Iran.
Hundreds of Azerbaijani Turks, including minority rights activists, were also violently arrested in connection with peaceful cultural gatherings throughout the year, including in July and August, when at least 120 people were arrested. Some activists were sentenced to prison terms and flogging. Minority rights activist Milad Akbari was flogged in the city of Tabriz, East Azerbaijan province, after he was convicted of “disrupting public order” through “taking part in illegal gatherings and singing eccentric songs” at a cultural gathering.
Environmental rights activists
At least 63 environmental activists and researchers were arrested in 2018, according to media reports. The Iranian authorities accused a number of them, without providing any evidence, of collecting classified information about Iran’s strategic areas under the pretext of carrying out environmental and scientific projects. At least five were charged with “corruption on earth”, which carries the death penalty.
“Throughout 2018 the Iranian authorities have sought to crush the spirits of protesters and human rights defenders demanding respect for human rights by carrying out mass arrests and even grotesque flogging sentences,” said Philip Luther.
“Governments which are engaged in dialogue with Iran must not stay silent while the net of repression rapidly widens. They must speak out in the strongest terms against the crackdown and forcefully call on the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those jailed for peacefully expressing their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly, including through their human rights activism.”

A new statement from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UNCERD) has underlined the urgency of immediately suspending construction of the Site C dam.
“The UN’s top anti-racism body has recognized that continued construction of the Site C dam is a serious threat to fundamental human rights,” said Chief Roland Willson of the West Moberly First Nations. “This latest statement from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination makes it clear that the federal and provincial governments have no claim to being human rights champions so long as they continue to ignore the impacts of Site C on our Treaty rights.”
UNCERD first called for a halt to construction of the Site C dam in August 2017 during a regular review of Canada’s human rights record. The independent, expert committee has now underlined the urgency of its recommendation by issuing a new statement under an emergency procedure meant to prevent serious violations of human rights.
In an open letter released today, the West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations are supported by downstream First Nations, and by 16 Indigenous peoples’ organizations, human rights, environmental and social justice groups across BC and Canada, in calling on the federal and provincial governments to immediately comply with CERD’s recommendations.
“The fact that the UN’s top anti-racism body takes the potential impact of the Site C dam on Indigenous peoples so seriously should be a wake-up call to the federal and provincial governments and indeed to all Canadians,” said Galen Armstrong, Sierra Club BC’s Peace Valley Campaigner.
UNCERD is an independent, expert body appointed to oversee state compliance with the UN Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a legally-binding human rights treaty ratified by Canada.
The Committee’s latest statement on Site C follows the decision of a BC court to allow construction of the dam to continue even though a fundamental Treaty rights challenge is still before the courts.
Kukpi7 Judy Wilson said on behalf of the executive of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC), “The federal and provincial governments have been getting away with ignoring Treaty rights in the short term. Eventually, however, they will have to deal with the fact, recognized by this expert body, that the Site C dam violates rights that are legally protected and which both levels of government are obligated to uphold. Any sensible government would stop throwing good money after bad on a project that it’s clear can never be completed.”
In addition to calling for a halt to construction of the Site C dam, the UN Committee also called on the federal and provincial governments to seek independent expert advice on implementation of their legal human rights obligations, including the responsibility to respect and uphold the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples.
Craig Benjamin, Indigenous rights campaigner for Amnesty International Canada, said, “These human rights experts have clearly recognized that there is an unacceptable gap between the promises made by the Trudeau and Horgan governments and the appalling reality of their actions trampling the rights of First Nations who depend on the Peace River. The UN Committee is giving the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to correct course on their disastrous support for the Site C dam. They should seize this opportunity.”

Esmail Bakhshi and Sepideh Gholian were violently arrested in Ahvaz, Khuzestan province, on 20 January in apparent reprisal for talking publicly about the torture they have said they endured in detention during November and December 2018, provoking a public outcry.
“There are real fears that Esmail Bakhshi and Sepideh Gholian could be facing a second round of torture after their rearrest. The timing of their arrest strongly suggests it is part of a sinister attempt to silence and punish them for speaking out about the horrific abuse they suffered in custody. The authorities must release them immediately and unconditionally, ensure their allegations of torture are independently investigated and that those responsible are brought to justice,” said Philp Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
The activists were first arrested on 18 November 2018 after participating in a peaceful gathering in front of the governor’s office in Shush, Khuzestan, and seeking to meet with officials to discuss the unpaid wages of several thousand workers at the Haft Tappeh sugar cane industrial complex.
Following their release on bail in mid-December, Esmail Bakhshi and Sepideh Gholian gave Amnesty International a harrowing account of the torture they suffered at the hands of security police and ministry of intelligence officials in both Shush and Ahvaz. They said they had been relentlessly beaten, slammed against a wall and shoved to the ground, as well as being humiliated and threatened with flogging, sexual violence and murder.
Sepideh Gholian told Amnesty International that, during her daily interrogation sessions, which started around 10am and lasted until the early hours of the following morning, intelligence officials repeatedly subjected her to sexual insults, calling her a “whore”, accused her of having sexual relationships with workers and threatened to have her family kill her “in the name of honour”.
Esmail Bakhshi wrote on his Instagram account on 4 January 2019 that, immediately after his arrest, “they [the officials] tortured me until I thought I was going to die and beat me with their fists and kicks so much that I could not move in my cell for 72 hours. I was in so much pain that it even hurt to sleep and today, after nearly two months… I still feel pain in my broken ribs, kidneys, left ear and testicles.”
He added that the officials torturing them also subjected them “to all sorts of heinous sexual profanities”. Esmail Bakhshi ended his post by challenging the minister of intelligence, Mahmoud Alavi, to participate in a live televised discussion with him concerning his torture complaints.
The posts triggered a public uproar about torture in Iranian detention facilities. The authorities initially responded by promising to investigate the torture allegations. State media reported that an official delegation would be sent to Khuzestan province to conduct an investigation and an adviser to the president said that he had issued a clear order for the allegations to be looked into promptly.
However, these promises soon proved hollow. Just days later, key state officials, including the head of the judiciary, the country’s chief prosecutor, and the head of the office of the president, among others, made statements claiming that the allegations of torture raised by Esmail Bakhshi were false. The head of the office of the president also said that they were entitled to file a complaint against Esmail Bakhshi for bringing the Islamic Republic system into disrepute.
On 19 January, just a day before the two activists’ arrest, state TV broadcast the “confessions” that the activists had said were obtained under torture and other ill-treatment. In the videos, Esmail Bakhshi and Sepideh Gholian “confess” to colluding with Marxist and Communist groups outside Iran to orchestrate the overthrow of the political system through organizing strikes and demonstrations by workers. 
By broadcasting the forced confessions, the Iranian authorities have flagrantly violated the detainees’ due process rights, including the right to remain silent during interrogation, and sought to depict activists who defend workers’ rights as enemies seeking to overthrow the state.
“If the Iranian authorities truly want to rehabilitate their notorious reputation on torture in detention, they must put in place measures to ensure that detainees are protected from all forms of torture and other ill-treatment while in custody. This includes giving them access to their lawyer from the moment of their arrest and during interrogation and excluding any information extracted through torture from evidence at trial,” said Philip Luther.
“Instead of locking up activists who speak out on torture, the Iranian authorities should be inviting international monitors, including the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, to carry out independent inspections of detention facilities.”
Amnesty International is calling on the Iranian authorities to urgently adopt domestic legislation that effectively defines torture as a specific crime and to ratify the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Iran is one of only 26 states globally that have neither signed nor ratified this convention.
Esmail Bakhshi is a spokesperson for the independent union of workers at the Haft Tappeh sugar cane industrial complex. Sepideh Gholian is a young labour rights activist who works to support the ongoing protests of Haft Tappeh workers. During their first bout of detention they were held in a ministry of intelligence detention centre in Ahvaz, Khuzestan province without access to their lawyers, until mid-December, when they were released on bail.

“The court’s decision to dissolve the opposition political group Wa’ad, a group committed to non-violence, is just the latest manifestation of how the authorities have been resorting to all means, including the judiciary, to crush any form of dissent in their country.
“Amnesty International calls on the Bahraini authorities to ensure that Wa’ad is allowed to reopen and resume its activities without delay and uphold the rights to freedom of association and expression. The international community must also use its leverage with the Bahraini authorities to push them to put an end to their systematic crackdown on opposition, which has been going on for far too long, unchecked.”
Background
In May 2017, the Bahraini Court of First Instance issued a ruling to dissolve Wa’ad. In October of that year, the court of appeals upheld the decision.
Wa’ad’s dissolution is similar to the dissolution of al-Wefaq, the largest opposition group in the country. Both were prevented from participating in the November 2018 elections, as were candidates affiliated with them.
The Bahraini authorities prosecuted Waad for describing individuals sentenced to death as “national martyrs”.

“We join Asim’s family in celebrating this good news which comes as a huge relief after he was originally sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit.”
“The authorities must however conduct an independent and effective investigation into allegations that he was tortured in prison. Though Asim has been acquitted, justice can only truly be done once the officials responsible for his ill-treatment are held to account, and he has been provided with appropriate redress for his injuries and imprisonment.
“The Sudanese authorities must review laws that allow for the torture and ill-treatment of detainees, notably by the National Intelligence and Security Services and the police.”
Background
Asim Omar was arrested on 2 May 2016 and accused of killing a police officer during protests at the University of Khartoum the previous month. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and sentenced to death on 24 September 2017.
He successfully appealed the sentence, and the judge ordered a re-trial of his case in August 2018. While in prison, he alleges that he was severely beaten by prison guards sustaining injuries on one of his legs, his testicles and his ears that rendered him incapable of appearing in court for one of the sessions.

Adlène Mellah, director of news websites Algerie direct et Dzair Press has been held in solitary confinement since he was jailed in El Harrach prison on 11 December 2018.
“It is outrageous that a journalist has been imprisoned simply for carrying out his work and exercising his rights to freedom of expression. The authorities must overturn Adlène Mellah’s conviction and drop all the charges against him in this case immediately,” said Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“Adlène Mellah’s case sends an alarming message about the state of media freedom in Algeria today. Journalists must be allowed to carry out their work free from harassment or intimidation, without fear of being arrested by the authorities.”
Adlène was arrested while covering a protest of 200 people in Algiers on 9 December.  The demonstration was held in solidarity with the imprisoned singer, Rada Hmimid, known by the stage name Reda City 16. On 25 December, the court of Bab El Oued sentenced Adlène to a year in jail and a 100,000 dinar (around US$843) fine on charges of “rebellion” and “non-armed gathering”.
A lawyer present at the trial told Amnesty International that the prosecution’s only evidence against Adlène was his presence at the protest. 
In a video of the protest, a police officer is seen telling Adlène to leave the protest. Shortly afterwards, he grabs Adlène by his arm, pushes him and says that public gatherings are illegal. Algerian authorities maintain a de facto ban on protests in Algiers under an unpublished decree from 2001.
Adlène was arrested along with two protesters, Abdelaziz Laadjal and Abdelhafid Benekrouche, who were released later that day. Adlène has been detained since.
In a court session on 18 December, the group of more than 20 lawyers who represent Adlène decided to withdraw and leave the courtroom as a sign of protest against what they said was the “deliberate intention” of the judge to hold an unfair trial.
Prolonged solitary confinement amounting to torture
Since his arrest, Adlène has been detained in solitary confinement, according to two of his lawyers. He is currently held alone in his cell and even during his courtyard breaks, he is alone apart from prison staff. Lack of meaningful contact with other detainees for at least 22 hours a day for more than 15 days constitutes prolonged solitary confinement, which amounts to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, under the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Mandela Rules).
To protest the verdict, Mellah began a hunger strike on 26 December, the day after he was convicted. According to his lawyer Zoubida Assoul,  Adlène had lost at least 14 kilograms as of 15 January. Another lawyer who visited him on 20 January told Amnesty International that after a visit from his family, Adlène had agreed to take serums containing salt and glucoses as well as vitamins.
One of his lawyers also told Amnesty International that Adlène was already very weak after reporting torture during his previous imprisonment. The Gendarmerie brigade of Bab Jdid in Algiers arrested him on 22 October 2018 on charges of “blackmail” and “harm to privacy”.
Adlène told Amnesty International that he was beaten and waterboarded by gendarmerie officers who also placed a cloth doused in bleach into his mouth three times. A Court provisionally released him on 22 November 2018 but the authorities failed to order an investigation into his torture claims.
“The Algerian authorities must immediately quash the conviction against Adlène Mellah and free him and all other peaceful protesters, human rights activists and journalists prosecuted or detained simply for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” said Heba Morayef.
Adlène’s arrest and conviction comes as part of a broader crackdown against freedom of expression in Algeria that intensified in October 2018, when at least seven journalists and six activists were arrested and detained in connection with their journalism under penal code provisions.

Vancouver-based mining company, Nevsun Resources, is being sued by Eritrean plaintiffs who allege that they suffered gross human rights abuses, including forced labour and torture, at a mine owned by the company in Eritrea. The zinc and copper mine in Bisha, Eritrea, is 60% owned by Nevsun and 40% by the Eritrean government.
This marks the first time that a corporate accountability case of this kind has made it to the Supreme Court of Canada.
“In the past, attempts to hold Canadian corporations accountable for human rights abuses abroad have frequently failed on procedural questions of jurisdiction or due to a legal doctrine that allows these cases to be sent back to the country where the violations have been alleged to occur,” Tara Scurr, Amnesty International Canada’s Business and Human Rights Campaigner, said. “This will be a historic opportunity for the Court to make it clear to Canadian corporations that they cannot hide behind procedural manoeuvres to avoid being held accountable in Canada for human rights abuses.”
Nevsun has argued that the plaintiffs should seek redress for their alleged harms in Eritrea. However, the UN Commission of Inquiry found there to be no independent or impartial Eritrean judiciary, and the government to be engaged in widespread crimes against humanity. Considering whether access to justice is possible in Eritrea, both the BC Supreme Court and the BC Court of Appeal held that Canada is, in fact, the right forum for this lawsuit.
The Supreme Court will decide whether the plaintiffs should be permitted to sue Nevsun for breach of customary international law. Nevsun is accused of using labour supplied by the Eritrean government’s National Service Program at the mine, through which 18-year old men are conscripted into the military. Amnesty International has documented abuses through the National Service Program in Eritrea, calling the use of labour through conscription “forced labour” – a gross human rights violation, and a violation of international law.
In addition, the Court will also decide whether the act of state doctrine applies in Canada. The principle, in its most basic form, prevents courts of one country from sitting in judgement of the actions of another. Nevsun will argue that Eritrea’s National Service program is an act of the State of Eritrea, and therefore the State is the source of the alleged harm. They will argue that for Canadian courts to sit in judgement of it would be contrary to the act of state doctrine, even though this principle has not previously been recognized in Canadian law.
“Unlike Nevsun, Amnesty International’s arguments are focused on the right to remedy for individuals who have suffered human rights abuses,” Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, said. “Access to remedy is a foundational cornerstone of any human rights framework, and is certainly essential to ensuring companies are held accountable when their operations lead to human rights abuse,” Neve said.
Amnesty will submit that allowing victims of Canadian corporate activity to sue in Canadian courts for harms suffered through breaches of customary international law is consistent with the constitutionally and internationally protected right to remedy. Amnesty will also submit that if the Court chooses to import the act of state doctrine into Canadian law, that it must do so in a manner that guarantees that the right to remedy will be protected.
“The outcome of this case could have far-reaching consequences for corporations who have been complicit in human rights violations and have acted with impunity,” Neve said.
Amnesty International will be represented on a pro bono basis by Paul Champ, Jennifer Klinck, Penelope Simons and Francois Larocque.

The poll, which was carried out by Ipsos MORI, found that: 
In the 26 countries surveyed in 2018, more than three in every five people (61%) oppose the development of lethal autonomous weapons systems.
Two-thirds (66%) of those opposed to lethal autonomous weapons systems were most concerned that they would “cross a moral line because machines should not be allowed to kill.”
More than half (54%) of those who opposed said they were concerned that the weapons would be “unaccountable.”
A near-identical survey in 23 countries in January 2017 found that 56% of respondents were opposed to lethal autonomous weapons systems – opposition growing.
More than half of respondents opposed killer robots in China (60%); Russia (59%); the UK (54%); France (59%), and the USA (52%). 
The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is a growing global coalition of NGOs, including Amnesty International, that is working to ban fully autonomous weapons.
“This poll shows that the states blocking a ban on killer robots are totally out of step with public opinion. Governments should be protecting people from the myriad risks that killer robots pose, not rushing into a new arms race which could have terrifying consequences,” said Rasha Abdul Rahim, Acting Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech.
“We still have time to halt the development and proliferation of fully autonomous weapons, but we won’t have that luxury for long. Governments should take note of this poll and urgently begin negotiating a new treaty to prohibit these horrifying weapons. Only this can help ensure respect for international law and address ethical and security concerns regarding delegating the power to make life-and-death decisions to machines.”
Amnesty International is calling for a total ban on the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapon systems, in light of the serious human rights, humanitarian and security risks they pose. The use of autonomous weapons without meaningful and effective human control would undermine the right to life and other human rights and create an accountability gap if, once deployed, they are able to make their own determinations about the use of lethal force. 
Currently, 28 states support a ban on fully autonomous weapons. Austria, Brazil, and Chile have formally proposed the urgent negotiation of “a legally-binding instrument to ensure meaningful human control over the critical functions” of weapons systems.
However, a minority of states at the 2018 November annual meeting of the Convention on Conventional Weapons, used consensus rules to thwart meaningful diplomatic progress. Russia, Israel, South Korea, and the USA indicated at the meeting that they would not support negotiations for a new treaty, but the poll results show that more than half of respondents in Russia (59%) and the USA (52%) oppose autonomous weapons. More than half of respondents opposed autonomous weapons in China (60%), South Korea (74%) and the UK (54%), which are among the leading states developing this technology.
The survey by Ipsos MORI was commissioned by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and conducted in December 2018. The sample size was 500 – 1,000 people in each country.

The TRU is tasked with responding to “the most serious threats to peace and order”, such as“hostage takings, barricaded persons, sniper incidents, and the search for armed or dangerous fugitives.”.   
The OPP has never provided a credible explanation for this massive – and dangerous – overreaction to a small group of unarmed land defenders. 
Even though the police action deteriorated to the point that officers pointed high-powered rifles at activists and bystanders, there has been neither an internal review nor a formal, independent review of this incident. 
“From where we were, I could see about two officers for each cruiser – about 25-30 officers. Every officer was holding a rifle, and every rifle was pointed at my truck.” This is how Jim Kunkel describes the experience of having dozens of high-powered rifles aimed at him when he and his wife, Rhonda, raced to police barricade to seek information about their son who was among the land rights defenders. 
As a result of years of persistent applications and appeals through the province’s freedom of information system, Amnesty International volunteers have been able to amass substantial evidence of police wrongdoing during this incident. This includes video evidence confirming that five men arrested during the protest were held in locked cells for hours in plastic restraints, contrary to police standards. 
After Amnesty obtained this video evidence, we urged the OPP to conduct an internal review. The review was so cursory, however, that the OPP didn’t even attempt to talk to any of the Mohawk men before declaring that it had no concerns over how they had been treated. 
In December, the UN Committee Against Torture called for a thorough and impartial investigation of OPP actions during this incident. 
We have posted a new online action calling on the Ontario government to act on the UN Committee’s recommendation. In addition to signing the action, we are encouraging Amnesty activists in Ontario to write and call the Premier’s office. The online action can be used as the basis of your personal message.

The TRU is tasked with responding to “the most serious threats to peace and order”, such as“hostage takings, barricaded persons, sniper incidents, and the search for armed or dangerous fugitives.”.   
The OPP has never provided a credible explanation for this massive – and dangerous – overreaction to a small group of unarmed land defenders. 
Even though the police action deteriorated to the point that officers pointed high-powered rifles at activists and bystanders, there has been neither an internal review nor a formal, independent review of this incident. 
“From where we were, I could see about two officers for each cruiser – about 25-30 officers. Every officer was holding a rifle, and every rifle was pointed at my truck.” This is how Jim Kunkel describes the experience of having dozens of high-powered rifles aimed at him when he and his wife, Rhonda, raced to police barricade to seek information about their son who was among the land rights defenders. 
As a result of years of persistent applications and appeals through the province’s freedom of information system, Amnesty International volunteers have been able to amass substantial evidence of police wrongdoing during this incident. This includes video evidence confirming that five men arrested during the protest were held in locked cells for hours in plastic restraints, contrary to police standards. 
After Amnesty obtained this video evidence, we urged the OPP to conduct an internal review. The review was so cursory, however, that the OPP didn’t even attempt to talk to any of the Mohawk men before declaring that it had no concerns over how they had been treated. 
In December, the UN Committee Against Torture called for a thorough and impartial investigation of OPP actions during this incident. 
We have posted a new online action calling on the Ontario government to act on the UN Committee’s recommendation. In addition to signing the action, we are encouraging Amnesty activists in Ontario to write and call the Premier’s office. The online action can be used as the basis of your personal message.

“The disbandment of the notorious Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) acknowledges years of outcry from Nigerians over human rights violations routinely committed by its members. However, disbandment alone is not enough and must be followed with concrete reforms that will end gross violations by the police altogether.
“Much more needs to be done to end unnecessary and excessive of force, extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention and extortion. Wide ranging reforms must be carried out so that Nigerians can trust the police to provide law enforcement according to Nigerian laws and international standards. The toxic climate of fear and corruption perpetrated by the police must end.
“Previous attempts to end the use of torture by the Nigerian police has proven ineffective. To draw a line under these atrocities, they must be investigated, and the perpetrators brought to justice. Compelling evidence of crimes and human rights violations committed by FSARS is widely available, including in reports by Amnesty International and can aid effective investigation of crimes committed by the squad.”

The satellite images reveal the true extent of the devastating attack which took place on 14 January in the Borno State town, which hosted thousands of civilians internally displaced by the conflict with Boko Haram. According to Amnesty International’s analysis, the attack resulted in large areas being burnt in the west and south of Rann, with more than 100 structures destroyed or heavily damaged by fire.
“Amnesty International condemns Boko Haram’s despicable disdain for life. This attack clearly targeted civilians and, therefore, may constitute a war crime. The organization appeals to the Nigerian authorities to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to the thousands of people who have been displaced,” said Osai Ojigho Director Amnesty International Nigeria.
“What is happening in Rann shows how vulnerable internally displaced persons are in Nigeria and the need to do more to protect them.” 
The satellite imagery corroborates reports from the humanitarian NGO Médecins Sans Frontières, which said Rann was “like a graveyard” in the aftermath of Monday’s attack. MSF has said it was preparing to receive many of those who fled as refugees across the border to Bodo, in Cameroon.
“Since Monday night’s attack people have been fleeing across the border to Cameroon in their thousands and with every day that passes their condition is becoming more and more desperate. Rann is now almost empty as deadly attacks by Boko Haram have made people too afraid to stay,” said Osai Ojigho.
“The authorities on both sides of the border must provide the supplies and safety that these people require. The Cameroonian authorities must also desist from forcing people to return until conditions are safe and they choose to do so voluntarily.”

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
In November 2014, Gize Yebeyo Araya, Kesete Tekle Fshazion and Mihretab Yemane Tekle filed a claim for damages at the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Nevsun Resources Ltd [“Nevsun”], which is a Canadian mining company based in Vancouver. The plaintiffs claim that through its Eritrean subsidiary, the Bisha Mine Share Company, and in complicity with the government and military of the state of Eritrea, Nevsun is liable for gross human rights violations alleged to have taken place at the mine, such as slavery and forced labour, torture and crimes against humanity. 
The plaintiffs, who claim to have fallen victim to these human rights abuses, are bringing claims for damages grounded in private law torts as well as in breaches of peremptory norms of customary international law. Nevsun denies the allegations in the claim and maintains that the court should not allow the claim to proceed. Nevsun argues that its liability is secondary to the alleged illegality of the National Service Program, an act of the State of Eritrea in Eritrean territory, which forced people to work at the mine. As such, Nevsun argues that it cannot be held liable for any of the alleged abuses at the mine as the ‘act of state’ doctrine precludes the court from assessing the validity of sovereign acts of foreign states within their own territory. In addition, Nevsun submits that the Canadian courts should not recognize a cause of action for damages based on alleged breaches of norms of customary international law. 
The Supreme Court case arises out of a Supreme Court of British Columbia decision to dismiss motions brought by the appellant to stay, dismiss or strike aspects of the respondents’ (plaintiffs’) claims on October 6, 2016. These motions argued that Eritrea is the forum conveniens (more appropriate forum for the lawsuit), that the claims are precluded by or have no reasonable chance of success due to the act of state doctrine, and the inapplicability of customary international law. On November 21, 2017, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed Nevsun’s appeal. The Court of Appeal rejected the application of the act of state doctrine and found that the chambers judge had not erred in declining to strike the plaintiffs’ claims founded in the customary international law. 
INTERVENTION BY AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL AND THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF JURISTS 
Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) intervened before the Supreme Court of Canada in the case. In our intervention, we submitted that the development of common law doctrines of judicial abstention and causes of action should be consistent with the right to an effective remedy for human rights violations, as protected under international law and as a fundamental value enshrined in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (“Charter”). This requires a rejection of any definition of the doctrine of act of state that denies access to a remedy for serious human rights violations, and indeed, requires a cautious approach to recognizing a doctrine of act of state in Canada, if at all. 
Amnesty International additionally submitted that it further requires the recognition of civil claims based on injury resulting from conduct that violates customary international human rights law. Accordingly, Amnesty and the ICJ submitted that that superior courts may develop the common law to recognize novel causes of action at common law for violations of well-established norms of customary international law. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
The Supreme Court granted Nevsun’s application for leave to appeal on June 14, 2018.  The hearing was held on January 23, 2019, where the Court addressed the following issues raised in the case: (i) Does the act of state doctrine operate in Canadian law and its application to this case? (ii) Should the claim for damages based on alleged breaches of peremptory norms of customary international law be allowed to proceed? 
In a landmark decision released on February 28, 2020, the majority of the Supreme Court dismissed Nevsun’s appeal. They ruled that the act of state doctrine does not operate in Canadian law. Furthermore, they ruled that customary international law is automatically adopted and incorporated into Canadian law unless there is legislation to the contrary. This means that customary international law is a part of Canadian law, including the peremptory norms of customary international law breached by Nevsun’s activities in Eritrea. The Court also affirmed that customary international law does not only apply to states but to corporate actors as well. Based on their analysis, the Court held that the workers’ civil lawsuit should be allowed to proceed in Canada as part of seeking an effective remedy against violations of peremptory norms of customary international law.

The organization also received reports of further raids of medical facilities by security personnel, who fired teargas inside hospitals and assaulted doctors.
“It is an outrage that Sudanese security forces continue to use lethal force on protestors and key service providers like doctors, killing people in an unbridled spree, said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The Sudanese authorities must immediately take charge of the security forces and ensure they stop using lethal force against protestors. They must also bring to an immediate end the continued onslaught against medical facilities and personnel, injured protestors and other people seeking treatment in hospitals, which constitutes violations of the rights to health and personal integrity.”
Amnesty International spoke to a medical doctor on duty at Al Faisal Specialized Hospital in Khartoum on Thursday, who said security forces raided the hospital in the afternoon, fired teargas and arrested him and another doctor, as well as two other medical staff. The medics, who were beaten during the arrest, were detained and interrogated at the National Intelligence and Security Services offices. He was released without charge after 8:30pm, while the others were released several hours later.
The organization also verified videos shared on social media and via WhatsApp showing security forces opening fire on protesters gathered at a football pitch near a mosque in Khartoum’s Burri district on Thursday. At least one fell to the ground as a result of his injury and had to be carried away by other protesters. The injured were reportedly taken to Royal Care Hospital, where many protesters remained overnight. 
On 17 January, Sudan’s security forces fired teargas into homes and buildings in the Burri area, an outright contravention of international guidelines on the use of force that require all force to comply with the principles of necessity and proportionality and forbid the use of teargas in confined spaces.
“This blatant violation of national and international laws must stop immediately, and independent and impartial investigations must be promptly launched into all allegations of human rights violations, including the deaths reported in the context of the protests, so that all those found responsible are brought to justice in fair trials,” said Sarah Jackson.
“By participating in these protests, the people of Sudan are exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Instead of trying to curtail these rights, the government should address the root causes of the economic crisis that has driven the people to the streets.”

“This verdict is an appalling miscarriage of justice. Nawal Benaissa’s only ‘crime’ was to join peaceful protests to demand the rights of people in the Rif region. The Moroccan authorities are blatantly targeting Nawal Benaissa for her role in the Hirak El-Rif movement and are making an example of her to intimidate others who may wish to speak out. Instead of continuing with their crackdown against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders, the authorities should immediately quash her conviction and drop all the charges against her.”
Background
Morocco’s authorities have repeatedly intimidated and harassed Nawal Benaissa – arresting her four times between June and September 2017. In February 2018 she was sentenced to a 10-month suspended prison term and a fine of 500 dirhams (around USD 50) on charges of “protesting in an undeclared demonstration”, “insulting law enforcement officers” and “incitement to commit” criminal offences. The Al Hoceima Court of Appeals upheld her sentence on 17 January 2019.
The Hirak El-Rif protests began in the northern city of Al Hoceima in the Rif region in October 2016. Protesters have been demanding social justice and an end to the marginalization of their communities.
Nawal Benaissa’s case was featured in Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign. For more information click here

Ahead of tomorrow’s early release of Ahmed H, a Syrian man who was unfairly jailed for “complicity in an act of terror” during clashes with police at the Serbia-Hungary border in September 2015, Eda Seyhan, Amnesty International’s Europe Counter Terrorism Campaigner, said:
“After spending three-and-a-half years behind bars, Ahmed will finally be reunited with his wife and two young daughters. His release is an overwhelming relief for the family, but the fact is he should never have been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for this offence in the first place.
“The absurd charges against Ahmed were emblematic of the systematic scapegoating of refugees and migrants, and those seeking to defend them. His prosecution was a potent symbol of Prime Minister Orbán’s ‘illiberal democracy’. It had nothing to do with justice but was instead part of the Hungarian government’s draconian crackdown on human rights.  
“By blatantly misusing terrorism-related provisions and riding roughshod over the law in their treatment of Ahmed, the Hungarian authorities showed they will stop at nothing to demonize refugees and migrants.”
Ahmed is expected to fly back to Cyprus to be reunited with his family soon after his release.
Photos and footage available are here (will be updated after his return to Cyprus) https://adam.amnesty.org/asset-bank/images/assetbox/02b445c9-8e7b-4be0-a31e-7411960c79d6/assetbox.html
In August 2015, Ahmed left his family home in Cyprus to go and help his elderly parents and six other family members flee Syria and find safety in Europe. One month later, they found themselves among hundreds of refugees stranded at the Hungarian border after police fenced off the crossing with Serbia.
Clashes broke out as some refugees attempted to get through. Hungary’s police responded with tear gas and water cannon, injuring dozens. Some people threw stones, including Ahmed. But news footage also clearly shows Ahmed using a megaphone to call on both sides to remain calm before the clashes.
For this, a Hungarian court found him guilty of involvement in an “act of terror”, under Hungary’s extremely vague counter-terrorism laws, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison, later reduced to 7 years and then 5 with eligibility for early release.

The York University Community was eagerly waiting for the most anticipated event of the year; Write for Rights. 
The executive team had been brainstorming, taking notes, and discussing how to make Write for Rights ‘Bigger and Better’. The team went through the post-event notes last year, discussed what could be improved and how to improve them. The biggest challenge was getting more students to be aware and be engaged in addressing human rights abuses or issues and actively advocating for the rights of human rights defenders.  
The entire team decided on the game plan, from promotions to outreach, booking tablings to preparing the incentives for the event. We had agreed on November 21st to be the date of our Write for Rights event. We had contacted our Student Community and Leadership Development coordinator to reserve the entire ‘Bear Pit’ as we were aiming for a high turn out this year. We were able to secure the maximum amount of tables and space as the whole from 10-4pm. 
Once we got our location confirmed, we assured that we promoted the event as much as possible. This year, we decided to promote through related departments, colleges, and other ally clubs. Most put us on their listserv and posted on their social media. Some executives talked to their professors if they had class during the event and had groups come from classes to take part in the global movement. On Facebook, a week before the event, many Amnesty members also added the Write for Rights banner and event information to their profile picture further promoting the event. 
For the third year in a row, Amnesty International at York facilitated “12 Days of Human Rights” leading up for Write for Rights on our social media channels. Each day on social media leading up to our event, we released the details of one case we would be focusing on along with a picture. The 12th day was the Write for Rights event, and we promoted with live videos, boomerangs, photos of the team, and photos of the incentives. 
To entice students, we offered free food, coffee, tea, and swag for those who wrote letters. We also brought back an Amnesty York favourite; Krispie Kreme donuts through their fundraising program. We were also able to provide fresh scones from Cobb’s Bread, thanks to one of our directors. 
Thank you to the musical talents of Zain Campbell, one of the directors’ partners, we were able to create the coffee house feeling that we had hoped. We wanted to get students away from their busy exam schedule for a few minutes, get them engaged in human rights advocacy, offer them food and drinks for free, a yellow photo booth to spruce up their social media pages, and a comfortable environment to have important and productive conversations. Zain played beautifully on his keyboard and without complaints for the 6 hour event. The keyboard brought in many students who wrote letters, but also students who wanted to learn more about Amnesty and the cases before writing a letter. 
Knowing the success that Write for Rights has been internationally, Amnesty York was very excited to host this event to allow all students, not just those who are a part of Amnesty, to have a voice to make a difference and to be heard. 
Although challenging to hang, we were lucky to secure the Write for Rights banner from AITO.  We also had the honour of showcasing the hand-stitched “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” banner made by an ANWHR member. We felt as though it was important to not only acknowledge that we were advertising for the event but also specifically for those we are advocating for and one of the factors as to why they are being persecuted in the first place; for being a woman.  Each year that Amnesty York co-hosts Refugees Awareness Week, we always make a banner alongside other students, community members, clubs, and faculty. We also brought out last years banner from the week that stated, “Refugee Rights are Human Rights” as some of the women part of Write for Rights were either refugees or advocating on behalf of refugees. 
Amnesty York ensures that it acknowledges the land in which we are gathering on and advocating on as stolen land. As a result, instead of periodically making a land claim, we brought our printed Land Acknowledgement and hung it beside the entrance of the space, so it was clearly visible to remind students where and how we are gathering. 
A really successful element of this year’s Write for Rights event was the photo booth. Because we had the entire space booked out, we were able to keep the photo booth on the side of the space, facing the rotunda where students are frequently passing by. We were lucky to receive our new stand up banner from the student union in time for the event to serve as a colourful backdrop. In the meeting prior to the event, members brought their creativity to the table by painting, designing, and drawing to make different signs to hold up in pictures. These signs were also eye-catching to students who were walking by and was Amnesty’s signature yellow colour. Signs read; ‘love is not a crime,’ ‘united against injustice,’ ‘human rights defender,’ ‘stop torture,’ ‘respect my existence or expect resistance,’ ‘activist,’ and also had social media hashtags and contact information. We also purchased a “Human Rights Defender” cape and borrowed another from AITO for photos and boomerangs which was really popular. When there were available spots, members would put on the cape and walk around the halls. Upon wearing a big yellow cape in the hallways during exams, many people came up to members asking what they are doing and how they could help the cause. Pictures with these signs and in these capes flooded our social media and news feeds for many days after the event. 
We are very proud to say that we ran out of tables and chairs and had people writing on benches and against walls to aid in the fight for human rights. This is something that has never happened before!  It was really a sight to see dedicated yet busy students take time out of their day to help someone they have never met before. We have made a note for the next executive team to request additional tables to ensure comfort and heightened accessibility. 
Walking around the space, students were talking to members, and other students and faculty about what they thought about human rights, women’s rights, and the cases. Many amazing and empowering conversations and ideas were being brought up. As a result, we got many new sign-ups and petition signatures during our event. Not only this, many students and new Amnesty members were able to understand the importance and impact of Amnesty internationally truly. Many folks did not know that they were taking part in an international movement and were shocked and excited to be participating. 
During our last meeting of the year, we stamped, sealed, and mailed all 147 letters, breaking an Amnesty York record! Write for Rights is one of the most highly anticipated events of the year by members who have been with Amnesty all four of their years at university, those who have recently joined, and allies of Amnesty York. It is always an exciting and empowering event for those who partake and is always a pleasure and honour as a team to host such an important and unique international event.

To entice students, we offered free food, coffee, tea, and swag for those who wrote letters. We also brought back an Amnesty York favourite; Krispie Kreme donuts through their fundraising program. We were also able to provide fresh scones from Cobb’s Bread, thanks to one of our directors. 
Thank you to the musical talents of Zain Campbell, one of the directors’ partners, we were able to create the coffee house feeling that we had hoped. We wanted to get students away from their busy exam schedule for a few minutes, get them engaged in human rights advocacy, offer them food and drinks for free, a yellow photo booth to spruce up their social media pages, and a comfortable environment to have important and productive conversations. Zain played beautifully on his keyboard and without complaints for the 6 hour event. The keyboard brought in many students who wrote letters, but also students who wanted to learn more about Amnesty and the cases before writing a letter. 
Knowing the success that Write for Rights has been internationally, Amnesty York was very excited to host this event to allow all students, not just those who are a part of Amnesty, to have a voice to make a difference and to be heard. 
Although challenging to hang, we were lucky to secure the Write for Rights banner from AITO.  We also had the honour of showcasing the hand-stitched “Women’s Rights are Human Rights” banner made by an ANWHR member. We felt as though it was important to not only acknowledge that we were advertising for the event but also specifically for those we are advocating for and one of the factors as to why they are being persecuted in the first place; for being a woman.  Each year that Amnesty York co-hosts Refugees Awareness Week, we always make a banner alongside other students, community members, clubs, and faculty. We also brought out last years banner from the week that stated, “Refugee Rights are Human Rights” as some of the women part of Write for Rights were either refugees or advocating on behalf of refugees. 
Amnesty York ensures that it acknowledges the land in which we are gathering on and advocating on as stolen land. As a result, instead of periodically making a land claim, we brought our printed Land Acknowledgement and hung it beside the entrance of the space, so it was clearly visible to remind students where and how we are gathering. 
A really successful element of this year’s Write for Rights event was the photo booth. Because we had the entire space booked out, we were able to keep the photo booth on the side of the space, facing the rotunda where students are frequently passing by. We were lucky to receive our new stand up banner from the student union in time for the event to serve as a colourful backdrop. In the meeting prior to the event, members brought their creativity to the table by painting, designing, and drawing to make different signs to hold up in pictures. These signs were also eye-catching to students who were walking by and was Amnesty’s signature yellow colour. Signs read; ‘love is not a crime,’ ‘united against injustice,’ ‘human rights defender,’ ‘stop torture,’ ‘respect my existence or expect resistance,’ ‘activist,’ and also had social media hashtags and contact information. We also purchased a “Human Rights Defender” cape and borrowed another from AITO for photos and boomerangs which was really popular. When there were available spots, members would put on the cape and walk around the halls. Upon wearing a big yellow cape in the hallways during exams, many people came up to members asking what they are doing and how they could help the cause. Pictures with these signs and in these capes flooded our social media and news feeds for many days after the event. 
We are very proud to say that we ran out of tables and chairs and had people writing on benches and against walls to aid in the fight for human rights. This is something that has never happened before!  It was really a sight to see dedicated yet busy students take time out of their day to help someone they have never met before. We have made a note for the next executive team to request additional tables to ensure comfort and heightened accessibility. 
Walking around the space, students were talking to members, and other students and faculty about what they thought about human rights, women’s rights, and the cases. Many amazing and empowering conversations and ideas were being brought up. As a result, we got many new sign-ups and petition signatures during our event. Not only this, many students and new Amnesty members were able to understand the importance and impact of Amnesty internationally truly. Many folks did not know that they were taking part in an international movement and were shocked and excited to be participating. 
During our last meeting of the year, we stamped, sealed, and mailed all 147 letters, breaking an Amnesty York record! Write for Rights is one of the most highly anticipated events of the year by members who have been with Amnesty all four of their years at university, those who have recently joined, and allies of Amnesty York. It is always an exciting and empowering event for those who partake and is always a pleasure and honour as a team to host such an important and unique international event.

In recent years there has been a spike in human rights violations in the island nation. Thousands of people are held in unjustified and prolonged pre-trial detention, while environmental rights defenders have been targeted simply for working to protect the country’s natural resources, such as rosewood.
Rajoelina was declared the president-elect of Madagascar after the second round of presidential elections on 19 December 2018.
“The human rights situation has been deteriorating in Madagascar in recent years. For example, environmental activists have been jailed and harassed for speaking out against the alleged illegal trafficking of rosewood and environmental degradation caused by multinational corporations,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“Suspects in various crimes, including petty offences such as stealing a chicken, are languishing in jail without having been convicted of any crime, due to the government’s practice of excessive pre-trial detention.”
Excessive pretrial detention
In its 2018 report, Amnesty International documented how pre-trial detention is used excessively and abusively, including for petty offences which did not justify being locked up.
Prisons are severely overcrowded and both pre-trial detainees and those who have been convicted and sentenced, are held together in inhumane conditions with no access to adequate food, clean water, hygiene and healthcare.
The report revealed that in 2017 alone, 52 out of the 129 detainees who died in Madagascar’s prisons were on pre-trial detention. The criminal justice system remains extremely weak and under-resourced.
Targeting of human rights defenders and activists
Human rights defenders, particularly environmental activists who have spoken out against illegal trafficking or the exploitation of natural resources continue to be harassed, intimidated and arbitrarily detained simply for their human rights work.
Clovis Razafimalala spent almost a year in jail between 2016 and 2017 on politically motivated charges for his work on the environment. He has denounced the illegal trafficking of rosewood and other timber as part of his role as the Coordinator of the Maroantsetra Lampogno coalition, a group fighting against illegal trafficking of natural resources.
Another environmental activist, Christopher Manenjika, was handed an absurd US$8 fine in June – on fabricated charges – for collecting information on cases of corruption, illegal trafficking of rosewood and mining exploitation. 
Criminalizing of abortion
Under the country’s law, abortion remains criminalized in all circumstances under Article 317 of the Penal Code inherited from the French colonial period, putting thousands of girls and women’s lives at risk. This is despite commitments made by the government to make it a minor offence not punishable by prison sentences in 2017.
“The president-elect, Andry Rajoelina, has a golden opportunity to ensure the building of a human-rights respecting Madagascar,” said Deprose Muchena.
“His government must ensure protection of the rights of human rights defenders, including their right to freedom of expression, as well as the right to peaceful protest. Pre-trial detainees whose detention is unjustified must be freed, along with those facing long jail terms for petty and non-violent crimes.”

“Today’s report confirms Amnesty International’s research, which found that thousands more families at the southern border were separated than the administration initially disclosed. By their own admission, US authorities intentionally separated families in order to deter others from trying to seek safety in the United States. This cruel and dangerous policy must never be put into practice again.
“Ripping children from the arms of their parents or guardians is a brazen violation of human rights. US authorities must immediately reveal full statistics on family separations for public scrutiny and ensure that all separated families are reunited.”
In October 2018, Amnesty International released a report finding that the U.S. government deliberately adopted immigration policies and practices that caused catastrophic harm to thousands of people seeking safety in the United States, including the separation of over 6,000 family units in just a four-month period.
The Department of Homeland Security previously denied the findings of Amnesty’s report.

Authorities shut down internet
200 people arbitrarily detained 
The Zimbabwean authorities must ensure that the security forces exercise restraint and respect the rights of people protesting against massive fuel price hikes, Amnesty International said on the second day of the national ‘shutdown’.
As a result of the crackdown at least eight people have reportedly been killed by the security forces and 200 arbitrarily detained.
Reports of security forces using firearms and teargas against people protesting at the 150 per cent increase in fuel prices have surfaced in Harare and Bulawayo’s townships. In Epworth, one woman was badly injured after she was shot near a police station on her way to work, according to media reports. Another boy was shot in the stomach in Mbare.
“Years of political and economic mismanagement has brought Zimbabwe’s economy to its knees. Millions of Zimbabweans are terrified about the knock-on effects that the fuel increases will have on their daily lives, including for food and healthcare,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“The Zimbabwean authorities must ensure that people are able to express their views freely and safely, and must promptly investigate in an independent and impartial manner allegations of police shootings of protesters. The police must use force only when strictly necessary. Even then, they must exercise restraint at all times and use the lowest level of force needed. Firearms may only be used as a last resort, and when strictly unavoidable, to protect life.”
Amnesty International is also alarmed by the repressive measures the government has taken in response to the protests, including shutting down the internet to prevent people from supporting or organizing protests. The police and military have also reportedly subjected people who were protesting to beatings and other forms of ill-treatment.
On 13 January, the government spokesperson Nick Mangwana vowed to crack down on “elements bent on taking advantage of the current fuel shortages to cause and sponsor unrest and instability in the country”. Security forces have been deployed in large numbers on the streets of the main cities, including the capital Harare.
“The authorities must put an end to the practice of arbitrarily detaining people who were taking part in the protests. Those detained must be either charged promptly with a recognizable offence or else released,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), a local labour organization, called for a national shutdown, saying the fuel price increases were “insensitive and provocative”. 
The government has also accused the organizers of the national shutdown and civil society organizations of being intent on destabilizing the country and working with ‘foreigners’ to achieve this aim. The authorities have since issued veiled threats against these unnamed ‘foreign’ organizers, including that they will revoke their visas and deporting them out of Zimbabwe.
“The organizers of the national shutdown are not a threat to anyone – all they have done is call for people to stay at home as a way to protest peacefully against the fuel increases,” said Muleya Mwanayanda.
“Instead of threatening those who criticize the government, the authorities should focus on addressing the root causes that are leading people to the streets and focus on building an inclusive economy for all Zimbabweans.”
There have also been reports of police stations being torched, shops looted, private property destroyed and the headquarters of the main opposition party, MDC, burned down.
Background
On 12 January, President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced the fuel price hikes, which took effect on 13 January. The prices of both diesel and petrol, the main means for the transportation of people and consumer goods in Zimbabwe, have gone up by 150 per cent.
Zimbabwe has been suffering chronic shortages of US dollars, which were adopted as the official currency after the country abandoned the Zimbabwean dollar in 2009 due to hyperinflation. The country has suffered shortages of consumer goods in recent months, with some shops shutting their doors due to the shortage in US dollars.

“The Office of the Prosecutor is likely to appeal this acquittal and the arrangements for the accused to be released will be addressed during a hearing to be held tomorrow morning at the Court.
“This ICC ruling reminds us that fair trial and due process must be at the heart of international criminal justice.

Background:
Today, Trial Chamber I of the International Criminal Court acquitted former Côte d’Ivoire president Laurent Gbagbo and Charles Blé Goudé, his former Youth minister. The Defense Motion for acquittal and immediate release was filed on 23 July 2018 by Laurent Gbagbo’s defence.  On 3 August 2018, Charles Blé Goudé’s defence filed a No Case to Answer Motion.
Gbagbo and Blé Goudé were accused of four counts of crimes against humanity: murder, rape, other inhumane acts/ attempted murder, and persecution. These crimes were allegedly committed as post-election violence swept through Côte d’Ivoire between 16 December 2010 and 12 April 2011. Their ICC trial opened on 28 January 2016. Today’s decision terminates the proceedings against the accused, unless the decision is appealed by the Office of the Prosecutor.

“The death sentence given to Robert Schellenberg does not deliver justice. We urge the Chinese authorities to revoke this sentence. Drug-related offences do not meet international standards for the use of capital punishment.
“China’s death penalty system is shrouded in secrecy, which contributes to why many will be questioning the timing of this decision. We have seen before that in highly politicized cases the trial is often a mere spectacle with the outcome already decided.
“The sudden re-trial and apparent rush to judgment has highlighted the numerous flaws in China’s judicial system. We hope that Robert Schellenberg and his defence counsel are given adequate time to prepare and respond to the prosecution’s new evidence when the case is finally brought up for appeal.”
Background 
Robert Schellenberg had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for drug smuggling, charges he denies, at his original trial in November 2018 at the Dalian Intermediate People’s Court in China’s northeast Liaoning Province. At the appeal hearing held on 29 December 2018, prosecutors said that they had uncovered new evidence and argued that the original sentence was too lenient. He received a death sentence at a re-trial by the same Dalian Intermediate People’s Court on Monday.
China executes more people than any other country in the world; however, the number of death sentences imposed and number of executions carried out are shrouded in secrecy. The authorities continue to execute a significant number of individuals for drug related and other offences which do not meet the “most serious crimes” threshold to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international law. States are under an obligation to review their criminal laws to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed for drug-related offences
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The organization has been campaigning for total abolition of the death penalty for over 40 years.

 “In order to prevent further deaths, the Nepali authorities must immediately put in place a comprehensive strategy, designed in consultation with Nepali women’s rights groups, to eliminate Chhaupadi. This should include effective enforcement of existing laws criminalizing Chhaupadi and widespread education programmes in affected areas” said Niranjan Thapaliya, Nepal Section Director, Amnesty International.  
“Chhaupadi is a violation of the right to be free from gender discrimination and gender-based violence which are guaranteed under the constitution of Nepal and international human rights treaties, including the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women.”  
Background
Chhaupadi results from a belief, held in parts of Nepal, that women and girls are “impure” and “untouchable” after childbirth and during menstruation. As a result, families and communities regulate what and whom women and girls may touch. This includes forcing them to leave their house and live in a cowshed or separate hut constructed specifically for that purpose. These sheds are frequently dirty, lack protection from severe weather and are insecure.
Despite the introduction of the law criminalizing Chhaupadi in 2017, the practice continues to be widespread, especially in the mid-western and far-western regions and there have been numerous cases of women dying or being subjected to sexual violence while staying in Chhaupadi sheds.

Ahead of a planned hunger strike by jailed UK charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in Iran this week, Amnesty International has described the move as a “desperate measure” and urged the Iranian authorities to “stop playing cruel games” with her life.
Last week, Zaghari-Ratcliffe and another prisoner of conscience held in Tehran’s Evin prison – prominent human rights defender Narges Mohammadi – announced they would jointly stage a three-day hunger strike from Monday 14 January in protest at the Iranian authorities repeatedly denying them specialised medical care.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Mohammadi both suffer from serious health conditions (see below), many of which have been caused or exacerbated by their grossly-unjust imprisonment and the authorities’ refusal to allow them adequate medical care while imprisoned.
According to her husband Richard Ratcliffe, 40-year-old Zaghari-Ratcliffe has recently discovered lumps in her breasts and is extremely concerned that she will not receive the medical care she needs in relation to this. Amnesty has previously documented a pattern of abuse by the Iranian prison authorities, who often deliberately deny medical care to prisoners held on politically-motivated charges. 
Last week, the Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said that Zaghari-Ratcliffe being able to receive the medical care she needs in jail is a matter of “supreme importance” to the UK.
Meanwhile, the Iranian prison authorities reportedly prevented Zaghari-Ratcliffe from having a regular telephone call with her husband Richard last weekend, in an apparent attempt to punish her for the decision to begin a hunger strike. In what may have been another coordinated reprisal from the Iranian authorities, on Wednesday Iranian state television aired footage showing the charity worker’s original arrest in April 2016.
In a further apparent reprisal, on 5 January Mohammadi learned that the Iranian authorities have reduced the already-limited time she is allowed for her weekly telephone calls to her children, who live outside Iran.
Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said:
“It’s outrageous it’s had to come to this for Nazanin and Narges.
“Nazanin and Narges are prisoners of conscience, forced to resort to desperate, life-endangering measures simply to get vital medical care.
“The Iranian authorities should stop playing cruel games with Nazanin and Narges and immediately release them. Pending their release, they should be allowed the medical care they urgently need.
“Nazanin and Narges are prisoners of conscience – they should be free and enjoying life with their families, not suffering in Evin jail.”
Charity worker
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian dual-national, was arrested at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport on 3 April 2016 prior to boarding a plane back to the UK after a regular family visit to the country with her infant daughter Gabriella. After being detained in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group” in a grossly unfair trial by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran. The conviction was in connection with her employment at Thomson Reuters Foundation, a charity promoting socio-economic progress, independent journalism and the rule of law, as well as her past work as an administrative assistant with BBC Media Action. The sentence was upheld on appeal the following year and her subsequent request for judicial review has been denied.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe recently completed her 1,000th day in detention, and three days prior to that she turned 40 in jail. More than 175,000 people have supported Amnesty’s campaign for her release.
Human rights defender
Narges Mohammadi is a distinguished Iranian human rights defender who has been jailed several times for her peaceful human rights work in Iran. She is serving a 16-year jail sentence in relation to her peaceful human rights work, including campaigning against Iran’s use of the death penalty and her participation in peaceful protests to condemn acid attacks against women in Iran. Mohammadi suffers from several very serious health conditions, including a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in her lungs) and a neurological disorder that results in seizures and temporary partial paralysis. She requires ongoing specialised medical care, which she cannot receive in prison.

At least two people are reported to have been tortured to death since December 2018.
The Russian LGBT Network has verified reports that the Chechen authorities have detained around 40 individuals in a government building in the city of Argun, where they have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. According to confidential sources, the authorities have destroyed some victims’ passports to prevent them from leaving the country.
“Many LGBTI people in Russia are still traumatized by the 2017 purge which saw dozens of gay men in Chechnya abducted and tortured and others killed. News that the authorities have resumed the crackdown is absolutely spine-chilling,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
“We are horrified by reports that at least two people have died from torture-inflicted injuries. With lives in jeopardy, there is an urgent need for an international response to protect gay and lesbian people in Chechnya.”
On 21 December 2018 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe published a report on the 2017 crackdown, in which it documented Russia’s refusal to cooperate or respond to calls for an investigation. So far no genuine official investigation has taken place, and not a single person has been held to account for the atrocities committed.
“The fact that there has still not been any justice for the 2017 attacks shows that gay and lesbian people in Chechnya cannot rely on the Russian authorities to protect them. The lack of official investigation has emboldened the Chechen authorities to launch a new wave of persecution, safe in the knowledge that the Russian government will back up their denials and obfuscation,” said Marie Struthers.
“We are calling for the international community to take immediate action to protect gay and lesbian people in Chechnya, and to increase the pressure on the Russian authorities to properly investigate these horrendous crimes.”
The Russian LGBT Network first received reports about new abductions of gay and lesbian individuals in Chechnya and their secret detention in Argun on 28 December 2018, and has now been able to verify the information. The organization, which has helped dozens of gay and lesbian people escape Chechnya over the past two years, estimates that around 40 people are currently in detention.

It was more than 17 years ago when secret police officers led me to my old car parked outside my mother’s house in Mauritania, and asked me to follow them in their unmarked, inconspicuous vehicle. There was a visibly ashamed agent waiting to sit beside me in my car. 
As I emerged from my mother’s door, she stopped me. She suspected these were agents just from the way they looked. She was afraid for me. Even an apolitical person like my mother could spot them every time. 
“I didn’t want them to find you,” said the young agent beside me in the car. I’d met him before. In 2000 on my way home to Mauritania from a trip to Canada, I was arrested in Senegal for baseless suspicions at the request of the US government. When I was rendered from Senegal to Mauritania, this young agent had acted as my prison guard. He had shared with me some of the hardship he was facing because his job wouldn’t pay his bills. I had promised to help him if I ever got out of prison. He told me that he could fix TVs and set up the channels, and I planned to find him clients and improve his knowledge. The night before my kidnapping from my mother’s house, I had hired him to fix my own TV. 
As we drove off, I could see in the rear-view mirror the fingers of my mother raised to the sky and counting prayers. I would never see my mother again, nor my older brother because they passed away before my release. 
Back then, there wasn’t yet Guantánamo prison as we know it today. I was rendered to Jordan and later onto Bagram Air Base before I was delivered to the Guantánamo detention center. 
In an attempt to get a confession from me, US agents subjected me to torture and to other cruel and inhuman treatment. As if losing my freedom, my livelihood and forcibly being separated from my loved ones wasn’t cruel enough. 
It would take years of deprivation, pain and suffering until I finally joined my family at the end of 2016. And more than two years after my release I am still a prisoner in my own country, forbidden from seeking the medical treatment I badly need abroad because the U.S. government has instructed the Mauritanian government not to issue a passport to me. 
All the above happened in the name of democracy. 
In the name of security. 
In the name of the American people. 
With the premise that only very few people deserve due process, dignity and human rights and the rest of humanity is fair game for the most powerful democracy in the world. 
I believe that the U.S. has the right and duty to protect its citizens but that it should never do it outside of the rule of law that it promised to uphold. 
I can safely say that I am a living example that a government’s suspicion can never be the reason for undermining the rule of law, for which generations upon generations in the U.S. have fought for. I am an example because the government’s suspicion that I was a criminal was totally and one hundred percent wrong. I was never charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. The only independent judge I ever faced during my ordeal had ordered my release after seeing the secret evidence that even I wasn’t allowed to see. 
Brave activists with Amnesty International recognized that non-Americans, too, have the right to be treated with dignity and benefit from the rule of law. They have actively been helping me, to this day. They helped give the world access to my side of the story when I remained imprisoned year after year, stifled and shouting in the dark. And for that I am forever thankful! 
It was never, and it still isn’t, popular to stand up for human rights if the accused is considered an ‘other,’ and much less if the accusation is terrorism-related. However, I would say that precisely for that reason, government violence should not be given free reign just because of the nature of the accusation and the background of the accused. Lynching was condemned and eventually abandoned for a reason. 
It’s now been 17 years since the opening of that infamous hell that is Guantánamo Bay. The decency of good American people requires their government to close that damn thing. 
Please close that prison and treat people within the rule of law!

She received death threats as she led efforts to stop construction of the Agua Zarca hydro-electric project on the Gualcarque River, considered sacred by Lenca Indigenous communities and vital for their survival in their territory. Berta reported the threats. She was assassinated on March 2, 2016. 
Bringing this horrific crime to justice is vital since impunity only fuels more killings of defenders of land, territory and the environment in Honduras. Indeed, the killings have continued in the three years since Berta’s murder. 
In November, 7 men were found guilty of involvement in the murder of Berta, including contract killers and people, including former military, connected to the company building the dam that Berta opposed. They have yet to be sentenced. Even more worrisome is the fact that evidence and lines of inquiry have been suppressed that would have identified the masterminds who paid for and ordered the assassination. For more, read A bittersweet verdict on the path to justice for Berta. 
 
We invite Amnesty Canada supporters to respond to a call for global action in Berta’s memory by Berta’s family and COPINH, the Indigenous human rights coalition she founded. In order to increase collective pressure, please take any of the following actions on or before March 2, the third anniversary of the assassination of Berta.

“It is deplorable that the US-led Coalition continues to ignore its responsibility of carrying out any meaningful investigations into the hundreds of civilian deaths it caused in Raqqa and elsewhere – even as it starts to withdraw from Syria.
“The Coalition is unashamedly ignoring the devastating legacy of its bombing campaign, adding insult to injury by making clear that it has no intention of offering survivors any form of remedy or compensation.  
“Amnesty International has been to Raqqa multiple times since the battle ended. Not a single one of the hundreds of survivors we’ve spoken to on the ground has even been contacted by the Coalition – let alone received any assistance – as they try to rebuild their lives.
“The Coalition’s battle for Raqqa began as  its military campaign in Mosul, in neighbouring Iraq, was winding down. Its legacy of devastation and impunity in Mosul should have served as a cautionary tale. There, too, Coalition strikes killed large numbers of civilians and destroyed civilian homes and infrastructure on a massive scale, but it barely lifted a finger to assist in the aftermath.
“Had the Coalition learned from its mistakes in Iraq, the utter devastation of Raqqa might have been avoided. Leaving such widespread civilian destruction in its wake is a humanitarian abomination that is at odds with the Coalition’s stated values.”
Background
The US withdrawal – the timeline and details of which remain unknown – is unlikely to stop the US-led Coalition’s air strikes in Syria, putting more civilian lives at risk.
Amnesty International is carrying out an ongoing investigation, in partnership with Airwars, into the shocking scale of civilian casualties resulting from four months of US, UK and French bombardment to oust the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS) from Raqqa. The results will be made public in April 2019.
Amnesty International’s on-the-ground investigations and analysis since the battle ended in October 2017 revealed compelling evidence of prima facie international humanitarian law violations by the US-led Coalition. They prompted the Coalition to revise its civilian death toll statistics upwards from 23 to more than 100 – a 300% increase. 
In a September 2018 letter to Amnesty International, the US Department of Defense – whose forces carried out most of the air strikes and all the artillery strikes on Raqqa – made clear it accepts no liability for the hundreds of civilian casualties it caused. The Coalition does not plan to compensate survivors and relatives of those killed in Raqqa and refuses to provide further information about the circumstances behind the strikes.

This injustice happened during a brutal crack-down as thousands of Hondurans took to the streets to protest alleged electoral fraud by the government of Juan Orlando Hernandez. Security forces shot at and beat protestors. Dozens were killed or badly injured. Others, like Edwin and Raul, were detained and denied their rights to due process. The crackdown was documented by Amnesty International in our report Protest Prohibited.  
After one year in a maximum security prison for violent criminals, without adequate food, water, sanitation, medical attention or access to daylight and exercise, both men have lost considerable weight and their health is in danger. There is no end in sight as Amnesty has documented multiple irregularities and serious violations of their right to defend themselves. 
Help keep hope alive for Edwin, Raul and their families. 
This past October, long-time social activist Edwin Espinal married Karen Spring, his partner of 9 years and a Canadian human rights activist from Simcoe County, Ontario working in Honduras (for more, read this update). From the limited number of visits she has been allowed, Karen has seen firsthand the deteriorating state of her husband and Raul. She fears for their health and their safety inside a prison that houses violent criminals. Karen told Amnesty Canada how important it is that prison officials and government authorities in Honduras know that the eyes of the world are watching what happens and demand justice. 
The optimum time period for action is January and early February, as we attempt to increase collective pressure and create momentum for redress. Action is still possible beyond these dates.

Below are sample messages in Spanish and English, but please make your message as personal and long as you would like: 
Dear Edwin and Raul:  You are not alone! From Town/Canada, I and others are denouncing the injustices you have suffered and calling on the authorities to demand your release from jail and guarantees of due process and fair trial so that you are able to defend yourselves. Until your release, we are also demanding guarantees of detention conditions that meet international human rights standards. We are watching. We are raising our voices. Stay strong!

This injustice happened during a brutal crack-down as thousands of Hondurans took to the streets to protest alleged electoral fraud by the government of Juan Orlando Hernandez. Security forces shot at and beat protestors. Dozens were killed or badly injured. Others, like Edwin and Raul, were detained and denied their rights to due process. The crackdown was documented by Amnesty International in our report Protest Prohibited.  
After one year in a maximum security prison for violent criminals, without adequate food, water, sanitation, medical attention or access to daylight and exercise, both men have lost considerable weight and their health is in danger. There is no end in sight as Amnesty has documented multiple irregularities and serious violations of their right to defend themselves. 
Help keep hope alive for Edwin, Raul and their families. 
This past October, long-time social activist Edwin Espinal married Karen Spring, his partner of 9 years and a Canadian human rights activist from Simcoe County, Ontario working in Honduras (for more, read this update). From the limited number of visits she has been allowed, Karen has seen firsthand the deteriorating state of her husband and Raul. She fears for their health and their safety inside a prison that houses violent criminals. Karen told Amnesty Canada how important it is that prison officials and government authorities in Honduras know that the eyes of the world are watching what happens and demand justice. 
The optimum time period for action is January and early February, as we attempt to increase collective pressure and create momentum for redress. Action is still possible beyond these dates.

“When President Trump revoked President Obama’s order to close the military prison at Guantánamo, he opened the door for a whole new era of horrific human rights violations to take place,” said Daphne Eviatar, director of Security with Human Rights at Amnesty International USA.
“While the prison should have been relegated long ago as an appalling chapter in U.S. history, Guantánamo continues to operate 17 years later as a symbol of Islamophobia that embodies the fear-mongering and xenophobia that defines Trump’s presidency.”
Guantánamo currently holds 40 Muslim men, many of whom were tortured. Some of these detainees have been cleared for transfer for years, but still remain. Among them is Toffiq al-Bihani, who was among those tortured by the CIA before he was sent to Guantánamo in 2003. He has been cleared for transfer since 2010.
“It is far too easy to imagine that Guantánamo will continue to serve as the site of ongoing human rights violations under a president who holds the cruel and erroneous belief that torture is acceptable. Those who are cleared must be transferred immediately, and all other prisoners should either be charged and fairly tried or released to allow this shameful institution to close permanently.”
Amnesty International USA will join other human rights organizations at a rally in Washington, D.C.’s Lafayette Park tomorrow at 2:30 to call for the closure of the prison.

The security officers opened fire in the hospital court yard and then marched into the emergency and medical sections of the Omdurman Hospital roughing up both patients and doctors.
“This attack on a hospital is an outrageous violation of international law. Patients and doctors in Omdurman Hospital were attacked with tear gas and live bullets as Sudanese security forces ramped up their mission to suppress peaceful protests,” said Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, Sarah Jackson.
“There must be an urgent investigation into this horrific attack, and all officers involved must be held accountable. The Government of Sudan must also take immediate action to stop the practice of shooting protesters and respect the Sudanese people’s right to freedom of expression.”
Since 19 December 2018 there have been more than 380 protests across Sudan against the high cost of living. More than 40 people have been killed and many more have sustained debilitating injuries as government security officers violently cracked down on protestors. More than 1,000 people have been arrested.
On 9 January, at least three people were killed when security forces opened fire on protestors in Omdurman, while eight people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds in the head, chest, stomach and legs.
Amnesty International today called for the urgent release of a man who was shot and injured in protests on December 25 and is now being held by the security officers from the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS).
Yasser Elsir Ali, 57, sustained serious injuries at a protest in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. A bullet fractured his ribs, punctured a lung, and lodged in his spinal cord.  After being stabilized in hospital, Yasser was due to travel to the United Arab Emirates for specialized spinal treatment but was arrested by NISS officers on 5 January. His whereabouts remain unknown.
“The Sudanese authorities must immediately release Yasser Elsir Ali and allow him to go for treatment. His life is in jeopardy and he needs urgent specialized medical attention,” said Sarah Jackson.
“They must also immediately and unconditionally release those people who have been arrested simply for peacefully protesting. It is not a crime to call for a better standard of living.”

How to believe that something like that could turn against you?” – the late Steve Fobister Sr., former Chief of the Grassy Narrows First Nation, quoted in the Toronto Star 
“Steve always wanted the government to admit that he had been poisoned by mercury. Now we take up his fight to honour him.” – the family of Steve Fobister, Sr.  
In October, Steve Fobister Sr., a leader and spokesperson for the Grassy Narrows First Nation in northwestern Ontario, died after a long struggle with mercury poisoning. He was only 66. His family and friends are clear that the struggle he helped lead is far from over. 
For more than five decades, the people of Grassy Narrows have been forced to live with the devastating consequences of a government policy that allowed massive amounts of mercury to be dumped into their river system. It’s no coincidence that Grassy Narrows, whose traditions and economy revolve around fishing, faces the worst community health crisis in Canada. 
A generation of leaders like Steve Fobister, who spoke out for the community when the mercury poisoning was first discovered, have had to deal with a lifetime of worsening health. At the same time, studies have shown that the symptoms of mercury poisoning are also widespread among young people in the community, even though they were born long after the federal and provincial governments reassured the community that the mercury threat would have vanished. 
Amnesty is continuing is work in solidarity with the people of Grassy Narrows with a new action appeal urging the federal government to acknowledge the devastating impacts on mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows and provide immediate and effective measures to address the harm, including compensation and specialized medical care.

The United Nations’ top anti-racism body has now responded to the injunction decision by calling on the federal and provincial governments to immediately suspend construction of Site C. The letter from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is absolutely clear that, despite the injunction decision, a halt to construction is absolutely necessary to prevent permanent harm to the human rights of Indigenous peoples in the Peace River region. 
The Committee also called on the federal and provincial governments to seek independent, expert advice on how to fulfill their human rights obligations, including the right of free, prior and informed consent. 
The statement by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reinforces the key messages of Amnesty International’s ongoing actions on the Site C case and creates an opportunity to reiterate and reinvigorate our appeal for the BC government to uphold its human rights obligations.

In a letter to Canada’s ambassador to the UN, dated December 14 and now posted online,  the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination calls for the massive dam project on the Peace River to be halted unless the free, prior and informed consent of the affected First Nations is obtained. 
The Committee is an independent, expert body appointed to monitor state compliance with their human rights obligations under a core international human rights instrument, the binding Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
The Committee’s call for an immediate halt to construction of the Site C dam was made under a special procedure intended to “prevent or limit the scale or number of serious violations of the Convention.” 
The Committee’s action follows a BC court ruling that allows construction to continue even though an outstanding Treaty rights challenge is still before the courts. 
The West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations have launched a civil suit alleging that destruction of the Peace Valley would violate rights protected under Treaty 8 – a concern that the federal and provincial governments deliberately excluded from consideration during the approval process for the Site C dam. The First Nations’ legal challenge is expected to take at least two to three years – and possibly much longer – to be resolved. Unless the federal and provincial governments intervene, construction activity during that time will lead to lasting harm to crucial plant and habitat and to sacred sites. 
The UN Committee has asked Canada to provide a reply by April demonstrating that construction has in fact been halted. 
In a striking comment on the gulf between the positive rhetoric of these two governments and their actual actions to date on this case, the Committee is also urging the federal and provincial governments to seek independent, expert advice on how to fulfill their human rights obligations to Indigenous peoples, including the right of free, prior and informed consent. 
The UN Committee first expressed concern over the Site C dam in August 2017, during a regularly scheduled review of Canada’s human rights record. At that time, the Committee underlined the urgency of its concerns by calling on Canada to respond within a year. The federal and provincial governments have still not done so.

More than 20,000 people have already fled...","As the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) braces itself for the long-awaited results of national elections, Amnesty International warned that a human rights crisis is looming in the country that could force countless people to flee if protests turn violent. More than 20,000 people have already fled the country since mid-December 2018.
“After multiple delays and prolonged waiting for the results of the election, the mood in the DRC is tense. The authorities appear to be preparing to escalate crackdown on protests, with many parts of the country under heavy military guard and many media outlets already shut down and muzzled,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“In the last few days police across the country have threatened and warned people not to take part in protests after the results are announced, sparking fears that demonstrations against the results will be dealt with brutally. The Congolese people are on a knife edge.”
Soldiers on the streets
In many parts of the DRC a heavy military presence is contributing to the tense mood.
In Lubumbashi and Kisangani, the army, police and non-uniformed intelligence officers have erected check points around the cities, and in Lubumbashi authorities have said these are aimed at “preventing” disorder.
Police in Ituri province and Goma in North Kivu province have explicitly warned people against joining protests following the election results. Ituri Police Chief Henri Kapend is on record warning people that police had identified the homes of “trouble makers” and would be positioned at their doorsteps to prevent them from attending protests.
The Mayor of Kananga in Kasai-Occidental province issued a statement broadcast on the national radio and TV prohibiting gatherings of three or more people, threatening “offenders” with severe punishment. 
Rumours and arrests
Rumours about the election results have already caused protests and widespread fear. On 8 January, a rumour that results were imminent caused a near-shutdown of businesses in major cities including Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Goma and Kananga, as people fled home fearing violence.
“We are afraid of what will happen with the announcement of the election results. Heavily armed soldiers are all over the place as if they were ready to go to war; but against whom?” Sylvie (not her real name), a student in Lubumbashi told Amnesty International.
On 5 January, security officers in Goma arrested up to 60 people who took to the streets to celebrate when rumours that an opposition candidate had won began to spread. On the same day the offices of Radio Télévision Debout Kasai (RTDK) in Mbujimayi were attacked by military officers and vital equipment destroyed. This attack was because of a gathering of opposition supporters celebrating what they believed to be a win for their candidate near the RTDK offices.
In Beni 43 people, including children, were arrested between 27 December 2018 and 5 January 2019, some of whom had participated in peaceful protests.  The military prosecutor in Beni told Amnesty International that 15 of these people would be charged for “participation in an insurrectionist movement.”
The general uncertainty has been compounded by the government’s crackdown on media outlets in the election period. Internet and SMS services were shut down on 31 December and three journalists were arrested between 4 and 6 January for broadcasting elections-related programs.   
“The DRC authorities have made multiple attempts to silence the voices of the Congolese people, but peace and stability will never be achieved by cracking down on human rights,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
“The Congolese people have a right to freely express their views. Violence, arbitrary arrests and censorship may silence them for a while, but in the long term this heavy-handed approach will further inflame tensions causing yet more suffering in the DRC.”
Background
After a two-year delay, the Democratic Republic of Congo finally held elections on 30 December 2018. Presidential elections in Beni, Butembo and Yumbi were, however, cancelled, and legislative and provincial elections were postponed until March 2019 because of inter-communal fighting and an Ebola outbreak.
All three main presidential candidates have claimed victory. The country’s election commission has faced growing local, regional and international pressure to publish election results that are “consistent with people’s votes”.
More than 20,000 people have fled the DRC altogether since mid-December 2018. Over 16,000 fled into Congo-Brazzaville because of mass killings in Yumbi, and another 4,000 have fled to Uganda over fears of post-elections violence.

“After nearly three weeks of being tossed around in stormy seas these women, men and children are now safely on dry land, but the fact that it took so long is shameful.
“The dangerous, unseemly spectacle of politicians bickering whilst women, men and children are stranded in a sea of cruel indifference, must not be repeated.
“The Italian and Maltese authorities have brazenly undermined the search and rescue system and used people as pawns to negotiate migration policies. But their callous disregard for peoples’ safety has been bolstered by European leaders’ inhumane failure to assist these people promptly.
“European member states must no longer turn their backs on people stranded at sea and urgently agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation policy in line with international law and on a fair system to distribute asylum-seekers among EU countries.”
For more information contact Elizabeth Berton-Hunter, Media Relations 416-363-9933 ext 332 bberton-hunter@amnesty.ca 
 
BACKGROUND
Prompt disembarkation is discouraged by the unfairness of the European asylum rules (the so-called Dublin system). These determine the country responsible for examining an asylum application.
Usually the country through which the asylum-seeker first entered the EU is responsible for examining their asylum claim. This forces a few countries to process the majority of the applications. In November 2017, the European Parliament agreed a radical change to the Dublin regulation, suggesting a binding mechanism to ensure that all EU countries welcome their fair share of people fleeing violence and persecution.

On 5 January, police in the Macomia district of Cabo Delgado arrested Amade Abubacar while he was interviewing a group of displaced people. According to reports he was taken to military detention the next day but there has been no official information about his fate.
“Amade Abubacar is a respected journalist who was collecting testimony about people fleeing deadly attacks in Cabo Delgado when he was seized by police. This is the latest display of contempt for freedom of expression and media freedom by the Mozambican authorities, who see journalists as a threat and treat them like criminals,” said Tigere Chagutah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“Amade Abubacar is being held in incommunicado detention without access to a lawyer or respect for due process.  The Mozambican authorities must immediately and unconditionally release him, and ensure that journalists can do their jobs without fear of reprisals.”
Over the past year there has been an escalation in violence in Cabo Delgado province, with armed groups carrying out attacks on civilians. Amade Abubacar was interviewing people fleeing the violence when police officers handcuffed him, confiscated his cell phone and took him into custody.
He has not been officially charged with any crime and has not been granted access to his lawyer. This is the second arbitrary arrest of a journalist in less than a month.
“Instead of targeting journalists who are covering the attacks in Cabo Delgado, the Mozambican authorities should be trying to understand the root causes of the violence and taking action to protect civilians,” said Tigere Chagutah.
Background
Amade Abubacar is a journalist at the Nacedje Communitary Radio in Cabo Delgado.  In December 2018 another journalist, Estacio Valoi, was arrested in the same area when he was carrying out his journalistic work. He was later released without charge; however his equipment is still being held by the army.
In June of the same year, another journalist working for a South African television news station, eNCA, was detained while working in the area.

“Rahaf’s story sends an important message: people around the world rallied to support her plea for protection, and people power prevailed over those who tried to oppress her. Rahaf took incredible risks to flee her family home and break Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship rules. In just a few days, her story became an inspiration to millions worldwide. Let it remind the world of the huge bravery and sacrifices shown by anyone, anywhere, who has sought safety abroad.
“We welcome the leadership shown by the Thai authorities in Rahaf’s case, however no person should be deported to a country where they are at risk of serious human rights violations. Hakeem al-Araiby, a Bahraini refugee and torture survivor who was living in Australia, has been detained by Thailand for weeks as he awaits an extradition hearing. In the past, Thailand have often breached their responsibilities to asylum seekers and refugees. The humanity shown to Rahaf must not be a one-off.”
Background
Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun landed at Suvarnabhumi Airport on 5 January 2019, en route from Kuwait to Australia. Al-Qunun says that she was fleeing abuse, beatings and death threats from her family. Upon arrival in Bangkok, al-Qunun says, she was met by a Saudi embassy official who seized her passport. Thai immigration authorities have said that al-Qunun was prevented from onward travel to Australia, having been in contact with the “Saudi Arabia embassy to coordinate” this. Following global attention for her live-tweeting of her situation on 7 January she was granted temporary stay in Thailand under UN protection.
On 9 January, Australia’s Department of Home Affairs announced that UNHCR had granted her refugee protection, and said they would consider her for resettlement in Australia.

As 2019 begins, how can we describe the state of our world in one word? Sadly, hopeful and confident aren’t the first that come to mind. Turbulent. Volatile. Unpredictable. Uncertain. The adjectives we think of come from a deeply unsettled feeling.   
Indeed, if 2018 is our guide, this year will likely roil with an ugly combination of too much conflict in global affairs, too much divisiveness in national politics, and too much bickering about the enormity of the climate crisis. 
What better time, then, to look to a different guidepost? One that’s about resistance and transformation? One that puts, at long last, the vision that states embraced when they adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 70 years ago at the heart of world affairs? Not as a secondary thought, taken up only when the necessary measures don’t cost too much, and not as something to be addressed only after we deal with the economy, the environment, armed conflict or national security. 
Imagine if our politics and public discourse began instead with human rights; how different those one-word descriptions of our world might be. Equal. Empowered. Dignified. Respectful. 
And imagine if we were able to bring that vision to the federal election less than 10 months from now. 
We would enshrine gender equality as the very core of universal human rights — and we would understand that doing so is not only essential to the dignity and safety of women, girls, the LGBTI community and all gender-nonconforming people, it’s in the best interest of all humanity. 
We would roll back the politics of fear, polarization and bigotry espoused by leaders in the United States, Brazil, Venezuela, Hungary, Russia, the Philippines, a growing number of other countries and, yes, in Canada. Not through angry debates and finger-pointing, but by rejecting hate and demonization, always and absolutely: in our personal conversations, in the media we choose to follow, and at the ballot box. 
We would lift up the courageous human rights defenders among us, particularly women’s rights activists, who’ve been vilified rather than celebrated for their passionate commitment to a world in which the rights of all are respected and upheld. 
We would starve the armies, rebel groups, militias and terrorists who have waged such agonizing wars — in Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Myanmar and elsewhere — of the weapons they use to kill and maim civilians, and the royalties from mines and other lucrative businesses that pay for those weapons. 
We would finally acknowledge that spewing toxic rhetoric about refugees and migrants — and spending staggering sums of money on cruel and insidious efforts to keep them away — achieves absolutely nothing except greater suffering, and undercuts one of the earliest universal human rights principles: There but for the grace of God go I. 
We would at long last understand that reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Canada is a shared responsibility that rests most heavy on the shoulders of those of us who enjoy the privileges and lifestyles that come from decades of human rights violations against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis people across the country — and that moving forward with reconciliation grounded in human rights is a tremendous opportunity, and, ultimately, a magnificent benefit for us all. 
We would also see that the escalating climate crisis is likely the greatest threat to human rights. For that reason, it’s not just for environmentalists, the oil patch and governments to work out the solutions. Universally, the rights of all of us are threatened. Universally, all of us bear the responsibility to prevent climate catastrophe.

“The Trump Administration has done everything in its power to make the situation at the border as unbearable as possible. From forcing people to remain in an unsafe country, to deliberately slowing the process to a crawl, to detaining children for months on end, to unlawfully turning asylum-seekers away entirely, the U.S. has only increased the misery for people seeking protection.
“This is entirely a crisis of the administration’s own making. It’s time to stop the political posturing and get back to work to create policies that treat families with dignity, fairness and respect.”

“Rahaf is at risk of great harm if Thai authorities deport her back to Saudi Arabia via Kuwait. Reports that a Saudi official confiscated her passport upon arrival in Bangkok are extremely concerning. The arbitrary confiscation of a passport also violates the right to freedom of movement.
“She has expressed clear fears for her safety if she returns to her family, and could face criminal charges in Saudi Arabia for disobeying laws on male guardianship. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has requested access to Rahaf. Thai authorities have yet to provide that access – they must do so immediately and ensure that her right to seek asylum is respected.
“The Thai authorities are bound by the general prohibition not to transfer persons to any place where they would face a real risk of serious human rights abuses. Rahaf is entitled to fair and effective safeguards against any deportation and to international protection.”
Background
Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun landed at Suvarnabhumi Airport on 5 January 2019, en route from Kuwait to Australia. Al-Qunun says that she was fleeing abuse, beatings and death threats from her family.

Samah Hadid, Middle East Director of Campaigns at Amnesty International, said:
“Saudi Arabia’s censorship of Netflix using a cyber-crime law comes as no surprise, and is further proof of a relentless crackdown on freedom of expression in the Kingdom.
“Since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman came to power in June 2017, many outspoken human rights defenders, activists and critics have been arbitrarily detained, or unjustly sentenced to lengthy prison terms simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression.
“The authorities have previously used anti cyber-crime laws to silence dissidents, creating an environment of fear for those who dare to speak up in Saudi Arabia.
“By bowing to the Saudi Arabian authorities’ demands, Netflix is in danger of facilitating the Kingdom’s zero-tolerance policy on freedom of expression and assisting the authorities in denying people’s right to freely access information.”
Background
In Saudi Arabia, Netflix removed an episode of satirical comedy show Patriot Act that was critical of the country’s authorities after officials from the Kingdom complained.
American comedian Hasan Minhaj was critical of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a monologue that discussed the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the Kingdom’s account of what happened inside the country’s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018, when the journalist was forcibly disappeared and killed.
The Saudi telecoms regulator had cited a cyber-crime law that states that “production, preparation, transmission, or storage of material impinging on public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy, through the information network or computers” is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine.
In a statement, Netflix said: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a valid legal request – and to comply with local law.”

Condemning the recent attack on journalists and activists, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner, Saad Hammadi said, “The authorities must impartially investigate these attacks and bring the perpetrators to justice. Such incidents are detrimental to a peaceful atmosphere for people to exercise their civil and political rights.”
At least 12 journalists on duty to cover the elections at a Dhaka constituency came under attack and 16 vehicles carrying them were damaged by a group of 30-35 attackers on 24 December 2018. The guest house where the journalists were resting also came under attack.

“Today’s shameful verdict is a travesty of justice. The decision to uphold Nabeel Rajab’s conviction and five-year sentence simply for posting tweets expressing his opinions, exposes Bahrain’s justice system as a complete farce. His treatment by the Bahraini authorities is completely unacceptable. 
“Nabeel Rajab is a prisoner of conscience. It is utterly outrageous that he has already spent two years behind bars – including nine agonizing months in solitary confinement, amounting to torture. Instead of prolonging his suffering and condemning him to several more years in prison the Bahraini authorities should quash his conviction and sentence and release him immediately and unconditionally.”
Background:
On 5 June 2018 Bahrain’s Appeal Court upheld Nabeel Rajab’s five years prison sentence for comments posted and retweeted on his Twitter account about the killing of civilians in Yemen by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition and allegations of torture in Jaw prison after a prison riot in March 2015. He was convicted of “spreading false rumours in time of war”, “insulting public authorities” and “insulting a foreign country”.
He is also serving two years for TV interviews he gave in 2015 and 2016, when he reportedly said that the Bahraini authorities were not granting human rights organizations access to the country.

“Today’s court decision to uphold Ahmed Mansoor’s conviction and 10-year prison sentence confirms there is no space for free expression in the United Arab Emirates.”
“Ahmed Mansoor’s only ‘crime’ was to express his peaceful opinions on social media, and it is outrageous that he is being punished with such a heavy prison sentence. This is a final verdict and cannot be appealed. Instead of punishing Ahmed Mansoor for daring to express his opinions, the authorities must ensure his conviction and sentence are quashed and release him immediately and unconditionally.”
In May 2018 Ahmed Mansoor was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 1,000,000 Emirati Dirham (approximately USD $270,000) for posts he made on Facebook and Twitter after being convicted of publishing “false information, rumours and lies about the UAE” which would damage the country’s “social harmony and unity.” During his trial all court proceedings were conducted in almost total secrecy.
Prior to his imprisonment Ahmed Mansoor had been one of the most prominent human rights defenders in the UAE. In 2015 he received the prestigious Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders for his work documenting the human rights situation in the country.

Wang is one of the few lawyers still held in detention after the Chinese government’s mass crackdown in 2015, which targeted nearly 250 lawyers and activists. He is on trial at the Tianjin Municipal No.2 Intermediate People’s Court accused of “subverting state power,” which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
“This is a sham trial in which Wang Quanzhang is being persecuted only for peacefully defending human rights,” said Doriane Lau, China researcher at Amnesty International.
“Wang Quanzhang has already been unjustly held for more than three years, during which his family suffered the anguish of not knowing whether he was alive until recently. He must be immediately and unconditionally released.”
Wang was taken away by police on 3 August 2015. It was only in July 2018 that his family learnt from a trusted lawyer that Wang Quanzhang was alive and being held in Tianjin.
A lawyer hired by Wang’s family finally met Wang Quanzhang in the detention centre on 12 July 2018. It was the first time throughout his entire detention that Wang could see a lawyer of his choice. The lawyer said Wang Quanzhang seemed very scared when they met. There are serious concerns he has been tortured and otherwise ill-treated in detention.
“Wang Quanzhang disappeared into a black hole for three years, during which only the Chinese authorities knew his fate. Without legal safeguards, including regular access to his lawyer and his family, he remains at grave risk of being tortured and otherwise ill-treated,” said Doriane Lau.
Other human rights lawyers who were detained in the 2015 crackdown and later released have reported been beaten, made to stand for up to 15 consecutive hours and force-fed medication.
Before his detention, Wang Quanzhang worked on issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government, such as defending religious freedom and members of the New Citizens’ Movement, a network of grassroots activists who promote government transparency and expose corruption.
Due to his role in representing such cases, Wang faced frequent incidents of intimidation prior to his detention.
Li Wenzu, Wang’s wife, has campaigned tirelessly to bring her husband home safely. She has faced constant harassment and surveillance since Wang Quanzhang was detained.

“With further protest planned tomorrow, the fact that the security forces are using lethal force so indiscriminately against unarmed protesters is extremely troubling,” said Sarah Jackson,
Amnesty International’s deputy director for East Africa, the Great Lakes and the Horn.
“With dozens already dead, the government must rein in this deadly use of force and prevent more unnecessary bloodshed. Instead, of trying to stop people from demonstrating, the authorities should be focusing on ending longstanding repression of human rights and resolving the economic crisis that have collectively precipitated these protests.”

“The damning report by the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts reveals that the government of President Daniel Ortega has committed crimes against humanity in the context of the crisis that began last April. This report constitutes a detailed investigation of the crimes under international law and human rights violations carried out by state agents under the command of President Ortega, using public institutions and pro-government armed groups to establish a repressive state apparatus, with the intention to kill and persecute those who opposed their policies.”
“A report of this nature must be investigated formally, in an impartial and exhaustive manner. To that end, the role of the international community is crucial to prevent crimes from going unpunished. Amnesty International reminds all states that they can exercise universal jurisdiction in relation to these crimes against humanity.”
More information:
As in previous Amnesty International reports, the GIEI-Nicaragua investigation has shown that violent events in Nicaragua are part of a deliberately lethal state strategy for repression. The GIEI’s investigation establishes that most of the killings committed, within the timeframe in question, were the result of the use of firearms, with the intention to cause loss of life, at the hands of state agents or others acting in collusion with them. The GIEI-Nicaragua’s report also states that the Nicaraguan authorities have used practically all the state apparatus, including the National Police, the Prosecutor’s Office and the judicial system, as well as pro-government armed groups, to kill, imprison, ill-treat, torture and persecute those people who oppose their policies or are perceived as such.
The Nicaraguan government announced the temporary suspension of the presence and visits of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and its Special Monitoring Mechanism for Nicaragua (MESENI), as well as the end of the GIEI’s mandate prior to the presentation of their final report.

“These killings must stop. Opening fire on unarmed protesters cannot be justified and what is clearly needed now is an independent, efficient investigation into these events. All those responsible for unnecessary or excessive use of force, including those with command responsibility, must be brought to justice. 
“The government must also immediately and unconditionally release all those arrested for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly.
“It must address the root cause of the rapidly deteriorating economic conditions in the country instead of trying to prevent people from fully exercising their right to protest against the growing hardships they are facing.”
Background
Sudan is currently experiencing a severe economic crisis which has led to a rise in the cost of fuel, electricity, transport, food and medicine provoking countrywide protests.
Since 14 December, tens of thousands of people have been taking part in protests in different parts of the country including in Wad Madani, Port Sudan, Gebeit, Al-Qadarif, Atbara, Berber, Dongla, Karima, Al-Damazin, Al Obeid, Al Fasher, Khartoum and Omdurman.
Security officers on Wednesday and Thursday shot at protestors to disperse them killing six people in Al Qadarif, one in Berber and two in Karima.
The government has also shut down the internet since 20 December, in yet another attempt to stop the protests.

The magazine, produced by Amnesty International Netherlands, was in extremely poor taste and entirely at odds with our values and objectives as a global human rights movement.
It is clear that the magazine trivialized the suffering and trauma refugees have experienced fleeing their homes, particularly women. We realize the images also compounded sexualized gender stereotypes that harm and objectify women, specifically women of colour. We are conscious that the use of life jackets as a prop was particularly hurtful to people who have depended on these for their survival. We are profoundly sorry for this.
Amnesty International Netherlands never intended to offend anyone and deeply regret the choices that were made in relation to this magazine. They realise this has been a mistake and has distracted from the urgent need for action to end the dire situation for many trapped on the Greek islands.
Amnesty International is reviewing the process which led to this magazine being produced to ensure that lessons are learned. We will be issuing renewed guidelines to national sections to ensure that will not happen in the future.

“Today’s acquittal of all 43 NGO workers in the first ‘foreign funding’ case is a step in the right direction for Egyptian justice. This was a bogus case that targeted human rights defenders simply for doing their legitimate work and should never have happened in the first place.
“However, today’s ruling only relates to the first phase of the case which investigated the funding of international organizations; the investigation into local Egyptian NGOs is ongoing and dozens of staff are still at risk. 
“Since the ‘foreign funding’ case was opened Egyptian human rights defenders have been treated as enemies of the state, subjected to an unprecedented crackdown, including asset freezes, travel bans and prosecutions.
“The key test now will be whether today’s court decision paves the way for an end to the persecution of all human rights defenders in the country. The Egyptian authorities must lift all travel bans and asset freezes against NGO staff and drop their investigations into Egyptian NGOs and human rights defenders for their legitimate human rights work.”
The EU-Egypt Association Council meeting is taking place in Brussels today. EU states must take this opportunity to call for an end to the criminal investigation into Egyptian NGOs.
Background
In June 2013,the first phase of the investigation into NGO funding (Case 173 of 2011) concluded when  42 foreign and Egyptian NGO workers were sentenced to prison terms of between one and five years and a series of international NGOs were closed.
Since 2014, investigative judges have been conducting a criminal investigation into the work and funding of local NGOs and have issued asset freezes against six organizations and 10 human rights defenders. They have banned at least 30 human rights defenders and NGO staff from travel abroad. The judges also summoned at least six directors and 61 civil society organization staff for interrogation and later ordered their release on bail.

Dr Nasser bin Ghaith is serving a 10-year sentence for criticizing the UAE in comments posted on Twitter after a grossly unfair politically motivated trial.
“News that Dr Nasser bin Ghaith’s health has deteriorated sharply leaving him too weak to stand up and causing him to start losing his eyesight, is deeply alarming. He is a prisoner of conscience and should not even be behind bars let alone serving a ludicrous 10-year sentence based on a deeply flawed trial,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Campaigns Director.
“Instead of prolonging his suffering the Emirati authorities should order his immediate and unconditional release. Until then, they must ensure he is granted any medical care that he requires.”
Dr Nasser bin Ghaith has been on hunger strikes for various lengths of time over the past 75 days in protest at his detention and prison conditions. Since 7 October 2018 he has only eaten a small amount of food a handful of times and his health has severely declined. Before his imprisonment he already had high blood pressure resulting in cardiomegaly (enlargement of the heart) but he is not receiving his blood pressure medication in prison. He also has early-stage fatty liver disease.
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison on appeal in March 2017 convicted on charges that include “insulting the UAE” based on comments he made on Twitter regarding his treatment during an earlier trial. He was also convicted of “communicating and cooperating with members of the banned al-Islah organization”. During his trial, Emirati authorities restricted his access to his lawyer meaning he was unable to prepare a proper defence.
“The recent imprisonment of the British PhD student Matthew Hedges, who was convicted on spying charges after grossly unfair proceedings, shone an international spotlight on the UAE’s repressive practices. However, across the
country there are dozens of prisoners of conscience, like Dr Nasser bin Ghaith, who are languishing in dire conditions, unjustly jailed for peacefully expressing their views,” said Samah Hadid.

The charges levelled against Stella Nyanzi under the Computer Misuse Act are in direct contravention of Uganda’s constitution and its international human rights obligations to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression.
“Stella Nyanzi has been repeatedly harassed, arrested and detained, simply for daring to speak out against the government. These latest charges relating to Facebook posts in which she criticized President Yoweri Museveni and First Lady Janet Museveni, are yet another callous attempt to silence her,” said Roland Ebole, Amnesty International’s Uganda researcher.
“We are calling on the Ugandan authorities to drop these absurd charges and ensure that she is able to enjoy her human rights without any fear of intimidation or arrest.”
The Ugandan authorities must also scrap the Computer Misuse Act 2011 – a repressive law has been used to systematically harass, intimidate and stifle government online critics.
The Makerere University academic was arrested on 2 November at a police station where she had gone to notify officers of a protest she was planning to hold at the university.
This is the second time she has been charged with insulting the president and violating his right to privacy.

“This is an absurd and shocking crackdown on a well-established, peaceful event. To use an arcane wartime decree about holding events in public spaces to stop a private gathering at a hotel is clearly unjustified and cynical,” said Minar Pimple, Amnesty International’s Senior Director for Global Operations.
A coalition of local groups were holding their third annual workshop today at the Hanoi Club Hotel. As in previous years, the meeting aimed to discuss approaches to social issues including public service access, health and gender equality.
Once the workshop was underway, local police entered the premises and ordered organizers to shut it down. Police accused organizers of violating a wartime law from 1957, Decree 257-TTg, which provides that public authorities must be informed of events at least 24 hours in advance.
“Viet Nam’s Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of assembly and association, which it also must respect and protect under international human rights treaties, so to close down this event violates both international law and Viet Nam’s own Constitution. The authorities must allow this vital gathering of respected grassroots groups to go ahead and put an end to this worsening crackdown on civil society groups,” said Minar Pimple.
 Background
The two-day event was organized by the People’s Participation Working Group (PPWG), the Partnership for Action in Health Equity (PAHE), the Group of Public Administration Reform, Human Rights Space, the Gender and Community Network (Gencomnet), the Ethnic Minority Working Group (EMWG), the Evidence-Based Health Policy Development Advocacy Group (EBPHD), and the Vietnam Non-Communicable Disease Prevention Alliance (NCDs-VN).
This annual meeting is a civil society platform for Vietnamese organizations to discuss ways to advise and engage with the government on solutions to social issues.

At this year’s Human Rights Defenders World Summit in Paris, France, Amnesty asked 11 prominent activists about the essence of human rights. Here’s what they said… 
Anielle is a teacher, journalist and activist. She is also the sister of Marielle Franco, a human rights defender who was shot dead earlier this year. Anielle is determined to seek justice for her sister and speak out about racism and the challenges black women face in Brazil. 
 
 
Human rights are the opportunity to defend what we truly believe in. For me, love and education are at the root of human rights. They can save us from many things.  
Marielle and I were born human rights defenders. We didn’t have a choice. We grew up in the slums. It was dangerous. Men would often kill their wives. We couldn’t just sit there and witness such injustice. We knew we had to do something. 
My sister Marielle taught me so much – I’ve been learning from her since I was a teenager. When I moved to the USA, aged 16, she said: “No matter where you go, you will always have to fight for something.” She instilled a sense of justice in me and from there, I joined the National Coalition of 100 Black Women and trained as a journalist. Back in Brazil, Marielle was always fighting for something. No matter where I was, I always supported her. It was incredible to see the powerful woman she became. She fought for justice until the day she was killed. 
Being a black woman in Brazil is incredibly difficult. We’re the most marginalized. I’m aware of the struggles ahead and I am scared. I don’t know what will happen next. I know they are going to try and shut us down and silence us, but we have to come together. We won’t give up the fight. 
Join Anielle and take action calling for justice for Marielle. 
Eva Lewis, 19, is a human rights activist and artist from the southside of Chicago, Illinois. She is founder and CEO of The I Project. Oh, and did we mention, she’s very cool. 
 
Human rights are the tools necessary to build sustainability. If you don’t have tools, you can’t build anything. To me, the southside of Chicago is like a fishbowl. There are lots of fish and one flavour of food. People can’t build their own tanks, so we’re in one fishbowl, sharing one piece. However, if we each had our own tanks, we would be OK. Human rights are the tools we need to build our own tanks.   
As a black woman, I live in a country that wasn’t meant to benefit me. It was evident growing up on the southside of Chicago. Members of my family were involved in gang activity; others fell victim to the oppression of black and brown people. 
To be liberated, I knew I would have to seek resources, such as a good education. My mother made sure I had access to those resources, but it wasn’t without struggle. Every morning I would wake up at 5am to travel to school. I was surviving on four to five hours sleep a night, but I had no choice. There weren’t any good schools in my area. 
Attending school on the northside of Chicago shaped me as a human rights activist. I quickly realised education in the US was about equity, not equality. I had a duty to speak out. It was an acquired privilege to be in this space, and I had to talk about the struggles my people go through. By speaking out I’ve acquired the skills needed to be an activist. 
Today I attend an Ivy League Institution. I am developing a team of young femmes of colour from disenfranchised communities who are fighting oppression. I’ve also set up a non-profit called the The I project. It’s an activism through arts initiative and I am really proud of it.   
Fred Bauma is a leader of the social justice, human rights and pro-democracy youth group LUCHA, which advocates for change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was arrested in March 2015 and spent 18 months in prison and could have faced the death penalty. Following international pressure from organizations like Amnesty International, Fred was released in 2016. 
 
Human rights, for me, are simple. It’s the things that make you feel human and make you consider someone else to be as human as you. It’s not in the laws or in the UN, it’s in love, compassion and empathy.   
Growing up, I saw a lot of violence in my country. People were suffering and there was a feeling of powerlessness. A lot of people were displaced, including myself. I didn’t want to see anybody else in the same situation, and I knew something had to change. That’s why I became a human rights activist. 
The first challenge I had to overcome was state violence and repression. I experience it every day and so does my family. After I was arrested, I was labelled a risk. Apart from my family and friends, people didn’t want to acknowledge that they knew me – they looked at me in a different way. My family and friends were so courageous to stand up for me, even though it affected the way they were seen too. 
It makes me proud to see that my fellow people citizens are starting to speak more freely, without fear. The pressure continues but at least they are aware of the power we hold. For me, bringing power back to the people will be the most important achievement. 
Vitalina Koval is an incredible activist in Ukraine’s LGBTI community. She co-founded a community centre that provides a safe space for LGBTI people, and fearlessly speaks out against hate. 
 
For me, human rights are basic values. They are the foundation for an open and inclusive society. 
I came out as a lesbian at 25. After that, I realized I had nothing more to keep to myself. I wanted to fight for the rights of LGBTQI people and women. I knew I was a human rights defender  after attending the Revolution Dignity [Ukrainian Revolution]  in Ukraine. I spent two and a half weeks campaigning on Maidan Nezalezhnosti [the central square in Kiev]. It shaped me as a human rights activist. 
There are two key issues in Ukraine today and two reasons we must keep campaigning. Firstly, the activity of radical right-wing groups has surged over the last few years. We, as human rights defenders, must counteract them and protect each other. Secondly, the police fail to prosecute people who commit crimes against activists. When these people feel impunity, they commit even more violence. We’ve got to work with law-enforcement to develop hate crime legislation. 
My personal accomplishment is coming out as a lesbian – I didn’t want to hide any longer. I have the same rights as anyone. I deserve to be happy and to live freely. 
Join Amnesty International in calling for justice for Vitalina. 
Human rights defender and engineer Mudawi Ibrahim Adam has been exposing human rights violations in Darfur for years. He has been repeatedly jailed on charges related to his human rights work. 
 
To me, human rights are equality, justice, freedom of association, freedom from suppression. It’s a right to life. A right to food. A right to housing.  
I grew up hating injustice. I wanted to support people in need. I found myself fighting injustice. I found myself a human rights activist. Sudan is a diverse country, with people from many religions and cultures. I was combatting poverty and human rights violations and fighting for equality wasn’t an easy fight. I spent parts of my life in prison, denied my freedom. I remain proud of what I’ve achieved – especially when I see the impact I’ve had on young people and their determination to work for justice. 
Aura Lolita Chávez Ixcaquic, known as Lolita, is a women’s rights activist and Guatemalan indigenous leader, who is leading the struggle to protect her land. 
 
Human rights are justice, freedom and a way of living together in the same world. It is a fight not just for people, but for nature, mountains and rivers.  
My mother was a human rights defender, so I became one too. My village was under threat, and I knew I had to fight. Businesses are still trying to take our land – they want it for money. I dared to speak out, but now I am unable to go back to my village. I’ve received death threats, I’ve been accused of things I haven’t done. I cannot go back. 
Public speaker, human rights defender and all-round brilliant person Maria Munir is speaking out on issues such as transgender rights and non-binary discrimination. 
 
Human rights are those freedoms that everyone should be afforded equally to have a fair chance in life. It’s the basic things that underpin what a person needs to live, such as sanitation and housing. When we speak in these terms, human rights become something everyone can relate to and understand. It helps break the barrier that human rights are something happening elsewhere. In fact, human rights are something every human is entitled to.  
I have always had a strong sense of the importance of equality. Everyone has the right to access information. Social class, education and money should not stop people from understanding how the world works and how they can ensure their place in the world is protected. 
One of the biggest challenges of being a human rights defender is myself. I have a lot of self-doubt. Even though I’ve done a lot of work, I still doubt myself and question whether I am good enough. Now, rather than question whether someone else could be doing it better, I ask: Why aren’t more people human rights defenders? Why don’t we allow more people to speak on the issues of human rights? 
The first time I came out as non-binary was in front of President Obama, during a Q&A in London. In the UK we don’t recognise non-binary people under the Equality Act, so we literally have no rights. I had intended to ask Obama about his regrets with regards to intervening in Libya, but then it occurred to me that this is a brilliant time to put the spotlight on an issue which has often been ignored or superseded by others. 
Yet, I wouldn’t say my ‘Obama moment’ is my biggest achievement. For me, it’s the amount of people who have said my work has made a difference. I’ve received so many Twitter messages and emails and I’ve opened up a conversation that people have been unable to have until now. That’s the most valuable thing to me! 
Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Matthew Caruana Galizia is calling for justice for his mother, Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was assassinated a year ago in Malta. 
 
Human rights are like air. Until they’re taken away, you don’t know what you have. You only realise how necessary they are once the air is taken away and you can no longer breathe.  
I didn’t decide to become an activist. It’s wasn’t my choice. My mother and I were both journalists, but we reached the point where we were under such heavy attack we were spending most of our time defending our work to justify our existence. 
My mother was murdered, just for doing the work of a journalist. In the lead up to her murder she was under constant attack. She faced over 50 civil or criminal libel cases and her bank accounts were frozen by our government minister. 
Corruption and impunity are ongoing issues in Malta. That’s the root of everything. We report on corrupt politicians, but nothing happens. They enjoy impunity, then they attack us. Eventually it leads to the murder of a journalist. 
The work of a human rights defender is not something I do out of choice. It’s something I must do. 
Nurcan Baysal is a Kurdish human rights defender and journalist from Diyarbakir, in the Kurdish region of Turkey. Nurcan has faced death threats, received abusive messages and she’s been detained by the authorities. In spite of everything, Nurcan is determined to keep fighting. 
 
Human rights are something so basic, but so important. Without rights we are nothing. If you can’t speak, if you can’t see, or say what you’re thinking; if you can’t go and protest, use your own language or come together with your own friends to speak out, what’s the point? Life is meaningful with our rights! 
I have been protecting the rights of both women and children for over 20 years. I am a journalist first and foremost, but I’m a human rights defender too. 
There’s been war in our region for over 40 years. I am part of the second or third generation of Kurdish people who grew up with war. I don’t want my children to have the same life. That’s why I am calling for peace and working to ensure the rights of the community are protected. It hasn’t been an easy task. I’ve faced a lot of challenges, mainly from the Turkish state. My existence is a problem for those in power. 
When the curfews were imposed, the Turkish media totally closed their eyes to what was going on in our region. I was one of the few people who informed the Turkish public what was really happening. I really tried to make a difference – and looking back, I feel like we saved some people. 
Phylesha Brown-Acton has worked in the HIV sector and on behalf of LGBTI communities for over 20 years.  She is also the Co-Chairperson of the Asia Pacific Transgender Network (APTN) and Director of F’INE Pasifika Aotearoa, New Zealand. 
 
What are human rights? It’s a basic but loaded question. Human rights mean so much to so many different people. To me human rights are for all people, to make sure they’re protected, safe and enjoy the same opportunities.  
I was born a human rights defender. As a child, a young person, an adult, a trans woman and as an indigenous activist, I’ve always had something to say. I believe in standing up for causes that I believe in. I come from a long line of strong women who have been the backbone of the foundation of culture and community. They have been the force that’s long held me up and encouraged me to speak out. 
I’ve faced many challenges during my life. I am a trans woman – do I need to say much more? If you understand my reality as a trans woman, the biggest challenge is having to deal with people redefining me. Many people cannot accept or understand that the notion of gender is not as binary as they think it is. 
Other than being alive, I have many accomplishments. One of them is being able to participate in the second ever Human Rights Defenders World Summit. I am the only one representing the South Pacific region. I am just one voice from the region, but I hope it opens the doors for others. 
Han Hui Hui is a blogger and human rights defender. She uses her blog and social media to highlight shortcomings in social services, as well as raise public awareness of human rights violations in Singapore. She has been physically assaulted and harassed, and has been jailed and held in solitary confinement just for speaking out.   
 
As a Singaporean, I believe human rights are concrete things. The ability to have adequate housing for families to stay in. Adequate healthcare so people are not afraid to fall ill and die. And proper pensions so everyone can enjoy their golden age once they’re retired.  
I don’t consider myself a human right defender. I am just an ordinary Singapore citizen, who wants to blog about my life and the education system in my country. But blogging about the education system in Singapore has got me into trouble. 
In 2013, the Singapore Government sent me a letter accusing me of defamation. I was very scared. I didn’t have the resources to fight back against the government. I started looking beyond borders, and that’s when I realised there was something called freedom of speech and that I had the right to question the government. 
I continued blogging, but I faced a lot of abuse. People questioned whether I was a girl. They think girls should just focus on clothes and make-up – they think we don’t have the brains to blog, too.   
I still face harassment. I have been banned from organizing an event in Singapore. I’ve spent time in solitary confinement and I’ve also faced deportation. In the end, I am just a curious person who wants to raise awareness.

At this year’s Human Rights Defenders World Summit in Paris, France, Amnesty asked 11 prominent activists about the essence of human rights. Here’s what they said… 
Anielle is a teacher, journalist and activist. She is also the sister of Marielle Franco, a human rights defender who was shot dead earlier this year. Anielle is determined to seek justice for her sister and speak out about racism and the challenges black women face in Brazil. 
 
 
Human rights are the opportunity to defend what we truly believe in. For me, love and education are at the root of human rights. They can save us from many things.  
Marielle and I were born human rights defenders. We didn’t have a choice. We grew up in the slums. It was dangerous. Men would often kill their wives. We couldn’t just sit there and witness such injustice. We knew we had to do something. 
My sister Marielle taught me so much – I’ve been learning from her since I was a teenager. When I moved to the USA, aged 16, she said: “No matter where you go, you will always have to fight for something.” She instilled a sense of justice in me and from there, I joined the National Coalition of 100 Black Women and trained as a journalist. Back in Brazil, Marielle was always fighting for something. No matter where I was, I always supported her. It was incredible to see the powerful woman she became. She fought for justice until the day she was killed. 
Being a black woman in Brazil is incredibly difficult. We’re the most marginalized. I’m aware of the struggles ahead and I am scared. I don’t know what will happen next. I know they are going to try and shut us down and silence us, but we have to come together. We won’t give up the fight. 
Join Anielle and take action calling for justice for Marielle. 
Eva Lewis, 19, is a human rights activist and artist from the southside of Chicago, Illinois. She is founder and CEO of The I Project. Oh, and did we mention, she’s very cool. 
 
Human rights are the tools necessary to build sustainability. If you don’t have tools, you can’t build anything. To me, the southside of Chicago is like a fishbowl. There are lots of fish and one flavour of food. People can’t build their own tanks, so we’re in one fishbowl, sharing one piece. However, if we each had our own tanks, we would be OK. Human rights are the tools we need to build our own tanks.   
As a black woman, I live in a country that wasn’t meant to benefit me. It was evident growing up on the southside of Chicago. Members of my family were involved in gang activity; others fell victim to the oppression of black and brown people. 
To be liberated, I knew I would have to seek resources, such as a good education. My mother made sure I had access to those resources, but it wasn’t without struggle. Every morning I would wake up at 5am to travel to school. I was surviving on four to five hours sleep a night, but I had no choice. There weren’t any good schools in my area. 
Attending school on the northside of Chicago shaped me as a human rights activist. I quickly realised education in the US was about equity, not equality. I had a duty to speak out. It was an acquired privilege to be in this space, and I had to talk about the struggles my people go through. By speaking out I’ve acquired the skills needed to be an activist. 
Today I attend an Ivy League Institution. I am developing a team of young femmes of colour from disenfranchised communities who are fighting oppression. I’ve also set up a non-profit called the The I project. It’s an activism through arts initiative and I am really proud of it.   
Fred Bauma is a leader of the social justice, human rights and pro-democracy youth group LUCHA, which advocates for change in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was arrested in March 2015 and spent 18 months in prison and could have faced the death penalty. Following international pressure from organizations like Amnesty International, Fred was released in 2016. 
 
Human rights, for me, are simple. It’s the things that make you feel human and make you consider someone else to be as human as you. It’s not in the laws or in the UN, it’s in love, compassion and empathy.   
Growing up, I saw a lot of violence in my country. People were suffering and there was a feeling of powerlessness. A lot of people were displaced, including myself. I didn’t want to see anybody else in the same situation, and I knew something had to change. That’s why I became a human rights activist. 
The first challenge I had to overcome was state violence and repression. I experience it every day and so does my family. After I was arrested, I was labelled a risk. Apart from my family and friends, people didn’t want to acknowledge that they knew me – they looked at me in a different way. My family and friends were so courageous to stand up for me, even though it affected the way they were seen too. 
It makes me proud to see that my fellow people citizens are starting to speak more freely, without fear. The pressure continues but at least they are aware of the power we hold. For me, bringing power back to the people will be the most important achievement. 
Vitalina Koval is an incredible activist in Ukraine’s LGBTI community. She co-founded a community centre that provides a safe space for LGBTI people, and fearlessly speaks out against hate. 
 
For me, human rights are basic values. They are the foundation for an open and inclusive society. 
I came out as a lesbian at 25. After that, I realized I had nothing more to keep to myself. I wanted to fight for the rights of LGBTQI people and women. I knew I was a human rights defender  after attending the Revolution Dignity [Ukrainian Revolution]  in Ukraine. I spent two and a half weeks campaigning on Maidan Nezalezhnosti [the central square in Kiev]. It shaped me as a human rights activist. 
There are two key issues in Ukraine today and two reasons we must keep campaigning. Firstly, the activity of radical right-wing groups has surged over the last few years. We, as human rights defenders, must counteract them and protect each other. Secondly, the police fail to prosecute people who commit crimes against activists. When these people feel impunity, they commit even more violence. We’ve got to work with law-enforcement to develop hate crime legislation. 
My personal accomplishment is coming out as a lesbian – I didn’t want to hide any longer. I have the same rights as anyone. I deserve to be happy and to live freely. 
Join Amnesty International in calling for justice for Vitalina. 
Human rights defender and engineer Mudawi Ibrahim Adam has been exposing human rights violations in Darfur for years. He has been repeatedly jailed on charges related to his human rights work. 
 
To me, human rights are equality, justice, freedom of association, freedom from suppression. It’s a right to life. A right to food. A right to housing.  
I grew up hating injustice. I wanted to support people in need. I found myself fighting injustice. I found myself a human rights activist. Sudan is a diverse country, with people from many religions and cultures. I was combatting poverty and human rights violations and fighting for equality wasn’t an easy fight. I spent parts of my life in prison, denied my freedom. I remain proud of what I’ve achieved – especially when I see the impact I’ve had on young people and their determination to work for justice. 
Aura Lolita Chávez Ixcaquic, known as Lolita, is a women’s rights activist and Guatemalan indigenous leader, who is leading the struggle to protect her land. 
 
Human rights are justice, freedom and a way of living together in the same world. It is a fight not just for people, but for nature, mountains and rivers.  
My mother was a human rights defender, so I became one too. My village was under threat, and I knew I had to fight. Businesses are still trying to take our land – they want it for money. I dared to speak out, but now I am unable to go back to my village. I’ve received death threats, I’ve been accused of things I haven’t done. I cannot go back.

Perhaps surprisingly, however, the Senator has chosen to illustrate her concerns with some gender-based analysis of her own. 
Bill C-69 includes a requirement that future assessment consider how projects might have different impacts for different people, particularly along the lines of gender. Senator Wallin has called this requirement for gender-based analysis vague and confusing, suggesting that it is part of some liberal agenda to derail the assessment process. “What does the intersection of gender and sex with other identity factors really mean?,” she asked in the Senate on December 11th.  
Senator Wallin went on to illustrate her concerns by giving the example of a single mother working as a waitress in the oil patch, who relies on tips from energy workers to “feed her kids and pay for hockey equipment.” Whether the Senator knows it or now, this is actually an example of gender-based analysis – just not very good analysis.  
The Senator’s anecdote illustrates two important realities about the benefits of resource development in Canada. First, the highest paying jobs in construction mostly go to men. Second, opportunities for women to benefit from the resource economy often take the form of much lower paying jobs in the service sector where tips are crucial to making ends meet. 
This is the kind of information that a gender-based analysis would bring to the table in decisions about where proposed projects are sustainable and in the public interest and whether conditions need to be imposed to mitigate potential harm. However, a good gender-based analysis would go further.  
A good gender-based analysis would ask whether local prices for food, housing and even hockey equipment have risen to take advantage of the high wages paid to oil industry and whether the single mother working as a waitress can actually still make ends meet – even with tips. A good gender-based analysis would also ask about other impacts of the surge in population that accompanies a new project or a periodic boom in the industry, such as whether mothers can still find daycare. Critically, a good gender-based analysis would also ask whether that waitress feels safe walking home from work in a community without public transit and where investment in policing and social services lags behind the real needs of the community. 
These questions aren’t vague or wishy washy. These are real questions that you will hear raised if you spend anytime talking with community members in resource towns and with the service providers working to meet local meets. The real question is who wouldn’t want such questions raised and addressed before a new project is approved?

A Cairo...","Egyptian authorities must immediately comply with a court decision to release Amal Fathy, a woman human rights defender who was given a two-year sentence in September for posting a video online in which she criticized the Egyptian authorities for failing to tackle sexual harassment.
A Cairo criminal court today ordered Amal Fathy’s release on probation after accepting her appeal against her pre-trial detention in relation to a separate case, in which she is charged with “belonging to a terrorist group”, “broadcasting ideas calling for terrorist acts” and “publishing fake news”. According to the terms of her probation, Amal will be required to visit a police station a number of times every week. Her next hearing in this case is on 26 December.
“Today’s court decision to order the conditional release of Amal Fathy, who has unjustly spent the past seven months behind bars, offers a glimmer of hope that her agonizing ordeal in prison will come to an end soon. The Egyptian authorities must now comply with the court’s decision and ensure she is immediately released and reunited with her family,” said Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International’s North Africa Campaigns Director.
“But releasing her on probation is not enough. Amal Fathy is being punished simply for peacefully speaking out against sexual harassment in an outrageous violation of her right to freedom of expression, contravening both Egypt’s international obligations and its own constitution. The Egyptian authorities must now drop all charges against her, quash her earlier conviction and two-year prison sentence and ensure she doesn’t face any further reprisals for freely expressing her opinions.”
Amal Fathy was arbitrarily arrested on 11 May for posting a Facebook video describing her experience of sexual harassment and criticizing the Egyptian authorities for failing to protect women.
On 20 September, she was sentenced to two years in prison with a bail of 20,000 EGP (1,120 USD) to temporarily suspend the sentence and a fine of 10,000 EGP (560 USD). The bail and fine were paid and she is now awaiting the final verdict by the appeals court on 30 December which might order her detention again.
Amal Fathy’s case has been featured in Amnesty International’s  2018 Write for Rights Campaign.  For more information click here.

The GCM, a global agreement to promote safe, orderly and regular migration, will be formally endorsed at the UN General Assembly tomorrow. Amnesty International made a number of recommendations to the draft text.
“The Global Compact for Migration is a welcome step towards improving the way the international community responds to migration and, if properly implemented, it will ensure the rights of migrants are respected and protected. The adoption of the GCM shows that it is still possible for countries to cooperate to protect human rights,” said Perseo Quiroz, Senior Advocate for the Americas at Amnesty International.
“We particularly welcome parts of the GCM which recognize the drastic impact that climate change will have on global migration. World leaders need to start planning now to ensure the rights and dignity of people driven out of their homes by climate-related disasters are respected. The GCM will guide this conversation in the coming years.”
A small number of countries, including Australia, the USA, Hungary, Italy, Austria and Poland, have refused to endorse the GCM.
These countries have been responsible for some of the worst abuses against migrants in recent years: Australia’s brutal offshore detention centres; the Trump administration’s cruel family separation policy; Italy’s cruel policy of closing its ports and trapping people in a cycle of abuses in Libya; and Hungary’s legislation criminalizing helping migrants and refugees.
“With many governments still pursuing polices that demonize migrants, it is now incumbent upon the countries who have adopted the GCM to ensure concrete action is taken. They must offer safe and legal channels for migration, and lead the way with a compassionate and fair approach to people on the move,” said Perseo Quiroz.

This remarkable group of medical professionals – including doctors, nurses, midwives, social workers, psychologists, allied health specialists, public health workers, researchers, educators and students – have signed an open letter urging Canada to review existing laws and policies regarding health care coverage for irregular migrants, and to provide Ms. Toussaint with adequate compensation for the violation of her human rights.
Amnesty International, one of more than 80 organizations that have signed the letter, welcomes this initiative and urges the government to act without delay to ensure that people with irregular immigration status have access to essential health care services.
Background:
Ms. Toussaint, a 49-year-old from Grenada, entered Canada as a visitor in 1999. She began the process to regularize her immigration status in 2005, but the process was delayed and in 2008 she developed serious health conditions requiring medical treatment. She had some access to emergency health care but was denied access to other essential health care available through Canada’s Interim Federal Health Program (IFHP) due to her irregular immigration status. 
After unsuccessfully challenging her inability to access the IFHP in Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal, and after leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied in 2012, Ms. Toussaint took her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC). Amnesty International submitted a legal opinion in support of her petition.
The UNHRC adopted the decision in August 2018 and requested a response from Canada within 180 days.

One in ten tweets mentioning black women politicians and journalists in a sample analyzed by Amnesty International was abusive or problematic, the organization said today, as it released a ground-breaking study into abuse against women on Twitter conducted with Element AI, a global artificial intelligence software product company.
More than 6,500 volunteers from 150 countries signed up to take part in Troll Patrol, a unique crowdsourcing project designed to process large-scale data about online abuse. Volunteers sorted through 228,000 tweets sent to 778 women politicians and journalists in the UK and USA in 2017.
Amnesty International and Element AI then used advanced data science and machine learning techniques to extrapolate data about the scale of abuse that women face on Twitter. Element AI calculated that 1.1 million abusive or problematic tweets were sent to the women in the study across the year – or one every 30 seconds on average.
“With the help of technical experts and thousands of volunteers, we have built the world’s largest crowdsourced dataset about online abuse against women. Troll Patrol means we have the data to back up what women have long been telling us – that Twitter is a place where racism, misogyny and homophobia are allowed to flourish basically unchecked,” said Milena Marin, Senior Advisor for Tactical Research at Amnesty International.
“We found that, although abuse is targeted at women across the political spectrum, women of colour were much more likely to be impacted, and black women are disproportionately targeted. Twitter’s failure to crack down on this problem means it is contributing to the silencing of already marginalized voices.”  
Element AI used the data gathered in Troll Patrol to develop a machine learning model of an app which attempts to automatically detect abusive tweets. Element AI is making its model available to try out here for three weeks, to demonstrate the potential and current limitations of AI technology in this field.
“This study is part of a long-term partnership between Amnesty International and Element AI. Taking a sober approach to AI, we make long-term commitments, dedicating our technical experts and tools to enable social good actors to do what they do best,” said Julien Cornebise, Director of Research, ‘AI For Good’ and Head of the London office of Element AI.
Politicians included in the sample came from across the US and UK political spectrums. The journalists included were from a diverse range of US and UK publications including The Daily Mail, The New York Times, Guardian, The Sun, GalDem, Pink News and Breitbart.
Key findings 
Black women were disproportionately targeted, being 84% more likely than white women to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets. One in ten tweets mentioning black women was abusive or problematic, compared to one in fifteen for white women.
7.1% of tweets sent to the women in the study were problematic or abusive. This amounts to 1.1 million tweets mentioning 778 women across the year, or one every 30 seconds.
Women of colour, (black, Asian, Latinx and mixed-race women) were 34% more likely to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets than white women.
Online abuse against women cuts across the political spectrum. Politicians and journalists faced similar levels of online abuse and we observed both liberals and conservatives alike, as well as left and right leaning media organizations, were affected. 
Amnesty International has repeatedly asked Twitter to publish data regarding the scale and nature of abuse on their platform, but so far the company has failed to do so. This hides the extent of the problem and makes it difficult to design effective solutions.
Troll Patrol volunteers collectively dedicated an incredible 2,500 hours analyzing tweets – the equivalent of someone working full-time for 1.5 years.
“By crowdsourcing research, we were able to build up vital evidence in a fraction of the time it would take one Amnesty researcher, without losing the human judgement which is so essential when looking at context around tweets,” said Milena Marin.
“Troll Patrol isn’t about policing Twitter or forcing it to remove content. We are asking it to be more transparent, and we hope that the findings from Troll Patrol will compel it to make that change. Crucially, Twitter must start being transparent about how exactly they are using machine learning to detect abuse, and publish technical information about the algorithms they rely on”.
Background
Abusive content violates Twitter’s own rules and includes tweets that promote violence against or threaten people based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. Problematic content is defined as content that is hurtful or hostile, especially if repeated to an individual on multiple or cumulative occasions, but not as intense as an abusive tweet.
Amnesty International shared its findings with Twitter. In response, Twitter requested clarification on the definition of “problematic” “in accordance with the need to protect free expression and ensure policies are clearly and narrowly drafted.”

The police must rein in unnecessary and excessive force, including the use of tear gas, against peaceful protesters, Amnesty International said today ahead of further demonstrations planned tonight in Budapest.
“Demonstrators are expected to descend onto Budapest’s streets tonight for a sixth night of anti-government protests. Last night we witnessed displays of unnecessary and excessive force against peaceful protesters that included the use of tear gas. This must not be repeated again. The police must use force only when strictly necessary and only when all other means to contain the violence have failed,” said Massimo Moratti, Deputy Director for Europe at Amnesty International.
“Last night’s forcible removal of two opposition MPs from the Hungarian public broadcaster’s (MTVA) building reveals the determination of Hungarian authorities to continue their crackdown on any form of dissent. This is in violation of Hungarian law, which gives MPs parliamentary immunity and access to all public institutions and contravenes Hungary’s international obligations to respect the right to freedom of expression.”
The Hungarian government’s crackdown on dissenting voices received further international condemnation today when the Venice Commission, one of Europe’s most prominent advisory bodies on constitutional law, issued an opinion criticizing Hungary’s ‘migration tax’ law. The law forces civil society organizations considered to be supporting migration to pay a 25% tax on any foreign funding.

Background:
Thousands of people have taken to streets since Wednesday 12 December when the Hungarian parliament adopted what protesters are calling a ‘Slave law’, which allows employers to request workers to work up to 400 hours of overtime a year. Employers could delay these overtime payments for up to three years.
On the same day, the parliament adopted a new piece of legislation which created a new administrative court system that would be under control of the Minister of Justice, rather than operate as an independent judicial institution, as is the norm elsewhere in Europe.
In addition to their call to repeal the “Slave Law”, protesters issued a series of other demands including an independent judiciary and independent public media.

“The fact that more countries than ever before have voted to end executions shows that global abolition of the death penalty is becoming an inevitable reality. A death penalty-free world is closer than ever.
“This vote sends yet another important signal that more and more countries are willing to take steps to end this cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment once and for all.
“The result also shows the increasing isolation of the 35 countries that voted against the resolution. Those countries still retaining the death penalty should immediately establish a moratorium on executions as a first step towards full abolition.”
Background
121 of the UN’s 193 member states voted in favour of the seventh resolution on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty at the UNGA plenary session in New York, while 35 voted against and 32 abstained. 117 had done so in December 2016. This resolution was proposed by Brazil on behalf of an Inter-Regional Task Force of member states and co-sponsored by 83 states.
For the first time, Dominica, Libya, Malaysia and Pakistan changed their vote to support the resolution, while Antigua and Barbuda, Guyana and South Sudan moved from opposition to abstention. Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Mauritius, Niger, and Rwanda once again voted in favour of the call for a moratorium on executions, having not done so in 2016.
Five countries reversed their 2016 votes, with Nauru moving from vote in favour to vote against and Bahrain and Zimbabwe switching from abstention to opposition. Congo and Guinea changed from voting in favour to abstention.
When the UN was founded in 1945 only eight of the then 51 UN member states had abolished the death penalty. Today, 103 of 193 member states have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, and 139 have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. In 2017 executions were reported in 22 UN member states, 11% of the total. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception.

This effort to move the international community at the highest level on the need to ensure the effective safety and security of human rights defenders around the world comes at a time when their role is constantly challenged and undermined in blatant contradiction with international obligations and commitments.
The meeting will take place on 18 December 2018, twenty years on from when the first UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders was created. A representative from the recent Human Rights Defenders World Summit is set to present the outcomes at the UN General Assembly, shining a spotlight on the increasing levels of danger facing activists worldwide. 
”We can only attain peace, security, dignity and sustainable development if we advance justice, freedom and equality for all, the ultimate goals of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,” said Alice Mogwe, Director of Ditshwanelo – the Botswana Centre for Human Rights, on behalf of The Human Rights Defenders World Summit.
States are the main perpetrators behind violations against human rights defenders, either directly or in complicity with other powerful non-State actors. They must take urgent action to recognise their essential role, protect those at risk, and take concrete measures to foster a safe and enabling environment for the defence of human rights without discrimination.
“Governments, companies and other powerful figures are harassing, spying on, jailing, torturing and even killing human rights defenders – just for defending the fundamental rights of their communities. These people must be respected, protected and able to live and work in an environment where it is safe to claim human rights.”
Marking the 20th anniversary of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, more than 150 human rights defenders from around the world gathered in Paris earlier this year to plan for the next 20 years of advancing human rights.
The Summit came at a time when, on an almost daily basis, a human rights defender is reported killed, when criminalization and defamation have become standard risks, when illegitimate and abusive restrictions to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly are routinely introduced into law and when governments are failing their commitments made in 1998 to respect and protect these people.
During the summit, the participants adopted an Action Plan to be urgently implemented by States, businesses, financial institutions, donors and intergovernmental institutions.  
The Action Plan stresses that it is everyone’s responsibility to create an environment in which it is truly possible and safe to claim our human rights. However, it emphasizes that those with power, state and non-state actors, must take the lead in creating a safe and enabling environment for those who defend human rights.
Since the Summit, thousands of people around the world have signed the Summit’s petition urging those in power to Protect Human Rights Defenders Everywhere.
Notes to editors
The Human Rights Defenders World Summit 2018
The Human Rights Defenders World Summit 2018 brought together a diverse group of over 150 human rights defenders from around the world for three days of meetings, panel discussions, networking and workshopping. These activists, who are at the forefront of struggles for social, political and environmental changes in their countries, had the opportunity to connect and engage with regional and international human rights organizations, global government leaders, the United Nations, donors and the private sector. The first Human Rights Defenders World Summit took place 20 years ago in 1998 at the Palais de Chaillot, Paris, the same location where this year’s closing ceremony was held.

Responding to media reports that Google is planning to shut down Project Dragonfly, its controversial censored search app for China, Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said:
“Media reports that Google is shelving Dragonfly follow intense criticism of the project from human rights groups and Google’s own staff. 
“We would welcome a decision by Google to drop Dragonfly and abandon its plans to cooperate in large-scale censorship and surveillance by the Chinese government.
“Going ahead with Project Dragonfly would represent a massive capitulation on human rights by one of the world’s most powerful companies.
“It’s worrying that these reports suggest that Project Dragonfly has been shelved due to discrepancies over internal process, rather than over human rights concerns.
“As Amnesty International and others set out in a letter to Sundar Pichai last week, threats to the rights to freedom of expression and privacy for millions of people in China should have never seen this project come into being.  
“We once again call on Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai to clear up any speculation and publicly state that his company will refrain from developing censored search products and drop Dragonfly with immediate effect.”

The Amnesty International Canada Media Awards honour the efforts of journalists to increase Canadians’ awareness and understanding of human rights issues. In selecting this year’s winners, the four-member jury reviewed more than 50 entries from journalists across the country.
 In her winning piece, The Globe and Mail’s Stephanie Nolen illustrates the lives of Colombians still living in fear and chaos after the country ended its war with the Fighters of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
“What happens when a successful peace process fails to bring a country to peace? Colombia happens,” notes jury member Rick MacInnes-Rae “FARC rebels disarmed, but the failure of the state to extend stability to their territory created a power vacuum seized by a murder of crows from the political left, the right, and the drug-dealing centres.”
Nathan VanderKlippe, also of The Globe and Mail, delves into China’s sprawling, prison-like camps housing Muslim Uyghurs and Kazakhs – one of the most brazen, large-scale human rights abuses of our time – for his winning story.
“To write about it under China’s hostile reporting conditions—where Beijing weighs every word written or broadcast by foreign correspondents—demands courage and commitment. Nathan VanderKlippe coolly demonstrates both,” notes juror Bill Schiller.
“Relying on interviews with former detainees, VanderKlippe reveals a program of forcible indoctrination, mind-numbing recitations and supreme leader worship meant to crush the religious and cultural traditions of Muslim Uyghurs and Kazakhs.”
In “The Cure was Worse,” Holly Moore travels across Canada to interview survivors and their loved ones about a little-known dark chapter in Canadian history.  From the 1940s to the 1960s, thousands of Indigenous people were sent thousands of miles away from family and subjected to medical experiments.  Some never returned home.” 
“Moore brings us a moving investigation into unanswered questions, and the search for healing,” notes juror Lynda Calvert.
Laura Lynch and Sylvène Gilchrist, tell the story of Shakila Zareen, a 17-year-old Afghan refugee who was brutally shot in the face by her much older husband in Afghanistan. She fled to India, underwent multiple surgeries and lived to share her story from her new home in Canada (“Shakila’s story”).
“Shakila Zareen’s case, which has attracted international media attention, illustrates the precarious condition of women’s rights in Afghanistan,” says juror John Tackaberry. “The story also highlights the impact on Shakila Zareen of being accepted in Canada as a refugee after being rejected by the United States and Sweden. Now living in Vancouver, no longer hidden from sight, Shakila Zareen feels free to be seen.” 
CBC’s Ryan Hicks introduces us to an Indigenous Guatemalan woman deported four times from the United States in “Nothing to lose: root causes of migrations from Central America”.  This story shines a light on the poverty and violence that force many Latin Americans to flee Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, a region known as the Northern Triangle.
“In this expertly crafted short audio piece, Hicks says that Canada’s foreign policy for the region should move from economic diplomacy to aid for social development, assist in the effort to combat corruption and help to rebuild institutions in ways that will stem the relentless impetus for migration,” notes John Tackaberry.
For her work “Invisible Disabilities Slip Through the Cracks”, Samantha Fink wins the Youth Media Award.
Juror Rick MacInnes-Rae summarizes the story: “A diabetic student has nowhere to dispose of all her daily needles. A flashing light in the classroom endangers a student with epilepsy.  A deaf student needs her Prof to wear an FM transmitter.The world isn’t always fair to those with invisible disabilities. In a well-written piece rich in research and first-person stories, reporter Samantha Fink illustrates the overlooked and emerging need for new accommodation on campus.”       
As Samantha writes; “For… students living with invisible conditions—limiting a person’s movements, senses or activities—campus accessibility can have social implications beyond physical barriers.”
Amnesty International appreciates the tremendous efforts of the four Media Awards jurors, who have volunteered considerable time to judging this year’s entries John Tackaberry, former media relations officer for Amnesty International Canada and former reporter for Inter Press Service  and Pacifica Radio News; Bill Schiller, former Toronto Star foreign affairs reporter for bureaus in Johannesburg, Berlin, London and Beijing; Rick MacInnes-Rae, associate professor of journalism at Humber College and former CBC host, journalist and correspondent; and Lynda Calvert, member of the journalism faculty at Seneca College and former National Reporter with CBC News responsible for the bureaux in St. John’s, Montreal and Edmonton.
Now in its 24th year, the Amnesty International Canada Media Awards recognize journalists’ efforts to bring awareness to international human rights issues. 
The award ceremony takes place in Toronto on April 4, 2019.

The Nigerian authorities’ failure to investigate communal clashes and bring perpetrators to justice has fuelled a bloody escalation in the conflict between farmers and herders across the country, resulting in at least 3,641 deaths in the past three years and the displacement of thousands more, Amnesty International revealed today.
In a new report, “Harvest of Death: Three Years of Bloody Clashes Between Farmers and Herders”, Amnesty International found that 57 per cent of the 3,641 recorded deaths occurred in 2018. Security forces were often positioned close to the attacks, which lasted hours and sometimes days, yet were slow to act. In some cases, security forces had prior warning of an imminent raid but did nothing to stop or prevent the killings, looting and burning of homes.
“The Nigerian government has displayed what can only be described as gross incompetence and has failed in its duty to protect the lives of its population and end the intensifying conflict between herders and farmers. The authorities’ lethargy has allowed impunity to flourish and the killings to spread to many parts of the country, inflicting greater suffering on communities who already live in constant fear of the next attack,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.
“Our research shows that these attacks were well planned and coordinated, with the use of weapons like machine guns and AK-47 rifles. Yet, little has been done by the authorities in terms of prevention, arrests and prosecutions, even when information about the suspected perpetrators was available.”
Amnesty International started documenting clashes between farmers and herders from January 2016. Between August 2017 and September 2018, researchers conducted 10 field trips to 56 villages in five states.
The report is based on 262 interviews with victims, eyewitnesses, community leaders, medical practitioners, religious leaders and government officials, including members of the security forces. Researchers also analysed 230 documents, including medical records and reports by the security forces.
Villagers in all the areas visited by Amnesty International described losing everything as their homes were burned and their food supplies carted away by attackers. Since 2016, both sides in the conflict have increasingly sought to destroy each other’s livelihood with herders setting fire to farms and farmers engaging in cattle rustling.
“The root cause of this conflict has nothing to do with religion or ethnicity; it is largely about land and access to grazing. But in some places, because of the failures of the security forces, competition over resources is used as a pretext to kill and maim along ethnic or religious lines. The conflict has also been dangerously politicized by some state government officials who have inflamed tensions by embarking on a blame game along political party lines,” said Osai Ojigho.
At least 310 attacks were recorded between 5 January 2016 and 5 October 2018. The attacks were most frequent in Adamawa, Benue, Kaduna, Taraba and Plateau. Other parts of the country including Enugu, Ondo, Oyo, Delta and Edo also recorded attacks.
Bloody testimonies
Amnesty International researchers uncovered a pattern of appalling killings by both farmers and herders across Adamawa, Benue, Taraba, Kaduna and Plateau.
On 17 June 2017 one of the deadliest attacks on Fulani communities in Taraba state began. It lasted four days with dozens of dead bodies found in the bush afterwards.
An eyewitness told Amnesty International: “My wife was slaughtered, they opened her stomach and brought out the baby and slaughtered it. My kids were slaughtered also. I was with their dead bodies for three days in the bush before the soldiers came. My father was burned in front of the mosque where he prayed. They killed him there and burned him.”
In the Guma and Logo local government areas of Benue state, villages began 2018 under attack by armed gangs, who arrived in the early hours of 1 January. The attack, which went on for 11 days, resulted in at least 88 deaths, although the state government was only able to bury 73 bodies.
An eyewitness told Amnesty International: “Up to 120 people (were) dead, some are farmers in the bush but we have not recovered them. It was through the efforts of the Benue State government and security agents that 73 bodies were recovered and buried. More corpses are still out there while some have been buried already in the villages.”
Amnesty International interviewed 21 women in communities affected by the attacks. Many spoke of losing their husbands and having to take care of their children alone. On 20 February 2017, Zilian village in Kaduna state was attacked. One woman described how she ran and hid in an old latrine pit. Her husband was killed in the attack and her 6-year old daughter was severely burnt. She said:
“When they left, I dragged myself out of the pit and went home. My thoughts were that my kids were already burned to death in the house but I needed to confirm. When I got home, everywhere was under fire. They burned the house and everything was on fire and still burning. I saw my husband’s corpse on the floor and fire had caught his leg, so I moved him from the fire.”
In Kaduna and Zamfara states, what started as clashes between herders and farmers has turned into a total collapse of law and order, with armed gangs raiding villages, kidnapping people for ransom and killing hundreds of people in recent years.
Villagers told Amnesty International that they were regularly confronted by attackers wielding machine guns and assault rifles.
Amnesty International took photographs of different ammunition casings from the scenes of attacks in Adamawa, Kaduna and Benue states, and received photographs of other casings from Plateau state. In all cases, weapons analysis showed that the attackers were likely to have been armed with machine guns like the PKM and G3, and AK-47 rifles.
Failure to protect
The Nigerian authorities have an obligation to protect the right to life as enshrined in international and African human rights treaties. Yet, communities told Amnesty International that they alerted the security forces to impending attacks and no action was taken.
On 2 May 2018, 33 villagers were killed and five villages torched in the Numan local government area of Adamawa state, despite security forces being informed 16 hours prior to the attack that gunmen had started gathering nearby. Villagers and a local government official phoned through the warnings from 11pm on 1 May, the night before the attack.
According to research undertaken on the ground by Amnesty International, soldiers were deployed to perform a single patrol in the area on the afternoon of 2 May, and then withdrew shortly before the attackers arrived. Villagers kept calling and complaining about the withdrawal, but the relevant Major’s phone was reported to be switched off.
Villagers in Agwada, Udege, Kokona local government area and Loko development area in Nasarawa state wrote to the Inspector General of Police on 10 March 2017 to protest against “incessant” attacks by herders. The villagers told Amnesty International that the police asked them for N150,000 ($411) for “logistics”, which was paid. Just three police officers were sent but they refused to go to the villages, complaining of bad roads.
Amnesty International shared its findings with government authorities and requested information from the Ministry of Justice, Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police Force and the governments of Adamawa, Benue, Enugu, Kaduna, Plateau and Taraba states. Only Enugu state government responded to our request, saying five people are being prosecuted over the killing of 12 people in Nimbo community in Uzo-Uwani local government area, which was attacked on 25 April 2016.
“Authorities must investigate the slow response time of security forces that has resulted in shockingly high casualties. As part of this process, the security forces’ leadership should scrutinize the role of individual commanders, while governments across the affected states must provide appropriate compensation to the victims of the conflicts,” said Osai Ojigho.
“The Nigerian authorities must immediately initiate independent, effective and impartial investigations into all human rights violations and abuses perpetrated during the farmers-herders conflicts, whether by state or non-state actors. The findings of these investigations must be made public, and where there is sufficient admissible evidence, those responsible must face prosecution in fair trials.”
BACKGROUND
Farmers-herders raids and counter-raids have been going on seasonally across northern Nigeria for decades but started escalating in 1999. Since 2017 the conflicts have become increasingly deadly as deteriorating environmental conditions have compelled herders to move southward for pasture.

“Amnesty International strongly condemns attempts by the Nigerian army to demonize UNICEF’s lifesaving work in the northeast of the country, where the Boko Haram conflict has created one of the deadliest humanitarian disasters in the world. We see the suspension of UNICEF as part of a wider drive to intimidate international humanitarian and human rights organizations who are working to save lives in this devastating conflict.
“The Nigerian army has accused UNICEF of ‘aiding Boko Haram’ – an absurd charge. The suspension of UNICEF will in fact deprive those whose lives have been devastated by the Boko Haram conflict from receiving much-needed humanitarian assistance.
“We call on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the suspension of UNICEF immediately. The Nigerian military should focus on protecting lives rather than smearing NGOs.”

Bill C-47 enacts important changes to Canada’s Export and Import Permits Act consistent with provisions in the Arms Trade Treaty, which prohibit the transfer of arms to another country when they would be used to commit genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. 
Importantly, the reforms to Canada’s arms control system would require the government to refuse to issue export permits in cases where there is a substantial risk that transfer of the arms in question “could be used to commit or facilitate … a serious violation of international humanitarian law, a serious violation of international human rights law … or serious acts of gender-based violence or serious acts of violence against women and children.” Similarly, export permits would be refused if there is a substantial risk the transfer would lead to acts that violate Canada’s obligations under treaties dealing with terrorism and transnational organized crime.
“Enshrining a mandatory provision to refuse export permits in cases of substantial risk that an arms deal will lead to war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and serious instances of gender-based violence is an important step forward in bringing real human rights rules to Canada’s arms trade,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “It is a significant improvement to the current system, which has long left too much uncertainty and discretion to grant permits, even when there are grave human rights concerns.”
Amnesty International joined with Project Ploughshares, Oxfam-Québec, Oxfam Canada, the Rideau Institute and Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East in pressing for Bill C-47 to be strengthened to address other longstanding gaps in Canada’s arms control processes, notably the fact that there are no binding human rights controls related to arms sales from Canada to the United States and that key departments and agencies, notably the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC), are not included. The organizations are disappointed that those crucial amendments were not taken up as the Bill passed through Parliament. 
While detailed information is not available due to a lack of public reporting, more than one-half of Canadian arms sales are to the United States, largely comprised of parts and components. The US government has made it clear that it has no plans to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty, and Amnesty International and other organizations have documented numerous instances of US-made weaponry being sold and transferred to countries which then use the arms to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity, including recent concerns about the use of US weapons by Saudi forces in Yemen.
The role of the CCC has been of serious concern in recent Canadian arms deals including contracts to sell light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia and military helicopters to the Philippines (the latter contract having been abandoned by the Philippine government after serious concerns became public in Canada). It has become clear that the CCC negotiates and concludes contracts without strict consideration of human rights concerns, and does so before proposed deals have been assessed for export permit eligibility.
“While C-47 provides important advances in Canada’s approach to arms control, and joining the Arms Trade Treaty is long overdue and will be a welcome step, major gaps remain,” said Alex Neve.  “It is vital that loopholes with respect to reporting and permitting of Canadian arms sales to the United States be closed, through upcoming regulations and further legislative reform. Similarly, there must be assurances that Bill C-47 will be applied consistently to any and all Canadian departments and agencies, including the Canadian Commercial Corporation.”
Over the coming months, there will be government-led consultations with industry, civil society and the public as more detailed regulations regarding many of the provisions in Bill C-47 are developed.  Once the regulations are adopted, Bill C-47 will enter into force and Canada will be in a position to accede to the Arms Trade Treaty. A total of 99 other countries have already become parties to the Treaty.

When ports of entry are all but closed, forcing asylum seekers to wait for weeks just to seek protection, families will be forced into taking more dangerous routes to reach the United States.
“This was not the first death at the southern border and sadly, it will not be the last. Children seeking protection should never be detained. There must be a thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances around her death.
“If the US builds a wall along the southern border, families seeking protection will face an impossible choice: take any risks necessary to seek safety or return back home to face the stark possibility of death. The solution is simple. The United States must end pushbacks at the border, allow families and individuals to have their asylum claims heard in a timely manner, and abandon plans to build a wall shutting out those seeking safety at our border. The lives of thousands of people, including children, are at stake.”

That was the heartfelt and urgent message shared with me by Honduran Indigenous leader Felipe Benitez Vazquez when we reconnected at a meeting in Peru a few weeks ago.  I first met Felipe when he travelled to Canada last year, to bring firsthand accounts of the impact of cruel repression on his people and on human rights defenders throughout Honduras.  We quickly agreed that his description of the struggle for rights and justice in Honduras powerfully captures the mood globally as well.  Without a doubt, not easy times.  And absolutely, solidarity is so vital. 
For it has been a year in which the world has witnessed far too much conflict, marked by horrific atrocities with devastating impact on civilians in Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, South Sudan, Gaza, Iraq and many other corners of our world.  At a time when that list should grow shorter, it has been heartbreaking to see precisely the opposite. 
And it has been a year during which the politics of hate, fear and division have continued to spread.  Leaders in the United States, the Philippines, Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey, Russia, most-recently Brazil, and a growing number of other countries hold on to or have come to power by demonizing refugees and migrants, LGBTI communities, women, minorities, Indigenous peoples, journalists, political opponents and people living in poverty. 
 
Conflict and hate challenge human rights at their very core. Not easy times. 
That is why documenting the grim truth in conflict zones and pushing for civilian protection, an end to arms sales and accountability for war crimes has been so important in our work this year. 
And that is certainly why we have said no, at every turn, to bans, walls and bigotry that deliberately target marginalized communities and foment heightened levels of violence and discrimination. 
Around the world, determined human rights defenders campaign and mobilize to end conflict and to overcome hate.  And everywhere, it has been women human rights defenders who are at the front-lines and bring unimaginable courage and resilience to so many vital human rights struggles.  They show us the way.  And they face great risk, including of being killed, as the targeted assassination of Brazilian human rights defender, feminist and grassroots politician Marielle Franco cruelly reminded us in March. 
 
Solidarity has never mattered more. 
On December 10th, the world marked the 70th anniversary of the adoption of humanity’s most precious human rights instrument, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is most certainly is an anniversary of equal parts celebration of the many triumphs and progress of the past seven decades; but also sorrowful realization of the many failures and entrenched injustice that still haunts our planet. 
2018 was, in so many ways, precisely such a year: of celebration and sorrow. 
It has been a year in which it is more important than ever to come together as a movement committed to that promise and vision of universal human rights.  At such a time, your support has been so essential. That support is at the very core of solidarity with human rights defenders. It fuels our demands that prisoners of conscience be freed. It provides the essential financial resources to send researchers into war zones and propels our campaigns for real change and meaningful reform. 
Here in Canada your support has been at the heart of our campaign to hold Canadian mining companies accountable for upholding human rights in their operations.  After years of determined advocacy alongside partner organizations and communities who have borne the brunt of mining-related abuses, we welcomed the announcement in at the beginning of the year that the government will establish an Ombudsperson with powers to investigate such cases.  As the year comes to a close, we are keeping up the pressure and anticipate an announcement of who the first Ombudsperson will be at any time. This is long overdue. 
In 2018, we have welcomed the progress of legislation through Parliament that, once adopted, will set a legal framework for implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Canada; a crucial change from Canada’s adamant opposition to the Declaration when it was adopted over a decade ago.  
 
Yet, actions can readily betray words, as is so starkly evident in the willingness of both the federal and BC provincial governments to proceed with construction of the massive Site C dam, despite clear opposition from First Nations who face the devastating loss of the territory that is central to their traditions, livelihoods and well-being.  They do not relent in the struggle for their rights to be respected, nor will we. 
As the year comes to a close, so too does the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Since publishing our Stolen Sisters report in 2004, Amnesty International has stood in solidarity with families of missing and murdered daughters, sisters, mothers and nieces across the country.  And we will be ready to respond to the Inquiry’s final report when it is released in the spring; for what is truly needed is the action that will at long last address and prevent this shameful violence and discrimination.  That includes the building pressure on governments across the country to end the sterilization of Indigenous women without their consent, a disgraceful and unlawful practice that the UN Committee against Torture has now also decried. 
Our concern has mounted over the course of this year about the worrying nature and tone of the debate about refugees and migrants in Canada.  From the national pride that was evident in 2016 as Canadians across the country welcomed Syrian refugees, discourse has deteriorated as politicians and pundits have promoted an untrue, inflamed and breathless narrative about hordes of “illegal” refugees flooding across the US border into Canada.  Numbers have gone up, most certainly, reflective of the punitive assault on the rights of refugees and migrants unleashed in the US by the Trump Administration. But it is far from the crisis suggested by many. 
 
And sadly, the government continues to refuse to take one of the most constructive steps available to improve the situation, by suspending the 2004 Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement, that closes official Canadian border posts to refugees coming from the United States and forces them to cross “irregularly” into Canada in order to claim protection.  We have joined with the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches and several courageous refugee claimants in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the STCA.  Our passionately committed legal team has been hard at work throughout the year readying for the hearings now scheduled for early May. 
Encouragement and disappointment absolutely captures the state of play when it comes to Canadian arms trade this year.  Early in the year, concern about the news of a deal to sell Canadian military helicopters to Rodrigo Duterte’s security forces in the Philippines was swift, leading to the deal being scrapped, ironically by Duterte himself.  But the sale of Canadian-made armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia still goes ahead, despite the grave risk of them being used in Yemen, where Saudi forces continue to be responsible for extensive war crimes.  Even the outrage about the jailing and torture of women’s rights activists and Saudi responsibility for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi did not lead the Canadian government to scrap the arms deal. 
Canada is, at long last and after considerable advocacy by Amnesty International and allies, close to signing on to the UN Arms Trade Treaty, which was adopted back in 2013.  Legislation to pave the way for our accession to this critical treaty was adopted by Parliament earlier this month. Concerns remain, however, most notably that Canada’s arms sales to the United States will be exempt from scrutiny, a very real concern given that the US is not joining the treaty and has a notorious arms-dealing record.  There will clearly be more work ahead. 
We welcomed two Canadians home from nightmares of injustice and imprisonment abroad this year, cases taken up by Amnesty supporters across the country over many years.  Bashir Makhtal was freed and came home after serving 12 years of a life sentence in Ethiopia; and Hassan Diab was freed after three Kafkaesque years of detention without charge in France on wholly discredited terrorism allegations. 
 
We celebrate their freedom by redoubling our efforts to free Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil, imprisoned in China since 2006 as part of China’s unrelenting campaign against the Uyghur people, and Canadian permanent resident Saeed Malekpour, who has recently passed ten years of unjust imprisonment in Iran. 
Final thoughts return to solidarity.  Earlier this year we brought thousands of paper butterflies — with beautiful designs and heartfelt messages of solidarity from across Canada — to families in Mexico campaigning for truth and justice for the 35,000 people who have been disappeared amidst a human rights crisis that has gripped that country for years. It is a campaign led by courageous women who demand the truth about what has happened to their loved ones and measures that will end and prevent further disappearances.  They often feel lonely in that struggle; and certainly face great danger for being outspoken.  
 
Every one of those butterflies bolstered their spirits and strengthened their resolve, because of one simple but powerful message: you are not alone. 
Thank you for the tremendous support you provide to Amnesty International and to shoring up human rights protection across Canada and around the world. It has never been more important. 
Not easy times.  Solidarity matters more than ever.  You are that solidarity.

That was the heartfelt and urgent message shared with me by Honduran Indigenous leader Felipe Benitez Vazquez when we reconnected at a meeting in Peru a few weeks ago.  I first met Felipe when he travelled to Canada last year, to bring firsthand accounts of the impact of cruel repression on his people and on human rights defenders throughout Honduras.  We quickly agreed that his description of the struggle for rights and justice in Honduras powerfully captures the mood globally as well.  Without a doubt, not easy times.  And absolutely, solidarity is so vital. 
For it has been a year in which the world has witnessed far too much conflict, marked by horrific atrocities with devastating impact on civilians in Yemen, Syria, Myanmar, South Sudan, Gaza, Iraq and many other corners of our world.  At a time when that list should grow shorter, it has been heartbreaking to see precisely the opposite. 
And it has been a year during which the politics of hate, fear and division have continued to spread.  Leaders in the United States, the Philippines, Venezuela, Hungary, Turkey, Russia, most-recently Brazil, and a growing number of other countries hold on to or have come to power by demonizing refugees and migrants, LGBTI communities, women, minorities, Indigenous peoples, journalists, political opponents and people living in poverty. 
 
Conflict and hate challenge human rights at their very core. Not easy times. 
That is why documenting the grim truth in conflict zones and pushing for civilian protection, an end to arms sales and accountability for war crimes has been so important in our work this year. 
And that is certainly why we have said no, at every turn, to bans, walls and bigotry that deliberately target marginalized communities and foment heightened levels of violence and discrimination. 
Around the world, determined human rights defenders campaign and mobilize to end conflict and to overcome hate.  And everywhere, it has been women human rights defenders who are at the front-lines and bring unimaginable courage and resilience to so many vital human rights struggles.  They show us the way.  And they face great risk, including of being killed, as the targeted assassination of Brazilian human rights defender, feminist and grassroots politician Marielle Franco cruelly reminded us in March. 
 
Solidarity has never mattered more. 
On December 10th, the world marked the 70th anniversary of the adoption of humanity’s most precious human rights instrument, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is most certainly is an anniversary of equal parts celebration of the many triumphs and progress of the past seven decades; but also sorrowful realization of the many failures and entrenched injustice that still haunts our planet. 
2018 was, in so many ways, precisely such a year: of celebration and sorrow. 
It has been a year in which it is more important than ever to come together as a movement committed to that promise and vision of universal human rights.  At such a time, your support has been so essential. That support is at the very core of solidarity with human rights defenders. It fuels our demands that prisoners of conscience be freed. It provides the essential financial resources to send researchers into war zones and propels our campaigns for real change and meaningful reform. 
Here in Canada your support has been at the heart of our campaign to hold Canadian mining companies accountable for upholding human rights in their operations.  After years of determined advocacy alongside partner organizations and communities who have borne the brunt of mining-related abuses, we welcomed the announcement in at the beginning of the year that the government will establish an Ombudsperson with powers to investigate such cases.  As the year comes to a close, we are keeping up the pressure and anticipate an announcement of who the first Ombudsperson will be at any time. This is long overdue. 
In 2018, we have welcomed the progress of legislation through Parliament that, once adopted, will set a legal framework for implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Canada; a crucial change from Canada’s adamant opposition to the Declaration when it was adopted over a decade ago.  
 
Yet, actions can readily betray words, as is so starkly evident in the willingness of both the federal and BC provincial governments to proceed with construction of the massive Site C dam, despite clear opposition from First Nations who face the devastating loss of the territory that is central to their traditions, livelihoods and well-being.  They do not relent in the struggle for their rights to be respected, nor will we. 
As the year comes to a close, so too does the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Since publishing our Stolen Sisters report in 2004, Amnesty International has stood in solidarity with families of missing and murdered daughters, sisters, mothers and nieces across the country.  And we will be ready to respond to the Inquiry’s final report when it is released in the spring; for what is truly needed is the action that will at long last address and prevent this shameful violence and discrimination.  That includes the building pressure on governments across the country to end the sterilization of Indigenous women without their consent, a disgraceful and unlawful practice that the UN Committee against Torture has now also decried. 
Our concern has mounted over the course of this year about the worrying nature and tone of the debate about refugees and migrants in Canada.  From the national pride that was evident in 2016 as Canadians across the country welcomed Syrian refugees, discourse has deteriorated as politicians and pundits have promoted an untrue, inflamed and breathless narrative about hordes of “illegal” refugees flooding across the US border into Canada.  Numbers have gone up, most certainly, reflective of the punitive assault on the rights of refugees and migrants unleashed in the US by the Trump Administration. But it is far from the crisis suggested by many. 
 
And sadly, the government continues to refuse to take one of the most constructive steps available to improve the situation, by suspending the 2004 Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement, that closes official Canadian border posts to refugees coming from the United States and forces them to cross “irregularly” into Canada in order to claim protection.  We have joined with the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches and several courageous refugee claimants in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the STCA.  Our passionately committed legal team has been hard at work throughout the year readying for the hearings now scheduled for early May.

Maha is a second-year student at McGill University, completing a double-major in International Development Studies and Economics, with a minor in Mathematics. She began working with Amnesty at age 15, volunteering with Amnesty International Toronto’s youth council. Following her recent experience representing AI Canada (ES) at Amnesty’s first International Youth Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, she brought together the new 2018-2020 NYAAC team. Over the years, she has become extremely passionate about meaningful youth engagement and leadership.   
Outside Amnesty, she is interested in journalism, research, and policy surrounding human rights. She has written for the McGill International Review with a broad focus on human rights issues, and is currently a research intern for Women in Cities International, where she is working on the Right to Campus project to improve the adequacy and availability of resources on university campuses in Montréal. Maha is also an executive member of the McGill chapter of Amnesty International, and an editor for The Matchstick, AI Canada’s youth newspaper. 
In the future, she hopes to achieve NYAAC’s goals and further her human rights education, but also eat dessert at every single café in the city of Montréal. 
 
Roshni has completed her Bachelors of Arts in Political Science from York University and is currently a first year student at Osgoode Hall Law School. In addition to being the former President of her Amnesty International campus group and a member of the NYAAC, she is a member of Plan International Canada’s Youth Advisory Council where she was an inaugural participant in the Girls Belong Here initiative having taken over the role of Plan’s CEO on International Day of the Girl 2016, and she had the unique opportunity to be employed by Plan in 2018 as a Summer Associate of Youth Advocacy. In these roles, she enjoys researching and implementing new and creative ways to engage and work with young people in the areas of campaigning, activism and engagement. 
Roshni hopes to channel her passion and experience with youth engagement, human rights, social justice and gender equality to her new chapter in legal advocacy. 
When not engrossed in advocacy and leather-bound law books, Roshni can be found taking long walks in nature, pausing to pick up sticks and flourishing them in the hope of discovering that she is in fact a witch and her Hogwarts letter simply got lost in the mail. 
 
Muriam is in her fourth year at University of Toronto. She is completing her major in Peace, Conflict, and Justice with a double minor in Indigenous studies and Diaspora & Transnational studies. Muriam’s first interaction with Amnesty International was when she was in grade 10 witnessing Amnesty International lawyers working with Indigenous communities to defend their human rights in Canada. Muriam’s work centres around working with minority groups in grassroots environments. 
She currently works with Syrian newcomers in coordinating English-Arabic workshop, as well helps to provide education, housing, and social services. Moreover, she works with a UN organization to promote international SDG education projects.

Fatima is a second-year student at Dalhousie University on the un-ceded, un-surrendered Mi’kmaq territory of Halifax (K’jipuktuk), Nova Scotia, where she also hails from. She is currently pursuing a double major in Environment, Sustainability and Society and International Development Studies with a minor in French. She was first introduced to Amnesty International Canada in Grade 11 when she attended a workshop hosted in Halifax, where it was her first time learning about murdered and missing Indigenous women in Canada by hearing the story of Loretta Saunders from her sibling Delilah. This experience was a tipping point that fully ignited a passion to learn more about the injustices around her and to use her privileges to make a difference where needed in addition to motivating those around her to get involved in doing so as well. Since that moment, she became a youth organizer and is currently the Co-president of the Amnesty Club at Dalhousie, in addition to being the only member from the Maritimes on NYAAC. 
Aside from her involvement with Amnesty, Fatima is active in student politics on her campus, where she currently sits on the student union council as the Arts and Social Sciences Faculty Representative. 
Furthermore, Fatima is involved with environmental and racial activism both on and off campus, where she works towards promoting sustainable practices as a steering committee member in the Sustainability Office, and advocates for more support and resources to students of different intersecting marginalized backgrounds as the Chair of Advocacy for the Black, Indigenous, People of Colour Caucus (BIPOCUS) at Dalhousie. When she is not attending meetings or cramming for last minutes assignments, Fatima enjoys watching international films (where her Cancer shines through in her sobbing moments) and eating as many desserts as she can in one sitting.

0,CAR: Up to 100 civilians shot and burnt alive as UN peacekeepers leave posts in Alindao,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/car-up-to-100-civilians-shot-and-burnt-alive-as-un-peacekeepers-leave-posts-in-alindao/,"The United Nations must carry out a thorough investigation into UN peacekeeping troops’ response to a recent attack that killed as many as 100 civilians in a displaced persons camp in the Central African Republic, Amnesty International said today in a new report. According to multiple...","The United Nations must carry out a thorough investigation into UN peacekeeping troops’ response to a recent attack that killed as many as 100 civilians in a displaced persons camp in the Central African Republic, Amnesty International said today in a new report.
According to multiple eyewitnesses, UN peacekeepers did not engage an attack by an armed group but instead retreated in an armoured vehicle to their central base, leaving thousands of civilians unprotected at the camp in Alindao on 15 November.
An immediate and impartial inquiry must focus, in particular, on whether the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) failed in its duty to protect the lives of more than 18,000 people residing at the site.
“Scores of civilians at the displaced persons camp in Alindao were massacred after the UN peacekeepers charged with protecting them failed to take action to fend off their armed attackers,” said Joanne Mariner, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International.
“While UN troops were badly outnumbered by armed attackers, their actions—both before and during the attack—raise serious questions as to whether they lived up to their mandate to protect civilians.”
MINUSCA told Amnesty International that, given the small number of peacekeepers, it would have been impossible for them to contain the violence. But it is far from clear that, with their armoured vehicles and heavier weapons, the troops could not have taken defensive positions that might have deterred the attack, particularly had they fired warning shots.
Bloody attack
At around 8-8:30am on 15 November, a Seleka off-shoot called the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (Union pour la Paix en Centrafrique, UPC) attacked the displaced persons camp located at Alindao’s Catholic mission. They fired mortars and rocket-propelled grenades at the site, and then looted and burned the majority of the displaced persons’ dwellings.
The UPC fighters were joined by many armed Muslim civilians from Alindao and surrounding villages. They were reportedly angered by previous killings of Muslim civilians in the area, including the murder of a Muslim motorcycle-taxi driver that same morning.
Amnesty International interviewed 20 survivors, many of whom described how Mauritanian MINUSCA peacekeepers stationed at the site failed to respond to the attack. Rather than defend against the attackers, or even fire warning shots, the Mauritanian troops retreated to their main base at the site.
By the time the attackers finished plundering and burning the site toward the end of the day, at least 70 civilians had been killed – with some sources estimating a total of nearly 100 dead – and around 18,000 displaced civilians had been forced to flee again.
Women, children and vulnerable IDPs killed en masse
The dead included many women, children, older people, and people with disabilities.
Georgette, whose family had been forced to flee her home in Alindao’s Bangui-ville neighbourhood in May 2017, lost both her mother and her eight-year-old daughter when attackers broke down the door to their home and shot them. Her mother, Marie, age about 65, died on the spot; her daughter, Natasha, died 10 days later at the hospital in Bambari, where she had been transferred to receive medical care.
Older people and people with disabilities were particularly vulnerable, and were killed in large numbers when they were unable to run away to escape the attack. Many were burned alive in their shelters, which were made of wooden poles and extremely combustible dried vegetation.
The attackers also killed two Catholic priests – Fr. Prospère Blaise Mada and Fr. Célestin Ngoumbango. While Amnesty International was unable to confirm whether they were purposefully targeted as priests, witnesses said they were wearing their priestly cassocks when killed.
UPC fighters and their accomplices massively looted and then burnt down nearly all of the shelters on the site and emptied a storehouse used by the World Food Programme. Amnesty International reviewed satellite imagery clearly indicating the area that had been burnt.
“The United Nations needs to assess whether the massacre at Alindao was preventable, and, most importantly, what it can do to ensure that future violent attacks on civilians are deterred or contained,” said Joanne Mariner.
Given a robust mandate to protect civilians, MINUSCA forces have maintained a long-standing presence at the IDP site in Alindao. Before the current posting of Mauritanian peacekeepers (which, since the 15 November attack, have been joined by a contingent of Rwandan troops), Burundian troops protected the site.
Numerous former residents of the site told Amnesty International that the Mauritanian peacekeepers, based there since about May, failed to properly control the area and prevent the entry of arms and armed fighters. In contrast to MINUSCA contingents previously based at the site, they rarely carried out patrols, and delegated much of their day-to-day duties to a small “security team” of anti-balaka fighters.
“The Mauritanian peacekeepers’ apparent acceptance of anti-balaka control of the site put the civilian population in great danger,” said Joanne Mariner.
MINUSCA denied that its forces allowed the anti-balaka to operate at the camp, pointing out that the camp is huge, making control over it extremely difficult. However, the actions of the Mauritanian troops showed that they not only knew of the anti-balaka fighters’ presence, they authorized it.
Threat of further violence
The threat of further attacks against displaced civilians looms large elsewhere in the country. On 4 December, UPC fighters reportedly attacked another IDP site run by the Catholic church in Ippy, resulting in the deaths of two children. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that Mauritanian MINUSCA peacekeepers were present at the time, but failed to prevent the attack.
UN vote to renew peacekeeping mandate
The UN Security Council is holding a vote on 14 December to renew MINUSCA’s mandate for another year. Amnesty International supports MINUSCA’s presence in the Central African Republic, and recognizes that, despite the many challenges, the peacekeeping force has saved countless lives. It calls on the international community to ensure, however, that the force is adequately trained, structured, and equipped to deliver on its ambitious mandate.
“United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres should set up a thorough and timely independent investigation into what led to the killings in Alindao. This will help the UN better fulfill its mandate of protecting the Central African Republic’s civilians,” said Joanne Mariner.
“The report of the investigation should be made public, and its recommendations should lead to concrete action.”
In addition, MINUSCA should ensure that adequate military forces with appropriate equipment carry out robust patrols in high-risk areas of the country, including Bambari, Batangafo, Alindao, Ippy, and Bangassou.

“Attacking the Nicaraguan Center for Human Rights (CENIDH) and cancelling its legal registration, is another repressive maneuver by President Daniel Ortega to try to cover up the serious human rights violations that his government has committed. Those who denounce the atrocities committed by his government are being punished in Nicaragua. President Ortega is wrong if he believes he will be able to evade justice by trying to silence CENIDH.”
“It’s extremely alarming that organizations with the trajectory and legitimacy of CENIDH are being persecuted. By cancelling their registration, the government leaves the people of Nicaragua defenseless, preventing organizations from representing victims or fighting for their demands for justice and accountability. Today is a very sad day for the defence of human rights in the region.”

Deadly protests violence in Togo hit the country ahead of contested parliamentary elections on 20 December, Amnesty International said today, as it urged the authorities to properly investigate and sanction all those responsible of a series of deaths which occurred during protests over the past week. 
At least four people have been killed in protest-related violence since 8 December, including a 12-year-old boy who was shot in the head. Clashes between protesters and security forces have been reported around the country. Many protesters were injured by gunshot wounds in the capital Lomé and the northern city of Sokodé. Protesters also burned tyres and erected barricades in the street. Four members of the security forces were injured. 
 “Even after a child was killed, Togo’s authorities continue to fuel the violence by deploying military officers carrying firearms to protest sites, which risks exacerbating an already tense situation,” said Evelyne Petrus Barry, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa Regional Director.
“As pressure mounts ahead of the elections, we are urging the authorities to respect the right to peaceful assembly and take all necessary measures to ensure no more lives are lost in these clashes. They must also carry out thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the deaths of protesters and ensure all those found responsible are brought to justice.”
Amnesty International’s digital verification experts were able to authenticate a series of videos of demonstration sites which appear to have been filmed on 8 December.
One video confirmed that the 12-year-old boy was shot in the neighborhood of Togblékopé around 5 km north of the capital Lomé. Another video shows a member of the security forces in a black pick-up car aiming at a group of protestors with a scoped rifle.
The Ministry of Security and Civilian Protection later acknowledged the vehicle was boarded by members of the armed forces, including the military chief of staff. Two other persons were killed in Sokodé on 10 December and dozens more resulted injured.
Amnesty International spoke to a 19-year-old man in Sokodé who received a gunshot to his foot. He told Amnesty International:
“On 10 December, I was sitting at the public square when I saw people running. When I got up I felt a burn and realized that blood was coming out of my left foot. (…) When I was brought to the hospital, they removed things [pellets] from my wounds…”
Earlier this month, a group of 14 opposition parties rejected the date of 20 December for the parliamentary elections and called for reforms for fair and transparent elections.
The protests were scheduled between 8 and 18 December. On 6 December, the Minister of Territorial Administration issued a statement banning the protests citing a “very high risk of serious breaches to public order”.
Amnesty International considers the demonstrations in the country were banned on vague and arbitrary grounds and contravene Togo’s international obligations to respect the right to peaceful assembly. Despite the ban, the opposition decided to go ahead with the protests, which were then dispersed by security forces.
The violence comes in the context of an intensifying crackdown on the right to freedom of expression in Togo.
 On 7 December, the National Assembly of Togo adopted a law on cybersecurity which significantly restricts freedom of expression. Among other things, it criminalizes the publication of false information with up to three years in prison; breaches of public morality with up to two years in prison; and the production, diffusion or sharing of data which undermine “order, public security or breach human dignity”.
The law also contains vague terrorism and treason related provisions which carry hefty sentences of up to 20 years in prison, and could easily be misused against whistle-blowers and others reporting on human rights abuses. The law also grants additional powers to police, particularly in terms of surveillance of communication or IT equipment, without adequate judicial control.
 “Authorities should repeal or substantially amend this law to ensure it is brought in line with international human rights law and standards,” said Evelyne Petrus Barry.

“The conflict has had a devastating impact in terms of interrupting vital supplies in and around Hodeidah. Both parties to the conflict have deliberately impeded humanitarian assistance in violation of international humanitarian law. They must now provide prompt and unhindered access to UN agencies and humanitarian organizations to deliver food, fuel, medicines and medical supplies to civilians in desperate need across Yemen.
“We call on the international community to strengthen the UN’s efforts to end gross violations of international law committed by all parties to the conflict and ensure justice and reparation for victims.”
Background
On 12 June, the Yemeni government – backed by the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition announced the launch of the offensive on the city of Hodeidah, a strategic port city that has been under Huthi control since October 2014.

On 14 and 15 December, after four and a half years, the IVD – which has investigated more than 62,000 cases of human rights violations dating back six decades – is due to deliver its main findings and recommendations at a conference with key stakeholders from government and civil society. Its final report will be delivered by the end of the year. A final IVD public hearing about propaganda and media manipulation before Tunisia’s 2011 uprising is also scheduled for 14 December. 
“The conclusion of years of IVD investigations is a crucial turning point that will determine the fate of tens of thousands of victims of human rights violations. Tunisia’s authorities must now show they are serious about breaking the pattern of impunity that has perpetually haunted the country by committing to fully implement the IVD’s recommendations, in particular those addressing reform of the security and justice sectors,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“It is essential that the progress towards justice does not stall with the end of the IVD’s mandate. Tunisia’s authorities must follow through with the prosecution of perpetrators of crimes that have remained unpunished for decades.”
Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to provide guarantees that the trials of suspected perpetrators will continue and be conducted in an impartial and transparent manner, that witnesses and victims are protected from reprisals and intimidation and that security sector reforms are taken particularly seriously.
The IVD was set up in May 2014 to ensure justice for past violations as part of the transitional process following the end of President Zine El Abidine’ Ben Ali’s repressive rule. Its mandate includes ensuring accountability and revealing the truth about decades of systematic human rights violations committed between 1955 and 2013.
It is the first truth commission in the Middle East and North Africa that has had the power to refer cases relating to gross violations of human rights directly to court. Since March 2018 the commission has referred 30 cases to trial, a historic move in Tunisia where courts hardly ever hold security officers to account.
These include cases of enforced disappearance, extrajudicial execution, death under torture, excessive use of force against peaceful protestors and killings of peaceful protestors during the 2010-2011 uprising.
So far at least 20 trials have begun. One of them relates to the death under torture of Faysal Baraket in 1991, which has become an emblematic case of the widespread, systematic use of torture in Tunisia’s past. Amnesty International is observing the trial.
However, very few alleged perpetrators have appeared in court and judges have thus far failed to issue travel bans in all cases to insist on them attending.
“The fact that we are finally starting to see trials holding suspected perpetrators of human rights violations to account is historic given that seven years after the Tunisian revolution, the judiciary hardly ever successfully prosecutes security officials,” said Fida Hammami, Tunisia Researcher at Amnesty International. 
The IVD’s recommendations are expected to include institutional and legislative reforms and measures such as vetting state institutions to ensure individuals suspected of corruption and human rights violations are suspended and no longer in a position to repeat their crimes.
The IVD has also initiated a national reparation plan to financially compensate victims of violations that submitted their cases.
The Tunisian authorities’ failure to demonstrate true political will to achieve accountability has seen almost absolute impunity for violations such as torture that continue to be committed in Tunisia today. 
Since it was established the IVD has faced numerous obstacles to its work from the authorities. IVD investigations have been hampered by the refusal of the Ministries of
Interior and Defence to cooperate with demands for information, including access to state archives, and to respond to summons for questioning.
The Ministry of Interior repeatedly failed to comply with the IVD’s requests to access secret police records. The military court system also refused to transfer to the IVD records of military trials related to human rights violations. 
In addition, in March 2018 parliament voted against an extension of IVD’s mandate even though it had not completed its work and its founding law granted it the right to extend its mandate by one year.
“Tunisia’s authorities must not shirk their responsibility to implement the institutional and legislative reforms needed to ensure these crimes are not repeated and that victims, who have waited decades for truth and justice, receive full reparation,” said Heba Morayef.
The IVD will submit its final report to the President, President of the parliament and Prime Minister by 31 December. The report will include the commission’s full findings and is expected to identify suspected perpetrators, give an analysis of the reasons underlying grave human rights violations and offer recommendations on how to ensure these crimes are not repeated.

Between 7 and 10 December 2018 in various media articles, South Sudan’s government denied Amnesty International’s findings about the use of the death penalty. In one article, government spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny said that no one had been executed in South Sudan since 2011 and that the government had put a moratorium on the death penalty since 2013. In the same article, he however said “If you kill a person, you will be executed.” In another article, Ateny said “the South Sudan government cannot carry out executions because it has signed the international charter.” In response to Amnesty’s finding that a person who had been a child at the time of the crime was amongst the seven people executed in 2018, Ateny said that “the culture of South Sudan cannot accept it.”
Amnesty International received credible information from multiple independent sources that these executions took place. Our findings are based on interviews with legal professionals and government officials working in the justice sector in South Sudan as well as desk-based research. Our research also uncovered violations of national and international law by the South Sudanese government.
Amnesty now urges the South Sudanese authorities to use these findings as a prompt to investigate the use of the death penalty more closely instead of resorting to denying the truth. We urge the government to use the findings as an opportunity to take positive steps to abolish the death penalty and establish an actual official moratorium on executions. The government must also immediately put in place measures that will ensure the death penalty is not used against persons below 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the crime.
Original text
South Sudan has carried out more executions this year than it has done since gaining independence in 2011, with a child among seven people known to have been executed so far in 2018, Amnesty International revealed today.
Amnesty International fears for the lives of another 135 people on death row, who have this year been rounded up from other prisons across the country to two prisons notorious for executions.
“It is extremely disturbing that the world’s youngest nation has embraced this outdated, inhuman practice and is executing people, even children, at a time when the rest of the world is abandoning this abhorrent punishment,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The President of South Sudan must stop signing execution orders and end this obvious violation of the right to life.”
Amnesty International has established that at least 342 people are currently under the sentence of death in South Sudan, more than double the number recorded in 2011.
Last year, South Sudanese authorities executed four people, two of whom were children at the time of the crimes for which they were convicted. The executions were a blatant violation of national and international laws, which strictly forbid the execution of anyone who was below the age of 18 at the time of their alleged crime.
This year Amnesty International interviewed a 16-year-old boy, who is languishing on death row at Juba Central Prison, after being convicted of murder. Waiting for his appeal to be considered by the court, he described the crime as an accident.
“Before the accident, I was in secondary school. I was a runner, a very good one and I was also a singer of gospel and earthly songs. […] My own aim was to study and do things that can help others. My hope is to be out and to continue with my school,” he said.
He said he had told the judge that he was 15 during his trial.
The use of the death penalty against people who were children at the time of the crime is strictly prohibited under international human rights law and South Sudan’s 2011 Transitional Constitution. Article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of a Child, to which South Sudan is a party, stipulates that ‘neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below 18 years of age’.
State-sanctioned killings
Since independence in 2011, South Sudanese courts have sentenced at least 140 people to death, and the authorities have executed at least 32 people.
This year’s spate of state-sanctioned killings seems to have been sparked by a directive by the Director-General of the National Prison Service of South Sudan on 26 April 2018. In it, he ordered all death row prisoners held at county and state prisons to be moved to two of the country’s most notorious death chambers – Wau Central Prison and Juba Central Prison.
In May, 98 death row prisoners were transferred from Kuajok, Tonj, Rumbek and Aweil state prisons in Bahr el Ghazal region, in the north-western part of the country, to Wau Central Prison.
Another 37 death row prisoners, including at least one child and a breastfeeding mother, were also transferred from prisons in the Equatoria region in the south of the country to Juba Central Prison. Thirty-four people were moved from Torit State Prison in September 2018 and three from Kapoeta State Prison in November 2018 to Juba.
“The transfer of 135 death row prisoners to prisons in Juba and Wau where all executions have taken place so far is deeply alarming. The South Sudanese government must immediately establish an official moratorium on executions, commute all death sentences to prison terms and abolish the death penalty altogether,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
Any attempt to execute a breastfeeding woman would also contravene South Sudanese law and international human rights law and standards.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to execute the prisoner.
The death penalty – the premeditated and cold-blooded killing of a human being by the state in the name of justice – is the most fundamental denial of human rights. It violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.
Background
In South Sudan, the Penal Code provides for the use of the death penalty for murder; bearing false witness resulting in an innocent person’s execution or for fabricating such evidence or using as true evidence known to be false; terrorism (or banditry, insurgency or sabotage) resulting in death; aggravated drug trafficking; and treason.
Hanging is the method of execution provided for in the Code of Criminal Procedure. Before a person sentenced to death can be executed, the Supreme Court and the President must confirm the death sentence.

Sabotage of irrigation wells and other destruction amounts to war crimes
Across Iraq, vast destruction deters hundreds of thousands from returning to rural areas  
As part of its brutal campaign against northern Iraq’s Yezidi minority, the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS) committed war crimes and crimes against humanity when it sabotaged irrigation wells and destroyed other farming infrastructure, Amnesty International said in a new report today.
A year after Iraq’s government declared military victory over IS, Dead Land: Islamic State’s Deliberate Destruction of Iraq’s Farmland details how the armed group also burnt orchards, looted livestock and machinery and laid landmines in farming areas.
“The damage to Iraq’s countryside is as far-reaching as the urban destruction, but the consequences of the conflict on Iraq’s rural residents are being largely forgotten,” said Richard Pearshouse, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International.
“Our investigation reveals how IS carried out deliberate, wanton destruction of Iraq’s rural environment around Sinjar Mountain, wreaking havoc on the long-term livelihoods of Yezidis and other agrarian communities. Today, hundreds of thousands of displaced farmers and their families can’t return home because IS went out of its way to render farming impossible.”
Amnesty International visited rural areas in northern Iraq, including Sinjar district where much of the Yezidi community lived before 2014 and the scene of some of the most extensive rural damage. The organization interviewed 69 people for this report, including 44 current or former farmers from rural areas.
Destruction of vital water sources in a harsh, dry land
In addition to its campaign of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, persecution, rape and enslavement, IS sabotaged the irrigation wells of many subsistence and smallholder farmers. 
IS fighters often tossed rubble, oil, or other foreign objects into the wells and stole or destroyed pumps, cables, generators and transformers. The armed group also burnt or chopped down orchards and pulled down and stole vital electricity lines.
Hadi, a former farmer in his mid-40s from a small village south of Sinjar Mountain, told Amnesty International what he saw when he returned to his farm after fleeing IS in 2014:
“[It was] pure destruction. I had a well – 220 metres deep – as well as a generator and an irrigation pipe system. [IS] threw rubble in my well and filled it to the top. My trees were chopped down – I could see the [chainsaw] marks. The irrigation system – from the pump to the pipes – was stolen. They did this to send a message: that you have nothing to return to, so if you survive, don’t even think of coming back.”
Majdal, a farmer in his mid-50s from another village south of Sinjar Mountain, said:
“There is nothing left. Now the house is destroyed, and all the trees burnt down. We had 100 olive trees, but when I went I didn’t see a single tree in any direction. They were chopped down and burnt… They wanted us to lose everything. They didn’t want us to be able to come back to our land.”
Amnesty International visited an abandoned farm in a small village near Sinune town, north of Sinjar Mountain. IS fighters had poured oil down one irrigation well and dumped debris in another. A large water tank was empty and plastic irrigation pipes lay broken and scattered nearby.  Adjacent fields lay barren.
Water engineers told Amnesty International they had no doubt the destruction was deliberate. This happened on a broad scale – no comprehensive assessment has been undertaken, but local officials estimate that in the area near Sinune alone, IS put 400 out of 450 irrigation wells out of use.
Wider agricultural destruction
The conflict against IS eviscerated Iraq’s agricultural production, now an estimated 40% lower than 2014 levels. Before IS, around two-thirds of Iraq’s farmers had access to irrigation – only three years later, this had fallen to 20%. Around 75% of livestock was lost, spiking to 95% in some areas.
Only about half the people displaced after IS took control of the Sinjar area in 2014 have returned. Numerous IDPs from the area told Amnesty International they felt they now had nothing to go home to, with their farms and livelihoods decimated. This pattern appears to be reflected in rural areas elsewhere in Iraq.
“Unless there is urgent government assistance, the long-term damage inflicted on Iraq’s rural environment will reverberate for years to come. When IS tore through Iraq in 2014, it thrived off rural poverty and resentments, so Iraq’s government should be concerned that something similar could happen again,” said Richard Pearshouse.
Urgent need to prioritize rural reconstruction
Iraq adopted an official reconstruction plan in 2018. It assesses the damage to the agricultural sector and outlines the costs of recovery over the next five years. 
“The Iraqi government urgently needs to fund and implement its reconstruction plan. Repairing critical irrigation and other rural infrastructure is vital to allow displaced people to be able to return to their homes and farms,” said Richard Pearshouse.
“Those displaced by IS war crimes have a right to full reparation and to justice. The government must ensure that survivors receive restitution or, if this is not possible, compensation.”
Amnesty International is also calling for the UN-mandated team established in September 2017 to include IS crimes related to the environment within the scope of its investigation. 
Background
From August 2014 onwards, Yezidis and their overwhelmingly agrarian communities bore the brunt of the IS crimes in northern Iraq.
First, IS fighters rounded up and killed any men and boys who hadn’t been able to seek sanctuary on the defensible heights of Sinjar Mountain. Soon after, they abducted and sold an estimated 6,000 young women and children into slavery elsewhere in Iraq and in Syria. Yezidis sought refuge in Europe and other parts of the Middle East.
By the time the north side of Sinjar Mountain was retaken from IS in December 2014, and the south side in November 2015, thousands of years of Yezidi life had been all but obliterated. The Kurdistan Regional Government took control of the area before handing it over to Iraqi central government control in October 2017.

On 13 December Mali’s National Assembly will examine the ”National Understanding Act” (Loi d’entente nationale) which has vaguely worded provisions.
The law could lead to “abandoning the prosecution of those involved in an armed rebellion if they have no blood on their hands,” according to the statement to the Nation made by Mali President on 31 December 2017.
“Members of the security forces responsible for human rights violations and members of the armed groups who perpetrated horrendous human rights abuses may never be brought to justice if the draft passes into law,” said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa Deputy Director.
“This law would be an insult to thousands of victims of the ongoing conflict in Mali. It would also be a serious threat to Mali’s obligation to investigate and prosecute crimes under international law, including extrajudicial killings, torture and enforced disappearances. The fight against impunity must be the priority for Malian authorities.”
Amnesty International’s analysis of the draft law found that it does not comply with Mali’s obligations under international law, including the Rome Statute, the UN Convention against Torture and the UN Convention for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance.
Article 4 of the draft law indeed specifies that amnesties shall not be provided to authors of “war crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and other imprescriptible crime.” However, this provision does not prevent amnesties for other crimes under international law such as torture and enforced disappearances. It may also allow amnesties for perpetrators of other serious crimes under Malian law including murder, torture, violence against persons, abductions, among others.
The United Nations Declaration on the Protection of all Persons from Enforced Disappearance also states: “Persons who have, or are alleged to have committed offences-acts of enforced disappearance- shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures that might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction.”
Confirming fears expressed by civil society organizations in a joint letter in March this year, the draft law, if passed, could result in a denial of truth and justice to the victims of crimes under international law and human rights abuses and their families.
Mali is facing more than six years of armed conflict in which hundreds of people were killed, and there were dozens of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and cases of torture. Malian authorities have largely failed to investigate the human rights abuses committed both by armed groups and state security forces since the conflict began in 2012.
In 2017, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) documented 252 cases of human rights violations by security forces and armed groups involving more than 650 victims. The cases included 21 instances of extrajudicial executions and deliberate and arbitrary killings, 12 cases of enforced disappearances and 31 cases of torture and other ill-treatment.
Rather than preventing future abuses by bringing to court the alleged perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, this draft law, if passed, will reinforce the culture of impunity.
Amnesty International is calling on the Malian authorities to amend the draft law, and in particular its Article 4, so that full investigations into crimes under international law and human rights violations by both armed groups and Malian security forces can be carried out. The draft law must be rewritten to be in accordance with Mali’s obligations under international law.

Background
In December 2017 Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita announced the ”National Understanding Act”. Several international human rights organizations including Amnesty International wrote to the President requesting a meeting with him and sharing their concerns about the announcement. So far there has been no response from the authorities. On 31 May 2018, the bill was adopted by the Council of Ministers.
In March this year, Amnesty International uncovered a mass grave in central Mali.  Local witnesses in the village of Dogo identified six bodies as people who had been arrested by the military three days earlier.
Amnesty International has also documented an increase in attacks on civilians by armed groups including Ansar Dine and GSIM, and confirmed that 65 people, including children, have been killed by improvised explosives since the beginning of the year.  Insecurity and intimidation of teachers by armed groups have forced 715 schools to close across the central and northern regions of the country, affecting more than 214,000 students.

Edward Snowden signs civil society open letter to Google
New video available here 
US lawmakers must press Google CEO Sundar Pichai on the company’s disturbing plans for a censored search app in China, Amnesty International said ahead of Pichai’s appearance before Congress.
Pichai is due to testify in Congress over allegations of political bias in Google’s search algorithm. The tech giant also faces questions over its prototype search engine for the Chinese market codenamed Project Dragonfly which would blacklist search terms like “human rights” and facilitate Chinese authorities in targeting dissidents online.  
“Sundar Pichai has some serious questions to answer tomorrow. How can Google square Project Dragonfly with its own human rights commitments? Does Google care more about profits than people? Will Google listen to the outcry of protest from its own workforce over its China plans?” said Joe Westby, Technology and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International.
“This is a crucial moment for internet freedom. We call on Congress to demand clarity from Sundar Pichai and urge him to drop Project Dragonfly.”
On 26 November Amnesty International organized a day of worldwide protests against the plans, and hundreds of Google staff signed an open letter joining Amnesty’s call to drop Dragonfly.
Amnesty also released a new satirical video today showing a fake Google employee objecting to criticism from “Google staff, Amnesty International and a whole bunch of other human rights organizations”. It is the sequel to Amnesty’s fake job ad for Project Dragonfly which was used to alert Google staff to the #DropDragonfly campaign through LinkedIn advertising.
Amnesty International also published an open letter signed by 61 NGOs and 11 individuals, including Edward Snowden.
Part of the letter reads:
“Facilitating Chinese authorities’ access to personal data, as described in media reports, would be particularly reckless. If such features were launched, there is a real risk that Google would directly assist the Chinese government in arresting or imprisoning people simply for expressing their views online, making the company complicit in human rights violations.”
Francisco Bencosme, Asia Pacific Advocacy Manager for Amnesty International USA, will be in attendance at the hearing and available for interviews.
Joe Westby is available for interviews in London.

People move — for work, for love, for safety. Human migration is a natural phenomenon, whether from the U.K. to Switzerland, the Philippines to Canada, or Flin Flon to Winnipeg. Today, in an increasingly interconnected world, there are more people on the move than ever. According to the United Nations, some 258 million people live outside the country of their birth. This accounts for just over three per cent of the world’s population, a number larger than ever and certain to rise. 
Migration is not only driven by the needs of individuals; it’s very often in the interests of states. Countries like Canada need more people for economic growth. 
But in a world where thousands of migrants die trying to cross the Mediterranean, and thousands more, including children, are threatened with military action by the U.S. president, clearly, we need to do much better, both at managing migration and protecting the rights of those who migrate. 
Today (the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), after three years of negotiations, representatives of over 100 governments endorsed the UN Global Compact for Migration, and adopted guiding principles to inform the way in which the world deals with migration. 
Here’s the thing: The Global Compact is not legally binding. It is not a treaty. 
It is a declaration of principles to guide how nation states tackle challenges arising from human migration. It touches on all aspects of migration, such as remittances, human trafficking, and preparing for displacement caused by climate change. Its aim is to safeguard human rights and help states manage borders effectively through international co-operation while respecting sovereignty. States remain free to manage their own immigration policies. 
Unfortunately, political leaders are calling on Canada to back out, and misinformed pundits are dogwhistling to xenophobes, declaring this the possible end of the Canadian identity. This past weekend, emboldened by these messages, far-right protestors, many from known hate groups, convened on Parliament Hill with anti-migrant messages. There was similar backlash in other countries. In the Canadian context, these reactions come at a time when more people are crossing into Canada from the United States seeking safety, the result of heightened bigotry fomented by the U.S. president’s assault on the rights of refugees and migrants. 
Many of those turning to Canada are people who may otherwise qualify for refugee protection, but, because of restrictive U.S. asylum laws, can’t successfully receive it there. They can’t cross at official border crossings because of the Safe Third Country Agreement, which requires them to seek protection in the U.S. So they traverse the border at irregular points to seek protection in Canada. This is dangerous for the migrants seeking safety, and makes it difficult for Canada to manage the border. 
Endorsing the compact will push Canada, even if it won’t require it, to reconsider border policies that force refugee claimants to take irregular and dangerous routes into the country. 
So why are the voices that decry what they see as “chaos” and “mismanagement” at the border also the ones opposing Canada’s endorsement of a non-binding set of principles for safe and orderly migration? 
We live in challenging times for human rights, with rising xenophobia and racism across the globe. Some countries under pressure from anti-immigrant and anti-refugee groups are choosing not to endorse the agreement. How disheartening to hear similar sentiments in Canada. 
This is an opportunity for Canada to show leadership in the vital global effort to protect the rights and dignity of those on the move, seeking to lead better lives. International guidelines on how to manage human mobility are precisely what we need as a first step in acknowledging that migration is a global challenge too big for any one nation to tackle on its own. 
Instead, let us heed the words of Louise Arbour, the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, and current UN Special Representative for International Migration: “Chaotic migration is bad for everybody. It’s bad for migrants, who often die, and it’s bad for governments. But safe, well-managed migration is good for everyone.”

Protests against the government of Saudi Arabia at the Human Rights Monument in Ottawa in 2017. Ashley Fraser / Postmedia 
Seventy years ago, world leaders committed to what was at once both an urgent set of promises and a compelling dream when the newly formed United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Today, International Human Rights Day, as we mark that platinum anniversary, in many ways the Universal Declaration has never had more meaning. 
In a world that reels with horrific atrocities in so many countries and in which the ugly politics of hate and demonization have swept far too many leaders into office, the drive and passion to secure truly global human rights protection grows more vital and dynamic. 
That is not just wishful thinking. 
Of course, there is no denying that those universal promises and dreams are still cruelly beyond reach. Ask the people of Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Gaza or Venezuela about rights protection when faced with the daily fear of just staying alive. Ask refugees and migrants about journeys to safety at the U.S. border or across the Mediterranean, that are increasingly more dangerous and inhospitable than the perils they fled in the first place. Ask Indigenous Peoples, across Canada and around the world, about entrenched racism that consistently sells their rights out to economic interests.

Nariman El-Mofty / AP 
Equally worrying, the importance of those universal promises and dreams has likely never been more urgent. At the top of that list is the International Panel on Climate Change’s sobering 12-year deadline to get carbon emissions under control, perhaps the most fundamental human rights challenge of our time. Think also of the disgraceful wealth gaps that continue to widen in so many countries, and the punishing toll for the rights of one billion people who live in extreme poverty. 
The importance of those universal promises and dreams has likely never been more urgent. 
But for each of those injustices, threats and tragedies there is resistance. There are resilient and imaginative solutions. And everywhere, in numbers vast and small, people mobilize and take action to uphold human rights – their own and the rights of strangers they will never know – with certainty and courage unimaginable back in 1948. 
We need look no further than the tenacity of women human rights defenders, everywhere. Women who have paid with their lives in Brazil and Honduras, who are behind bars in Saudi Arabia and Iran, and who are harassed and attacked in South Africa, India and Ukraine, but who do not relent or remain silent. And who never give up on the universal dream. Their cases are at the heart of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign this year. 
Dec. 10, 1948. The world was emerging from the blood-soaked Second World War and staggering to grasp the scale and depravity of the Holocaust. 
Leaders knew that the way forward did not lie in more warfare and divisiveness, nor in resignation and complacency. Instead, in the Universal Declaration’s opening lines they forged agreement that “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” 
Over the seven decades since, governments have tripped over themselves putting ever more eloquent human rights words to paper. They have drafted international treaties and declarations too numerous to count. They have enshrined stirring human rights pledges in national constitutions and laws in countries that span the globe. They have established courts, commissions, committees and councils to be the guardians of those promises. 
All of that matters. 
But what matters most is that we join together in a global chorus that grows only stronger and more determined, insisting that human rights come first. Come first in upholding gender equality, respecting our environment, doing business, and ensuring security. Come first in what we expect of our governments. And in how we view and treat each other. 
Years ago, a remarkable woman, a trade unionist whose life was at risk and who was often in hiding in Zimbabwe, shared words with me that capture the essence of this day. Even while she was in such danger, she was determined to take action for other activists. As she noted, “if I do not show that I care about their rights, why would I expect them to care about mine?” 
“Universal” does not only mean that we all share in enjoyment of those rights. It means we all share the responsibility to defend them.

Following guilty verdicts today in the case of 15 people tried in relation to their attempt to prevent what they believed was the unlawful deportation of a group of people at Stansted Airport last year, Amnesty International has reiterated its strong concern over the decision to charge the human rights defenders with a terrorism-related offence.
The 15 people – known as the “Stansted 15” – took non-violent direct action at Stansted in March 2017 to prevent the deportation of 60 people on a charter flight bound for Ghana and Nigeria.
The Stansted 15’s actions prevented the flight from leaving. Of the 60 individuals due to have been deported, ten are currently pursuing asylum claims in the UK, and at least one has since been granted permission to remain in the UK.
Initially the Stansted 15 were charged with aggravated trespass, but four months later this was changed to “endangering safety at aerodromes” – a serious terrorism-related charge which can lead to a life sentence.
Ahead of the trial, which began at Chelmsford Crown Court on 1 October, Amnesty wrote to the Director of the Crown Prosecution Service and the Attorney General calling for the “endangering safety at aerodromes” charge to be dropped, expressing concern that it may have been brought to discourage other activists from taking non-violent direct action in defence of human rights. Amnesty attended the trial proceedings daily.
Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said:
“This is a crushing blow for human rights in the UK. The terrorism-related charge against these individuals was always a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
“It’s deeply disturbing that peaceful protesters who caused disruption but at no time caused harm to anyone, should now be facing a possible lengthy prison sentence.
“This whole case will send a shiver down the spine of anyone who cares about the right to protest in our country.
“Around the world, human rights defenders are coming under increasing attack. The UK should not be bringing such severe charges against those who seek to peacefully stand up for human rights.”
Sentencing will take place in February.

Sign our online petition to #DefendConsent
(December 10, 2018) Across Canada and as recently as 2017, Indigenous women report being forcibly or coercively sterilized. Some women were incorrectly told the procedure is reversible. Others were separated from their babies until they consented to a tubal ligation.
Forced and coerced sterilizations of Indigenous women are a result of systemic violence and discrimination against Indigenous peoples in the provision of public services in Canada, a pattern well known and acknowledged by government. They are an assault on Indigenous women, their families, their communities, and their Nations that have already been subjected to forced assimilation through colonialism, including eugenic practices.
Sterilizing women without their free, full, and informed consent is a form of violence and torture. Measures to prevent births within ethnic or racial groups is explicitly prohibited by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
All women have the human right to make decisions around if, when, and how to create a family. All women have a right to live free from violence and discrimination. All women have a right to health.
We, the undersigned organizations call on the Government of Canada to take immediate action to address the issue of coerced and forced sterilizations of Indigenous women in Canada and: 
Investigate allegations of forced or coerced sterilizations in Canada, with particular attention to cases involving Indigenous women and girls, ensuring justice and reparations to survivors and their families.
Appoint a special representative to meet with survivors and their families to hear their requests for justice and reparations.
Apply existing criminal legislation on aggravated assault and disciplinary measures for breach of professional standards for cases of forced or coerced sterilization.
Change government policies and practices to explicitly prohibit sterilization without free, full, and informed consent.
Implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action 23 and 24 on increasing the number of Indigenous healthcare professionals and providing cultural competency training to all healthcare professionals.
Develop a comprehensive National Action Plan to prevent and address gender-based violence involving the federal government, provinces, territories, municipalities, and First Nations.

Women activists around the world have been at the forefront of the battle for human rights in 2018, Amnesty International said today as it launched its review on the state of human rights over the past year.
The human rights group also warns that the actions of “tough guy” world leaders pushing misogynistic, xenophobic and homophobic policies has placed freedoms and rights that were won long ago in fresh jeopardy.
“In 2018, we witnessed many of these self-proclaimed ‘tough guy’ leaders trying to undermine the very principle of equality – the bedrock of human rights law. They think their policies make them tough, but they amount to little more than bully tactics trying to demonize and persecute already marginalized and vulnerable communities,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“But it is women activists who have offered the most powerful vision this year of how to fight back against these repressive leaders.”
The findings are published in “Rights Today”, a major review analysing the human rights situation in seven regions around the world: Africa, Americas, East Asia, Europe and Central Asia, Middle East and North Africa, South Asia and South East Asia. The launch marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – the first global bill of rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the world’s governments.
2018: Women rise up
The burgeoning power of women’s voices should not be underestimated, notes the review. While women’s rights movements are well established, female activists have dominated the biggest human rights headlines from the past year.  And women-led groups like Latin America’s Ni una menos have galvanised mass movements on women’s rights issues on a scale not seen before.
In India and South Africa, thousands took to the streets to protest endemic sexual violence. In Saudi Arabia and Iran respectively, women activists risked arrest to resist the driving ban and forced hijab (veiling). In Argentina, Ireland and Poland, demonstrators rallied in vast numbers to demand an end to oppressive abortion laws. In the USA, Europe and Japan, millions joined the second #MeToo-led women’s march to demand an end to misogyny and abuse.
However, the report notes that we cannot celebrate the “the stratospheric resurgence of women’s activism” without addressing the driving force behind why so many women have mobilised to demand change.
“Women’s rights have consistently been placed a rung below other rights and freedoms by governments who believe they can pay lip service to these issues while doing little in reality to protect the rights of half the population” said Kumi Naidoo.
“Worse still, many of the current crop of leaders in the world have launched fresh attacks on women’s rights with their misogynistic and divisive narratives. These leaders try to argue that they are protecting traditional values that represent family interests, but the truth is, they are pushing an agenda that denies women basic equality.”
Rights Today points to a growing body of policies and laws designed to subjugate and control women, especially around sexual and reproductive health. These include a push from Polish and Guatemalan law-makers to advocate for stricter abortion laws, while in the USA, funding cuts to family planning clinics have put the health of millions of women at risk.
Women activists have risked their lives and freedoms to bring to light human rights injustices. They include Ahed Tamimi, a Palestinian child activist who was unjustly imprisoned for daring to stand up for her people; Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, three activists who are now detained in Saudi Arabia for campaigning on women’s rights; and Marielle Franco, who was brutally murdered in Brazil earlier this year because she fearlessly fought for human rights.
2019: A landmark year to turn the tide on women’s rights
Kumi Naidoo noted that the anniversary of the international bill of rights for women in 2019 – the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) – will be an important milestone that the world cannot afford to overlook.
The bill, which will turn 40 next year, is widely adopted. Yet many governments have only adopted it under the condition that they can reject major provisions that are designed to secure women’s freedoms, such as pursuing a national policy to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in law and practice and committing to eliminating discrimination against women in marriage and family relations.
Amnesty International is urging governments to take action to ensure that women’s rights are upheld – this includes not only commitments to international standards, but changes to harmful national laws and proactive measures to empower women and protect their rights.
“The fact that so many countries have only partially accepted the international bill of women’s rights is evidence that many governments think protecting women’s rights is just a PR exercise to make them look good, rather than a priority they need to address urgently,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“All around the world, women on average earn far less than their male peers, have far less job security, are denied access to political representation by those in power, and face endemic sexual violence that governments continue to ignore. We have to ask ourselves why this is. If we lived in a world where in fact it was men facing this kind of persecution, would this injustice be allowed to continue?
“I want to acknowledge that Amnesty International can and should do more on women’s rights. As we enter 2019, I believe now, more than ever, we must stand firm with women’s movements, amplify women’s voices in all their diversity and fight for the recognition of all our rights.”

BACKGROUND: Rights Today provides a snapshot of human rights issues across major regions in 2018. They include, but are not limited to:
AFRICA
Despite some progress, 2018 saw too many governments in sub-Saharan Africa continuing with brutal repression of dissent and restricting the space in which people can defend human rights. From Niger to Sierra Leone and Uganda to Zambia, governments used repressive tactics to silence human rights defenders, media, protestors and other dissenting voices. But here were signs of hope, as in Ethiopia and Angola, including as result of the change in leadership. The best news of all, however, is the extraordinary bravery displayed by ordinary people across Africa, including courageous women human rights defenders, who exemplify resilience in the face of repression. 
AMERICAS
In the Americas, 2018 brought a regressive environment for human rights, with killings of environmental defenders and social leaders rising to deeply alarming levels in countries like Colombia, and the emergence of leaders with extreme anti-human rights rhetoric, such as Brazil’s president-elect, Jair Bolsonaro. Meanwhile, human rights crises in Venezuela and Central America have forced people to leave home in search of safety on a scale unprecedented in the region. While some countries in the Americas have welcomed those in need of help, US authorities have responded by separating and detaining families and restricting the right to claim asylum.
EAST ASIA
In East Asia, 2018 saw positive steps for LGBTI rights, but the year was also marked by a shrinking space for civil society and renewed crackdowns on human rights defenders. One of the most disturbing developments has been the mass detention of up to one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). Unprecedented peace talks took place between North and South Korea, which could have significant implications for human rights on the Korean peninsula.
EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA
In Europe 2018 was marked with a rise of intolerance, hatred and discrimination, within the context of a shrinking space for civil society. Asylum-seekers, refugees and migrants have been turned away or left in squalor while acts of solidarity are progressively criminalized. Hungary, Poland and Russia, in their different ways, have lead the trend whilst in the wider region, countries from Belarus to Azerbijan and Tajikistan have seen further crackdowns on free expression and in Turkey a climate of fear has continued to descend. And yet, against this backdrop of xenophobic rhetoric and repressive politics, optimism persists. Activism and protest are growing: a groundswell of ordinary people with extraordinary passion are speaking out for justice and equality.
SOUTH ASIA
Governments across South Asia continued to harass, intimidate and persecute human rights defenders as well as other individuals campaigning for their rights. İn Bangladesh and Pakistan, authorities used draconian laws to shut down freedom of expression. In India, authorities have sought to demonize and persecute civil society groups and activists. Elsewhere in the region, Sri Lanka was plunged into a constitutional crisis following the sudden appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister. However, there were glimmers of hope too: in May, Pakistan’s parliament passed one of the most progressive pieces of legislation on transgender rights in the world.
SOUTHEAST ASIA
The state of human rights in many countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific continue to deteriorate in 2018. The Myanmar military’s violent campaign of murder, rape and arson caused the flight of more than 720,000 Rohingya women, men and children uprooted from Rakhine State by the Myanmar military’s violent campaign of murder, rape and arson continued to languish in makeshift refugee camps in Bangladesh. Governments have displayed increasing intolerance of peaceful dissent and activism, as seen with the silencing of political opposition and independent media in Cambodia. In the Philippines, more lives, particularly among the poor, were lost in the “war on drugs” perpetrated by President Rodrigo Duterte’s government.

The Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC), Amnesty International Canada, and Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights strongly support the recommendations of the UN Committee Against Torture, and call on Canada to: 
“Canada’s legacy of colonialism and genocide have led to discrimination against Indigenous women in Canada’s public healthcare system,” said Francyne Joe, President of the Native Women’s Association of Canada. “Sterilizing an Indigenous woman without her free, prior, and informed consent is invasive, medically unnecessary, and a serious violation of her right to life, liberty, and security of the person.” 
In October 2017, a class action lawsuit was proposed in Saskatchewan representing more than 60 Indigenous women who say they were sterilized without their consent. Most women reported being sterilized in the last 10-15 years, and as recently as 2017. Since then, women in other provinces have reported they too were sterilized without consent in recent years. How widespread this practice is across Canada is unknown. 
“Today’s report from the UN affirmed that sterilizing women without consent is intentional, committed by state officials, causes serious harm, and is rooted in discrimination,” said Jackie Hansen, Gender Rights Campaigner with Amnesty International Canada. “This is the very definition of torture, one of the most egregious human rights violations, and it must be stopped now.” 
As a State Party to the UN Convention Against Torture, Canada’s record on preventing and addressing torture and other forms of ill-treatment is periodically reviewed by the UN Committee Against Torture. Canada’s most recent review took place last month in Geneva and the report issued today outlines the Committee’s recommendations stemming from this review. The Committee also called on Canada to adopt laws and policies to prevent and criminalize sterilization without consent, and to clearly define “the requirements of free, prior and informed consent with regard to sterilization and by raising awareness among Indigenous women and medical personnel of that requirement.”Notably, the Committee has signaled that this deeply troubling human rights concern is of such urgency that Canada has been asked to provide an interim progress report back one year from now, rather than waiting for the next review in five or six years. This means that the Committee has put forced or coerced sterilization high on the list of issues that need to immediately be addressed when it comes to preventing and addressing torture and ill-treatment in Canada.  Governments across Canada must do the same. 
“All levels of government and healthcare agencies have a role to play in ending sterilizations without consent. The federal government is a signatory to international human rights treaties and therefore, as duty bearer, needs to exert leadership to end reproductive violence,” said Sarah Kennell, Director of Government Relations at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “The federal government must engage provinces in ensuring this does not happen again, in investigating when it does and stopping human rights violations like these across Canada.” 
“Too many Indigenous women have experienced trauma, shame, and stigma because they have been permanently sterilized without their consent,” said Francyne Joe. “We have the right to make decisions about our health and our bodies. We have the right to give birth in hospitals without fear. And we need immediate action from the federal government to defend these rights.”

“Today, we received some very sad news. Médecins Sans Frontières and its partner SOS Méditerranée have been forced to terminate operations by the search and rescue ship, Aquarius.
“Over the last two years the Aquarius and her crew have rescued nearly 30,000 people in the Mediterranean. Yet, more than 2,100 people have drowned this year. The vast majority were fleeing violence, torture and arbitrary detention in Libya.
“During this time, not only have European governments failed to provide search and rescue capacity, they have instead supported the Libyan coastguard to return people to Libya, and actively obstructed life-saving activities like Aquarius was carrying out.
“In doing this, European leaders have shown where their true priorities lie: the closure of the central Mediterranean route for refugees and migrants, even at the cost of a soaring death toll at sea.
“Today we salute the Aquarius and her courageous crew. We will continue to stand with them in defiance of cruel and unlawful policies condemning people to die at sea.”

“2018 has been a particularly brutal year for peaceful human rights activists, journalists and dissidents in the Gulf states. The abhorrent killing of Jamal Khashoggi in October shone a global spotlight on Saudi Arabia’s human rights record at home and in Yemen. All of the Gulf states gathering on Sunday have continued their suppression of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly over the past year,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Campaigns.
“Gulf leaders can no longer operate on the assumption that they have a carte blanche to treat their citizens like criminals whenever they express dissent without fear of any international repercussions.”
The GCC states – Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Qatar – typically come together to discuss trade and security cooperation. Discussion of human rights has been noticeably absent from the agenda of past summits. It is unclear whether Qatar will attend Sunday’s summit in light of the ongoing rift between Qatar and Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain.
A deteriorating human rights situation
During 2018 the persecution of human rights defenders, journalists and other peaceful dissenters has escalated across the Gulf region. Torture, harassment, arbitrary detention, executions and unfair trials have been rife for years, and governments continue to use vaguely worded “counterterror” laws to intimidate critics into silence.
In May, the Saudi authorities launched a wave of arrests targeting many human rights defenders including prominent women’s rights activists. Among those arrested were Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, who had campaigned against the ban on women driving and the male guardianship system. All remain in pre-trial detention. Government critics, academics, clerics and members of the Shi’a minority were also targeted. Saudi Arabia is currently seeking the death penalty for Israa al-Ghomgham, a Shi’a activist who has participated in protests against the government in Qatif province.
In Bahrain, the UAE and Oman, dozens of dissidents remain behind bars. Among them are opposition leaders Sheikh Ali Salman, Hasan Mushaima, and AbdulWahab Husain, and human rights defenders Nabeel Rajab and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja. Since mid-2016, the Bahraini authorities have embarked on a systematic campaign to eliminate organized political opposition in the country.
In the UAE, human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, attorney Mohammed al-Roken and academic Nasser bin Ghaith are all serving lengthy prison sentences simply for expressing their views peacefully. In Oman, human rights activists such as Saeed Jaddad and Mohammed al-Fazari have been driven into exile after years of persecution by the government.
With restrictive laws still on the books and a repressive political environment prevailing, authorities in Kuwait and Qatar appear to have largely won in their battle to suppress freedom of expression for the time being. This year Kuwait issued a new prison sentence against former member of parliament Musallam al-Barrak for supporting a public demonstration, and until 2016 Qatar had imprisoned poet Mohammed al-Ajami for reciting his work to guests in his own apartment.
Human rights violations by Gulf governments are not confined within the borders of their countries. The Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition continues to cause devastation in Yemen. Over three and a half years of war, coalition airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians, including children, by bombing or shelling hospitals, schools and homes, and many thousands more are at risk of war-induced famine.
Amnesty International is calling on the international community, especially Western allies of GCC states, to increase the pressure on Gulf leaders to respect and protect human rights.
“It’s time GCC members stop ignoring human rights. We are calling on governments to use their leverage to push for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been detained solely for their peaceful work defending human rights, reporting in the media or online, or otherwise expressing dissenting opinions in the Gulf States,” said Heba Morayef.

“Today’s appalling verdict against three peaceful activists shows the government’s determination to silence any criticism of their actions in this deadly conflict – and repress any peaceful opposition to the military whatsoever.
“These jail sentences reflect a pattern of continued attacks, intimidation, threats and prosecutions against human rights defenders, journalists and community leaders who peacefully speak out in defence of civilian victims of military operations. It sends a chilling warning to any humanitarian actor or activist who wants to tell the truth about the Myanmar military’s brutality in Kachin and northern Shan states and beyond.
“These activists made a peaceful call for humanitarian aid to vulnerable civilians trapped in a conflict zone. The convictions should be overturned and the three released immediately. They should be commended, not punished.”
Background
 A court in northern Myanmar sentenced Lum Zawng (m), Nang Pu (f), and Zau Jet (m) today to six months imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 MMK (320 USD) each. On 3 September 2018, the three peaceful activists were charged under Section 500 of the Penal Code with defamation of the Myanmar military.
The charges relate to statements they made at a peaceful rally in Myitkyina, Kachin State, on 30 April 2018 and at a press conference the next day, following major escalation in fighting in early April 2018 between the Myanmar military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), an ethnic armed group in Kachin State.
The fighting displaced more than 5,000 civilians, 2,000 of whom were trapped for several weeks in a forest near the village of Aung Lawt, without access to humanitarian assistance or safe passage from the conflict-affected area.
Since 2011, more than 100,000 people have been internally displaced across the conflict-affected areas of northern Myanmar, many of them displaced multiple times.

As a State Party to the UN Convention Against Torture, Canada’s record on preventing and addressing torture and other forms of ill-treatment is periodically reviewed by the UN Committee Against Torture. Canada’s most recent review took place last month in Geneva and the report issued today outlines the Committee’s recommendations stemming from this review. The Committee also called on Canada to adopt laws and policies to prevent and criminalize sterilization without consent, and to clearly define “the requirements of free, prior and informed consent with regard to sterilization and by raising awareness among Indigenous women and medical personnel of that requirement.”
Notably, the Committee has signaled that this deeply troubling human rights concern is of such urgency that Canada has been asked to provide an interim progress report back one year from now, rather than waiting for the next review in five or six years. This means that the Committee has put forced or coerced sterilization high on the list of issues that need to immediately be addressed when it comes to preventing and addressing torture and ill-treatment in Canada.  Governments across Canada must do the same.
“All levels of government and healthcare agencies have a role to play in ending sterilizations without consent. The federal government is a signatory to international human rights treaties and therefore, as duty bearer, needs to exert leadership to end reproductive violence,” said Sarah Kennell, Director of Government Relations at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “The federal government must engage provinces in ensuring this does not happen again, in investigating when it does and stopping human rights violations like these across Canada.”
“Too many Indigenous women have experienced trauma, shame, and stigma because they have been permanently sterilized without their consent,” said Francyne Joe. “We have the right to make decisions about our health and our bodies. We have the right to give birth in hospitals without fear. And we need immediate action from the federal government to defend these rights.”

0,UN Committee Calls on Canada to Take Action on 22 Torture and Ill-Treatment Concerns,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/un-committee-calls-on-canada-to-take-action-on-22-torture-and-ill-treatment-concerns/,"Amnesty International welcomes the release today of the Concluding Observations of the UN Committee Against Torture, following last month’s review of Canada’s record of compliance with the United Nations Convention against Torture, the first such review since 2012. “The outcome of the UN...","Amnesty International welcomes the release today of the Concluding Observations of the UN Committee Against Torture, following last month’s review of Canada’s record of compliance with the United Nations Convention against Torture, the first such review since 2012.
“The outcome of the UN Committee Against Torture’s review of Canada highlights a range of troubling failures to live up to the country’s obligations under the United Nations Convention against Torture, including insufficient and inadequate measures to address violence against Indigenous women and girls, gaps in refugee protection, improper use of solitary confinement, concerns around immigration detention and actions taken in the name of national security,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “Canada must move urgently to implement the Committee’s crucial recommendations, including unequivocally ending forced or coerced sterilization of Indigenous women, addressing concerns about the Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement, and speeding up the process to at long last accede to the torture-prevention provisions in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.”
The Committee highlights a number of situations of abuse, violence and detention conditions in Canada which amount to torture or ill-treatment under the Convention.  Notably, this includes mounting concerns that a substantial number of Indigenous women and girls have been subject to forced or coerced sterilization in Canada, a disturbing practice that has recently received considerable political and public attention.  The Committee calls on Canada to “ensure that all allegations of forced or coerced sterilization are impartially investigated, that the persons responsible are held accountable and that adequate redress is provided to the victims.”
Amnesty International has joined today with the Native Women’s Association of Canada and Action Canada for Sexual Rights and Health in pressing for immediate action to investigate and stop this unlawful practice and ensure justice for survivors.
Returning to a concern raised also during its last review of Canada in 2012, the Committee rejected the government’s assurances about the adequacy of any internal police review of allegations that the Ontario Provincial Police used excessive force and committed acts amounting to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in responding to an Indigenous land occupation and related protests at Tyendinaga, Ontario in 2008. The Committee instead called for an independent and impartial investigation.
The Committee also draws attention to Canadian laws, policies and practices that put people at serious risk of torture or ill-treatment in other countries. One such recommendation deals with the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States, which bars refugee claims at official US/Canada border posts and has led to an increase in the number of refugee claimants making irregular and often dangerous border crossings so as to be able to make refugee claims in Canada. In the face of what are described as “aggressive anti-immigration policies” in the United States, the Committee recommends that Canada undertake an assessment of the impact of the Agreement on “potential asylum seekers arriving from the United States of America who currently fear deportation and may have well-founded grounds with regard to their personal circumstances.”   
Notably the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) also expressed concern about the Safe Third Country Agreement at the time of its last review of Canada’s anti-racism record in August, 2017. CERD asked Canada to report back about the STCA by August, 2018.  That report has not yet been tabled.  With two expert UN human rights bodies now both speaking out about the STCA, it is time for the government to suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement.
The Committee also urges Canada to move to sign on to the Optional Protocol Convention against Torture, an important treaty designed to prevent torture though a system of national and international prison inspections. The Optional Protocol was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2002. Canada has made commitments to consider acceding to it in 2006, 2009 and 2018. In 2016 the government announced consultations with provincial and territorial governments with an eye to becoming party to the Optional Protocol. The Committee urges that Canada “complete the process towards accession” and “ensure the participation” of Indigenous groups and civil society. 
Among 22 comprehensive recommendations the Committee has made to Canada, action is also needed to: 
Take immediate steps to address violence against Indigenous women and girls, including by establishing a mechanism for the independent review of all cases in which there are allegations of inadequate or partial police investigations, ensuring all survivors of genderbased violence have access to shelters and compiling disaggregated statistical data.
Strengthen proposals in Bill C83 to reform the practice of solitary confinement in Canada, including by instituting a process of independent decision-making, a cap of 15 days as the maximum time anyone is held in “strategic intervention units” and a ban on individuals with serious mental health problems ever being held in such units; and by addressing the Committee’s concern that the Bill “does not contain measures to limit disproportionate impacts on Indigenous inmates, women or other prisoners with special needs.”
Ensure redress is provided to Abousfian Abdelrazik for Canada’s role in the torture he experienced in Sudan and provide more detailed updates regarding the redress provided to Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad AbouElmmati, Muayyed Nureddin and Omar Khadr, as well as efforts to pursue prosecutions related to “Canadian involvement” in the torture they experienced.
Reform law and policy to unconditionally prohibit the use by Canadian law enforcement agencies of information that may have been obtained through torture or illtreatment in third countries.
Amend the State Immunity Act to allow lawsuits in Canada against foreign government officials responsible for torture.
Bring Canadian law into compliance with the absolute prohibition on deporting individuals to a serious risk of torture and cease the use of diplomatic assurances in order to justify such unlawful removals.
Establish a maximum amount of time that individuals can be held in immigration detention and stop the arbitrary mandatory detention of “irregular” arrivals under the “Designated Foreign National” regime. 
Institute an independent oversight mechanism for the Canada Border Services Agency, the only major law enforcement agency without such oversight.
End the practice of detaining children and families in Canada’s immigration detention regime, and end the use of correctional facilities to house immigration detainees.
Reform the immigration security certificate system and provide an update relating to progress in ensuring that three individuals who have been the subject of such certificates — Mohamed Harkat, Mohammad Mahjoub and Mahmoud Jaballah — are treated in compliance with the Convention.
Conduct a full review of Canada’s approach to the handling of prisoners apprehended on the battlefield during the years of Canadian military operations in Afghanistan, with an eye to identifying reforms to ensure no prisoner is transferred to a risk of torture. 
The Committee has identified four recommendations that it feels to be of such urgency that Canada has been asked to provide an interim progress report one year from now, rather than waiting for the next review in 5 or 6 years. Those are recommendations dealing with involuntary sterilization of Indigenous women, diplomatic assurances, adequate redress for the torture and ill-treatment of Canadians detained abroad, including Abousfian Abdelrazik, and security certificates.
“Torture continues to be a grave human rights crisis around the world. The Committee against Torture has made it clear that Canada’s own record of preventing torture at home and abroad is far from perfect,” said Alex Neve. “The Committee’s important recommendations must be taken up without delay, to ensure protection and justice for those impacted by these laws, policies and decisions. When Canada is in scrupulous compliance with our own obligations under the Convention against Torture, our efforts to hold other government to account for their failures will be all the stronger.”

“Following yesterday’s arrest of prominent human rights defender Lev Ponomarev in Moscow, the detention of Emil Kurbedinov is the second time in two days that a human rights defender has been thrown behind bars over a Facebook post.
“The similarities of these two cases are obvious, even if they are not directly related. Both men are prominent members of the human rights community and both have been deliberately targeted by Russian authorities for this very reason.
“The authorities’ abuse of social media to target and harass activists is a cause of growing concern in Crimea. These politically-motivated charges must be dropped and he should be immediately and unconditionally released.”
Background
Emil Kurbedinov, a lawyer for a number of Crimean Tatar activists prosecuted by the Russian authorities, was detained on 6 December by Russian Interior Ministry officers on his way from home to his office in the Crimean capital Simferopol.
He faces charges under the Russian law forbidding “propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi or other extremist attributes or symbols”, on account of his 2013 Facebook post on a Hizb ut-Tahrir event in Simferopol published a year before Russia occupied the peninsula. A number of groups and organizations which legally exist in Ukraine, including Hizb ut-Tahrir, are banned in Russia.
On 5 December, a court in Moscow sentenced 77-year-old human rights activist Lev Ponomarev to 25 days in administrative detention for a Facebook post.

They should not have to fight again and again for basic justice that others in Canada take for granted. They should not have to overcome hunger, poverty, and poison in order to succeed.”  Judy Da Silva, Grassy Narrows, quoted today in The Toronto Star 
One of the things that has stayed with me with from Amnesty’s first official research mission to Grassy  Narrows, almost 15 years ago, was the story shared by a young mother who had only recently learned about the dangers of mercury contamination of their river system. Throughout her pregnancy she had eaten a lot of fish caught in the local rivers because she knew that wild food is part of a healthy diet and that eating fish is part of what has always connected generation after generation to their culture. But when we spoke she was very worried about whether she might have inadvertently harmed her child. 
This story, of the terrible choices forced on a people whose rivers have been poisoned, is the story of many young women at Grassy Narrows.  And a new community health study released today confirms their worst fears.

According to the study, authored by Dr. Donna Mergler and based on a comprehensive survey of children and youth at Grassy Narrows, young people in the community are much more likely than other First Nations youth to suffer from chronic health problems, including developmental and cognitive issues associated with mercury poisoning. The report draws a direct link to exposure to mercury when pregnant women eating fish from the poisoned river system. Critically, the report also documents how the contamination of the natural environmental, and the erosion of cultural traditions of living on the land, has also had a deadly toll, as loss of livelihoods, culture and identity contributes to social strain in the lives of young people. 
In other words, eating fish from the poisoned waters, and the challenge of maintaining traditions of fishing, both pose real risks to the youth of Grassy Narrows. 
“The tradition and culture of fishing and fish consumption have been passed down from one generation to the next. However, since the 1970s, so, too, has the loss of the traditional economy, unemployment and sickness.” – from the new report  
But what is perhaps most tragic is the fact that so much of this harm could have been avoided if the federal and provincial governments had not treated the people of Grassy Narrows in such a blatantly discriminatory way. 
Despite knowing that they had allowed an upstream pulp mill to dump massive quantities of mercury into the river system in the 1960s, and despite having medical evidence of the harm that had been caused to the people of Grassy Narrows, the federal and provincial governments have effectively washed their hands of the issue. 
They agreed to set up a narrow and restrictive compensation fund in  the mid 1980s but they never conducted any rigorous follow up studies on how the community had been effected. In fact, governments downplayed the mercury risks, telling the community that the contamination would soon dissipate. 
When Amnesty began our work in support of the people of Grassy Narrows, the federal and provincial governments were actively denying that mercury poisoning was even an issue. 
The study released today is part of an ongoing community-led health initiative. It is taking place only because the community insisted that it happen, in the face of government denial and delay. 
The young people of Grassy Narrows are well-known for their resilience and determination to protect their rights. Amnesty first visited the community on the heals of a blockade launched by the youth 16 years ago and which still stands today. 
Walks, vigils and other protests have all had an impact. They have held off the threat of further environmental loss from the clear cut logging promoted by the province. And they have secured commitments to clean up the river and provide specialized health care to the community. 
These promises now need to be turned into action, without delay. 
Today, youth from Grassy Narrows were in Ottawa to bring the new report to the attention of the federal government. The report includes numerous concrete recommendations for immediate action. The people of Grassy Narrows are also calling for fair compensation for all members of the community to help recover and rebuild from the harm that has been inflicted.

Signing petitions and writing letters to protect human rights matters! Achieving our desired goals may take time but raising our voices helps create pressure. I saw that first hand during a visit to the Embassy of Mexico in Ottawa on November 20th. 
We met with Ambassador Arturo Hernández Basave (below 3R) and Legal Affairs Secretary Alfonso Vera Sanchez (left) and handed over more than 35,000 messages of support, solidarity and calls for action on behalf of the 43 disappeared students of Ayotzinapa, as well as other victims of grave human rights abuses in Mexico. 
 
I’m very proud that our delegation included youth and student voices. It made our message so much more powerful. Gabrielle Crovasce (above 2L), a leader of the National Youth Committee for the francophone section of Amnesty Canada; Ashna Ali (4L), our youth intern; and myself (5L), head of our National Youth Action and Advisory Committee, were able to communicate how the forced disappearance of the students of Ayotzinapa has moved us as youth and students in Canada, the important action we have taken – and will continue to take! Sergio Michel (R), a Carleton University PhD student, added unique heartfelt perspectives as a Mexican worried about the impact on loved ones of the crisis of disappearances, violence and impunity in his country of origin. 
Our delegation was strengthened by the participation of Amnesty Canada’s National Action Coordinator Ailish Morgan-Welden (our amazing photo taker), Executive Director Jayne Stoyles (below) and Mexico campaigner Kathy Price (underneath). They read powerful excerpts from letters written by supporters in different parts of the country on the fourth anniversary of the day the students were taken away, never to be seen again. 
 
We presented two giant letters signed by hundreds of people in Ottawa and Toronto. 
 
 
We also handed over a banner signed by dozens of activists in Regina. 
 
We showed the Ambassador photos from a vigil in Montreal and Gabrielle quoted from a moving poem called “43 Students” that McGill student Teresa Altamirano Mayoral wrote and read out at that vigil. 
 
The boxes of letters we delivered, each letter wrapped in the colours of the Mexican flag, called for the creation of a special investigative commission to ensure truth and justice for the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa. A key argument we emphasized over and over was that if there is no action to get to the bottom of a case as well known as that of the students, what hope is there for disappearances without the scrutiny of civil society or the international community? 
 
 
The Ambassador (above right) applauded our efforts and expressed his solidarity with the families of the disappeared. The most meaningful part of the Ambassador’s response for me was his recognition of the importance of the activism we delivered: 
“We are touched by your action,” he said. “It shows your sisterhood with the victims of human rights abuses who are suffering terrible violence in Mexico. We acknowledge that things are not as they should be. We know we need to do more to protect human rights. On July 1, Mexicans voted for change. The incoming president promised to implement the investigative commission on the Ayotzinapa disappearances. We ask you to maintain your eyes on Mexico. It’s very, very important. The actions of your supporters in Canada create pressure. This can help to make change happen.” 
 
As a youth activist who has been taking action on the case of the 43 students since they were disappeared, the meeting was definitely emotional. I was very disheartened that four years later, we still had to have this meeting to demand truth and justice for the missing students and their families. At the same time, it was very touching and empowering to actually see all the messages from so many other activists and be able to make sure the Mexican government also sees and receives them. 
I wish that every young activist who campaigned for the students of Ayotzinapa could have been there with me, seeing the letters they wrote and the pictures of themselves at demonstrations in the hands of the Ambassador. 
 
Moving forward, I want young activists to know how powerful they are. I want them to know that all of their hard work mobilizing at school, on campus, and in their communities is incredibly important and is slowly setting the gears for change in motion. 
 
 
 
The incoming Mexican government can’t ignore the awareness that exists in Canada. Or the deep solidarity with the victims and their families that has been harnessed. 
Like the Ambassador himself said, our pressure needs to be continuous. It is working and real changes are being produced because of it. 
  
On December 3, two days after taking over as Mexico’s new leader, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador acted on the central demand of our fall campaign. 
He created a truth commission to re-examine the case of the 43 students of Ayotzinapa, whose disappearance in 2014 has yet to be resolved amid a flawed investigation and allegations of a cover-up. The truth commission, ordered in June 2018 by a Mexican federal court but blocked by the outgoing government of Enrique Peña Nieto, will be headed by the new deputy interior minister for human rights. It will start a new investigation under a special prosecutor’s office and reportedly aim to consider all leads, including those that were ignored or discarded by the former government. 
As quoted inThe New York Times, President Lopez Obrador said: “I assure you there won’t be impunity in this sad and painful case.”

Gabrielle Crovasce (above 2L), a leader of the National Youth Committee for the francophone section of Amnesty Canada; Ashna Ali (4L), our youth intern; and myself (5L), head of our National Youth Action and Advisory Committee, were able to communicate how the forced disappearance of the students of Ayotzinapa has moved us as youth and students in Canada, the important action we have taken – and will continue to take! Sergio Michel (R), a Carleton University PhD student, added unique heartfelt perspectives as a Mexican worried about the impact on loved ones of the crisis of disappearances, violence and impunity in his country of origin. 
Our delegation was strengthened by the participation of Amnesty Canada’s National Action Coordinator Ailish Morgan-Welden (our amazing photo taker), Executive Director Jayne Stoyles (below) and Mexico campaigner Kathy Price (underneath). They read powerful excerpts from letters written by supporters in different parts of the country on the fourth anniversary of the day the students were taken away, never to be seen again. 
 
We presented two giant letters signed by hundreds of people in Ottawa and Toronto. 
 
 
We also handed over a banner signed by dozens of activists in Regina. 
 
We showed the Ambassador photos from a vigil in Montreal and Gabrielle quoted from a moving poem called “43 Students” that McGill student Teresa Altamirano Mayoral wrote and read out at that vigil. 
 
The boxes of letters we delivered, each letter wrapped in the colours of the Mexican flag, called for the creation of a special investigative commission to ensure truth and justice for the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa. A key argument we emphasized over and over was that if there is no action to get to the bottom of a case as well known as that of the students, what hope is there for disappearances without the scrutiny of civil society or the international community? 
 
 
The Ambassador (above right) applauded our efforts and expressed his solidarity with the families of the disappeared. The most meaningful part of the Ambassador’s response for me was his recognition of the importance of the activism we delivered: 
“We are touched by your action,” he said. “It shows your sisterhood with the victims of human rights abuses who are suffering terrible violence in Mexico. We acknowledge that things are not as they should be. We know we need to do more to protect human rights. On July 1, Mexicans voted for change. The incoming president promised to implement the investigative commission on the Ayotzinapa disappearances. We ask you to maintain your eyes on Mexico. It’s very, very important. The actions of your supporters in Canada create pressure. This can help to make change happen.” 
 
As a youth activist who has been taking action on the case of the 43 students since they were disappeared, the meeting was definitely emotional. I was very disheartened that four years later, we still had to have this meeting to demand truth and justice for the missing students and their families. At the same time, it was very touching and empowering to actually see all the messages from so many other activists and be able to make sure the Mexican government also sees and receives them. 
I wish that every young activist who campaigned for the students of Ayotzinapa could have been there with me, seeing the letters they wrote and the pictures of themselves at demonstrations in the hands of the Ambassador. 
 
Moving forward, I want young activists to know how powerful they are. I want them to know that all of their hard work mobilizing at school, on campus, and in their communities is incredibly important and is slowly setting the gears for change in motion. 
 
 
 
The incoming Mexican government can’t ignore the awareness that exists in Canada. Or the deep solidarity with the victims and their families that has been harnessed. 
Like the Ambassador himself said, our pressure needs to be continuous. It is working and real changes are being produced because of it. 
  
On December 3, two days after taking over as Mexico’s new leader, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador acted on the central demand of our fall campaign. 
He created a truth commission to re-examine the case of the 43 students of Ayotzinapa, whose disappearance in 2014 has yet to be resolved amid a flawed investigation and allegations of a cover-up. The truth commission, ordered in June 2018 by a Mexican federal court but blocked by the outgoing government of Enrique Peña Nieto, will be headed by the new deputy interior minister for human rights. It will start a new investigation under a special prosecutor’s office and reportedly aim to consider all leads, including those that were ignored or discarded by the former government. 
As quoted inThe New York Times, President Lopez Obrador said: “I assure you there won’t be impunity in this sad and painful case.”

Germán Graciano, a renowned human rights defender, is facing charges brought by the Colombian army’s 17th Brigade. The charges were brought against him because he has denounced both nationally and internationally the presence of paramilitary groups in his community’s territory as well as the inaction of the Colombian state, which has neither investigated effectively nor taken adequate measures to protect his community.
“Germán Graciano and the Peace Community have been fighting for justice for over two decades in a context of armed conflict. The Colombian justice system has not fulfilled its duty to investigate the deaths of over 300 members of the community, nor has it responded effectively to reports of paramilitary groups and their activities in the area, or the Colombian military’s lack of action to stop them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“Reports of collusion between the military and paramilitary groups in Colombia are long-standing and credible. And despite the threats on their lives, communities and human rights defenders continue their brave reporting. The Colombian justice system must work in favour of the victims of conflict and must not become another means to re-victimize and criminalize them.”
For over 21 years, the San José de Apartadó Peace Community has reported that it has repeatedly suffered grave violations of international law, yet these cases remain in impunity. This, in addition to the slow action of the Colombian justice system, is why the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and Colombia’s Constitutional Court have all granted the community protective measures.
The 17th Brigade took legal action against Germán Graciano so he would retract his public reports of paramilitary activity in the region. A local judge ruled in favour of the 17th Brigade and gave Graciano two options: retract his reports or offer evidence of what he reported. These measures are not appropriate when grave human rights violations have been alleged. However, when Graciano refused to comply with the ruling, a judge ordered his arrest, sentenced him to five days in prison and imposed a fine equivalent to five days of minimum wage.
“This case is a true reflection of how common impunity and vulnerability have been and remain in Colombia when victims report human rights violations and the state does not fulfill its duty to investigate and protect them. We will continue to accompany the Peace Community in solidarity and support its human rights defenders,” said Erika Guevara Rosas.
This case shows the broader context of how the people and communities like the San José de Apartadó Peace Community who defend human rights suffer from vulnerability and stigmatization. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the state to investigate the interrelated actions of paramilitary groups and the Colombian military, and to guarantee victims’ rights to truth, justice and holistic reparation.
The San José de Apartadó Peace Community is a model of dignified and peaceful resistance in the face of armed conflict in Colombia. Since 1997, community members have declared their position of neutrality before armed actors operating in their region. This position of neutrality has been recognized internationally.

Today Grassy Narrows released a ground-breaking new report by renowned mercury expert Dr. Donna Mergler. The authoritative report is the first study to link higher rates of health and wellbeing challenges in Grassy Narrows’ children with exposure to mercury, a potent neurotoxin, from local fish. Grassy Narrows has long asserted that the mercury poisoning of the English and Wabigoon rivers in Northwestern Ontario continues to impact new generations of their children, and are in Ottawa to call upon Prime Minister Trudeau to take action.
The report finds that the “health and well-being of children and youth have been affected directly by prenatal exposure to mercury and indirectly by the intergenerational consequences of mercury contamination of the fish resources in their community.”
“I am calling on Trudeau to commit today to fairly compensate all our people for the ongoing mercury crisis which has impacted yet another generation of our children decades after it should have been stopped,” said Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle.  “Support us in ensuring that our bright children can expect the same successful futures that other children in Canada take for granted by urgently implementing all of Dr. Mergler’s recommendations including programs for food security and extra resources for the school.”
Ninety four percent of Grassy Narrows people receive no compensation for the intense ongoing impacts of mercury on their bodies, their environment, economy, and rights.
The report finds that Grassy Narrows people under the age of 19 had higher rates of mercury related problems compared to other First Nations, but similar rates of other conditions. Grassy Narrows children were twice as likely not to thrive and to have emotional or behavioural problems, and three times as likely to have at least one condition that may impact school performance such as speech/language difficulties, and learning disability.
These differences were clearly linked to maternal fish consumption during pregnancy.  Children whose mothers ate fish at least once each week during pregnancy were four times as likely to have a learning disability, nervous system disorder, or at least one condition that may impact school performance, and three times as likely not to be thriving compared to those whose mothers ate fish never or hardly ever during pregnancy.
“We are proud of our kids.  They are amaze me every day with their humour, their pride, and their strength.  They should not have to overcome hunger, poverty, and poison in order to succeed.  Justin Trudeau, please find it in your heart to help our children so that their dreams can come true.”
Overcoming many challenges, the children of Grassy Narrows are active and engaged.  More than two-thirds of children (70%) participate in the community organized cultural events.  The large majority of children (88%) are engaged in physical activities including walking, swimming, running or jogging, fishing, bicycle riding/mountain biking. Fully 86% of girls and 72% of boys read for fun at least a few times a month.
In spite of higher rates of fish consumption and its impacts, when all of the other factors are taken into account, the likelihood of a child being in very good or excellent health is over two times higher if the mother lived in Grassy Narrows during her pregnancy, suggesting that the Grassy Narrows environment during pregnancy was more propitious to children’s future health.
Fifty eight percent of girls 12-17 participate in events related to the promotion of their rights, such as the convergence planned for tomorrow, December 6th, at noon at the Centennial Flame on Parliament Hill.
This report paints a starkly different picture than a recent internal briefing note by INAC, obtained through FOI, apparently produced following the PMO’s January 17, 2017 statement that Grassy Narrows is a priority for his government which would “deal with this issue once and for all.”
The briefing note states that in Grassy Narrows “no children were at risk” and that “[a]ccording to Health Canada, and their review of the health and mercury related data accumulated over the past 45 years, there is no data to confirm whether there is a greater rate of disability or significant health problems, in comparison to other First Nations, in… Grassy Narrows… at this time.”   The briefing goes on to state that “Health Canada is responsible for, and is actively, monitoring water quality, the safety of the food supply and health risks to the community”
However, Health Canada stopped the regular monitoring of mercury levels in Grassy Narrows people in 1999 and on April 12, 2010 Health Minister Leonna Aglucaq told parliament that Grassy Narrows mercury “is one of those projects that we had reviewed and determined was safe.”
Since the 1970s a long series of experts have noted anecdotal signs of fetal mercury impacts on children in Grassy Narrows and called for a comprehensive community wide study to look at impacts of mercury on children.  In spite of this, no sound study was ever done, until now.
“I’ve always been taught that if you do something wrong, you have to fix it. And I believe Trudeau and government have to step up and do whats right by compensating everyone on the English and Wabigoon Rivers.” Rodney Bruce Jr., 24, Grassy Narrows youth.
Grassy Narrows’ children and youth are a national inspiration as leaders in the movements for environmental justice and Indigenous sovereignty.  They have led Canada’s longest standing Indigenous logging blockade, walked thousands of kilometers for water protection, and led marches of thousands in Toronto for mercury justice.  They have also created a hit song “Home to me” with over a million views, written award winning plays, and become accomplished nurses, teachers, powwow dancers, artists and athletes.
This report documents the unique headwinds that these remarkable youth face to succeeding in a community enduring an ongoing four decade long mercury poisoning crisis.
The authors write that “[t]he legacy of mercury compounds and exacerbates the legacies of colonialism and residential schools on the health and wellbeing of the next generation.”   The report states that “[t]here is a need to act immediately to improve the conditions of this and future generations of Grassy Narrows Children… There is a responsibility on the part of governments who allowed this situation to continue for several generations to ensure that harm to present and future generations is minimized.”
The report makes key recommendations for urgent actions needed to improve the health and wellbeing of Grassy Narrows’ children and youth so that all can reach their full potential.  These recommendations include food security programs, increased support in the school and for mothers, emergency and long-term programs for children and youth.
Grassy Narrows has been asking for these measures for many years, but neither level of government has provided them.
As a community Grassy gets no extra support to help their kids reach their full potential in the context of this unique multi-generational mercury crisis.  They get only the same school and health funding that has been found to be inadequate in other First Nations who do not have the added burden of mercury.
In recent years governments have finally committed to clean up the English and Wabigoon Rivers, build a Mercury Survivors Home and Treatment Center and index existing Mercury Disability Board payments to inflation.  However, these promises do little to help the children and youth of this generation who strive to succeed while struggling to access safe food, support in school, and adequate assistance.
The report finds that among mothers of children 4-11 years old in Grassy Narrows half have incomes less than $20,000, and two thirds struggle to meet basic needs for food.
Among youth, those who eat walleye often are four times more likely to have short attention spans, and among all school children those who eat walleye more often are 3.6 times more likely to have a condition that may affect performance in school.

Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, said, “The latest community health study on the Grassy Narrows First Nation is an indictment of the appalling history of government inaction and indifference. The young people in this study were born and grew up after the federal and provincial governments had already washed their hands of the mercury crisis at Grassy Narrows. Imagine the difference it could have made if, instead of denying that mercury was even a threat, these governments had shouldered their responsibilities and worked with the community from the outset to ensure that young people could practice their rights and traditions in a safe and healthy environment.”
Amnesty International first became involved with Grassy Narrows because the youth of that First Nation led an extraordinarily successful campaign to protect their territory from the impacts of industrial logging. Tragically, as the latest report from an ongoing community-led study clearly shows, the same youth are paying a terrible price for decades of government neglect of the health of their river system.
The report, prepared by Dr. Donna Mergler, a renowned authority on community health and the impacts of mercury poisoning, finds vastly disproportionate levels of ill-health, both physical and mental, among young people at Grassy Narrows. The report draws a number of connections to the impacts of mercury dumped into the river system in the 1960s including the health impacts of pregnant women eating contaminated fish and the loss of culture and livelihoods resulting from the destruction of the fishing economy.
The report recommendations include full compensation for the people of Grassy Narrows.
“The federal and provincial governments should ensure that the recommendations put forward by Dr. Mergler are implemented without delay,” Alex Neve said. “What the people of Grassy Narrows are seeking is a fundamental matter of justice. The federal and provincial governments need to acknowledge the terrible harm that has been done to this community and work with the people of Grassy Narrows to set things right so that future generations can enjoy their right to a safe and healthy childhood.”

Turkish authorities must immediately and unconditionally release 31 construction workers who have already spent two months in jail simply for protesting unsafe working conditions on the site of Istanbul’s third airport, said Amnesty International as a mass trial gets underway.
Just days after the official figures revealed that there have been 52 fatal work accidents on the site between 2013 and 2018, 61 workers and trade unionists are in court today. They are facing numerous charges in the context of a protest on 14 September 2018. 31 of these workers have been remanded in prison pending trial.
“By detaining and prosecuting these workers who were simply calling for dignified and safe working conditions, the Turkish authorities are sending out a message that anyone who attempts to stand up for their rights will be punished,” said Amnesty International’s Turkey Strategy and Research Manager, Andrew Gardner.
“With the official statistics showing that at least 52 workers have died on the site, it is surely now time for the authorities to listen to the legitimate demands of these workers rather than trying to silence them. All of the construction workers and unionists on trial today must be released immediately and unconditionally.”

Background
More than 400 workers were detained during a midnight raid, following a protest on 14 September 2018 against inhumane working and living conditions at the site of Istanbul’s third airport. Workers have also complained of the high numbers of accidents and deaths at the site.
61 workers are on trial and 31 of them have been in pretrial detention for around two months. Detainees, include Anıl Deniz Gider, Özkan Özkanlı, Uğur Karadaş, and Yunus Özgür, who are representatives from İnsaat-İş, a construction workers union, and the head of the Construction Workers Union (Dev Yapı-İş), Özgür Karabulut.
They are all accused of preventing police and gendarmerie from intervening in the protest, forcing or threatening others to stop or suspend work, damaging public and private property and participating in the protest with potentially harmful instruments proscribed by law, such as stones and sticks.  However, the indictment fails to describe or provide evidence of how each individual worker has committed each of the alleged crimes.
According to a written response from Istanbul Provincial Social Security Directorate to a Member of Parliament, Ali Şeker, the local social security centre recorded 52 fatal work-related accidents at the new airport construction site between 2013 and 2018.

“Whilst we welcome the news that these dedicated humanitarians will be back with their families tonight after more than 100 days behind bars, the fact that they still face absurd charges and potentially long prison sentences is an outrage.
“This case is just the latest example of how authorities are mis-using anti-smuggling laws to target activists and criminalize rescue. To detain dedicated volunteer humanitarians who helped people in need defies logic. People who selfless act in these ways should be lauded not imprisoned. These baseless charges should be dropped.”
Background
Four humanitarian workers were released on bail today.
Sean Binder and Sara Mardini were released on 5,000 Euro bail. They are charged by the Greek authorities of several crimes, including being members of a criminal organization, espionage, as well as facilitating people smuggling. According to the legal team representing the two humanitarians, the Greek authorities failed to produce concrete evidence in support of such serious accusations. These charges could lead to up to 25 years’ imprisonment.
Two more NGO members facing the same charges have also been released today on bail after three months in pre-trial detention.

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI
A police officer in Uttar Pradesh has become the latest victim of mob lynching and attacks by cow vigilantes. This attack is a consequence of the growing impunity that perpetrators of cow-related violence have in Uttar Pradesh, Amnesty India said today.
On 3 December, police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was shot dead after he reportedly tried to control mob violence in Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh after carcasses of 25 cows were found close to a police post. A post-mortem report confirmed that he died of bullet injuries. The mob also injured more than five policemen and burned down a police station. A local man was also killed during the violence.
“The Uttar Pradesh government have arrested four people so far in the death of police inspector, Subodh Kumar Singh. But mere arrests are not enough. The disturbing truth is that cow vigilante groups operate in many cases with the tacit approval of state authorities. Subodh Kumar Singh was the first investigating officer into the death of Mohammed Akhlaq. On 28 September 2015, Mohammed Akhlaq was killed by a mob in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh on the suspicion that he possessed and consumed beef. Three years later, Akhlaq’s family is still waiting for justice, and now the family of Subodh Kumar Singh is mourning the death of their loved one. The sad reality in Uttar Pradesh is that neither police nor marginalised communities, or in fact any one, are safe from the violence perpetrated by cow vigilantes,” said Asmita Basu, Programmes Director, Amnesty India.
In October 2015, following the death of Mohammed Akhlaq, local BJP leader, Vichitra Tomar, told the Times of India “The police have arrested innocent people. We also demand legal action against those people, who are engaged in cow slaughter, as it is hurting Hindu sentiments”. Shrichand Sharma, vice-president of BJP’s western Uttar Pradesh unit told the newspaper Indian Express “This happens every day. When we hurt people’s sentiments, such clashes take place. This was not a communal riot. The Hindu community worships cows. Whose blood won’t boil if they see cow slaughter?”
On 1 June 2016, the then Member of Parliament and current Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath said that the family of Mohammad Akhlaq, should face charges for cow slaughter and be stripped of the compensation they were given after his killing.
“The Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanth must take responsibility for the death of the police inspector, Subodh Kumar Singh. A culture of fear, hatred and impunity has spread across Uttar Pradesh. Many more will be attacked by cow vigilante groups in the state if the government does not end the prevailing impunity and bring those responsible to justice. The increased religious divisions that this government encourages only puts ordinary people at risk of discrimination, hostility and violence. This must end immediately and the government must commit to respecting the rights of all people,” Asmita Basu said.

Ongoing campaign to deny, distort truth and abuse victims’ families
UN must establish independent investigation into crimes against humanity
High-profile figures accused of involvement in 1988 prison massacres named  
By concealing the fate and whereabouts of thousands of political dissidents who were forcibly disappeared and secretly executed in prison 30 years ago, Iranian authorities are continuing to commit crimes against humanity, said Amnesty International in a damning report published today.
The report Blood-soaked secrets: Why Iran’s 1988 prison massacres are ongoing crimes against humanity calls on the UN to set up an independent investigation into the mass enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings which have gone unpunished for three decades.
“These blood-soaked secrets from Iran’s past continue to haunt the country to the present day. This report unravels the web of denials and distortions that the Iranian authorities have perpetuated over 30 years, both at home and internationally, to hide the truth that they forcibly disappeared and systematically killed thousands of political dissidents within a matter of weeks between late July and early September 1988,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“The fact that to this day the Iranian authorities refuse to acknowledge the mass killings, tell relatives when, how and why their loved ones were killed and identify and return their bodies, means that the enforced disappearances are continuing today. This has inflicted torturous suffering on victims’ families. Until Iran’s authorities come clean and publicly reveal the fate and whereabouts of the victims, these crimes against humanity are ongoing.”
For 30 years, families of victims have been denied the right to bury their loved ones and mourn their loss. Those who dare to seek truth and justice have faced relentless harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrest and detention, as well as torture and other ill-treatment. Further suffering has been caused by the desecration and destruction of mass grave sites.
Meanwhile, individuals responsible for these crimes against humanity have evaded justice and in some cases those involved have held and continue to hold powerful positions in Iran today. More recently, after further evidence of what happened emerged, the mass killings have been celebrated in the country and those involved hailed as heroes.
“Instead of continuing their cruel attacks against families, the Iranian authorities should be ensuring their right to truth, justice and reparation – including returning victims’ bodies and identifying remains by allowing professional exhumations of mass graves and DNA analysis,” said Philip Luther.
For this report, Amnesty International gathered testimonies of more than 100 family members and survivors from across Iran and examined hundreds of documents from the organization’s own historical archives; reports, memoirs and other written materials from survivors and Iranian human rights groups; and statements from the UN and Iranian authorities. It also crosschecked lists containing the names of thousands of victims and examined victims’ death certificates, many of which deceptively give no explanation or cite “natural causes” as the cause of death. The organization’s research reveals the shocking national scale and geographical spread of the mass killings, identifying at least 32 cities across Iran where these atrocities took place.
1988 prison massacres
The report describes how, in late July 1988, the authorities put prisons on lockdown across the country and suspended family visits without giving any reasons. Over the following weeks at least 5,000 political dissidents were extrajudicially executed in a co-ordinated effort to eliminate political opposition. This was on the orders of at least one secret fatwa issued by the then Supreme Leader of Iran, Rouhollah Khomeini, which followed an armed incursion into Iran by the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), an outlawed opposition group based in Iraq. 
Across Iran, groups of prisoners were rounded up, blindfolded and brought before committees involving judicial, prosecution, intelligence and prison officials. These “death commissions” bore no resemblance to a court and their proceedings were summary and arbitrary in the extreme. There was no possibility of appeal at any time.
Prisoners were asked questions such as whether they were prepared to repent for their political opinions, publicly denounce their political groups and declare loyalty to the Islamic Republic. Some were asked cruel questions such as whether they were willing to walk through an active minefield to assist the army or participate in firing squads.
They were never told that their answers could condemn them to death. Some thought they were appearing before a pardon committee. Often, they only discovered they were to be executed minutes before they were lined up before a firing squad or nooses were put around their necks.
Most of the victims were serving prison terms issued years earlier. Some had been detained for years without trial, and some had already completed their sentences but were due to be released. Most had been imprisoned because of their political opinions and peaceful activities such as distributing leaflets and attending demonstrations.
The majority of the victims were affiliated with the PMOI, but hundreds of prisoners affiliated with leftist political organizations and Kurdish opposition groups were also executed.
Key figures involved in the killings
Many of the officials who participated in the “death commissions” in 1988 have held, and in some cases continue to hold, positions of power in Iran today. In particular, the report compiles evidence showing that the following officials participated in the “death commissions”: 
Alireza Avaei, Iran’s current minister of justice, was the prosecutor general of Dezful in Khuzestan province and was tasked with participating in the “death commission” in that city.
Hossein Ali Nayyeri, who acted as Shari’a judge in the Tehran “death commission”, is today head of the Supreme Disciplinary Court for Judges.
Ebrahim Raisi, the deputy prosecutor general of Tehran in 1988 and another member of the Tehran “death commission”, ran for the presidency in 2017 and has held several high-profile positions, most recently as the country’s prosecutor general until 2016. 
Mostafa Pour Mohammadi, who served as justice minister between 2013 and 2017, represented the ministry of intelligence in the Tehran “death commission”. In August 2016, he was quoted boasting about his role saying, “We are proud to have carried out God’s commandment concerning the [PMOI]”, and openly declared that he had not “lost any sleep all these years” over the killings.
Mohammad Hossein Ahmadi, who participated in the Khuzestan “death commission”, is currently a member of the Assembly of Experts, a constitutional body that has the power to appoint or dismiss Iran’s Supreme Leader. 
In August 2016, an audio recording was leaked of an August 1988 meeting in which some of the key officials from the Tehran “death commission” are heard discussing its harrowing work. In response to the publicity sparked by this revelation, Iranian leaders have openly celebrated the events of 1988, glorifying the purge and describing those responsible as worthy of receiving “medals of honour”.
These statements follow a three-decade long campaign of misinformation in which the authorities have downplayed the scale of the killings and demonized the victims as a “few terrorists”.
“The grotesque distortion of the truth about these heinous crimes, coupled with the clear lack of remorse displayed by those with blood on their hands, is sickening. All individuals involved in committing and concealing these crimes must be brought to justice in fair trials that exclude the death penalty,” said Philip Luther.
Need for international action
Families and survivors have been grossly failed by the UN and international community. The lack of condemnation from the UN Commission of Human Rights at the time and the failure of the UN General Assembly to refer the situation to the Security Council emboldened Iran’s authorities to continue to deny the truth and inflict torture and other ill-treatment on the families.
“The abject failure of the UN and international community to pursue truth and justice for the atrocities committed by Iranian authorities has had catastrophic consequences not only on survivors and victims’ families but also on the rule of law and respect for human rights in the country. Iran’s authorities must no longer be allowed to shield themselves from accountability for their crimes against humanity,” said Philip Luther.
“With no prospects of justice for victims inside Iran, it is even more crucial that the UN establishes an independent, impartial and effective international mechanism to help bring those responsible for these abhorrent crimes to justice.”

0,A bittersweet verdict on the path to justice for Berta,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-bittersweet-verdict-path-justice-berta/,"Almost three years after the murder of well-known Indigenous rights and river defender Berta Cáceres in Honduras, there are finally some bittersweet steps towards justice.

But important steps forward none the...","Almost three years after the murder of well-known Indigenous rights and river defender Berta Cáceres in Honduras, there are finally some bittersweet steps towards justice. They are half steps, fraught with troubling omissions and violations of due process. But important steps forward none the less. 
  
In a unanimous verdict, a three-judge tribunal of the National Criminal Court convicted seven men of involvement in the murder of the beloved human rights defender who was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her tireless, courageous efforts to stop the Agua Zarca dam because of its impacts in Lenca Indigenous territory.  
  
The judges concluded contract hitmen burst into Berta’s home on the night of March 2, 2016 and gunned her down on the orders of executives at Desarollos Energeticos S.A. (DESA), the company developing the Agua Zarca project. During the hit, Mexican environmentalist Gustavo Castro (below left), who happened to be visiting Berta’s home, was also shot but survived by playing dead. 
 
Convicted of premeditated conspiracy to commit murder were DESA manager Sergio Rodríguez, Douglas Bustillo, a retired military officer and the company’s former security chief, and former US-trained special forces major Mariano Díaz, who served in the army with Bustillo. 
 
Elvin Heriberto Rápalo, Henry Javier Hernández, a former special forces sergeant who served with Díaz, Óscar Haroldo Torres, and Edilson Duarte Meza were found guilty of carrying out the murder of Berta and attempt to murder Gustavo Castro. The seven convicted men will return for sentencing on January 10. 
 
  
“These convictions are the first step in the search for justice,” said Berta’s daughter Bertha Isabel, on behalf of her family, COPINH, Gustavo Castro and their lawyers during a joint statement delivered outside the courthouse. 
 
The defenders were crystal clear that the struggle for justice is far from over. 
“The structures and people who gave the money for these criminals to assassinate Berta Cáceres are still free and able to continue carrying out crimes like this one with impunity,” said Berta’s youngest daughter Laura. “We ask the state and its institutions what interests are at stake that motive you to behave in a way that protects the masterminds? Why, despite clear evidence of their participation, have they still not been charged almost three years after this hideous crime?” 
 
  
“The verdict of this trial offers only half the truth,” agreed Amnesty International’s Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas. “Failing to investigate & prosecute all the perpetrators who ordered & planned this atrocious crime means the Honduran state owes a huge debt to truth and justice.” Read our full public statement here. 
  
Fallo del tribunal es una verdad a medias. Sin investigación y enjuciamiento de todos los autores que ordenaron y planearon el atroz crimen contra nuestra querida #BertaCaceres, el estado hondureño tiene una deuda enorme con la verdad y la justicia. @COPINHHONDURAS https://t.co/j0pu9Ncfp8 
— Erika Guevara-Rosas (@ErikaGuevaraR) November 29, 2018 
 
  
Amnesty has monitored the response of authorities in Honduras since the horrifying attack on Berta Cáceres and Gustavo Castro almost three years ago. We have given this work considerable attention because we know the quest for justice in this emblematic case has far-reaching implications for the protection of all defenders of indigenous rights and the environment in Honduras.  
From the outset, and on multiple occasions, we denounced a deeply-flawed investigation that seemed intent on covering up who was behind the crime.  
We also carefully monitored the trial and spoke out about multiple violations of due process that impacted on the victims’ access to justice, truth and reparation. These included forcing the family to be represented by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, an institution they have repeatedly reported for infringing their rights and suppressing evidence.  
  
In addition to our monitoring work, we have mobilized people in Canada to express their concern and create international pressure. 
More than 59,000 people have signed our actions calling on Honduran authorities to guarantee truth, justice and protection of the human rights defenders of COPINH, who continue to suffer threats and attacks, including via a dangerous smear campaign by lawyers for DESA. Many activists have made visible their demand for justice and their solidarity via photo messages.  
 
COPINH has signalled the value of these messages by sharing them in their communications, time after time. They underscored the impact of international support for their cause when they shared the news that DESA’s General Manager David Castillo (below) had been arrested in March. He is currently awaiting trial.   
 
  
“Thank you for your support,” said Berta’s daughter Bertha Isabel Zuniga in an email message to Amnesty Canada illustrated with four hearts! 
 
At their post verdict press conference, Bertha Isabel and her family had more to say about the vital importance of continued solidarity action from outside Honduras: 
“Our family, Gustavo Castro, COPINH and our legal teams have been accompanied by those who believe in Berta Cáceres, in her words and her actions. We know you will continue to make a principled stand on the side of truth and justice in the battles to come, which we will wage with complete determination.”  
 
  
There is no question that we will indeed remain firm in our solidarity and support. With COPINH, we are raising our voices now to demand that all the masterminds behind the murder of Berta are identified and brought to justice. You can help by adding your voice. 
Seven accused finally found guilty of the murder of #BertaCaceres; four of them for the attempted murder of #GustavoCastro. In Canada, we’re still waiting for the full truth. @MP_Honduras must identify & bring to justice ALL the masterminds #CapturaALosAutoresIntelectuales pic.twitter.com/fMwaczAjF9

Ciham Ali was arrested in 2012, when she was 15-years-old, for trying to leave the country in violation of Eritrea’s national service policy. She has been held incommunicado and her family has not seen or heard from her since.
“Assistant Secretary Nagy has emphasized the urgent need to address Eritrea’s dire human rights record – he will have no better opportunity to do so than this visit,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“At the top of his agenda must be the alarming number of prisoners of conscience arbitrarily detained in the country just for speaking their minds. Thousands of people like Ciham Ali are languishing in Eritrean jails having never been charged or tried for any crime simply for exercising their human rights.
“For the past six years, Ciham’s family has been robbed of a beloved daughter but they have not lost hope of seeing her again. Assistant Secretary Nagy must make robust representations to push for the immediate and unconditional release of both Ciham and all those detained across the country solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.”
Assistant Secretary Nagy must also call on the Eritrean authorities to end the practice of indefinite conscription into mandatory national service and promptly demobilize those who have served beyond the 18 months’ period prescribed by the law. He must also remind the authorities to ensure that the national service system makes provision for conscientious objection that includes the option to perform an appropriate alternative non-punitive service.

“By excluding the victims from the murder trial of human rights defender Berta Cáceres and by having the Public Prosecutor’s Office – an institution that has repeatedly been reported for violating their rights – act as their representative, the path to justice and truth has been blocked for the defender’s family” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
“Despite the ruling delivered today in this emblematic case, the Honduran justice system must demonstrate its commitment to the truth and identify all those who planned and ordered the murder of Berta Cáceres”
Today, the National Criminal Court concluded the trial against the eight individuals accused of the murder of the Indigenous Lenca leader and environmental defender, which occurred on 2 March 2016.
Douglas Bustillo (a retired military officer), Henry Hernández (a former soldier), Edilson Duarte Meza, Óscar Torres, Sergio Rodríguez Orellana (a director for DESA, the company that built the Agua Zarca dam to which the activist was opposed) and Mariano Díaz Chávez (an army major) were all found guilty by the court. Emerson Duarte Meza was found not guilty.
David Castillo, the general manager of DESA arrested on 2 March 2018, is still pending trial. 
Irregularities during the proceedings
Throughout the investigation, the family of the human rights defender and Gustavo Castro, the only person to have witnessed the killing, have reiterated that the Honduran Public Prosecutor’s Office failed to ensure genuine and full access to the case file and the evidence.  
As the court did not take the appropriate measures to ensure the victims had access to the evidence and the case file, the representatives of Berta Cáceres’ family and Gustavo Castro filed a motion to recuse the members of the court, deeming them to lack the impartiality required to hear and rule on the case. This petition prompted the suspension of the trial, which had been scheduled to begin on 17 September.
The court reconvened to commence the trial on 19 October. The lawyers for Berta Cáceres’ family and Gustavo Castro did not appear in court on the grounds that starting the trial would be illegal, given that the ruling on the writ of amparo, submitted precisely to avoid said commencement, was still pending.
On that same date, the court declared the trial to have been abandoned by Berta Cáceres’ family and Gustavo Castro. Consequently, the court decided that the Public Prosecutor’s Office should assume representation of the human rights defender’s family and the aforementioned witness.
The court’s decision to force the victims to be represented by Public Prosecutor’s Office violates the guarantee of due process and thereby affects the victims’ right of access to justice, to the truth and to reparation. Representation of the victims should not have been left to an institution that they had repeatedly reported for infringing their rights.
Stigmatisation and possible acts of discrimination
As the trial progressed, the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organisations of Honduras (COPINH) and the Broad Movement for Dignity and Justice (MADJ), the organisation to which the lawyers for Berta Cáceres’ family belong, were the focus of smear campaigns that sought to discredit their work with human rights. The authorities neither refuted these accusations nor advocated the importance of defending human rights in order to protect the members of the abovementioned organisations from further attacks. 
According to COPINH, on 31 August 2018, court staff forced Indigenous attendees to remove their traditional clothing before entering the courtroom and refused entry to some Indigenous attendees because there weren’t enough seats. In contrast, delegates from the diplomatic corps of various embassies were allowed to enter and extra seats were provided for them.

Moreover, this does not erase the fact that Canada still holds an active $15-billion multi-year Light Armoured Vehicles (LAV) deal with Saudi Arabia, which could be used to attack civilians in Yemen. Earlier this month, Finland, Denmark and Germany halted their arms sales to the Kingdom, but Canada still refuses to act. Continuing to sell arms to Saudi Arabia risks Canadian complicity in the commission of war crimes in Yemen, where we are witnessing one of the worst human rights atrocities of our time. Canada must show leadership by halting LAV sales to Saudi Arabia and supporting the rights and dignity of the Yemeni people, as well as calling for a UN-led investigation into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.”

Whether they face vitriolic harassment online, intimidation for demanding equal services or death threats for protecting their land, women around the world are increasingly under attack for peacefully advocating for human rights.
That’s why Amnesty International is focusing this year’s Write for Rights campaign on women who are fearlessly working to improve the lives of those living in vulnerable, marginalized communities.
Every year, around International Human Rights Day on December 10, Amnesty International supporters across the globe write millions of letters and take action for people whose rights are under attack, in what has become the world’s biggest human rights campaign.
Write for Rights participants send messages of solidarity to those fighting for human rights. They also send letters to government officials responsible for or complicit in human rights violations, urging them to take action.
This year’s Write for Rights event is remarkable; not only is Amnesty International shining the spotlight on women human rights defenders, but this December 10 marks the 70th anniversary of the United Nations adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The Universal Declaration pronounces rights that each and every one of us possesses, by the very fact that we are human. Every year since 1948, progress has been made towards every person enjoying all those rights. More and more people are living lives free from want, fear and discrimination.
But, as this year’s 10 Write for Rights cases demonstrate, the fight for universal human rights is far from over.
This year, Amnesty International is writing letters to: 
Brazil’s presidentelect, Jair Bolsonaro, urging him to bring Marielle Franco’s killers to justice, including those who ordered the crime. Marielle was a young, black, bisexual human rights defender and city councillor in Rio de Janeiro who was shot dead last March.
Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, asking him to release Atena Daemi, who was unjustifiably jailed for criticizing Iran’s death penalty on social media.
Republic of South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, urging him to protect human rights defender Nonhle Mbuthuma, who has faced death threats and survived a murder attempt while courageously defending Indigenous land rights from titanium mining. Fortunately, the North Gauteng High Court ruled the government cannot issue a licence for the proposed Australian company’s mining project without the consent of Indigenous communities. While this is news worth celebrating, we must still support Mbuthuma and the amaMpondo Indigenous people. 
These are just a few of the cases Amnesty International is focusing on this year. Visit www.writeathon.ca to review all the cases and join a Write for Rights event in your community.
Background:
Amnesty International’s first Write for Rights campaign took place 15 years ago in Poland.  Canada joined the letter writing campaign in the 2nd year. Since then, millions of actions have been taken by activists from over 80 countries around the world. Every year, these actions lead to real change. People wrongfully imprisoned are released, torturers are brought to justice, and people in prison are treated more humanely.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is meeting leaders of the world’s largest economic powerhouses to discuss the global economy amid brewing trade tensions, recent high-profile human rights violations and a growing wave of troubling government measures to ban refugees and silence dissent.
Unfortunately, this is not a new Netflix series. It’s the real-life world stage on which political leaders will meet from November 30 to December 1. Amnesty International will be looking to Trudeau – and his 19 other Summit colleagues – to address these serious human rights issues.
While any number of concerns could be addressed, Amnesty International is urging Trudeau to make the following crucial recommendations with the leaders of China, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States.
China: Close the “re-education” camps in which at least one million Uighur and other Muslim ethnic minorities are detained, and release Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil so that he is able to return home to his family.
India: Cease the mounting crackdown against Amnesty International India and other human rights and civil society groups in the country.
Mexico: Stop blocking court-ordered measures to address a grave crisis of disappearances, act to end widespread use of torture by state security forces and sexual torture of women, stop illegally deporting asylum-seekers back to life-threatening situations, and initiate a plan for the orderly removal of the armed forces from public security.
Russia: End the use of draconian and repressive laws against independent journalists, non-governmental organizations and human rights defenders.
Saudi Arabia: End war crimes in Yemen, release imprisoned women’s rights activists and commit to a UN-led investigation into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.
Turkey: Demonstrate a commitment to the protection of human rights defenders by dropping charges against the honorary chair and former director of Amnesty International Turkey and nine other human rights activists, and ensure that dual Canadian/Turkish nationals imprisoned during the post-coup crackdown have access to appeal hearings that meet international fair trial standards.
United States: Halt the deployment of US military personnel at the Mexican border, accept asylum seekers at all locations along the Mexico-US border and end all family separations of migrants and asylum seekers.

The report, “The Forest Is Our Heartbeat:” The Struggle to Defend Indigenous Land in Malaysia, documents the countless obstacles faced by members of Indigenous communities and those who advocate on their behalf across the country. Amnesty International’s investigation is based on dozens of interviews with Indigenous community members, village heads, local activists, members of civil society organizations, lawyers, academics and journalists across Peninsular Malaysia, as well as Sabah and Sarawak.
“The government is failing to protect Indigenous peoples’ right to land, which on paper is recognized under Malaysian law,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Malaysia Researcher at Amnesty International. “Indigenous cultures are at risk of disappearing completely, together with Malaysia’s forests.”
“From our research, it is clear the Federal and state authorities are in denial about the scale of abuses against Indigenous peoples. The new government must intervene urgently to introduce immediate reforms, as promised in its election manifesto.”
Violence and harassment
The report shows how the murder of the Indigenous activist Bill Kayong – a vocal advocate for Indigenous peoples’ land rights who was gunned down in broad daylight in Miri in June 2016 – came amidst a wider climate of violence, intimidation and harassment faced by human rights defenders in Sarawak.
People described as ‘gangsters’ armed with swords or other weapons have been found to confront, harass and physically attack community leaders and activists with impunity. Other people Amnesty International spoke to told how police, government officials and agencies have threatened, arrested and investigated community members and human rights defenders across Malaysia. State authorities have demolished peaceful blockades of communities seeking to protect their land claims.
This includes the case of Gua Musang, Kelantan, where some people told Amnesty International that they were arrested and interrogated by police in clear relation to their roles in peaceful protests in defence of their land. Several journalists also told Amnesty International that they were questioned and detained simply for documenting the protests.
No accountability or protection
The report also details the systematic lack of accountability for abuses. Perhaps owing to its shocking violence, Bill Kayong’s murder is the only case Amnesty International documented where a person has been convicted of a crime. A crime that his relatives believe could have been prevented:
“Bill had filed lots of police reports. I am really not satisfied with how the police handled the case and I believe if the police did their job effectively and on time my brother would still be alive,” a relative told Amnesty International. “Nothing was done, no action was taken.”
While the alleged gunman was found guilty, no charges have ever been brought against anyone suspected of ordering the killing. The Kayong family is appealing to the new Attorney General, to re-examine the case.
“In a significant number of cases we’ve heard, the Malaysian government has failed to adequately investigate the human rights violations reported by communities,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “In cases of attacks, assaults and threats by people described as ‘gangsters’, witnesses told us that the police showed shocking indifference.”
“As Bill’s case tragically shows, when the state fails to protect those defending Indigenous peoples’ land, it undermines their vital work – and exposes them to even greater danger.”
Lack of progress
These findings emerge as Malaysia’s new governing Pakatan Harapan coalition embarks on a reform agenda following its electoral victory in May 2018. Its campaign manifesto pledged to ‘recognise, uphold and protect the dignity and rights’ of the Indigenous peoples of Malaysia.
“More than one in ten people in Malaysia belong to an Indigenous community,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “It is clear that since the report of the National Inquiry on Indigenous land in 2013, there has been almost no progress on Indigenous land matters in the country.”
“In particular, Indigenous people told us that the government had not obtained their free, prior and informed consent for development projects. It is high time for the government to act – the future of the country’s forests and Indigenous peoples depends on it.”
Time for action
The report outlines some clear areas for action. These include strengthening and expanding legal and policy protections for human rights defenders, to ensure they can work safely and free from harassment. The Malaysian government must carry out prompt, thorough and impartial investigations into attacks, threats and assaults against human rights defenders. It must also ratify key conventions to protect and promote Indigenous people’s rights, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
Crucially, the government must also reverse its recent decision not to ratify the International Covenant on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). “It is deeply disappointing that the government has backtracked on its promise to ratify ICERD” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “The purpose of ICERD is to protect the rights of all people without discrimination.”
“55 out of 57 OIC states have ratified ICERD, except for Malaysia and Brunei, as have seven of ASEAN’s 10 states. The government must reconsider this decision if it is to protect Malaysia’s Indigenous people from the appalling levels of harassment and abuses shown in our report.”

It is rare for the authorities to prosecute a human rights activist for this charge, which carries a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment, in a disturbing sign of the intensifying crackdown against peaceful dissent in the country.
This ludicrous charge must be dropped as it is aimed solely at silencing a dedicated, peaceful human rights activist. This is a politically motivated prosecution, brought by the authorities in response to Huynh Thuc Vy’s tireless work to expose human rights violations in Viet Nam and hold the powerful to account; said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
For the authorities to use the charge of insulting the national flag to curb peaceful criticism underlines the worsening crackdown on the right to freedom of expression in Viet Nam. The real insult here is the lack of respect the authorities are showing for human rights and international law and standards.
Background
Huynh Thuc Vy is the founder of the organization Vietnamese Women for Human Rights, whose work aims to support women human rights defenders in Viet Nam. She regularly blogs about human rights violations, including the persecution of ethnic minorities in the country.
Her trial is due to take place on Friday 30 November at the Peoples Court of Buon Ho town, Dak Lak province. Huynh Thuc Vy was accused of insulting the national flag” after a photo of her standing next to a Vietnamese flag with white paint splashed over it appeared on her Facebook page.

“The government of President-elect López Obrador has a historic opportunity to build a Mexico in which the human rights of every individual are respected and protected,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“The mistakes of the past cannot keep being repeated. We ask the next government to take decisive, timely and effective measures to improve the human rights situation in Mexico and to demonstrate that the rights of individuals in the country will be at the core of all public policy and government action.”
In an open letter delivered to the president-elect, Amnesty International recommended 11 actions that his government should take during its first 100 days in relation to five pressing issues: violence against women and children; caring for the environment by protecting defenders of the land, territory and environment; the role of the police and military forces in public security; the right to justice, truth and reparation in cases of enforced disappearance; and the rights of individuals seeking asylum in Mexico.
Amnesty International will closely monitor the situation to see whether necessary actions are taken in these five areas.
“Andrés Manuel López Obrador has spoken about transforming the country and that is exactly what we are asking him to do in this campaign. In 100 days for Mexico, we set out the key actions that would help to build a better country, a brief list of specific improvements that would deliver the powerful message that his government is committed to human rights”, said Tania Reneaum, Executive Director of Amnesty International Mexico.
“The biggest social changes start with small steps, and so we call on the new president and his team to make a new Mexico a reality, one that takes the rights of all individuals seriously, joins in the decades-long fight and is set in motion during his first 100 days of government”.

“These allegations are deeply disturbing. It is beyond belief that the UN may have deliberately buried information that would have been critical for bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of its own investigators.
“The suggestions of deliberate cover-up for political expediency must be fully investigated by the UN and any UN officials guilty of wrongdoing must be held to account. The UN must also disavow the findings of the Board of Inquiry and reopen the probe into the killings of Zaida Catalan and Michael Sharp – this time independently and impartially.
“If any high-ranking security officers or government officials bear responsibility for these horrific murders, they must be identified and brought to justice.”
Background
Michael Sharp, a US citizen, and Zaida Catalan, from Sweden, were murdered on 12 March 2017 in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of Congo while on a UN mission. Catalan was shot in the head and decapitated; Sharp was shot in the back trying to run away.
A Board of Inquiry into their murders established by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres concluded in August 2017 that the two were killed by the Kamuina Nsapu militia, and that Catalan and Sharp had breached UN safety and security protocol for field operations.
However, an investigation released on 27 November by Swedish television’s Mission Investigate, in collaboration with Süddeutsche Zeitung, Le Monde, Foreign Policy magazine and Radio France International alleges that senior Congolese military and security officials may have been connected to the murders – information that was “covered up” by the UN’s own probe, possibly to “avoid a diplomatic rupture” with the DRC.

A recent investigation by Haaretz newspaper uncovered the firm’s sophisticated surveillance tool “Pegasus” was offered to authorities in Saudi Arabia last year.
Two weeks ago, Amnesty International Israel submitted an urgent request to the Israeli Ministry of Defence, demanding that NSO Group’s defence export licence be revoked in light of an attempted cyber attack on an Amnesty staff member via NSO’s spyware.
But this week, the Israeli Defence Ministry refused to revoke the firm’s licence, causing Amnesty International to consider seeking legal action.
“We thoroughly reject this inadequate response. The mountain of evidence and reports on NSO Group and the sale of its spyware to human rights-violating regimes is substantial proof that NSO has gone rogue”, said Molly Malekar, Programs Director of Amnesty International Israel.
“The Ministry of Defence must answer for their failure to properly regulate NSO Group as they are in charge of controlling Israeli Defence Export.
“By continuing to approve of NSO Group, the Ministry of Defence is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with NSO Group as their software is used to commit human rights abuses.”
In June this year, an Amnesty International staff member was targeted by a sophisticated surveillance campaign, in what the organization suspects was a deliberate attempt to spy on its staff by a government hostile to its work.
“Amnesty International will not stand idly by as companies such as NSO Group profit from selling their invasive Pegasus software to repressive states around the world”, said Danna Ingleton, Deputy Director of Amnesty International Tech.  
”NSO Group’s software has been used to attack Amnesty staff and fellow human rights defenders globally. As the Israeli Ministry of Defence refused our request to revoke the export licence, it is clear that we now need to take additional legal steps to expose the truth and seek accountability for the attack against us.”
Targeting of Amnesty International staff
In June this year, an Amnesty International staff member received a suspicious WhatsApp message in Arabic. The text contained details about an alleged protest outside the Saudi embassy in Washington D.C., followed by a link to a website. Investigations by Amnesty International’s technology team revealed that clicking the link would have installed “Pegasus”, a sophisticated surveillance tool developed by the Israel-based company NSO Group.
The WhatsApp message was sent to Amnesty International in a week when the organization was campaigning for the release of six women’s rights activists detained in Saudi Arabia. The link, if clicked, would have allowed the Pegasus software to infect the user’s smartphone, tracking keystrokes, taking control of the phone’s cameras and microphone and accessing contact lists.
Amnesty International’s investigation also discovered that another Saudi Arabia rights activist, who later publicly identified himself as Yahya Asiri, received a similar malicious message.
In a statement to Amnesty International, NSO Group said that their product “is intended to be used exclusively for the investigation and prevention of crime and terrorism” and that any other use violate their policies and contracts.
Connection to NSO Group and suspicious websites
Further investigations by Amnesty International revealed that the domain link in the message belongs to a large infrastructure of more than 600 suspicious websites which had been previously connected to NSO Group. Amnesty International is concerned that these could be used to bait and spy on activists in countries including Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo and Hungary, in addition to the Gulf.
Pegasus was also used to target the Emirati award-winning human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, who has been in prison in the United Arab Emirates since March 2017.
Background
While law enforcement agencies in many countries have used secret surveillance in relation to national security objectives, Amnesty International is concerned that in many cases surveillance is being carried out in a manner contrary to international human rights law. Tools like Pegasus are especially problematic from a human rights law perspective as they are so deeply invasive.
As laid out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), companies also have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever they operate in the world.

Google’s plans to launch a censored search app in China could irreparably damage internet users’ trust in the tech company, Amnesty International said today, warning that going ahead with the app would set a dangerous precedent for tech companies enabling rights abuses by governments.
The organization has launched a global petition calling on Google CEO Sundar Pichai to drop the app, which is codenamed Project Dragonfly and would blacklist search terms like “human rights” and “Tiananmen Crackdown”. Following a public outcry from Google’s own workforce, Amnesty International is reaching out to the company’s staff through protests outside Google offices and targeted messages on LinkedIn calling on them to sign the petition. A spoof promotional video offering Google staff the chance to participate in Project Dragonfly ends with a twist on Google’s motto: “Don’t be evil – unless it’s profitable”. 
“This is a watershed moment for Google. As the world’s number one search engine, it should be fighting for an internet where information is freely accessible to everyone, not backing the Chinese government’s dystopian alternative,” said Joe Westby, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Technology and Human Rights.
“Many of Google’s own staff have spoken out against these plans, unwilling to play a role in the Chinese government’s manipulation of information and persecution of dissidents. Their courageous and principled stance puts Google’s leadership to shame. Today we are standing with Google staff and asking them to join us in calling on Sundar Pichai to drop Project Dragonfly and reaffirm Google’s commitment to human rights.”
State repression
The Chinese government runs one of the world’s most repressive internet censorship and surveillance regimes. In 2010 Google publicly exited the search market in China, citing restrictions to freedom of expression online. Since then, the Chinese government has intensified its crackdown and it is unclear how Google would safeguard human rights in this environment.
Leaked internal documents obtained by The Intercept show that the prototype app that Google built under Project Dragonfly would comply with China’s censorship rules by automatically identifying and filtering websites blocked in China and “blacklisting sensitive queries”. According to The Intercept, the blacklist that Google itself developed for the project includes the terms “student protest” and “Nobel Prize” in Chinese, as well as phrases that imply criticism of China’s President Xi Jinping. Google would also be compelled to cooperate with Chinese censors in cracking down on posts related to developing social issues, such as the Chinese government’s response to the growing #MeToo movement and the Chinese government’s internment of ethnic minorities. 
The prototype app would also make it easier for authorities to track individual users’ searches, which means there is a real danger that Google would be helping the Chinese government to arrest or imprison people. Chinese laws and regulations force tech companies to cooperate fully with inspections by public security officials.
Launching Project Dragonfly would also risk legitimizing China’s vision of the internet, which gives governments absolute control over what information is available to the population and the power to freely access all online data about their citizens. A recent report by Freedom House found that China is actively exporting its model of internet control around the world by conducting large-scale trainings for foreign officials, providing technology to other governments and forcing international companies to follow its rules even outside China.
In response to criticism over Project Dragonfly, Google has said it is committed to respecting the fundamental rights of its users. However, the company has failed to explain how it would square this commitment with a project that appears to accept censorship and surveillance. The company’s leadership has also tried to shrug off criticism by saying it has simply been exploring the possibility of re-entering the Chinese search market and that it does not know whether it “would or could” launch such a product. However leaked comments by a senior Google manager suggest that before the project was made public, the company had been working to have Project Dragonfly ready to launch as soon as possible.  
“Google needs to stop equivocating and make a decision. Will it defend a free and open internet for people globally? Or will it help create a world where some people in some countries are shut out from the benefits of the internet and routinely have their rights undermined online?” said Joe Westby.
“If Google is happy to capitulate to the Chinese government’s draconian rules on censorship, what’s to stop it cooperating with other repressive governments who control the flow of information and keep tabs on their citizens? As a market leader, Google knows its actions will set a precedent for other tech companies. Sundar Pichai must do the right thing and drop Project Dragonfly for good.”

0,Burundi: Human rights defender jailed for 32 years must be released,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/burundi-human-rights-defender-jailed-for-32-years-must-be-released/,"The Burundian authorities should overturn the 32-year sentence handed to human rights defender Germain Rukuki and set him free, according to Amnesty International following his appeal hearing on 26 November. “Germain was tried and imprisoned simply because he worked for a human rights...","The Burundian authorities should overturn the 32-year sentence handed to human rights defender Germain Rukuki and set him free, according to Amnesty International following his appeal hearing on 26 November.
“Germain was tried and imprisoned simply because he worked for a human rights organization. The appeal court should quash his sentence and release him immediately and unconditionally,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The Burundian government must also release all other prisoners of conscience in the country and allow human rights defenders to do their work without fear of reprisals.”
Germain Rukuki was arrested on 13 July 2017 in the capital Bujumbura and charged on 1 August 2017. The charges were based on his former affiliation with the anti-torture organization, ACAT-Burundi, which was suspended in the latter part of 2015 and permanently closed in October 2016.
His trial took place before the Ntahangwa High Court, at Ngozi prison, where he was transferred two weeks after his arrest. Neither Germain Rukuki nor his lawyers were present when the verdict and sentence were handed down by the court on 26 April 2018. The decision had been expected in early May.
He was acquitted of charges of “assassination” and “destruction of public and private buildings” but found guilty of “rebellion”, “threatening state security”, “attacking the authority of the state” and “participation in an insurrectionist movement”.
In June this year, Germain Rukuki was hospitalized and underwent surgery for a fracture in his right ankle sustained during an accident in prison. He also injured his right shoulder and leg. After his return to prison, he applied for provisional release in order to receive adequate medical treatment and full rehabilitation in hospital. No decision on this request has been communicated to date.
“The authorities have an obligation to provide care to Germain Rukuki while he is in their custody and they must ensure he gets comprehensive treatment for his injuries, including the necessary post-operative care,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
Another jailed human rights defender, Nestor Nibitanga, was found guilty of “threatening state security” and sentenced to five years in prison on 13 August 2018. Nestor Nibitanga, who was arrested in November 2017, had been an observer with the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Detained Persons (APRODH) before the organization was shut down.
Others jailed for their human rights work are Aimé Constant Gatore, Marius Nizigama and Emmanuel Nshimirimana, who worked with PARCEM – Words and Actions for the Awakening of Consciences and the Evolution of Mentalities. They were arrested in June 2017 and sentenced to 10 years in prison on 8 March 2018 on charges of “threatening state security”.
Amnesty International considers all these men prisoners of conscience – imprisoned solely because of their human rights work.
Background
The civic space in Burundi continues to shrink since the start of the political crisis in April 2015 when President Pierre Nkurunziza decided to stand for a third term in office, sparking mass protests.
The Burundian authorities have clamped down on members of the political opposition, independent civil society and media. Many human rights defenders and journalists have fled the country and many of those that remained have faced threats and reprisals, including arrests, prosecution on trumped-up charges, and suspected enforced disappearances.
APRODH and ACAT-Burundi, along with several other civil society organizations, were shut down in October 2016 by the Minister of Interior, Pascal Barandagiye, following their initial suspension in 2015. They were accused of “tarnishing the image of the country” and “sowing hatred and division among the Burundian population”.
In October this year, all international non-governmental organizations (except for those running schools and hospitals) were temporarily suspended after the government accused them of not upholding new legislation with respect to ethnic quotas in recruitment and financial requirements, among others.

Conditions could only...","Unlawful US border policies are leaving thousands of asylum seekers stranded in Mexico, where they are facing threats of deportation to their countries of origin, where they potentially face serious harm, Amnesty International said today following a research mission last week. Conditions could only worsen under a reported deal between both countries that, if agreed, would force asylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are processed, rather than allow them to enter the United States.
As a result of Amnesty International’s research focusing on the treatment of refugees and migrants in the caravans in Guatemala, the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, Mexico City and Tijuana throughout October and November, the organization has today issued 26 recommendations to the US and Mexican governments, as well as to the authorities in Central American countries of origin and transit, to ensure human rights protections and humanitarian support for all those seeking asylum and en route, including calling on authorities to respect international standards on the use of force.
“Instead of militarizing the border and peddling fear and discrimination, President Trump’s administration should show compassion for those forced to flee their homes and must receive their requests for asylum without delay, as required by US and international law,” said Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“For their part, the governments of Mexico and Central America must take urgent action to guarantee the safety and wellbeing of all these people on the move and ensure they do not suffer further human rights violations. If Mexico agrees to do the US government’s dirty work at the expense of the caravan members’ dignity and human rights, it is effectively paying for Trump’s shameful border wall.”
“The danger posed to desperate families patiently waiting their turn for asylum at the border is an emergency of the US government’s own making,” said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.
“Using teargas in a situation where families, children and their parents were present was not only horrific, it was also a new low for this administration in its contempt for our shared human dignity and human rights.”
Unsanitary conditions and unlawful asylum waitlists
On 18 November, Amnesty International visited Tijuana’s Benito Juarez sports complex, a temporary shelter where the municipal government had accommodated approximately 3,000 migrants and asylum seekers who had arrived in the first of several caravans totaling 8,000 to 10,000 people across Mexico. They joined thousands of other people that US authorities have forced to wait in Tijuana for weeks or months before allowing them to request asylum at the border. On 22 November, US Secretary of State Pompeo declared that the US government plans to unlawfully deny people that right by refusing entry of the caravans into the United States. 
Mexican federal, state and municipal officials separately confirmed to Amnesty International that the temporary shelter did not have sufficient food, water and health services, and that respiratory illnesses were spreading among those staying there.
Since at least April 2018, US and Mexican authorities have unlawfully required asylum seekers to put their names on a quasi-official asylum waitlist on the Tijuana side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry, instead of allowing people to request asylum directly at the border. The list is jointly coordinated by the asylum seekers themselves and Mexican authorities, in response to US limits on the number of asylum seekers they will receive each day. People seeking asylum without identity documents are prohibited from joining the list of those waiting to request asylum, and if they miss the day their number is called, they risk losing their places entirely.
By turning away asylum-seekers at ports of entry, US authorities are violating their right to seek asylum from persecution and manufacturing an emergency along the border. This queue along the border exposes people who seek asylum to risks of detention and deportation by Mexican immigration officials, and exploitation by criminal gangs.
On 21 November, Amnesty International reviewed the list, which contained the names of around 4,320 people, including about 2,000 caravan members, mostly from Honduras, who had arrived since 15 November. Those already on the list prior to the caravan’s arrival had been waiting, on average, about five weeks in Tijuana before US authorities started processing their asylum claims. Officials from Mexico’s National Institute of Migration (INM) and a Tijuana municipal official told Amnesty International that Mexican nationals comprised approximately 80 percent of those seeking asylum before the caravan arrived.
Mexican authorities cannot lawfully prevent people from exiting the country and seeking asylum at the US border. Yet Amnesty International confirmed with multiple sources in the Mexican government that Mexican immigration officials routinely take possession of the waitlist each night, and coordinate with US border authorities on how many asylum seekers from the list will be received each day. Amnesty International has received reports from Mexican officials speaking anonymously that raise doubts as to the supposed lack of capacity by US authorities to receive more people and indicate the pressure that the US government exercises on Mexican authorities to restrict entry of asylum seekers.
Mexican officials and asylum seekers at the San Ysidro Port of Entry told Amnesty International that US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials there were recently accepting 30 to 70 asylum applications per day. On 16 November, CBP’s San Ysidro Port Director told the Washington Post his staff could process 90 to 100 asylum seekers per day, provided that US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) took custody within 72 hours of those asylum seekers whom they processed.
In a meeting with Amnesty International on 20 November, ICE officials declined to answer whether they were taking custody of asylum seekers in a timely fashion or faced any capacity constraints due to the recent arrival of the caravans, before abruptly ending the meeting.
Amnesty International calls on the US authorities to immediately respect people’s right to claim asylum both at and between official ports of entry. Following the US government’s declarations that they plan to unlawfully deny people in the caravans that right, Congress should decline to fund CBP operations absent rigorous congressional oversight of those operations and a written commitment from CBP to halt the illegal pushbacks of asylum-seekers both at and between US ports of entry. Amnesty International documented these pushbacks in a recent report.
People seeking asylum face risk of deportation by Mexican authorities
On 19 November, Tijuana’s municipal police force announced that it had detained 34 caravan members for “public disorder” (including drinking beer on the street) and transferred them to INM for potential deportation. Amnesty International immediately asked INM to facilitate its access to interview the detainees, after receiving unverified reports that Tijuana’s municipal police may have racially profiled, entrapped and/or extorted some of them, and that their detentions may have resulted in their separation from family members staying at the Benito Juarez sports facility. INM did not allow the organization to visit them.
On 20 November, a migrant rights expert with Mexico’s National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) confirmed to Amnesty International that one or more families had been separated by the detentions, but said CNDH had not yet interviewed any of the detainees to assess the validity of the charges against them. He noted that people who were part of the caravans were at high risk of deportation if detained by municipal police, since most either lack legal status in Mexico or their legal stay is due to expire soon, including those planning to seek asylum at the US border. Under Mexican migration law, municipal police are not allowed to carry out migratory revisions of people’s documents – a task reserved for the INM.
Local media in Tijuana reported on 20 November that 40 caravan members had been detained by municipal police and then deported by INM. This detention is part of a wider trend in recent days, with the INM carrying out several mass detentions across Mexico in response to the caravan, including of families and children. In some cases, the number of people detained has reached the hundreds. On 25 November, Mexican authorities said that some of those who tried to cross into the United States and were met with teargas would be deported. Deporting people to countries were their lives are at risk, without giving them the chance to seek asylum, would violate Mexican and international law.
“Mexican municipal, state and federal authorities have struggled to accommodate and provide adequate humanitarian assistance for those stuck in Tijuana, and in some cases sought for Mexican immigration officials to deport people who are part of the caravans, potentially contrary to international law,” said Erika Guevara Rosas.
“Mexico’s National Migration Institute should urgently clarify whether all of those caravan members detained in recent days have been provided with opportunities to request asylum in Mexico or regularize their status and reunify with their children or other family members.”
Amnesty International calls on the Mexican government to ensure and expedite proper screening of migrants and asylum seekers who may qualify for international protection; and provide provisional documentation to those awaiting reception at US ports of entry, to prevent them from being deported to their countries of origin while their cases are processed.
The organization also recommends authorities in countries of origin to address the factors that drive people to leave, while transit and receiving countries must ensure their health and safety, provide them with humanitarian assistance, respect their right to claim asylum, and prevent and investigate any abuses and human rights violations against them.
These recommendations are based on interviews that Amnesty International conducted with approximately 200 people travelling in the caravans – either individually or in groups, including several families, women travelling with children, and members of the LGTBI community – as well as information obtained from governments across the region, international organizations and civil society organizations present in the field.

She also happens to be the sister of renowned Brazilian women human rights defender and politician Marielle Franco, who was murdered in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year. Jackie Hansen, Amnesty’s Gender Rights Campaigner, reports on Anielle’s human rights work including her ongoing campaign for justice for Marielle. 
In September 2018, Anielle Franco travelled to Montreal, Quebec, to participate in a historic summit of women foreign ministers from around the world. She met with politicians, who, like her sister, are part of a minority: women in politics.  
Anielle spoke to the ministers with love and passion about her sister. They were raised in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, and experienced discrimination because of the colour of their skin and their social class. In a country where the opportunities for black women are often limited, both went on to attend university and work in their chosen fields. They shared a passion for advocating for the rights of black women in Brazil. Marielle was also an outspoken advocate for young people, LGBTI people, poor people, and against police violence. 
Anielle talked about her sister’s murder in March 2018 as she handed the foreign ministers flowers dedicated to her sister’s memory, and a photo of her sister. Marielle and her driver were shot to death in Marielle’s vehicle after leaving an event she had organized about black women’s empowerment. No one has been arrested for their murders. 
Anielle Franco is leading a global campaign calling for #JusticaParaMarielle (justice for Marielle). She spoke of the trauma her mother experienced when she saw her daughter’s lifeless body. The threats to her family as they advocate for justice because “They believe black women can’t speak. They believe women can’t speak.” She called on foreign ministers to support and implement actions in their own countries and around the world that will ensure women like her can advocate for justice and equality without having to worry about online harassment, assaults, or worse. 
While in Montreal, Anielle held meetings with women human rights defenders from around the world including two Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, many of whom have experienced violence and discrimination because they are women who dare to speak out publicly in support of human rights. At a public event in Montreal where Anielle spoke alongside some of these advocates, she said, “Women need security. Safety. What my sister didn’t have. What so many women human rights defenders don’t have.” 
Before she left Montreal, we asked Anielle how hopeful she is about seeing justice for her sister’s murder. With great certainty and conviction, Anielle said, “I am hopeful.” 
  
On March 14, 2018, as she was leaving an event she had organized on black women’s empowerment, human rights defender and politician Marielle Franco and her driver, Anderson Pedro Gomes, were shot dead in Rio de Janiero. Their murders are part of a pattern in Brazil, where at least 70 human rights defenders were killed in 2017. 
Evidence suggests the murder was carried out by skilled professionals, and experts said the bullets had belonged to the Federal Police. Brazil is one of the world’s deadliest countries for human rights defenders. Women human rights defenders from marginalized communities like Marielle often face a heightened risk of violence. 
Marielle was a young, black, bisexual women human rights defender. Despite the limited opportunities for women in Brazil, Marielle obtained a masters degree in public administration, spent a decade advocating for some of the most marginalized people in her community, and was elected to Rio de Janeiro city council in 2016. “Marielle embodied the rights she stood up for,” says her partner, Monica.

As a woman human rights defender, in most parts of the world, you as an individual are considered less worthy just because you’re a woman, an LGBTI person, or because you work on issues related to gender and sexuality. You’re more likely to be seen as not fitting in with social norms and expectations when raising your voice. And in your daily life, you’ll be at risk of violence, sexual attacks and harassment. You’ll be afraid of becoming the target of sexualized smears and of being judged by the value of your “honour” when you stand out. 
Add to that the daily grind of patriarchal oppression and inequality and you can begin to see the double whammy of being a women human rights defender. It comes as no surprise that as a consequence of these negative perceptions and difficult circumstances, women human rights defenders continue to be ignored, dismissed, and silenced.  
Their extremely courageous, cutting-edge work continues to be underrepresented and insufficiently recognized by mainstream society, policy-makers, and the media.

“This is a huge relief and goes some way to righting a wrong after Matthew’s grossly unfair trial. Now Matthew needs to be speedily released and allowed to return to the UK.
“Matthew should never have been jailed after such an unfair process, and he should never have been held in the miserable conditions of solitary confinement. A pardon doesn’t make up for this injustice.
“Today’s news is a tribute to the tireless efforts of Matthew’s wife Daniela, who has bravely pushed the UK Government into taking action.
“Matthew’s ordeal is a reminder that the UAE is a deeply repressive country which ruthlessly suppresses free speech and peaceful criticism, and we should spare a thought for Emirati prisoners of conscience like Ahmed Mansoor or Mohammed al-Roken who aren’t getting a pardon today.
“The scales will surely fall from the UK Government’s eyes now, with ministers and officials urgently reassessing the UK’s entire relationship with the UAE. We’d like to see a far more robust position from the UK in defence of human rights across the entire Gulf region.”
Seven-year-long crackdown
Since 2011, the UAE authorities have embarked on a ruthless crackdown targeting human rights defenders, judges, lawyers, academics, students and journalists, apparently designed to stamp out all dissent in the country. Many of those arrested have been subjected to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and unfair trials. As a result, critics and dissidents in the UAE are serving lengthy prison sentences simply for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression.
The UAE authorities regularly use criminal defamation, cyber and overly-broad anti-terrorism laws to detain, prosecute, convict and imprison government critics and prominent human rights defenders.
In addition to calling for justice for Matthew Hedges, Amnesty is campaigning for the release of the following prisoners of conscience in the UAE:
Ahmed Mansoor is a prominent human rights defender who received the prestigious Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. He has documented the human rights situation in the UAE since 2006. Up until his arrest in March 2017, Mansoor was the last remaining human rights defender in the UAE who had been able to criticise the authorities publicly. He was tried and convicted on charges including “insulting the status and prestige of the UAE and its symbols”, including its leaders, “publish[ing] false information to damage [the] UAE’s reputation abroad”, and “portray[ing] the UAE as a lawless land”. He was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment on 29 May this year.
Dr Mohammed al-Roken is a prominent human rights lawyer and former president of the UAE’s Jurists Association who was arrested in 2012. The following year he was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment following the grossly unfair trial of 94 reform advocates (known as the “UAE 94” trial). Many of the UAE 94 have alleged in court that they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated in pre-trial detention, where they were often held incommunicado for months in secret State Security detention facilities.
Osama al-Najjar was arrested in March 2014 and sentenced to three years in prison after sending tweets to the Minister of Interior expressing concern that his father (see below) had been ill-treated in prison. He was due for release from al-Razeen Prison in Abu Dhabi in March 2017, having fully served his prison sentence. However, the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court decided to extend his detention at the request of the Public Prosecution on the pretext that he remained a threat and therefore should be detained in the Counseling Center, another area within the prison.
Science teacher Hussain Ali al-Najjar al-Hammadi is Osama al-Najjar’s father. He was arrested on 16 July 2012. He was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment in the “UAE 94” trial, and to a further 15 months in the trial of 20 Egyptian and ten UAE nationals.
Dr Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment in March 2017 by the Federal Appeal Court in Abu Dhabi. He was tried and convicted on charges including “posting false information” about UAE leaders and their policies, based on comments he made on Twitter stating that he had not been given a fair trial in a 2011 case that included Ahmed Mansoor and three other Emiratis known as the “UAE 5” case. Dr Nasser bin Ghaith has also been convicted of “communicating and co-operating with members of the banned al-Islah organisation”, in connection with meetings he had with individuals allegedly linked to the organisation.

“The decision not to grant bail to Oyub Titiev once again demonstrates the political motivation of the case against him. He has committed no crime, having been jailed on completely fabricated drug charges, and must be released immediately and unconditionally.
“In today’s hearing, all the defence’s arguments were dismissed without any proper consideration while the court accepted every one of the prosecution’s objections to the bail request.
“This case is an affront to justice which highlights the Chechen government’s intolerance of opposing views and is further evidence that human rights defenders jailed in Chechnya cannot rely on the tools of justice to help them.”
Background
The Shali City Court today rejected Oyub Titiev’s bail request. The judge stated that the defence did not present enough evidence to mitigate the previous grounds for his arrest.
Oyub Titiev, the head of the Chechen office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre, has been detained since 9 January 2018 after police stopped him in his car. They said drugs had been “discovered” in the vehicle – a charge he has always denied.
Two days later, the Shali City Court ordered the pre-trial detention of Oyub Titiev. He faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of drug possession.
Members of Memorial have been repeatedly targeted by the Chechen authorities. In 2009, Memorial researcher Natalia Estemirova was abducted and killed on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia.

In a briefing released today, Amnesty International analyses rape legislation in 31 countries. It found that only 8 of these countries have consent-based definitions of rape, while the vast majority only recognize rape when physical violence, threat or coercion is involved.
“Although movements like #MeToo have inspired many women to speak out about their experiences, the sad fact is that rape remains hugely underreported in Europe. Women’s fear of not being believed is confirmed time and time again, as we see courageous survivors who do seek justice frequently failed by outdated and harmful definitions of rape in law and treated appallingly by justice officials,” said Anna Błuś, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Western Europe and Women’s Rights.
“Laws have the power to enable justice and influence attitudes. Time and again, surveys show that many people still believe it’s not rape when the victim is drunk, wearing revealing clothes or not physically fighting back. Sex without consent is rape, full stop. Until governments bring their legislations in line with this simple fact, the perpetrators of rape will continue to get away with their crimes.”
According to the most recent survey from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), one in 20 women in the EU has been raped since the age of 15 – about 9 million women. Despite these shocking statistics, few European countries treat this crime as seriously as they should in law.
Out of the 31 European countries covered in Amnesty’s briefing, only Ireland, the UK, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Iceland, Luxembourg and Sweden define rape as sex without consent. Sweden changed the definition only in the past few months, in response to years of campaigning by Amnesty and others.
The other countries mentioned in Amnesty’s research are: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland.  
These all have legal definitions of rape based on force, threat of force or coercion or the victim’s inability to defend themselves. Worryingly, some countries categorize sex without consent as a separate, lesser offence, sending a strong message to people that “real rape” only occurs when physical violence is used. For example, in Croatia, “sexual intercourse without consent” carries a maximum penalty of five years, as opposed to ten years for rape.
In some countries rape and sexual violence laws are still framed in terms of crimes related to “honour” or “morality”, supporting the idea that society has the right to control women’s bodies. In Malta, for example, sexual offences fall under the chapter of “crimes affecting the good order of families”.
Consent-based definitions of rape and legal reforms are not the ultimate solutions to addressing and preventing this ever-present crime, rather they are significant starting points.
Everyone, regardless of their gender, can be a victim of rape. However, it is a crime that disproportionately affects women and girls. 
As shown by the briefing, women’s attempts to seek justice for rape are hindered not only by outdated laws.  They also frequently face prejudice, victim blaming, negative stereotypes and myths, often coming from the very officials tasked with providing them support, investigating and prosecuting crimes of sexual violence.
A wave of change
On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Amnesty International is highlighting the determination, strength and courage of activists across Europe who are fighting against impunity for rape and pushing for changes to their country’s laws. Over the past year, women in many countries have come together to express their outrage about high profile rape cases and demand better protection from their governments.
In April, protests broke out in Spain after five men accused of the gang rape of a woman were found guilty of a lesser charge of sexual abuse due to the outdated law, despite the court finding that the woman had not consented to sex.
In recent days women in Ireland have been posting pictures of their underwear and tweeting #ThisIsNotConsent in solidarity with a 17-year-old girl whose thong was presented to the jury by the defence in a shocking bid to undermine her claim of rape. 
This Sunday, women in Denmark will protest in at least four different cities to demand change in legislation to ensure that sex without consent is rape.
Spain, Portugal and Denmark may be the next countries to change their legislation, with government officials publicly stating that they are open to discussing amendments to the legal definition of rape
“Rape is a grave human rights violation that should always be recognized as a serious crime,” said Anna Błuś.
“By changing the laws and ensuring the end of victim blaming and gender stereotypes in legal proceedings, European governments can ensure the next generations of women never question whether rape is their fault, and never doubt that the perpetrators will be punished. And ultimately, are better protected from rape.”

Shi’a public figures have been disproportionately targeted in the pre-election clampdown.
“Over the past two years, the crackdown in Bahrain has seen the political opposition detained, intimidated and silenced. We call on the authorities to stop this ongoing and escalating repression and to allow free expression of dissenting voices, including those who oppose the monarchy,” said Devin Kenney, Amnesty International’s Bahrain researcher.
“Bahrain’s international partners and allies cannot remain silent, and must use their influence to pressure the Bahraini authorities to adhere to the international standards they have committed to.”
Since mid-2016, the Bahraini authorities have embarked on a systematic campaign to eliminate organized political opposition in the country. The main targets of this far-reaching repression have been human rights defenders, journalists, political activists, Shi’a clerics and peaceful protesters. Political leaders from the majority Shi’a population have been disproportionately targeted throughout, and on the eve of the election there is not one Shi’a political leader of national stature left who has not been detained, imprisoned, or stripped of Bahraini nationality.
The authorities have extended already repressive legislation to exclude the political opposition in any form of civic or political participation.

“This progressive court ruling is a victory for the people of Xolobeni, who have long fought for their right to say no to mining on their ancestral land. The judgement sends a clear message that multinational mining companies cannot trample over people’s rights in the pursuit of profit. 
 “This judgement is not only a win for this community, but for communities across the country who are fighting to protect their land, heritage and culture.
“The government must take heed of the ruling and ensure that informed consent is sought from Indigenous peoples when granting future mining licenses.”
Background
A subsidiary of the Australian mining company MRC, Transworld Energy and Minerals (TEM), had applied for the right to mine titanium in the uMgungundlovu district on the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape province in 2008.
Villagers of Xolobeni in Pondoland formed the Amadiba Crisis Committee (ACC) in 2007 to challenge the mining project, arguing that it constituted a deprivation of their ancestral land which threatened to take away their history and livelihood.

Gregory Chifire’s verdict and sentencing are due to be delivered on 23 November following a grossly unfair trial on four trumped-up contempt of court charges.
“This trial is an affront to the right to freedom of expression. Gregory Chifire’s only ‘crime’ has been to ask the Zambian judiciary to ensure accountability within its ranks,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“The contempt of court charges against Gregory Chifire are a total fabrication. They make a mockery of justice and must be dropped immediately.”
The four contempt of court charges against Chifire, the director of the Southern Africa Network Against Corruption (SANAC), emanate from his questioning of a Supreme Court judgment handed down in March 2018 involving two large corporations.
The case involved a local bank, Stanbic, referring a local company, Savenda, to a credit bureau for blacklisting on allegations that it defaulted on a loan repayment. 
In a letter to Zambia’s chief justice, Gregory Chifire described the judgment as having “omitted very crucial evidence” that formed the basis for the awarding of damages to Savenda and asked for the judges suspected to be responsible to be investigated.
He was summoned to appear in court on 17 July and later faced an unfair trial. The hearing of his case was concluded on 19 September.
“The Zambian authorities should be supporting the free exercise of the right to freedom of expression, not supressing it. Gregory’s case smacks of censorship and victimisation, designed to silence his activism work,” said Deprose Muchena.

In response to official statements from...","The Trinidad and Tobago authorities must stop criminalizing the peaceful protest of migrants and refugees and find human rights-based solutions for them consistent with its existing obligations under international law, Amnesty International said today.
In response to official statements from Trinidad and Tobago’s Attorney General, Faris Al-Rawi, suggesting that the country was not yet legally required to establish systems for addressing the growing number of migrants and refugees reaching the Caribbean island, as it has not ratified the UN Refugee Convention, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:
“The Attorney General is mistaken in his understanding of Trinidad and Tobago’s obligations under international law. Having acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, the country is bound by international law to uphold the terms of these treaties. This means it must respect the fundamental human right to seek asylum and never return people to countries where their lives or freedom are at risk.”
The Attorney General made the statements after Trinidad and Tobago’s authorities reportedly arrested 78 Cuban asylum applicants and refugees, who had been peacefully protesting their human rights situation in the country outside the UN House in Port of Spain, reigniting debates on the growing number of migrants and refugees in the country.
According to news reports, the Cubans detained on 16 November were charged with obstruction of the free pass way under the Summary Offences Act and sentenced to two days in prison. When asked if Trinidad and Tobago was in discussions with the Cuban authorities to deport the Cubans, the Attorney General said the Minister of National Security was the lead on that issue.
Trinidad and Tobago is party to the the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, which the country acceded to in November 2000. As such, it is obliged to fully protect the rights of those in need of international protection. Although Trinidad and Tobago has not yet adopted national legislation to guide its treatment of people in need of international protection, it is a rule of customary international law that a state may not invoke the provisions of its internal law, or lack thereof, to justify its failure to uphold the terms of a treaty.
In 2014, Trinidad and Tobago’s cabinet adopted a national policy to address asylum and refugee matters. The policy states that recognized refugees should be entitled to a series of rights including travel documents, identity papers, authorization to work, and right to education. In practice, those who apply for asylum or are granted refugee status are not allowed to work, leaving many destitute, and they are not permitted to send their children to school. The Cubans arrested had been protesting this situation.
“By criminalizing migrants and refugees who were protesting the country’s very failure to uphold human rights, the authorities in Trinidad and Tobago are taking a short-sighted approach to the growing numbers of people reaching their shores in need of international protection,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Rather than locking up people who only want to rebuild their lives in safety, the authorities should build on the nation’s existing policy on asylum and refugees and put in place legislation to help it fulfil its existing obligations under international law.”
International law establishes that states must not return people to countries where their life or freedom would be threatened, or where they could be subject to torture or other human rights violations. Nevertheless, in April, Trinidad and Tobago deported over 80 Venezuelans, potentially in violation of international law.
Almost all states in Latin America have national legislation on refugees.
Background
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had registered 2,286 people of concern in Trinidad and Tobago at the end of 2017. The majority were Venezuelans, with Cubans representing the second largest group of asylum applicants.
Amnesty International has documented severe restrictions on the right to freedom of expression in Cuba for decades, while tens of thousands of Cubans have left their homeland in recent years. Amnesty International’s report, Your Mind is in Prison, published in 2017 and based on interviews with over 60 Cuban migrants, documents Cuba’s ongoing mechanisms of control over freedom of expression in the country and the risks faced by Cubans who dare to speak out.
In March, Amnesty International released Emergency Exit, which documented how violations of the right to health, as well as difficulties accessing food and other basic services, are putting thousands of people’s lives at risk in Venezuela and fuelling a regional forced migration crisis.
In September, Amnesty International published an open letter to regional governments calling on them and the international community to agree on urgent measures to guarantee the rights of Venezuelans needing international protection. It also issued a report detailing the failure of the Curaçao government to establish effective procedures for people seeking asylum in light of the growing number of Venezuelan nationals in need of international protection.

The government maintains a blanket ban on protests other than those organized by politicians close to outgoing President Joseph Kabila. Opposition supporters, as well as people calling for improvements to security and services, have faced threats, intimidation, harassment, arrests and violent dispersal often resulting in deaths and injuries.
“The authorities’ determination to silence dissent couldn’t be more evident through their ceaseless silencing of any kind of criticism or public demand, whether it touches on the country’s dire security situation, social grievances or the ongoing electoral process,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
On 15 November, two students from the University of Kinshasa died from gunshot wounds after police illegally used lethal force on campus to disperse students peacefully protesting an ongoing lecturers’ strike. Those who fired the shots have been arrested and charged in court, but officers higher up in the chain of command are yet to be held to account for deploying armed police officers to the university campus.
In August, five people were killed in Lubumbashi when they took to the streets after exiled opposition leader Moise Katumbi was barred from returning to the country to register as a presidential candidate.
“The authorities have shown outright bias and selectivity in allowing the ruling party’s public rallies while cracking down on dissent, rallies and protests by the opposition supporters and critics of the government,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
Since August 2018 when President Kabila made it clear he would uphold the constitution and not stand for a third term, Amnesty International has documented more than 150 arbitrary arrests and detentions countrywide, including of 28 youth activists in Kinshasa who allegedly questioned the credibility of the upcoming elections.
At least 50 of the arbitrarily arrested people were subject to prolonged detention, some were beaten. Two police officers were arrested and detained in September for two weeks for “passivity” and “violation of instructions from hierarchy” because they did not disperse a peaceful protest by activists of the Lutte pour le Changement (fight for change) – La LUCHA movement in Kananga, central DRC.
“The endemic display of heavy-handedness by the police to quell dissent and protests undermines and threatens the people’s freedom to exercise of human rights before, during and after the campaign and election period,” Joan Nyanyuki said.
The authorities must immediately lift the blanket ban on public gatherings and allow everyone to peacefully organize and attend meetings and rallies without interference.
The government must also immediately release all people arbitrarily detained simply for peacefully protesting including four Filimbi activists who have been in detention since December 2017 and seven Les Congolais Debout activists, held incommunicado since September 2018. Political and pro-democracy activists who are in exile must be allowed to return to the country and continue their activities.
Amnesty International also calls on the government to ensure the internet and social media will not in any way be disrupted and that journalists can do their work unhindered.
“We are concerned that the government has effected the July 2017 requirement for foreign correspondents to seek accreditation each time they want to travel to parts of the country other than where they were originally accredited. This requirement is a serious infringement on press freedom and must be scrapped immediately,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
“Both national and foreign journalists must be able to freely move within DRC to promptly cover events of public interest without having to get permission each time.”
The government must make every effort to guarantee security during the campaigns and elections and hold to account anyone suspected to be responsible for human rights violations.
The UN peacekeeping forces must also proactively play their part in protecting civilians from any harm, be it from government or rebel forces, as mandated by the UN Security Council.
Background
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will hold its long overdue presidential, parliamentary and provincial elections on 23 December 2018, more than two years late. The elections were initially scheduled for November 2016.
Over 40 million people have been registered to vote for more than 15,000 candidates who will contest 500 seats in the National Assembly, and more than 19,000 candidates for the country’s 26 provincial assembly seats.
Official campaigns kick-off on 22 November running up to 21 December.
The upcoming elections have been marked with controversy and protests over ‘the independence of the Independent Electoral Commission (CENI), the use of electronic voting machines and the voters’ roll’, which was audited by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) revealing six million voters without fingerprints.
President Joseph Kabila, whose term officially ended in 2016, remained in office announcing in August that he would not be standing in the forthcoming elections, picking former interior minister Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary as his party’s presidential candidate.

“Mathew Hedges must be afforded his right to fair trial proceedings; otherwise, the UAE has no right to hold him and he should be released without delay.

“Human rights defenders, political critics, and even Emirati judges and lawyers have all been convicted in the kind of sham proceedings to which Mr Hedges has just been subjected.”

Singapore police yesterday raided the home of Terry Xu, editor-in-chief of The Online Citizen (TOC) news site, and seized all his electronic equipment. Police informed him he was being investigated for criminal defamation over an article published on his website on 4 September. Authorities have also threatened action against the alleged author of the article, Willy Sum.
“The targeting of Terry Xu and Willy Sum is a callous attempt by the authorities to silence and punish peaceful dissent. They are being persecuted solely for daring to publish content critical of the Singapore government,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s East and South East Asia and the Pacific Regional Director.
“This is the latest example of the authorities coming down hard on independent media outlets who refuse to toe the line by publishing social and political views. The crackdown on freedom of expression in Singapore must end now, starting with these malicious charges against Terry Xu being dropped.”
The government’s response to the article, which alleged “corruption at the highest echelons” in Singapore, is the latest in a series of attacks on independent media reporting.
In mid-November at least one other individual, Leong Sze Hian, was threatened with defamation charges unless he publicly apologized for sharing a critical article on his personal Facebook profile.
Tuesday’s raids follow a police report filed against the TOC, one of the few independent political news sites in the country, by the government’s Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA).
An IMDA spokesman said: “The Online Citizen article ‘The take away from Seah Kian Ping’s Facebook post’ made serious allegations that undermine the public’s confidence in the Government’s integrity”.
Terry Xu’s desktop computer, mobile devices and laptops were all seized at his home by five police officers. He was subsequently taken to the police station and interrogated until 11pm on Tuesday night.
He is being investigated for criminal defamation under Section 21 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code Chapter 68.
Willy Sum has also reportedly had his electronic equipment seized by police but has not yet been interrogated. The article has since been removed from TOC website.
Attacks on the press and individuals by the Singaporean authorities have increased since the alternative news site States Times Review published an article linking Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) corruption scandal.
The government has also increased its censorship of other news outlets that are critical of the authorities.

Project Ploughshares, the Rideau Institute, Oxfam-Québec, Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East and Amnesty International will testify before the Senate on Bill C-47, legislation that prepares Canada for accession to the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), starting Wednesday, November 21.
While joining the ATT is a positive step for Canada, Bill C-47 is deeply flawed and fails to comply with the treaty’s essential objective to “establish the highest possible common international standards” for regulating the arms trade.
The numerous shortcomings under Bill C-47 leave glaring loopholes in the country’s export permit process, as outlined in a briefing document that has been presented to Senators. Those include: 
The failure to require that all USdestined military goods and technology require export control permits. Under the current Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA), only a small number of US-destined military goods require these permits. That means the majority of Canada’s military exports remain unregulated.
A provision exempting the Department of National Defence from the EIPA. This could create different, possibly contradictory, standards and outcomes on arms exports.
The omission of the Canadian Commercial Crown Corporation, which plays a central role in exporting Canadian military goods, especially to the United States.
A lack of any provision that limits confidentiality and ensures transparency around future arms contracts. With respect to the Saudi arms deal, we are told by the Government of Canada that the contract mandates a level of secrecy that is far beyond the normal bounds of commercial confidentiality. This level of secrecy severely undermines core principles of transparency and accountability, which underpin the ATT.
A lack of oversight on future arms trade regulations. To better ensure proposed regulations fulfill ATT obligations, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development (FAAE) should establish procedures for mandatory parliamentary review of such regulations in advance of implementation. 
The brutal murder of Jamal Khashoggi – and the renewed attention to Saudi Arabia’s responsibility for extensive war crimes in Yemen – has underscored the importance of preventing similar future arms deals.   
It is particularly crucial that Bill C-47 be strengthened to ensure that arms exports to the US do not in turn lead to Canadian weapons, parts or components being further transferred on to countries where there is a serious risk they will be used to commit grave human rights violations, thus safeguarding against the risk of Canada becoming complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Quotes
“The Arms Trade Treaty calls for the ‘highest possible common international standards.’ Yet Canada’s arrangement with the United States neither constitutes the highest possible standard nor is it consistent with the standards applied to others.”
– Cesar Jaramillo, Executive Director of Project Ploughshares
“The international Arms Trade Treaty is finally a chance for Canada and its allies to collectively say ‘no’ to arms sales to the most repressive governments of the world. Nevertheless, if C-47 passes in the Senate without amendment, Canada will accede to the ATT in name only. A failure by Canada to live up to the vision and intents of the ATT will result in incalculable misery and suffering around the world, especially in the Middle East, where there is already evidence of Canadian arms being used to commit human rights abuses.”
– Thomas Woodley, President of Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East
“In order for arms control reforms to truly ensure that Canada is compliant with the crucial obligations in the Arms Trade Treaty, it is imperative that Bill C-47 bring scrutiny and legal responsibility to all departments and agencies involved in negotiating, concluding and authorizing arms deals and contracts.  That is presently not the case. Crucially, the Canadian Commercial Corporation remains outside of current arms control procedures and this is not addressed by Bill C-47.  The deal to sell light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia and the now-abandoned contract to sell military helicopters to the Duterte government in the Philippines make it clear that the CCC has a central place in the Canadian arms industry. They must be subject to the obligations and expectations laid out in Bill C-47.”
– Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada
“Whenever the pressure builds to stop Canada’s unconscionable arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, we are told by the Government of Canada that some secret provision of the contract makes such action impossible. This level of secrecy – which is far beyond the normal bounds of commercial confidentiality – severely undermines transparency and accountability – core principles of the ATT and of democracy itself. “
– Peggy Mason, President of the Rideau Institute
“Transparency and parliamentary scrutiny are essential components of effective arms trade controls and oversight of arms sales is a job for Parliament. So we are strongly recommending the creation of a subcommittee empowered to examine all aspects of Canada’s arms exports procedures and policies, and also Canada’s role in international arms control agreements. Polls have showed that most Canadians disapprove of arms deals with human rights abusers. However, details on Canadian arms exports remain limited. A subcommittee would ensure oversight and increased transparency for Canadians on important imperatives such as arms sales to countries with dubious human rights records.”

0,Syria: Thousands of digital activists to track how US-led air strikes destroyed Raqqa,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/syria-thousands-of-digital-activists-to-track-how-us-led-air-strikes-destroyed-raqqa/,"Thousands of digital activists around the world will take part in an innovative new crowdsourcing data project Amnesty International is launching today, which uses satellite imagery to help plot how the US-led military coalition’s bombings destroyed almost 80% of the Syrian city of Raqqa....","Thousands of digital activists around the world will take part in an innovative new crowdsourcing data project Amnesty International is launching today, which uses satellite imagery to help plot how the US-led military coalition’s bombings destroyed almost 80% of the Syrian city of Raqqa.
“Strike Tracker” is the next phase of an in-depth Amnesty International investigation, in partnership with Airwars, into the shocking scale of civilian casualties resulting from four months of US, UK and French bombardment to oust the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS) from Raqqa.
Amnesty International’s field investigations and analysis since the battle ended in October 2017 presented compelling evidence of apparent violations of international humanitarian law (the laws of war) by the US-led Coalition. They prompted the Coalition to revise its civilian death toll statistics upwards from 23 to more than 100 – a 300% increase.
“Based on our meticulous on-the-ground investigations, hundreds of interviews amid the rubble of Raqqa, and expert military and geospatial analysis, we’ve been able to push the US-led coalition to admit to almost every civilian death case we’ve documented so far. But with bodies still being recovered from the wreckage and mass graves more than a year later, this is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Milena Marin, Senior Adviser for Tactical Research on Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team.
“There is a mountain of evidence left to sift through, and the scale of the civilian devastation is simply too large for us to do this alone. With thousands of ‘Strike Trackers’ on the case to help us narrow down precisely when and where Coalition air and artillery strikes destroyed buildings, we can significantly scale up our ability to map out the apocalyptic destruction in Raqqa.”
How it works
“Strike Tracker” will allow anybody with a mobile phone or laptop to contribute to Amnesty International’s vital research into the pattern of civilian devastation – including potential violations of the laws of war – that the Coalition has been unable or unwilling to acknowledge so far.
UN data shows that more than 10,000 buildings in Raqqa were destroyed or damaged over the course of the battle in 2017. “Strike Tracker” will help to narrow down the timeframe of the destruction of each of these from months to weeks – or even days. Volunteers will track a building across a timeline of satellite images during the battle, looking for changes and marking the dates before and after the building’s destruction.
It is expected that anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 digital activists will get involved in the month-long project. To ensure data quality, the aim is to have each destroyed building analysed multiple times by multiple trackers.
What happens next? 
The results of “Strike Tracker” will contribute to Amnesty International’s wider efforts to: 
raise awareness of the devastating impact on civilians trapped in Raqqa during the battle;
move the US-led Coalition’s position on civilian casualties from ongoing denial to accepting greater responsibility and carrying out meaningful investigations; and
assist and empower victims’ families and survivors to seek justice and reparation. 
In a September 2018 letter to Amnesty International, the US Department of Defense – whose forces carried out most of the air strikes and all the artillery strikes on Raqqa – made clear it accepts no liability for the hundreds of civilian casualties it caused. The Coalition does not plan to compensate survivors and relatives of those killed in Raqqa and refuses to provide further information about the circumstances behind the strikes.
“The Coalition’s blatant denials and shoulder-shrugging are unconscionable – their military offensive killed and maimed hundreds of civilians and then left the survivors to pick up the pieces,” said Milena Marin.
“The data we glean from ‘Strike Tracker’ will take us one step closer to establishing the staggering scale of civilian casualties and will build on the legal obligation, as well as the moral imperative, for the Coalition to take full responsibility for its actions. It must acknowledge and properly investigate these cases once and for all, paving the way for justice and reparation.”
Amnesty International and Airwars will publicize the results of “Strike Tracker” as part of an interactive digital platform in early 2019.
Background on Decoders
“Strike Tracker” is the latest in a series of Amnesty International crowdsourcing data projects called Decoders. Since Decoders launched in June 2016, Amnesty International has successfully completed four projects, mobilizing more than 50,000 digital activists from 150 countries. The volunteers sifted through huge volumes of data, processing more than 1.5 million tasks. They helped Amnesty International researchers to analyse the success of urgent action campaigns; detect destroyed villages in remote Darfur; hold oil companies to account for thousands of oil spills in Nigeria; and analyse tweets to detect online abuse and threats against women.

Azerbaijani police detained prominent opposition leaders and activists for attempting to organize what the authorities call an “unauthorised demonstration”. According to Amnesty International’s sources in Azerbaijan, police started to detain individuals as the opposition leaders began to organise a peaceful procession that included laying flowers at the Alley of Martyrs. The Alley of Martyrs is a national cemetery and memorial near Baku dedicated to those who lost their lives when Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union and during the war in Nagorno-Karabakh (the breakaway region of Azerbaijan supported by Armenia).
Forty-one participants of the peaceful assembly were initially detained and all but 11 were released shortly thereafter. After two days of incommunicado detention, eight detainees, including a prominent opposition leader, Ali Karimli from the Popular Front Party, were fined for organizing and/or participating in the “unauthorised demonstration” and released. The fines ranged from 400 (USD 230) to 2500 (USD 1460) Manat. The remaining three activists were still detained on 19 November. According to information available to Amnesty International, they are to spend 20 days under “administrative detention” for participating in the “unauthorised demonstration”.
Azerbaijan’s Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of peaceful assembly; however, other legislation tightly regulates public assemblies, and local municipalities often refuse permission for peaceful demonstrations organized by the opposition, particularly in the capital Baku. Police often use excessive force to disperse peaceful demonstrations.
Azerbaijani authorities must guarantee the right to freedom of peaceful assembly as recognised by the Azerbaijani constitution and the international human rights treaties that have been ratified by Azerbaijan. The authorities must immediately release the remaining activists who have been placed under “administrative detention” for their attempt to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly.
Background information
For years, Amnesty International has been reporting violations of human rights in Azerbaijan. The rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly have been severely restricted and many of the journalists, human rights defenders and other activists who tried to exercise these rights have faced harassment, prosecution under false charges and imprisonment following unfair trials. According to Azerbaijani human rights defenders, in 2017, more than a hundred individuals remained in prison following arrest under politically motivated charges, and the number of such cases continues to grow. This practise has repercussions throughout civil society, creating a climate of fear and self-censorship.
As the arrests and politically motivated prosecution of critics continue unabated, Azerbaijan remains closed to human rights scrutiny with many of the violations happening behind closed doors. International human rights monitors, including Amnesty International, continue to be denied access to the country.

“This sickening attack once again lays bare the growing risks to civilians in Afghanistan, where a record number of civilians were killed in the first half of 2018 – many of them children.
“Any attack in which civilians are deliberately targeted constitutes a war crime under international law, yet those killed in Kabul today will merely become another statistic.
“Armed groups must immediately halt all attacks targeting civilians and indiscriminate attacks, while the Afghan government must make the protection of civilian lives its absolute priority.
“This attack also once again highlights the irresponsibility of countries in the European Union who claim Afghanistan is a safe place for refugees and asylum seekers to be returned to.”
No one has yet admitted responsibility for the blast.
According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), a total of 1,692 civilians were killed between January 1 and June 30 this year, marking the highest figure for civilian casualties recorded by the UN body.

On 22 November 2018, Egypt’s State Information Service issued a press release in response to Amnesty International’s findings denying that any violations against children have taken place. It stated that Amnesty International’s information was “not based on well-grounded sources” and did not provide “reliable evidence” to validate its claims of torture and enforced disappearance, arguing that it had complied with Egyptian and international law. On 3 December 2018, Amnesty International published a letter addressed to the Egyptian authorities rebutting these claims, reiterating its conclusion that the authorities have violated children’s rights under international and Egyptian law. Amnesty International urged the authorities to investigate the cases raised instead of making fictional claims of a “politicized smear campaign” aiming to damage the image of the Egyptian state locally and abroad. The organization also highlighted that it is human rights violations committed with impunity that harm children and damage Egypt’s image, not the work of human rights organizations uncovering such violations.
**Original text follows**
The Egyptian authorities have committed shocking violations against children since 2013, with at least six tortured in custody and 12 subjected to enforced disappearances since 2015, according to new findings published by Amnesty International today.
The information, gathered by Amnesty International and the Egyptian Front for Human Rights, has been released today to mark the World Children’s Day.
“These findings reveal how Egyptian authorities have subjected children to horrific violations including torture, prolonged solitary confinement and enforced disappearance for periods of up to sev­­en months, demonstrating an absolutely shameful disregard for children’s rights,” said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. 
“It is particularly outrageous that Egypt, as a signatory to the UN Convention on the rights of the child, is breaching the rights of children so flagrantly.”
The families of six children who were subjected to torture, interviewed by Amnesty International and the Egyptian Front for Human Rights, said that during detention they were severely beaten, given electric shocks on their genitalia and other parts of their body or suspended by their limbs.
In some cases, the children said they were tortured in order to “confess” to offenses that they did not commit.
Aser Mohamed was forcibly disappeared in January 2016 at the age of 14, where he was held incommunicado for 35 days and tortured in order to “confess” to “membership in a terrorist group” and attacking a hotel, offenses that he says he did not commit. He is now facing a trial along with adults which could see him sentenced to jail.
Abdallah Boumidan was 12 years old when he was arrested in December 2017 by the Egyptian military in Arish City in Northern Sinai, then forcibly disappeared and tortured. He was held incommunicado for seven months before being charged with “membership of a terrorist group” and transferred to solitary confinement, where his medical situation severely deteriorated.
Egyptian authorities have also imprisoned children alongside adults in violation of international human rights law. In some cases, they were also held in overcrowded cells and denied sufficient food. In at least two cases children were held in prolonged solitary confinement. 
Children have also been subjected to unfair trials – some in front of military courts – by being questioned without their lawyers and legal guardians present, being charged on the basis of “confessions” extracted through torture and being kept in prolonged pre-trial detention for periods of up to four years. At least three children were sentenced to death following unfair mass trials in three different trials. Two of these sentences were later overturned, while another is still pending appeal. 
Under international law arrest should only be used as a last resort for children. Both Egyptian and international law require children to be tried in front of special juvenile courts. However, Egyptian law allows for trying children 15 or older alongside adults, including in military courts and State Security courts. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for all states to try people accused of committing criminal offences when they were less than 18 in juvenile courts.
“Instead of brazenly violating children’s rights the Egyptian authorities must release all children that are arbitrarily detained. The authorities must also quash any sentences issued to children in adult courts or after unfair trials and retry these children in juvenile courts,” said Najia Bounaim.
“Any allegations of torture or enforced disappearance must be investigated and those responsible must be brought to justice.”

“This ruling is a temporary relief for thousands of families and reaffirms our responsibility to protect human rights. People who are fleeing violence and persecution have the right to seek safety. These are people just like you and me, except they are running for their lives. We must not abandon mothers, fathers, and children who have lost everything and are trying to rebuild their lives.”
Last month, Amnesty International released a report finding that U.S. border authorities regularly violated both domestic and international law by turning away asylum-seekers at the border without registering or determining their claims, even at ports of entry.

“This ruling by Europe’s top human rights court should have far-reaching implications within the country where civil society actors are routinely remanded in prolonged pre-trial detention under trumped up charges. It exposes the pernicious and undue influence of politics in Turkey’s broken judicial system, in which the peaceful expression of opinions and political dissent are punished through the courts.
“As a member state of the Council of Europe, Turkey is bound by the Court’s rulings. The authorities must implement the Court’s decision and immediately release Selahattin Demirtaş from his prolonged and unlawful pre-trial detention.”

Background  
This judgement is the first ever finding of a violation of Article 18 (limitation on use of restrictions on rights) against Turkey. The Court made this finding in conjunction with its finding that Turkey violated Article 5(3) of the Convention (right to be tried within a reasonable time).
Selahattin Demirtaş, the former co-chair of the opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP), has been held in pre-trial detention for more than two years.   
The Court’s ruling established that extensions to Selahattin Demirtaş’ pre-trial detention were not only wrong but pursued with the purpose of stifling pluralism and limiting freedom of political debate, a first in a case against Turkey. 
The Court ordered the Turkish government to “take all necessary measures to put an end to the applicant’s pre-trial detention” at the earliest possible date and considered that “any continuation of Mr Demirtaş’s pre-trial detention would entail a prolongation of the violation of Article 5(3) and Article 18 of the Convention and a breach of the obligations on respondent States to abide by the Court’s judgment.”

According to three separate testimonies obtained by the organization, the activists were repeatedly tortured by electrocution and flogging, leaving some unable to walk or stand properly. In one reported instance, one of the activists was made to hang from the ceiling, and according to another testimony, one of the detained women was reportedly subjected to sexual harassment, by interrogators wearing face masks.
“Only a few weeks after the ruthless killing of Jamal Khashoggi, these shocking reports of torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, if verified, expose further outrageous human rights violations by the Saudi authorities” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East research director.
“Saudi authorities are directly responsible for the wellbeing of these women and men in detention. Not only have they deprived them of their liberty for months now, simply for peacefully expressing their views, they are also subjecting them to horrendous physical suffering”.
According to the testimonies obtained, the human rights defenders were unable to walk or stand properly, had uncontrolled shaking of the hands, and marks on the body. One of the activists reportedly attempted to take her own life repeatedly inside the prison.
Prison authorities in Dhahban Prison have also reportedly warned detained activists against disclosing any accounts of torture or prison procedures to family members.
“The Saudi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release detained human rights defenders who are being held solely for their peaceful human rights work and launch a prompt, thorough and effective investigation into the reports of torture and other ill-treatment with the view of holding those responsible to account,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Torture and other ill-treatment in Saudi Arabian prisons and detention centers have been routinely and widely reported in past years, in violation of its obligations under international law including the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.
Many detainees have reported during trials that torture was used to extract “confessions” from them, to punish them for refusing to “repent” or to force them to promise not to criticize the government. Such “confessions” have furthermore routinely formed the basis for harsh sentences, including the death penalty, without the judiciary taking any steps to duly investigate these claims.
Several activists who were arbitrarily detained in the May crackdown, including the women human rights defenders, remain in detention without charge and with no legal representation. They were detained incommunicado and in solitary confinement for the first three months of their detention.
Those detained in Dhahban Prison include Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Mohammad al-Rabe’a and Dr Ibrahim al-Modeimigh.
Several other activists were detained in the ensuing months and remain in detention without charge. These include women’s rights activists Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahran, as well as activists who had already been persecuted for their human rights work in the past, such as Mohammed al-Bajadi and Khalid al-Omeir, as well as Hatoon al-Fassi, a prominent women’s rights activist and academic, was also reportedly detained shortly after the lifting of the driving ban. Last week, Hatoon al-Fassi recieved the Middle East Studies Association Academic Freedom Award, which was awarded in her absence at the association’s annual meeting.
“The international community must take substantive measures to put pressure on Saudi Arabia to immediately and unconditionally release all those jailed for peacefully exercising their human rights,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Activists report that many others, including other women’s rights activists, have also been detained since the crackdown in May; however, the escalated crackdown on dissenting voices has had a chilling effect on freedom of expression in the country, intensifying an already existing environment of fear for people to report on arrests and other violations.

While the Canadian government...","On November 20, Amnesty International will appear before the United Nations Committee Against Torture (CAT) in Geneva, highlighting ongoing and new concerns that Canada is falling short of its international obligations to prevent and address torture and ill-treatment.
While the Canadian government has taken a number of positive steps since its last review before the UN CAT in May 2012, there is still much to be done to strengthen laws, policies and other measures so as to fully implement the prohibition against torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.
In a written submission and oral presentation to the Committee, Amnesty International is highlighting numerous concerns regarding Canada’s shortcomings with respect to torture and ill-treatment, including violence against Indigenous women and girls, coerced or forced sterilization of Indigenous women, policing of Indigenous protests, redress for survivors of torture, refugee protection, immigration detention and solitary confinement.
“The prohibition against torture is an essential human rights safeguard, which allows no exception in any circumstances. Canada regularly professes its strong support for global efforts to eradicate torture and must back that up with scrupulous determination to both ensure it does not occur within the country and that Canadian actions do not contribute to its commission abroad,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “It is not enough to avoid carrying out torture directly, Canada must avoid complicity in torture in other countries. There is more to be done on both fronts.”
Amnesty International is calling on the UN CAT to make the following recommendations to Canada: 
Develop a National Action Plan to prevent and address genderbased violence, including provisions that recognize and address disproportionate rates of violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.
Ensure that recent, deeply troubling instances of forced or coerced sterilizations of Indigenous women in Canada are investigated, justice is provided to survivors and their families, and all government policies across Canada are reformed to explicitly prohibit sterilization without free, full and informed consent.
Conduct an independent investigation into the Ontario Provincial Police’s illtreatment of five Mohawk men who were detained and unlawfully held in painful nylon restraints for hours, following protests at Tyendinaga, Ontario in April 2008. Their mistreatment has been documented in a report by the Toronto Star.
Promptly provide fair reparations, including compensation and an official apology, to Abousfian Abdelrazik for the role Canadian officials played in the circumstances leading to the torture and other serious human rights violations he suffered in Sudan between 2003 and 2009. The Canadian government has, to date, delayed and obstructed Abdelrazik’s effort to obtain the redress to which he is entitled under international law.
Rescind or suspend the application of the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States, unless and until the treatment of refugees and migrants in the United States meets international human rights standards, including the absolute ban on torture and illtreatment.
Enforce the absolute prohibition on deporting individuals to countries where they face a serious risk of torture, including in the case of Mohamed Harkat.
Build on important advances in reducing the use of immigration detention by setting a maximum time limit so as to avoid the possibility of individuals being indefinitely detained for immigration purposes.
Amend the recent proposal to reform Canada’s system of solitary confinement (previously termed “administrative segregation”) through the institution of newly created “structured intervention units” so as to meet international human rights requirements, including ensuring this practice is not used disproportionately against Indigenous prisoners, is never used against people with mental health illnesses, is strictly timelimited and is subject to independent oversight. 
“One long overdue step forward for Canada is to finally become party to the torture-prevention scheme of prison inspections established by the UN in 2002 through the Convention against Torture’s Optional Protocol,” said Andréanne Paquet, directrice générale par interim, Amnistie international Canada. “In May 2016, the Trudeau government made a public commitment to join the Optional Protocol, but two and a half years later that has not happened, and the government has more recently equivocated in its commitment. Canada cannot press other nations – where torture is rampant – to open their prisons to scrutiny, unless and until we take that step ourselves.”
Amnesty International is also disappointed the Canadian government continues to maintain that violence by non-state actors, including violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people in Canada, should not be considered to be torture under the UN Convention against Torture. The government argues that “acquiescence” for the purposes of the UN definition of torture should be interpreted very narrowly and rejects the due diligence framework for preventing and addressing torture by private actors, adopted by the UN CAT over ten years ago.
“It is concerning that the Trudeau government, with a strongly professed feminist commitment to addressing violence against Indigenous women, would hold the troubling position that government failure to assert due diligence in preventing violence by private actors is not the relevant test for defining torture,” highlighted Alex Neve. “The UN CAT rejected Canada’s problematic and outdated view in 2012 and took a strong stand against the entrenched, longstanding violence experienced by Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. Amnesty International calls on the Committee to again dismiss Canada’s efforts to undermine the advances that have been made in recognizing that gender-based violence can and often does amount to torture.”

Alisa, to say you’ve had a busy week is an understatement. A week ago, before this story broke, how well known was it in Canada that Indigenous women continue to have tubal litigations without consenting to the procedure? 
Media reports in 2015 out of Saskatchewan highlighted several cases. Following those reports, which the government initially sought to ignore, the Saskatoon Regional Health Authority (SRHA) commissioned an external review. The report resulting from the external review identified over a dozen cases, confirmed the ongoing practice of forced sterilization and found that “pervasive structural discrimination and racism….remains unmistakable” within the regional health care system. The Report points to the likelihood that the practice occurs throughout Canada as a result of the imprints and vestiges of eugenics ideology and legislation.  The report brought some nation-wide media attention last year. 
So I’d say the issue has been in the public domain for a number of years now, but not much has been done to address it.  
And what happened in the past week to change the level of awareness amongst the general public in Canada? 
A swell of media attention has resulted in some public education on the issue. Senator Dr. Yvonne Boyer, who was one of the authors of the external review, has been making public statements on the issue that helped propel the media attention. Whether the general public in Canada is now truly aware will be, in our view, measured against meaningful and concrete actions to provide the survivors of forced sterilizations with justice, prevent the practice using legislative and policy reforms including criminalization, education of the profession regarding the legal requirements of consent, awareness among the general population. Overall, the fabric of the healthcare system must be entrenched in values, policies and legislation that empower human dignity and bodily-autonomy. 
We have seen comments from the general public this week wondering who is being sterilized and why. For people not familiar with the issue, can you please explain it? 
Most of the women we have spoken with have been in Saskatchewan, though more and more are coming forward from different areas. All report that they have been sterilized by medical professionals – usually having their “tubes tied”, which may mean their fallopian tubes were cut and cauterized, tied or clamped – without proper and informed consent. All are Indigenous. 
To get technical, sterilization refers to the practice of surgically, permanently removing a person’s ability to reproduce. It is irreversible and designed to prevent future pregnancies. It is never considered an emergency procedure; there is no medically valid reason to rush a woman to consent, or to force a woman to consent to unwanted sterilization at all. 
Forced sterilization is when the patient has not given her prior, full, free, and informed consent. It may involve not seeking a woman’s consent at all. Or consent may be sought through coercive means, through undue pressure, without providing the time or information necessary for the patient to come to a proper and informed decision, or by misrepresenting the procedure and the patient’s health risks. Additionally, consent may not be considered freely given when a patient is in a particularly stressful state, such as labor or delivery. A patient may revoke consent. 
Our team has personally spoken with over 60 Indigenous women who have reported this experience. Since the matter gained public attention this week, many additional women affected by the issue have contacted us to share their stories.  
We have also heard people wondering how this practice has been allowed to continue until now. 
Systemic and institutional racism and discrimination negatively affect the quality of health care available to Indigenous Peoples. No concrete and effective measures have been taken by the institutions delivering reproductive health care to Indigenous women to prevent, protect against and remedy this terrible practice. 
What are you calling on various levels of government to do to end sterilizations without consent? 
Investigate, prevent, protect and remedy. 
Alisa, you are headed to Geneva, Switzerland next week for Canada’s review before the Committee Against Torture. What are you hoping to accomplish in Geneva? 
Forced sterilization is a violation of various human rights that Canada is bound by law to uphold. It constitutes cruel and ill treatment, and thus violates the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The Committee against Torture reviews Canada’s performance of its obligations under this Convention, and we hope to raise the issue with it and to put pressure on Canada to act to fulfill its international obligations. 
We have raised the issue with several human rights bodies in order to shine a light on the practice and to amplify the courageous voices of our clients, the survivors of forced sterilization, to humanize their lived experience, to humanize their pain and suffering so that those who can prevent it, protect them, and remedy it through meaningful restitution, do so immediately. 
You may be traveling around the world, but you are doing so on behalf of the 60+ survivors you represent. What solidarity and action are they wanting to see from people across Canada? 
Support, kindness, empathy and understanding for their need to obtain justice in the form of remedies, prevention and protection. 
Fast forward to a year from now. If your advocacy is successful, what change will we have seen a year from now?  
First and foremost, that this practice will have stopped. Preventative measures will be in place to ensure the health and safety of Indigenous women seeking and obtaining reproductive health care. And my clients will be receiving the support that they need and deserve. 
How can Amnesty supporters advocate alongside you and the women you represent to ensure awareness of this practice becomes well known, action is taken to end it, and that survivors and their families receive justice? 
Care for the wellbeing of Indigenous women, their families and communities, as you would your very own. We represent mothers, grandmothers, daughters, sisters and aunties. Everyone has them.

The South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, is currently the largest immigration detention center in the United States, holding hundreds of families. The capacity for the Center is now at 2,400 beds. Seven-year-old Mario is one of the children that remains behind bars at Dilley after being separated from his mother, Andrea, for 73 days for seeking safety. They left Guatemala after years of being targeted because they belong to the Q’eqchi Indigenous group.
Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, stated:
“World Children’s Day should be a day for every child to claim their rights. All children deserve to be safe and protected, to live with their parents and their families, and to have their voices heard. Instead, this World Children’s Day, children are locked up behind bars in the United States with their families, indefinitely, in fear of what will happen to them next.
“What the US government is doing is abhorrent. It could release these families while they pursue their asylum claims, but instead it has chosen to lock up children with their parents, simply for exercising their human rights and seeking asylum.
“The United States has failed to protect children’s rights, refusing to do what is best for children while it continues to pursue cruel policies of hate and demonization.”
Background:
World Children’s Day is the 1959 Day the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. It is also the date in 1989 it adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which guarantees children’s rights around the world.
Amnesty International is partnering with the American Immigration Council, American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the Dilley Pro Bono Project to call on ICE to release the dozens of families currently in prolonged detention at Dilley.
Many of the families held at Dilley come from a region known as the Northern Triangle of Central America which includes El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. The Northern Triangle is an area widely recognized for extreme levels of violence and insecurity, which Amnesty has documented extensively.
On October 26, Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, visited an unaccompanied children’s camp in Tornillo, Texas, which currently holds over 1,100 children.

0,UAE: End relentless crackdown on critics ahead of Abu Dhabi Grand Prix,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uae-end-relentless-crackdown-on-critics-ahead-of-abu-dhabi-grand-prix/,"Ahead of the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand-Prix, which is set to take place between 23 and 25 November, the authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) must step up to the modern image they want to project and unconditionally release all those who have been detained solely for peacefully...","Ahead of the Abu Dhabi Formula One Grand-Prix, which is set to take place between 23 and 25 November, the authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) must step up to the modern image they want to project and unconditionally release all those who have been detained solely for peacefully criticizing the government.
“As the world tunes in to watch the final race of the Formula One Grand-Prix season and attend glitzy music concerts, they should know that the UAE authorities have also been racing to silence critics and human rights defenders,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Campaigns Director.
Since 2011, the UAE authorities have embarked on a ruthless crackdown targeting human rights defenders, judges, lawyers, academics, students and journalists, in their efforts to stamp out dissent in the country. Many have been subjected to arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and unfair trials. As a result, critics and dissidents in the UAE are serving lengthy prison sentences simply for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression.
“Today, we call on Formula One Grand-Prix drivers, teams and performers to be the champions of human rights on the circuit and on the entertainment stage. They should be the voice of those who have been silenced and unfairly detained.
“We urge racing teams and performers to call on the UAE authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience who have been detained solely for peacefully criticizing the authorities, or for calling for respect for human rights.”
Background
The UAE authorities regularly use criminal defamation, cyber and overly broad anti-terrorism laws to detain, prosecute, convict and imprison government critics and prominent human rights defenders.
Abu Dhabi is also bidding to be crowned the World Capital of Sports in 2019, having qualified for the final stages of the competition. The award is recognized by the European Parliament and the UN, as well as by different European sports agencies.
Amnesty International is campaigning for the release of the following prisoners of conscience in the UAE:
Ahmed Mansoor is a prominent human rights defender who received the prestigious Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2015. He has documented the human rights situation in the UAE since 2006 and has publicly spoken out publicly in defense of international human rights. Up until his arrest on 20 March 2017, Ahmed Mansoor was the last remaining human rights defender in the UAE who had been able to criticize the authorities publicly. He was tried and convicted on charges including “insulting the status and prestige of the UAE and its symbols” including its leaders, “publish[ing] false information to damage [the] UAE’s reputation abroad” and “portray[ing] the UAE as a lawless land,” and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on 29 May 2018.
Dr Mohammed al-Roken is a prominent human rights lawyer and former president of the UAE’s Jurists Association who was arrested on 17 July 2012.  He was sentenced in July 2013 to 10 years’ imprisonment, following the grossly unfair trial of 94 reform advocates, which became known as the “UAE 94” trial.
Many of the UAE 94 defendants have alleged in court that they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated in pre-trial detention, where they were often held incommunicado for months in secret State Security detention facilities.
Osama al-Najjar was arrested on 17 March 2014 and sentenced to three years in prison after sending tweets to the Minister of Interior expressing concern that his father had been ill-treated in prison. He was due for release from al-Razeen Prison in Abu Dhabi in March 2017, having fully served his prison sentence, However the State Security Chamber of the Federal Supreme Court decided to extend his detention at the request of the Public Prosecution on the pretext that he remained a threat and therefore should be detained in the Counseling Center, another area within the prison.
Science teacher Hussain Ali al-Najjar al-Hammadi is Osama al-Najjar’s father. He was arrested on 16 July 2012. He was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in the “UAE 94” trial and to a further 15 months in the trial of 20 Egyptian and 10 UAE nationals.
Dr Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment on 29 March 2017 by the Federal Appeal Court in Abu Dhabi. He was tried and convicted on charges including “posting false information” about UAE leaders and their policies, based on comments he made on Twitter stating that he had not been given a fair trial in a 2011 case that included Ahmed Mansoor and three other Emiratis known as the “UAE 5” case. Dr Nasser bin Ghaith has also been convicted of “communicating and co-operating with members of the banned al-Islah organization”, in connection with meetings he had with individuals allegedly linked to the organization.

“Today’s verdict hopefully brings some measure of justice to the victims, forty years after the unspeakable mass atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
“While this second trial of the Khmer Rouge’s last surviving senior leaders results in two convictions, and 14 reparation projects, this is bitter justice: the world has waited far too long for this moment. Decades after the crimes and 13 years after it was established, the ECCC should have achieved much more.”
Background
Nuon Chea, aged 92, was the former second in command of the Khmer Rouge regime. Khieu Samphan, aged 87, was the regime’s former Head of State. The Khmer Rouge, seized power in Cambodia in 1975 and governed until 1979.
Both men were convicted of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and are already serving life sentences after they were convicted of crimes against humanity in a separate ECCC trial in 2014.
The ECCC has completed only one other case. In 2010 Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, who operated the Khmer Rouge’s Tuol Sleng torture chambers in Phnom Penh, was convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes.

The Security Council will discuss Yemen’s conflict and humanitarian crisis at 15:00 EST (20:00GMT).
“Even with the lull in fighting in recent days, Hodeidah remains on a knife-edge, and the ominous fear of mortal danger looms large. Hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped near frontlines must be protected amid the fighting and granted safe passage out of the city,” said Sherine Tadros, Head of Amnesty International’s UN Office in New York.
“Bombs and bullets have killed thousands of civilians across Yemen, while the crushing descent into the world’s worst humanitarian crisis has placed many millions of already food-insecure people at imminent risk of famine. The Security Council must demand that all sides protect civilians by respecting international humanitarian law. They must ensure the unimpeded flow of aid and essential goods, including via Hodeidah port.
“This is not the time for discussion and words of support. All states, including permanent members of the Security Council like the USA, UK and France, should halt the flow of arms for use in the conflict and do everything in their power to prevent further violations – otherwise they are just part of the problem. And they should make clear that those responsible for war crimes in Yemen will be held to account.” 
On 9 November, Yemeni forces – backed by the Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition – announced a “vast offensive” to capture Hodeidah from Huthi control. Amnesty International has documented serious threats to the hundreds of thousands of civilians believed to remain in the city, unable to leave due to the currency collapse, vastly increased fuel prices and exorbitant rents elsewhere.
The Saudi Arabia and UAE-led Coalition has not made good on assurances it made in September that it would establish humanitarian corridors for civilians fleeing from the city. Only one passable route remains, to the north. If this is cut off, civilians will be fully encircled in a conflict zone.
Those who have managed to flee the city have joined 445,000 civilians from across Hodeidah governorate who have been displaced by violence since June 2018, according to UN figures.
Huthi forces have militarized at least one hospital in Hodeidah city and have mined several routes out. Increasingly, they are embedding themselves in civilian homes in heavily populated areas, a tactic which looks likely to draw Coalition fire into civilian neighbourhoods, with disastrous consequences.
Outside Hodeidah, Saudi Arabian and UAE-led attacks have struck people displaced by violence, while Coalition attacks have impacted downtown areas of the city, including around al-Thawra hospital on 11 November, prompting hundreds of patients and staff to flee in terror. Al-Thawra hospital was struck again later this week, by shells of unknown origin.
Thousands of civilians are at grave risk from both sides’ use of indirect explosive weapons such as mortars and artillery. These weapons are indiscriminate when used in populated areas due to their imprecise nature and wide-area effects.
The fighting in Hodeidah is blocking access to aid warehouses and other humanitarian facilities, further exacerbating the already dire humanitarian situation for millions of Yemeni civilians. According to the World Food Programme, clashes near Kilo 10 on Hodeidah’s outskirts have prevented it from accessing the Red Sea Mills, where 51,000 metric tons of wheat grain is stored – enough to feed 3.5 million people for a month.
Hodeidah’s port is crucial to a country that depends on imports to meet 80% of its basic needs. Amnesty International has previously warned that cutting off this supply line would further exacerbate what is already the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with 14 million people – half the population – teetering on the brink of famine.

“This latest wave of detentions of academics and activists, on the basis of absurd allegations, shows that the authorities are intent on continuing their brutal crackdown of independent civil society, and shatters any illusion that Turkey is normalizing following the lifting of the state of emergency.
“The fact that they have been detained in relation to innocuous activities alleged around the overwhelmingly peaceful ‘Gezi Park’ protests in 2013 shows how desperate Turkish authorities are to crack down on any form of dissent.
“It is telling that the detentions are part of the investigation into the jailed civil society leader, Osman Kavala, who – more than a year after his detention – is yet to be indicted or have evidence of an internationally recognized crime presented against him. Osman Kavala and all those detained today must be immediately and unconditionally released and the crackdown against Turkey’s independent civil society must be brought to an end.”

Background
According to information from the Istanbul Security Directorate, detainees include Anadolu Kültür staff alongside prominent civil society actors. Those detained are: Asena Günal, Ayşegül Güzel, Bora Sarı, Filiz Telek, Hakan Altınay, Hande Özhabeş, Meltem Aslan, Yiğit Ali Emekçi, Yiğit Aksakoğlu, Yusuf Cıvır as well as Turgut Tarhanlı, a prominent human rights law professor, Betül Tanbay, professor of mathematics, and film producer Çiğdem Mater.
Detention orders have reportedly been issued against 20 individuals in four Turkish cities in relation to alleged activities around the overwhelmingly peaceful ‘Gezi Park’ protests that took place across Turkey following the violent police dispersal of a small group of protestors in Istanbul’s Gezi Park in May 2013. The 13 individuals currently in detention include civil society actors connected to Anadolu Kültür, a civil society organization led by Osman Kavala, and the Open Society Institute where he was a board member in Turkey.
The allegations against those detained include organizing meetings to “deepen and spread” the Gezi Park protests, inviting trainers and moderators on the subjects of “civil disobedience and non-violent activism,” carrying out media activities to continue the ‘”Gezi Park process” and activities to stop the export of tear gas to Turkey. Even if true, all these are legitimate activities protected under the rights to freedom of expression, association and the right to peaceful assembly.

0,Hong Kong: Drop “chilling” prosecution of pro-democracy protest leaders,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/hong-kong-drop-chilling-prosecution-of-pro-democracy-protest-leaders/,"Trial of nine Umbrella Movement leaders due to start on Monday The Hong Kong government must drop the politically motivated prosecution of nine leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests, as it amounts to an attack on free speech and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said...","Trial of nine Umbrella Movement leaders due to start on Monday 
The Hong Kong government must drop the politically motivated prosecution of nine leaders of the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests, as it amounts to an attack on free speech and peaceful assembly, Amnesty International said ahead of the start of their trial on Monday.
Among the nine activists facing trial at West Kowloon Magistrates’ Courts are the co-founders of the “Occupy Central” campaign – legal scholar Professor Benny Tai Yiu-ting, sociologist Professor Chan Kin-man and retired pastor Reverend Chu Yiu-ming – who each face a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment if convicted. Six other defendants in the case include student leaders, lawmakers and political party leaders.
“This prosecution is an act of retaliation aimed at silencing the pro-democracy movement. The charges against all nine activists must be dropped, as the government’s case is based solely on the legitimate exercise of the rights to free speech and peaceful protest,” said Man-kei Tam, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong.
“The prosecutors are using deliberately vague and ambiguous charges that will have chilling consequences for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.”
In a briefing published today, Amnesty International outlines why the charges against the nine activists amount to an attack on human rights, and highlights the far-reaching consequences of prosecutions related to the Umbrella Movement protests.
The prosecution of the three “Occupy Central” leaders centres on the planning and implementation of a pro-democracy campaign, including non-violent direct action to block roads in the Central District of Hong Kong. The campaign, which called for the democratic election of the city’s head of government, became part of the large-scale pro-democracy Umbrella Movement protests carried out in an overwhelmingly peaceful manner over 79 days between September and December 2014.
The other six activists being prosecuted are student leaders Tommy Cheung Sau-yin and Eason Chung Yiu-wa, lawmakers Tanya Chan and Shiu Ka-chun, and political leaders Raphael Wong Ho-ming and Lee Wing-tat.
In an unusual move, prosecutors decided to base the charges against all nine individuals on the common law offence of “public nuisance”, which both makes the charges more ambiguous and carries harsher sentences compared to similar charges under statutory law.
Prosecutors are using press conferences, media interviews and public meetings in which the pro-democracy leaders discussed their non-violent civil disobedience campaign as key evidence.
Videos filmed by police of the nine’s peaceful participation in the first two days of the Umbrella Movement, including directing protesters to different streets outside the government headquarters and urging others through loudspeakers to join the protests also form central pillars of the prosecution’s case.
“If prosecutors are successful, there is a real danger that more and more people will face charges for peaceful activism. The authorities appear intent on trying to silence any debate about sensitive issues in Hong Kong, especially those relating to democracy and autonomy,” said Man-kei Tam.
Background
The prosecution is the latest against Umbrella Movement protesters by the Hong Kong government, following the conviction of three student leaders in 2017. More than four years on from the start of the Movement, hundreds of protestors remain in legal limbo, uncertain if the police will proceed with charges against them.
The trial comes amid increasing alarm over the erosion of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in Hong Kong. Last Thursday, the Financial Times’ Asia news editor Victor Mallet was refused entry to Hong Kong. The denial came just a month after the Hong Kong authorities refused to renew his work visa, in what appeared an act of retaliation, after Mallet hosted a talk with a pro-independence activist at the local Foreign Correspondents’ Club in August.
Earlier this month, dissident Chinese artist Badiucao cancelled his first show in Hong Kong citing security threats from Chinese authorities.

“The use of live ammunition to disperse student protests on university campuses in the DRC is abhorrent and illegal. No one should have to die because they exercised their right to freedom of expression or took part in a peaceful protest.
“The government must immediately launch a thorough and impartial investigation into these student deaths and bring to justice those found to be responsible.
“The authorities must ensure that all students injured in these protests receive comprehensive medical treatment. We also urge the leadership of the university to listen to student concerns and allow future student protests to take place, without involving the police in settling disputes on campus.” 
Background
On Monday 12 November, students at the University of Kinshasa held peaceful protests demanding an end to a lecturers’ strike that was adversely affecting their education.
Police were called in and used live bullets to disperse the students. Hyacinthe Kimbafu, a graduate student studying informatics was shot and taken to the university hospital. He died of gun wounds on Thursday 15 November.
On hearing the news, hundreds of students gathered on campus to protest Hyacinthe’s death. The police once again intervened with live bullets, killing Rodrigue Eliwo, an undergraduate biology student, and wounding at least seven others.
University of Kinshasa lecturers have been on strike since 8 October demanding better pay. This is their second strike this year. Students have said they will continue their protests over the weekend if their grievances are not addressed.

0,Libya: Refugees and migrants refuse to disembark ship in desperate plea to avoid detention and torture,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/libya-refugees-and-migrants-refuse-to-disembark-ship-in-desperate-plea-to-avoid-detention-and-torture/,"Libyan, European and Panamanian authorities must ensure that at least 79 refugees and migrants who are on board a merchant vessel at the port of Misratah are not forced to disembark to be taken to a Libyan detention centre where they could face torture and other abuse, said Amnesty International...","Libyan, European and Panamanian authorities must ensure that at least 79 refugees and migrants who are on board a merchant vessel at the port of Misratah are not forced to disembark to be taken to a Libyan detention centre where they could face torture and other abuse, said Amnesty International today.
The refugees and migrants, including a number of children, were found as they attempted to reach Europe by boat across the Mediterranean. Amnesty International understands that Italian and Maltese maritime authorities were involved in the operation, carried out by the merchant ship Nivin. Flying a Panamanian flag, the Nivin picked the group up in the central Mediterranean on 8 November and returned them to Libya, in what appears to be a clear breach of international law, given that Libya cannot be considered a safe place to disembark.
“The protest on board the ship now docked in Misratah, gives a clear indication of the horrifying conditions refugees and migrants face in Libya’s detention centres where they are routinely exposed to torture, rape, beatings, extortion and other abuse,” said Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa Director for Amnesty International.
“It is high time the Libyan authorities put an end to the ruthless policy of unlawfully detaining refugees and migrants. No one should be sent back to Libya to be held in inhumane conditions and face torture and other ill-treatment.”
Like most of the refugees and migrants passing through Libya, a number of those on the ship told Amnesty International that they had been subjected to horrific human rights abuses, including extortion, ill-treatment, and forced labour, much in line with what has previously been documented in Libya by the organization. One of those on board told Amnesty International he had already been held in eight different detention centres inside Libya and “would rather die than go back there”.
Fourteen people who agreed to leave the ship yesterday have been taken to a detention centre – among them is a four-month-old baby.
The news comes amid reports that some refugees and migrants held at Libyan detention centres are being driven to take their own lives. A young Eritrean man was reported to have attempted suicide earlier this week. Last month a Somali man at the same detention centre died after setting himself on fire.  
“Unable to return home out of fear of persecution, and with very limited chances for resettlement to a third country, for most refugees and asylum seekers in detention centres in Libya their only option is to remain in detention, where they are exposed to grave abuses. “
“Europe can no longer ignore the catastrophic consequences of its policies to curb migration across the Mediterranean. The protest on board this ship should serve as a wake-up call to European governments and the wider international community that Libya is not a safe country for refugees and migrants,” said Heba Morayef.
“Under international law, no one should be sent to a place where their life is at risk.  European governments and Panama must work with Libyan authorities to find a solution for the people on board to ensure they do not end up indefinitely detained in Libyan detention centres where torture is rife.
“The international community also has to do more to increase the number of refugees they are willing to resettle, increase access for people seeking asylum and offer alternative routes to safety for thousands of people stranded in Libya with no end in sight to their suffering.”
Amnesty International is also calling on Libyan authorities to expedite the opening of a long-awaited processing centre that will house up to 1,000 refugees and asylum seekers allowing them to relocate out of detention centers.
Earlier this week Amnesty International highlighted how thousands of migrants and refugees in Libya continue to be trapped in appalling conditions in Libyan detention centres with no way out.

0,Why Rohingya refugees shouldn’t be sent back to Myanmar,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-why-rohingya-refugees-shouldnt-be-sent-back-myanmar/,"Since August 2017, more than 720,000 Rohingya have fled a vicious campaign of violence by the Myanmar security forces and sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. This week some refugees could be returned from Bangladesh to Myanmar under an agreement reached earlier between the two governments...","Since August 2017, more than 720,000 Rohingya have fled a vicious campaign of violence by the Myanmar security forces and sought refuge in neighbouring Bangladesh. 
This week some refugees could be returned from Bangladesh to Myanmar under an agreement reached earlier between the two governments that sidestepped safeguards mandated under international law. 
Here, Amnesty International explains how this situation has come about and why the forcible return of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar is unlawful, being premature, and putting their lives, liberty and other key human rights at risk. 
The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in Myanmar. Until recently, more than a million lived mostly in Rakhine State, in the west of the country, on the border with Bangladesh. 
The Rohingya assert longstanding ties to Rakhine State, and the overwhelming majority were born in the country as were their parents and grandparents. Virtually all of them have no citizenship and no reasonable claim to citizenship other than in Myanmar. Despite this, the government, insists that there is no such group in the country, instead claiming that they are “illegal immigrants” from Bangladesh. It refuses to recognize them as citizens, effectively rendering the majority of them stateless.  
Their lack of citizenship has had a cascade of negative impacts on their lives, and has allowed the authorities in Myanmar to severely restrict their freedom of movement, effectively segregating them from the rest of society. As a result, they struggle to access healthcare, schools and jobs. This systematic discrimination amounts to apartheid, a crime against humanity under international law. 
Since August last year, more than 720,000 Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State after the military unleashed a brutal campaign of violence against them. During this campaign, launched in response to coordinated attacks on security posts by the armed group the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), security forces killed thousands of Rohingya, raped women and girls, hauled men and boys off to detention sites where they were tortured, and burned hundreds of homes and villages to the ground in what were clearly crimes against humanity. A UN report has concluded these crimes may also constitute genocide. 
While the crisis in Rakhine State since 25 August is unprecedented in the scale of displacement, it’s not the first time the Rohingya have been subject to violent expulsion from their homes, villages and country at the hands of the Myanmar state. In the late 1970s and early 1990s hundreds of thousands were forced to flee to Bangladesh after major military crackdowns which were accompanied by wide-ranging human rights violations. 
More recently, in 2016 almost 90,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces responded to attacks on police posts by an armed Rohingya group with a campaign of violence targeting the community as a whole. At the time, Amnesty International concluded that these actions may have amounted to crimes against humanity. 
Today, the UN estimates that there are altogether more than 900,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. 
At first, the new arrivals were welcomed. Across Bangladesh, there was an outpouring of sympathy for the persecuted minority driven from their homes. The Bangladeshi government, which had long been ambivalent towards the Rohingya, embraced them. 
On a visit to the Rohingya refugee camps, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared that if Bangladesh could feed their 160 million people, it could feed hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees. 
While the Bangladeshi government has generously hosted the refugees, they have not given them refugee status – leaving them without legal status on either side of the border. Bangladesh is not a signatory to the UN Refugee Convention. 
The refugees are squeezed into threadbare shelters, mostly made of flimsy tarpaulin and bamboo. During the severe monsoon season, many homes were at risk of damage. Thousands of families were relocated and the shelters were reinforced. But they are still at risk in the case of a cyclone striking. The camps are also extremely congested. The area where most of the Rohingya refugees have taken shelter is large enough to count as Bangladesh’s fourth largest city, with nearly a million people, including the local host community residing there. 
The Rohingya have an inalienable human right to return to and reside in Myanmar – it is their home, and if they choose to they must be allowed to return. But governments must not organize returns unless they ensure that they are safe, voluntary, and dignified. As things currently stand, none of those conditions have been met, despite claims to the contrary by both the Myanmar and Bangladesh governments. The UN has repeatedly stated that conditions in Myanmar are not conducive to returns. The Bangladeshi government has agreed to have UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, oversee the returns process. UNHCR has undertaken the responsibility to interview every family that has expressed willingness to go back and certify that this is a voluntary return before they can be repatriated to Myanmar. This includes ensuring that refugees are also given the option to remain in Bangladesh if they choose to do so. 
The cruel and entrenched system of discrimination and segregation that made the Rohingya so vulnerable in the first place has to be dismantled. Safe and dignified returns also means guaranteeing that once back, they can enjoy equal rights and citizenship and that the extreme human rights violations they have suffered will stop. 
Safe and dignified returns also require those responsible for the horrific abuses against the Rohingya to be held to account. As it stands, almost all perpetrators remain at large and continue to evade justice, while maintaining positions of power that enable them to perpetrate more violations. The Rohingya cannot be left living in fear of a fresh wave of violence that will, if they survive, drive them across the border yet again. 
Forcibly returning refugees from Bangladesh to Myanmar, where their lives, safety and other key human rights remain at grave risk, is a violation of the fundamental principle of international law known as non-refoulement. 
The Governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar must uphold their commitment that Rohingya refugees will only return safely, voluntarily and with dignity. Both governments must also ensure that refugees in Bangladesh are able to make free and informed choices about return, based on access to full and impartial information about conditions in Rakhine State and the support to remain in Bangladesh if they choose to do so. 
Both governments must also ensure that Rohingya are consulted and included in all decisions affecting their futures. At the moment, Rohingya refugees do not have a seat at the table, and decisions about their future are being made without their knowledge and therefore obviously without their consent. 
As the UN agency mandated with the protection of refugees, UNHCR must play a key role in any organized return process, including providing refugees with objective, up-to-date, and accurate information in relevant languages and formats to allow them to make genuinely free and informed choices about whether and when they would like to exercise their right to return, obtaining their consent and monitoring that conditions are safe for return in Myanmar – before, during and after any returns take place, ensuring their long-term sustainability. 
The international community has an important role to play – in ensuring that returns are not forced, but also in pushing Myanmar to create the conditions which would allow for safe, voluntary, and dignified returns. The international community must also do much more to support Bangladesh and share the responsibility and financial burden of hosting almost a million refugees. Shamefully, only 40% of the UN’s appeal for USD 950 million has been committed. Governments and donors around the world need to step up to support this effort. 
Finally, Rohingya refugees are entitled to continue to seek asylum in Bangladesh and the authorities there must keep borders open to refugees who continue to flee now or will in the future. The Bangladeshi government should also explore all options to ensure continued international protection for this community. To be truly voluntary, refugees need alternatives – including to remain in Bangladesh with asylum protections, including refugee status, and to resettle or relocate to a third country if they choose to do so. So far, these options do not exist.

In light of their demands, the Colombian authorities must guarantee their right to peaceful protest and undertake to comply fully with the Peace Agreement signed two years ago, Amnesty International said today.
“The Indigenous Peoples of Chocó have historically borne the brunt of the brutal violence of the armed conflict in Colombia and, today, this violence has intensified with the reorganization of armed groups, such as the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional, ELN) and paramilitary groups, in their ancestral territories. Every day, thousands of people and communities are being forcibly displaced; the government of President Duque must take decisive measures and immediate action to protect them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“The Colombian authorities must fulfil their obligation to implement the Peace Agreement and guarantee the rights to life and physical integrity of Indigenous Peoples and ensure the protection of their territories. The national and Bogotá city authorities must guarantee the right to demonstrate peacefully in Plaza de Bolívar, without repression and without restrictions. It is shameful that the authorities have sought to block their own people from entering the capital, restricting their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.”
The Minga for Life, a broad coalition of the Indigenous Peoples of Chocó, arrived in Bogotá last Sunday to demand protection and respect for their human rights. According to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, police blocked approximately 500 Indigenous people from entering Plaza de Bolívar, where they planned to hold their protest. Another part of the Minga was stopped by police on the outskirts of the city and forced to spend the night there before making their way on foot into the city on Monday morning.
*Minga is a word of Indigenous origin and refers to a broad call for Indigenous Peoples to demonstrate about an issue of collective concern.

“While President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s decision to order a review of Egypt’s repressive NGO law is encouraging, amending the law is not enough. It is crucial that the authorities develop a new law in consultation with independent civil society and take concrete steps to end the relentless assault on Egypt’s human rights community,” said Najia Bounaim, Head of Campaigns for North Africa at Amnesty International.
“Egyptian human rights defenders are facing an unprecedented crackdown. The Egyptian authorities need to show they are sincere and committed to protecting the rights of local and international NGOs by developing a law that ensures they are able to operate independently and carry out their work without fearing harassment, criminal prosecution or the threat of being shut down.”
The authorities have launched a “criminal” investigation into the “foreign funding” of NGOs, if convicted staff could face up to 25 years in prison. At least 30 human rights NGO staff and directors have been banned from travel and seven NGOS and 10 individuals have had their assets frozen. The authorities also ordered the closure of the renowned el-Nadeem Centre for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture.
Human rights defender Hisham Gaafar, director of Mada Foundation for Media Development, has been held for more than three years in pre-trial detention, and Ezzat Ghoniem, co-founder of the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms was forcibly disappeared on 14 September, despite a court order to release him.
“If the Egyptian authorities are serious about ending the persecution of human rights defenders they need to start by closing the fabricated foreign funding investigation into NGOs, ending travel bans and asset freezes against civil society staff, and immediately and unconditionally releasing Ezzat Ghoniem and Hisham Gaafar,” said Najia Bounaim.
Amnesty International is calling for the process to develop a new law on associations to be transparent and for members of Egyptian civil society to be actively involved in the drafting process.
Background:
In May 2017, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ratified law no.70/2017 on Associations and Other Foundations Working in the Field of Civil Work. The law imposed unprecedentedly harsh restrictions on NGOs and has been widely criticized national and internationally.

BENGALURU/DELHI
The latest leak of a dossier on Amnesty India by the Enforcement Directorate, a financial investigation agency under the Ministry of Finance, based on its ongoing investigations, indicates a deliberate attempt by the government to tarnish Amnesty India’s reputation. Amnesty India calls for an immediate end to this smear campaign and an independent inquiry into the selective leaks of information that are fueling this smear campaign. 
“In the three weeks since we were raided by the Enforcement Directorate, no formal charges have been filed against us. So, it is really shocking to see media coverage of what is alleged to be documents from the investigation. If the authorities believe that Amnesty India has committed an offence, they must prove it in a court of law. However, the Enforcement Directorate seems to be leaking selective information and conducting a media trial,” said Aakar Patel of Amnesty India
“It is alarming to see authorities resort to such low measures to discredit the work of an organization committed to upholding human rights. The latest action of leaking documents related to an ongoing investigation to a media house to tarnish Amnesty India’s reputation is deplorable. Such actions highlight a pattern of demonizing and criminalizing human rights defenders and organizations. The government seems afraid and viscerally opposed to anyone who is critical of its actions or policies,” said Aakar Patel.
On 14 November, a prominent Indian news channel ran two hour-long special shows on the Enforcement Directorate’s raids on Amnesty India. The anchors claimed to have accessed the entire dossier of investigations done by the investigating agency. They also showed visuals of the documents, including the investigation report, testimonies and bank documents that are a part of the investigations. It is important to note that Amnesty India has still not been given access to the dossier and has repeatedly been denied access to such information by the agency.
At one point, the anchor read from what is alleged to be a copy of the statement given by Aakar Patel, the Chief Executive Officer of Amnesty International India Private Limited and the Managing Trustee of Indians for Amnesty International Trust, to the Enforcement Directorate. This document was also flashed repeatedly during the show. The Enforcement Directorate officials refused to provide a copy of said statement to Aakar Patel, when it was requested during the search and again on 31 October in the Enforcement Directorate’s office. They refused on the grounds that the copy is confidential and can only be shared after the charges are framed.
“Isn’t this a gross violation of natural justice where the person accused of a crime is not given full details? We have always respected the rule of law and have extended our full cooperation to the agency’s investigations. However, it seems like the government thinks it can abuse its power and run smear campaigns to fulfill its agenda of silencing anyone who questions power. The authorities should initiate an independent probe and bring to justice those who are responsible for this leak,” said Aakar Patel.
This is not the first time the investigating agency has leaked information about Amnesty India to the media. Ahead of the raids on 25 October, of which Amnesty India was not aware, the government authorities had leaked a cache of documents marked “secret” that cast Amnesty India’s operations in a dark web of intrigue. Within moments of the raid, a smear campaign was launched on social media and sections of the pro-government media that have long been opposed to the work being done by Amnesty India.
BACKGROUND
On 25 October 2018, Amnesty India endured a ten-hour-long raid as a group of officers from the Enforcement Directorate, a financial investigation agency under the Ministry of Finance, entered the premises and locked the gates behind them. Some of the staff were ordered to not leave, shut their laptops and not use their mobile phones. Most of the documents asked for during the search were available in the public domain or were already filed with the relevant government authorities. Details of our current structure, which was the focus of much of the questioning, have been available on our website since 2014. Following the raid, and despite operating in compliance with relevant national regulations, the accounts of Amnesty India have been frozen, effectively stopping our work. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Home Affairs has also initiated investigations into the funds received by Amnesty India.

“Minister Motsoaledi should stop this shameless scapegoating of refugees and migrants. He has been in charge of the health department for almost a decade and should have been fully aware of the challenges faced by the public health system, including the need for more investment, to address the health needs of the growing population. He has failed to take adequate action.
“He is now blaming refugees and migrants to abdicate his responsibility. Minister Motsoaledi should stop fueling xenophobia with these unfounded remarks and take urgent steps to improve access to affordable and quality health care for all persons in South Africa.” 
Background
South Africa has ratified several international and regional human rights instruments that require the government to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health, including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The right to health requires health facilities, goods, and services to be available, accessible, acceptable, and of good quality for all persons, free from discrimination.

Aung San Suu Kyi once asked Amnesty International “to not take either your eyes or your mind” off Myanmar as she led a struggle against the country’s repressive military junta. 
We did exactly as requested. 
And when she ultimately rose to become the de facto leader of Myanmar’s civilian-led government in April 2016, we carried on watching — first with hope, and then with horror. 
We watched as the release of scores of prisoners of conscience gave way to renewed political arrests and clampdowns on freedom of expression. 
We watched as Aung San Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD) — elected in a landslide by voters from all walks of life — cultivated narratives of hate that have fostered discrimination and intolerance rather than celebrated the country’s diversity. 
And we watched when she failed to condemn or even acknowledge the atrocities against the Rohingya population in Rakhine state — as the military killed thousands, tortured men and boys, raped women and girls, and forced hundreds of thousands out of their homes and country. 
We watched keenly, but never silently. 
Since Aung San Suu Kyi came to power, Amnesty has documented war crimes and other human rights violations by the military in Kachin and northern Shan states in the north of the country. As is often the case, civilians are those who suffer the worst. But instead of alleviating their suffering, her government has joined the military in restricting humanitarian access to people in need. 
We have exposed how the Rohingya have been trapped in a vicious system of state-sponsored, institutionalized discrimination that amounts to apartheid, stripped of their citizenship, segregated from society and unable to move freely or access schools and hospitals. The situation is exacerbated by the administration stirring up hostility against the Rohingya, calling them “terrorists,” and accusing them of burning their own homes and of “faking rape.” 
We have gathered — and published — extensive, credible evidence implicating Myanmar’s military commander in chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, and 12 other named individuals, most of them high-ranking military or police officers, in crimes against humanity committed against the Rohingya. A United Nations report concluded that these crimes may also constitute genocide. 
And this week, we revoked Amnesty’s highest human rights honor — the Ambassador of Conscience Award — from Aung San Suu Kyi herself. 
It was when she received this award in person in 2012, two years after being released from long years of house arrest, that she requested we observe what was to come. 
Irene Khan, then in the role I now hold as secretary general of Amnesty, described Aung San Suu Kyi as “a symbol of hope, courage and the undying defense of human rights.” 
But while Amnesty worked to keep up its side of the bargain, Aung San Suu Kyi did not keep hers.

0,Morocco: Hirak protester jailed over Facebook posts must be released,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/morocco-hirak-protester-jailed-over-facebook-posts-must-be-released/,"Responding to the news that a Moroccan court has upheld a five-year prison sentence against El Mortada Iamrachen, a local imam and Hirak protester from the northern Rif region of Morocco, for peacefully expressing his views in two Facebook posts, Amnesty International’s MENA Regional Director...","Responding to the news that a Moroccan court has upheld a five-year prison sentence against El Mortada Iamrachen, a local imam and Hirak protester from the northern Rif region of Morocco, for peacefully expressing his views in two Facebook posts, Amnesty International’s MENA Regional Director Heba Morayef said:
“Today’s verdict is another appalling blow for freedom of expression in Morocco and a blatant miscarriage of justice.
“With this prison sentence El Mortada Iamrachen is being cruelly punished merely for expressing his opinions on Facebook. He has already been held in solitary confinement for 11 months in violation of the prohibition of torture and other ill-treament. The fact that he will be imprisoned for years for peacefully expressing his views is abhorrent.
“El Mortada Iamrachen appears to have been targeted because of his role as an advocate of peaceful protests. His conviction is the latest example of the Moroccan authorities’ stepping up their crackdown on dissent by prosecuting and intimidating protesters from the Hirak movement.
“Instead of jailing El Mortada Iamrachen in inhuman conditions, Morocco’s authorities must release him and ensure that his conviction on these bogus charges is quashed.”
Background
Since May 2017, Moroccan security forces have arrested hundreds of protesters, including children and several journalists, over the largely peaceful protests in the northern Rif region of Morocco. Those arrested include scores of protesters, activists and bloggers in the Rif, who have protested to demand social justice and an end to marginalization of their communities.

0,Iran: Two people executed for corruption after unfair TV show trial,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/iran-two-people-executed-for-corruption-after-unfair-tv-show-trial/,"Responding to the news that the Iranian authorities have executed Vahid Mazloumin and Mohammad Esmail Ghasemi, two men convicted of financial crimes after a grossly unfair trial, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director, Philip Luther, said: “With...","Responding to the news that the Iranian authorities have executed Vahid Mazloumin and Mohammad Esmail Ghasemi, two men convicted of financial crimes after a grossly unfair trial, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director, Philip Luther, said:
“With these abhorrent executions the Iranian authorities have flagrantly violated international law and once again displayed their shameless disregard for the right to life.
“Use of the death penalty is appalling under any circumstances but it is even more horrific given that these men were convicted after a grossly unfair show trial that was broadcast on state television. Under international human rights law, the death penalty is absolutely forbidden for non-lethal crimes, such as financial corruption.
“The shocking manner in which their trial was fast-tracked through Iran’s judicial system without allowing them the chance of a proper appeal is yet another example of the brazen disregard the Iranian authorities have for defendants’ basic due process rights.”
Background
Amid a deepening economic crisis, the Iranian authorities have carried out mass arrests of individuals whom they describe as “financially corrupt” and “saboteurs of the economy”, convicted them of charges related to financial crimes and sentenced some of them to flogging, lengthy prison terms and the death penalty after grossly unfair summary trials.
In August, Iran’s Supreme Leader approved a request by the Head of Judiciary to set up special courts to deal with crimes involving financial corruption. Since then, these courts have sentenced several people to death. Vahid Mazloumin and Mohammad Esmail Ghasemi had been accused of manipulating Iran’s gold and currency markets and were sentenced to death in September on the charge of “spreading corruption on earth”. Dozens of other people have also been sentenced to prison terms after convictions on similar charges.
Amnesty International considers that trials before these special courts are inherently unfair because defendants are denied access to lawyers of their own choosing, have no right to appeal against sentences of imprisonment and are given only 10 days within which to appeal death sentences.
