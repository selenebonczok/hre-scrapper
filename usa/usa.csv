0,110+ Orgs to Biden: End U.S. Program of Lethal Strikes Abroad,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/110-orgs-to-biden-end-u-s-program-of-lethal-strikes-abroad/,"Today, 113 organizations from the United States and around the world sent a letter to President Biden calling for an end to the U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized … ","Today, 113 organizations from the United States and around the world sent a letter to President Biden calling for an end to the U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized battlefields, including through the use of drones. The groups’ focus varies from: human rights; civil rights and civil liberties; racial, social, and environmental justice; humanitarian approaches to foreign policy; faith-based initiatives; peacebuilding; government accountability; veterans’ issues; and the protection of civilians. 
“Successive presidents have now claimed the unilateral power to authorize secretive extrajudicial killing outside any recognized battlefield, with no meaningful accountability for wrongful deaths and civilians lives lost and injured,” reads the letter, which was signed by organizations based in the United States as well as in countries impacted by the program, including Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. “This program is a centerpiece of the United States’ forever wars and has exacted an appalling toll on Muslim, Brown, and Black communities in multiple parts of the world. Twenty years into a war-based approach that has undermined and violated fundamental rights, we urge you to abandon it and embrace an approach that advances our collective human security” 
The letter calls on the Biden administration to use its ongoing review of the program, as well as the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11, as an opportunity to disavow and end the lethal strikes program for good. Read the letter in full here. 
Below are statements from signatories: 
“Time and time again, human rights organizations like Amnesty International have investigated and exposed the human cost of deadly U.S. air strikes instead of the government responsible for committing them. The Biden administration must put an end to this unaccountable killing program if it is going to fulfill its promise to restore US leadership on human rights and to hold itself accountable to families and communities worldwide as well as stateside.” 
— Daphne Eviatar, Director, Security With Human Rights program, Amnesty International USA 
“Our nation has been involved in seemingly endless war for nearly two decades. We are tired of our country using military force as a tool of first resort and the enormous physical and psychological toll this has caused for servicemembers, as well as civilians harmed by our country’s actions abroad. The program of lethal strikes outside even recognized battlefields is central to that war-based approach. An entire generation of veterans and lost civilian lives later, it’s past time for a new way forward.” 
— Garett Reppenhagen, Executive Director, Veterans For Peace  
“The U.S. has been killing people for nearly 20 years in Yemen, but to this day it has not adequately investigated civilian deaths and injuries, or clearly recognized the severe harm caused to families and communities. The Biden administration should break with these damaging practices, and ensure thorough investigation and accountability for harms that have occured.” 
— Radhya al-Mutawakel, Chairperson, Mwatana for Human Rights, Yemen 
“Young people urgently want a livable, peaceful future — not forever wars that degrade our planet, harm Muslim, Brown, and Black communities around the world, and divert attention and resources from existential challenges like climate change. If President Biden is serious about investing in our future and our rights, he must end this lethal program and decades of war-based approaches, and chart a path forward that protects our collective human and environmental security.” 
— Ellen Sciales, Communications Director, Sunrise Movement 
“Because we are all God’s children, the decision to take a life is morally perilous. And, if it is ever justifiable, it must truly be a last resort. Unfortunately, two decades of drone strikes and other lethal acts, often carried out well away from any recognized battlefield, show that rather than using lethal force as a last resort, killing has instead become our government’s default approach to perceived threats.  President Biden must end the policy of using drone strikes and other lethal strikes in order to preemptively address possible threats. Two decades of killing is two decades too many.” 
— Rev. Jimmie Hawkins, Director, Presbyterian Church U.S.A. Office of Public Witness 
“That such a large and diverse set of groups signed this letter shows there’s widespread support for President Biden to end the harmful U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized battlefields. For too long, successive presidents have flouted the rights-protecting safeguards of international law and the U.S. system of checks and balances, with devastating consequences for lives and the rule of law. In following through on his promise to end forever wars, President Biden urgently needs to center rights, our collective human security, and adherence to domestic and international law.” 
— Hina Shamsi, Director, ACLU National Security Project 
Other groups signing the letter include: September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, American Friends Service Committee, Center for Civilians in Conflict, Win Without War, Alliance for Peacebuilding, Saferworld, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), Women for Afghan Women, and Common Defense.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Prime Minister, 
I write to express my grave concern for the ongoing crackdown on human rights defenders in Thailand, which has seen at least 635 people, including 41 children targeted with criminal proceedings solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Your government continues to indict, put on trial and arbitrarily detain students and other peaceful protesters, including children, under legislation including lèse-majesté and sedition. 
It is distressing to learn that dozens of students and peaceful protesters, including Parit ‘Penguin’ Chiwarak, Anon Numpa, Panupong ‘Mike’ Jadnok, Panusaya ‘Rung’ Sithijirawattanakul, Piyarat ‘Toto’ Chongthep, Chai-amorn ‘Ammy’ Kaewwiboonpan, Pornsorn ‘Fah’ Weerathamjaree, Wanwale ‘Tee’ Thammasattaya and Siraphop ‘Kha Nun’ Phumphuenghphut are at risk of lengthy prison sentences for the peaceful exercise of their human rights during protests. 
I am further concerned about the health and well-being of the detained individuals, especially in light of an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in prison. Specifically, I find it alarming that Anon Numpa, and Panupong ‘Mike’ Jadnok have contracted COVID-19 in detention and have had repeated bail applications denied. This is further worrying as they have been without adequate access to family members or legal counsel. 
It is important that your government upholds Thailand’s international and constitutional human rights obligations and allow people to express their opinions, including on social media, and peacefully participate in public protests. As you will be aware, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have previously found Thai authorities to have breached its international human rights obligations by prosecuting and arbitrarily detaining lèse majesté suspects, including by holding them in unnecessary pre-trial detention and repeatedly denying bail. 
Therefore, I call on you to: 
Sincerely, 
[YOUR NAME]

Belarusian LGBT+ activist Victoria Biran spent two weeks in detention under Article 23.34 of the Code of Administrative Offences (‘Violation of the procedure for organising or holding mass events’) and was released on 11 October.

According to her friends, when Victoria Biran was arrested and brought to a police station, a law enforcement official gave her a list of names and asked her to point out LGBT+ activists. However, later police claimed that they had had no knowledge of Victoria Biran’s LGBT+ activism and had not even noticed her large rainbow flag. 
Victoria Biran was first brought to the detention centre on Akrestina street where she was placed in an overcrowded cell, in which some women had to sleep on the floor. On 29 September she was moved to the prison located in the town of Zhodino. 
While Amnesty International welcomes Victoria Biran’s release at the end of her 15-day administrative detention, Victoria Biran did not commit any offence and was only intending to exercise her rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and should not have been arrested or detained in the first place.

Dear Acting Secretary Wolf and Acting Director Albence: 
The undersigned organizations write to urge that families held at all three Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) family detention centers be swiftly, safely, and promptly released together following a court order to release all children in ICE facilities by July 17, 2020. We understand that the deadline was extended to July 27, 2020. We strongly object to any plan to place a choice before parents that is no choice at all: indefinite detention with their children in deadly conditions during a global pandemic or possibly permanent separation from them. Parents must be released with their children to preserve family unity, as family separation is not in the best interests of the child. 
  
In her June 26 order directing ICE to release all children detained at its three family detention centers, District Court Judge Dolly Gee described how these facilities are “on fire,” with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and inadequate protective measures, and concluded that “there is no more time for half-measures.”[1] COVID-19 is running rampant in these facilities, which detain children as young as one-year-old. In the Karnes County Residential Center, 34 parents and children of approximately 100 detained have tested positive for COVID-19.[2] In the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, 21 facility staff have tested positive for COVID-19.[3] Despite this, ICE continues to fail to take steps to prevent contagion in these family detention facilities. Sick employees are permitted to come to work, and there are arbitrary contact-tracing and quarantine practices. 
  
Long before the onset of COVID-19, family detention and family separation were roundly criticized by medical and mental health experts for the trauma they inflict on children and their parents.[4] Detention centers are often retraumatizing, and children in detention “may experience developmental delay and poor psychological adjustment” even after they are released; even brief periods of detention can lead to psychological trauma and long-term health risks.[5] Family separation is a form of psychological violence experts have likened to “soul murder,” which inflicts lasting and permanent damage upon children and their parents.[1] The powerful evidence documenting the harm of these practices only underscores the urgency of ending both immediately. 
  
Most families held in prolonged and indefinite detention were wrongfully denied the chance to seek safety because of the unlawful third-country transit ban, which renders ineligible for asylum nearly anyone who traveled through any other country on their way to the United States. In the past two weeks, multiple courts have declared the ban unlawful, and it is now no longer in effect.[2] Detained families must now be afforded the fair chance to seek asylum they never received, and they should be paroled from detention during their asylum proceedings. 
  
We are deeply alarmed that ICE is now on the verge of forcing parents into an impossible and cruel “choice,” as it did in May 2020, when ICE asked detained parents whether they wished to remain detained with their children in unsafe conditions or separate from their children so the children could be released from detention.[3] These families are living with unthinkable fear and anxiety – not knowing if they will be released, if they will contract COVID-19, or if ICE will seek to try to separate them again, as it attempted in mid-May. 
  
ICE has historically exercised its legal authority and discretion to release parents with their children on parole and/or into alternative-to-detention programs. Since the COVID-19 crisis started, Members of Congress, advocates, attorneys, doctors, and members of the public have repeatedly urged ICE to use its legal authority and discretion to release detained families together. 
  
Yet, in the face of this heightened risk of contracting COVID-19, and despite having full authority and discretion to act to save lives, ICE is choosing to pursue an option to separate families. Instead of releasing them together from facilities with confirmed COVID‐19 cases, it is choosing to separate families or keep them locked up together in detention indefinitely. Both traumatize children. Neither is an option. 
  
Family separation produced by this coercive “choice” violates multiple human rights, including the right to family unity, the right to liberty, and the requirement to prioritize the best interests of the child.[4] In some instances, family separation can violate the right to freedom from torture and other ill-treatment.[5] The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Torture has denounced any authorities’ “deliberate separation of family members” who are seeking asylum at borders, calling it “refoulement in disguise,” which is “designed to coerce them to ‘voluntarily’ return to their country-of-origin” regardless of their protection needs.[6] 
  
The detention of children is not in their best interests, and their separation from parents is only lawful in exceptional circumstances, such as when a child faces imminent harm. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has categorically called on all states to end the practice of immigration detention of children, and to maintain family unity through alternatives to detention. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has likewise stated that the detention of children is never in a child’s best interests, and can constitute ill-treatment if the detention is due to their or their parents’ immigration status.[7] 
  
These rights violations are entirely avoidable: ICE has the legal authority and discretion – and especially in the pandemic, the obligation – to release families together. ICE can parole or release parents for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.[8] There is surely no more urgent humanitarian reason or significant public benefit than protecting the health of families in ICE’s care and custody during a pandemic. Instead, ICE is inflicting fear and uncertainty upon families and endangering public health. 
  
We urge you to release children together with their parents, and we roundly reject any solution that will result in either the continued detention of families or separations of detained parents from their children. We strongly oppose the development of any protocol for gaining the purported consent of families to separation; any such protocol is inherently coercive, on top of being unnecessary given that ICE has full authority and discretion to release families together on parole and/or into ATD programs. Preserving the unity of these families is in these children’s best interests, and it is also the right and compassionate thing to do. 
  
We therefore call on you to immediately release all detained families together. This administration must not use COVID-19 as an opportunity to deploy its family separation policy again. 
  
Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohammed added their voices to the Free Turkey Media campaign which will culminate in a global day of action on World Press Freedom Day, 3 May. 
“In the purge that followed the failed coup, Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists. Many have been held for months and still have no idea of what they’ve been charged with,” said Gauri van Gulik Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director. 
“In the wake of this month’s constitutional referendum, Turkey needs a free media now more than ever and this campaign will show that the world has not forgotten the scores of journalists languishing in jail.” 
The campaign, run by Amnesty International with the support of PEN, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Index on Censorship and numerous other organizations, encourages individuals to show support by posting a ‘selfie’ while holding a sign with the hashtag #FreeTurkeyMedia. Among those that have already backed the movement are artist Ai Weiwei, while dozens of cartoonists around the world are submitting work which will be judged by a panel including cartoonists Zunar, Steve Bell and Martin Rowson. 
“If it was right to demand freedom for the Al Jazeera journalists, it is right to demand #FreeTurkeyMedia,” said Peter Greste in a tweet. 
“The world stood beside we three journalists – Peter Greste, Baher Mohammed and myself – until we won our freedom. Let’s #FreeTurkeyMedia,” tweeted Mohamed Fahmy.

0,Partisan Election of Judges + Death Penalty = Bad Idea,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/partisan-election-of-judges-death-penalty-bad-idea/,Most states elect judges in partisan elections; this can cause a conflict between appealing to voters and upholding the rule of law. Can we do better?," 
On November 6th, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Sharon Keller was re-elected despite previously facing removal from the bench over a case in which she refused an after-hours appeal by a death row inmate who was executed later that night. 
The election of judges based on popular vote is not unique to Texas, though it is one of only 8 states that choose judges for its highest courts with partisan elections. 
But 39 states elect at least some judges by popular vote. Since this approach is implemented in most of the United States, it is important to evaluate whether picking judges this way is a good idea. Proponents of electing judges argue that it is more democratic than having them appointed, and that it makes judges directly accountable to the people.  But, especially for death penalty cases which as high profile crimes are usually deeply politicized to begin with, how fair and accurate can judges be when they are beholden, not just to the law, but also to voters? 
Electing judges by popular vote makes them politicians, with all that entails: campaigning, fundraising, partisan loyalties, etc. Concerns about the practice of electing judges have been raised since the 1990s when Stephen B. Bright, President of the Southern Center for Human Rights published a groundbreaking study in 1995 focusing on the prominence of the death penalty in the election, retention and promotion of judges.  The report called “for open and honest discussion of the political pressures on judges who must stand for election and retention.” 
Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has taken up the call, arguing that “what you get these days is large campaign contributions when you have elections. And I don’t think we should have any cash in our courtrooms.” She created the O’Connor Advisory Committee to encourage states to abandon direct elections. Her plan, which seeks to “balance the need for fair and impartial courts with the need for public accountability and transparency,” calls for appointment of judges, followed by non-partisan retention elections. 
Across the country, judges campaign based on their conviction rates. Electing judges based on their ability to conform to demand for the death penalty can corrupt the motives of the people we count on to place the rule of law above political self-interest.  When emotions are high, and life and death are at stake, more partisan politics is probably the last thing we need.",,"November 20, 2012 • Post",False
0,Age 19 + No Prior Record + Sloppy Lawyers = Death Sentence,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/age-19-no-prior-record-sloppy-lawyers-death-sentence/,"Anthony Haynes could be executed in Texas on Oct. 18; a teenager with no prior record, he was still given the ultimate penalty thanks to some bad lawyering.","Anthony Haynes, a 19-year-old at the time of the crime with no prior criminal history, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on October 18. 
As noted in this space previously, there were serious issues of racial bias in his case (African American defendant, 11 white jurors, judge cleaning guns during jury selection). There were also bad lawyers and a possibly coerced confession. Despite this, the state of Texas is prepared to put this man to death for a crime he committed as a teenager under the influence of crystal meth. 
Two days before Haynes fatally shot Kent Kincaid, an off-duty police officer, a friend of the family had given him crystal meth. It was Haynes’ first experience with the drug. The same friend wrote in a sworn statement that during those two days Haynes began “talking crazy,” saying he had been unable to sleep for days and thought someone was following him. When Sergeant Kincaid approached Haynes’ car, Haynes’ drug-induced paranoia really kicked in – he believed he would be dragged from the car. He shot and killed Officer Kincaid. 
A doctor who specializes in psychiatry concluded in 2005 that Haynes’ actions that night were inconsistent with previous behavior and his diminished capacity was due to his first-time use of meth. The jury never heard that Haynes had used crystal meth prior to the shooting. 
Sloppy Lawyers 
Predicting “future dangerousness” is a prerequisite for Texas death sentences, and Anthony Haynes’ lawyer failed to offer a strong challenge to the state’s weak case for his future dangerousness.  Without the violence inducing effects of meth, there was little to suggest Haynes would be an ongoing threat. 
Haynes has no previous criminal record. More than 3 dozen friends and family offered to testify about Haynes’ good character and against the claim that Haynes would be a future threat to society. Yet Haynes’ defense lawyer refused most offers of testimony and failed to even interview many family members. 
Haynes’ inadequate representation continued into his habeas corpus appeal. His court appointed habeas lawyer didn’t investigate the failures of his trial lawyer. In a 2006 article in the Austin American-Statesman, the habeas attorney was cited as one of the “sloppy lawyers failing clients on death row”, due to a habit of submitting habeas corpus petitions that were “copied largely verbatim” from the prisoner’s previous appeal. 
A Coerced Confession? 
For Texas to obtain the death penalty in this case, the prosecution also had to prove that Haynes knew Sergeant Kincaid was a police officer at the time of the shooting. Kincaid was off-duty the day of the shooting and was dressed in plain clothes, driving his personal car. In his initial statement, for which he waived his right to have a lawyer present, Haynes confessed to the shooting and to knowing that Kincaid was a police officer. 
Haynes has since maintained that this confession was coerced, and that he did not know Kincaid was an officer. During and before his interrogation, Haynes was not allowed to use the bathroom, eat or rest, and was still feeling the effects of his meth use. As we have all seen recently, it doesn’t always take much to coerce a false confession. Despite Haynes’ allegation that the confession was coerced, the judge allowed it to be used as evidence that led to his being sentenced to death in 1999. 
Stop this execution 
Anthony Haynes should be granted a new sentencing hearing so that the mountains of unheard mitigating evidence can finally be presented. At the least, he should be granted clemency and have his sentence commuted.  Executing Anthony Haynes after such a dubious legal process would be a fundamental injustice.",,"October 5, 2012 • Post",False

In one e-mail exchange between Ayotte and Robert Varsalone, her friend and future political advisor, under the subject “Get ready to run….,” Varsalone discussed Republican campaign chances and possible candidates. 
“Have you been following the last 2 week.  A police officer was killed and I announced that I would seek the death penalty,” Ayotte responded to Varsalone in the Oct 27, 2006 e-mail.

0,110+ Orgs to Biden: End U.S. Program of Lethal Strikes Abroad,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/110-orgs-to-biden-end-u-s-program-of-lethal-strikes-abroad/,"Today, 113 organizations from the United States and around the world sent a letter to President Biden calling for an end to the U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized … ","Today, 113 organizations from the United States and around the world sent a letter to President Biden calling for an end to the U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized battlefields, including through the use of drones. The groups’ focus varies from: human rights; civil rights and civil liberties; racial, social, and environmental justice; humanitarian approaches to foreign policy; faith-based initiatives; peacebuilding; government accountability; veterans’ issues; and the protection of civilians. 
“Successive presidents have now claimed the unilateral power to authorize secretive extrajudicial killing outside any recognized battlefield, with no meaningful accountability for wrongful deaths and civilians lives lost and injured,” reads the letter, which was signed by organizations based in the United States as well as in countries impacted by the program, including Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan. “This program is a centerpiece of the United States’ forever wars and has exacted an appalling toll on Muslim, Brown, and Black communities in multiple parts of the world. Twenty years into a war-based approach that has undermined and violated fundamental rights, we urge you to abandon it and embrace an approach that advances our collective human security” 
The letter calls on the Biden administration to use its ongoing review of the program, as well as the upcoming 20th anniversary of 9/11, as an opportunity to disavow and end the lethal strikes program for good. Read the letter in full here. 
Below are statements from signatories: 
“Time and time again, human rights organizations like Amnesty International have investigated and exposed the human cost of deadly U.S. air strikes instead of the government responsible for committing them. The Biden administration must put an end to this unaccountable killing program if it is going to fulfill its promise to restore US leadership on human rights and to hold itself accountable to families and communities worldwide as well as stateside.” 
— Daphne Eviatar, Director, Security With Human Rights program, Amnesty International USA 
“Our nation has been involved in seemingly endless war for nearly two decades. We are tired of our country using military force as a tool of first resort and the enormous physical and psychological toll this has caused for servicemembers, as well as civilians harmed by our country’s actions abroad. The program of lethal strikes outside even recognized battlefields is central to that war-based approach. An entire generation of veterans and lost civilian lives later, it’s past time for a new way forward.” 
— Garett Reppenhagen, Executive Director, Veterans For Peace  
“The U.S. has been killing people for nearly 20 years in Yemen, but to this day it has not adequately investigated civilian deaths and injuries, or clearly recognized the severe harm caused to families and communities. The Biden administration should break with these damaging practices, and ensure thorough investigation and accountability for harms that have occured.” 
— Radhya al-Mutawakel, Chairperson, Mwatana for Human Rights, Yemen 
“Young people urgently want a livable, peaceful future — not forever wars that degrade our planet, harm Muslim, Brown, and Black communities around the world, and divert attention and resources from existential challenges like climate change. If President Biden is serious about investing in our future and our rights, he must end this lethal program and decades of war-based approaches, and chart a path forward that protects our collective human and environmental security.” 
— Ellen Sciales, Communications Director, Sunrise Movement 
“Because we are all God’s children, the decision to take a life is morally perilous. And, if it is ever justifiable, it must truly be a last resort. Unfortunately, two decades of drone strikes and other lethal acts, often carried out well away from any recognized battlefield, show that rather than using lethal force as a last resort, killing has instead become our government’s default approach to perceived threats.  President Biden must end the policy of using drone strikes and other lethal strikes in order to preemptively address possible threats. Two decades of killing is two decades too many.” 
— Rev. Jimmie Hawkins, Director, Presbyterian Church U.S.A. Office of Public Witness 
“That such a large and diverse set of groups signed this letter shows there’s widespread support for President Biden to end the harmful U.S. program of lethal strikes outside recognized battlefields. For too long, successive presidents have flouted the rights-protecting safeguards of international law and the U.S. system of checks and balances, with devastating consequences for lives and the rule of law. In following through on his promise to end forever wars, President Biden urgently needs to center rights, our collective human security, and adherence to domestic and international law.” 
— Hina Shamsi, Director, ACLU National Security Project 
Other groups signing the letter include: September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA, American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, American Friends Service Committee, Center for Civilians in Conflict, Win Without War, Alliance for Peacebuilding, Saferworld, South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), Women for Afghan Women, and Common Defense.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Prime Minister, 
I write to express my grave concern for the ongoing crackdown on human rights defenders in Thailand, which has seen at least 635 people, including 41 children targeted with criminal proceedings solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Your government continues to indict, put on trial and arbitrarily detain students and other peaceful protesters, including children, under legislation including lèse-majesté and sedition. 
It is distressing to learn that dozens of students and peaceful protesters, including Parit ‘Penguin’ Chiwarak, Anon Numpa, Panupong ‘Mike’ Jadnok, Panusaya ‘Rung’ Sithijirawattanakul, Piyarat ‘Toto’ Chongthep, Chai-amorn ‘Ammy’ Kaewwiboonpan, Pornsorn ‘Fah’ Weerathamjaree, Wanwale ‘Tee’ Thammasattaya and Siraphop ‘Kha Nun’ Phumphuenghphut are at risk of lengthy prison sentences for the peaceful exercise of their human rights during protests. 
I am further concerned about the health and well-being of the detained individuals, especially in light of an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in prison. Specifically, I find it alarming that Anon Numpa, and Panupong ‘Mike’ Jadnok have contracted COVID-19 in detention and have had repeated bail applications denied. This is further worrying as they have been without adequate access to family members or legal counsel. 
It is important that your government upholds Thailand’s international and constitutional human rights obligations and allow people to express their opinions, including on social media, and peacefully participate in public protests. As you will be aware, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have previously found Thai authorities to have breached its international human rights obligations by prosecuting and arbitrarily detaining lèse majesté suspects, including by holding them in unnecessary pre-trial detention and repeatedly denying bail. 
Therefore, I call on you to: 
Sincerely, 
[YOUR NAME]

Dear Acting Secretary Wolf and Acting Director Albence: 
The undersigned organizations write to urge that families held at all three Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) family detention centers be swiftly, safely, and promptly released together following a court order to release all children in ICE facilities by July 17, 2020. We understand that the deadline was extended to July 27, 2020. We strongly object to any plan to place a choice before parents that is no choice at all: indefinite detention with their children in deadly conditions during a global pandemic or possibly permanent separation from them. Parents must be released with their children to preserve family unity, as family separation is not in the best interests of the child. 
  
In her June 26 order directing ICE to release all children detained at its three family detention centers, District Court Judge Dolly Gee described how these facilities are “on fire,” with confirmed cases of COVID-19 and inadequate protective measures, and concluded that “there is no more time for half-measures.”[1] COVID-19 is running rampant in these facilities, which detain children as young as one-year-old. In the Karnes County Residential Center, 34 parents and children of approximately 100 detained have tested positive for COVID-19.[2] In the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, 21 facility staff have tested positive for COVID-19.[3] Despite this, ICE continues to fail to take steps to prevent contagion in these family detention facilities. Sick employees are permitted to come to work, and there are arbitrary contact-tracing and quarantine practices. 
  
Long before the onset of COVID-19, family detention and family separation were roundly criticized by medical and mental health experts for the trauma they inflict on children and their parents.[4] Detention centers are often retraumatizing, and children in detention “may experience developmental delay and poor psychological adjustment” even after they are released; even brief periods of detention can lead to psychological trauma and long-term health risks.[5] Family separation is a form of psychological violence experts have likened to “soul murder,” which inflicts lasting and permanent damage upon children and their parents.[1] The powerful evidence documenting the harm of these practices only underscores the urgency of ending both immediately. 
  
Most families held in prolonged and indefinite detention were wrongfully denied the chance to seek safety because of the unlawful third-country transit ban, which renders ineligible for asylum nearly anyone who traveled through any other country on their way to the United States. In the past two weeks, multiple courts have declared the ban unlawful, and it is now no longer in effect.[2] Detained families must now be afforded the fair chance to seek asylum they never received, and they should be paroled from detention during their asylum proceedings. 
  
We are deeply alarmed that ICE is now on the verge of forcing parents into an impossible and cruel “choice,” as it did in May 2020, when ICE asked detained parents whether they wished to remain detained with their children in unsafe conditions or separate from their children so the children could be released from detention.[3] These families are living with unthinkable fear and anxiety – not knowing if they will be released, if they will contract COVID-19, or if ICE will seek to try to separate them again, as it attempted in mid-May. 
  
ICE has historically exercised its legal authority and discretion to release parents with their children on parole and/or into alternative-to-detention programs. Since the COVID-19 crisis started, Members of Congress, advocates, attorneys, doctors, and members of the public have repeatedly urged ICE to use its legal authority and discretion to release detained families together. 
  
Yet, in the face of this heightened risk of contracting COVID-19, and despite having full authority and discretion to act to save lives, ICE is choosing to pursue an option to separate families. Instead of releasing them together from facilities with confirmed COVID‐19 cases, it is choosing to separate families or keep them locked up together in detention indefinitely. Both traumatize children. Neither is an option. 
  
Family separation produced by this coercive “choice” violates multiple human rights, including the right to family unity, the right to liberty, and the requirement to prioritize the best interests of the child.[4] In some instances, family separation can violate the right to freedom from torture and other ill-treatment.[5] The United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on Torture has denounced any authorities’ “deliberate separation of family members” who are seeking asylum at borders, calling it “refoulement in disguise,” which is “designed to coerce them to ‘voluntarily’ return to their country-of-origin” regardless of their protection needs.[6] 
  
The detention of children is not in their best interests, and their separation from parents is only lawful in exceptional circumstances, such as when a child faces imminent harm. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has categorically called on all states to end the practice of immigration detention of children, and to maintain family unity through alternatives to detention. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has likewise stated that the detention of children is never in a child’s best interests, and can constitute ill-treatment if the detention is due to their or their parents’ immigration status.[7] 
  
These rights violations are entirely avoidable: ICE has the legal authority and discretion – and especially in the pandemic, the obligation – to release families together. ICE can parole or release parents for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.[8] There is surely no more urgent humanitarian reason or significant public benefit than protecting the health of families in ICE’s care and custody during a pandemic. Instead, ICE is inflicting fear and uncertainty upon families and endangering public health. 
  
We urge you to release children together with their parents, and we roundly reject any solution that will result in either the continued detention of families or separations of detained parents from their children. We strongly oppose the development of any protocol for gaining the purported consent of families to separation; any such protocol is inherently coercive, on top of being unnecessary given that ICE has full authority and discretion to release families together on parole and/or into ATD programs. Preserving the unity of these families is in these children’s best interests, and it is also the right and compassionate thing to do. 
  
We therefore call on you to immediately release all detained families together. This administration must not use COVID-19 as an opportunity to deploy its family separation policy again. 
  
Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohammed added their voices to the Free Turkey Media campaign which will culminate in a global day of action on World Press Freedom Day, 3 May. 
“In the purge that followed the failed coup, Turkey has become the world’s biggest jailer of journalists. Many have been held for months and still have no idea of what they’ve been charged with,” said Gauri van Gulik Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director. 
“In the wake of this month’s constitutional referendum, Turkey needs a free media now more than ever and this campaign will show that the world has not forgotten the scores of journalists languishing in jail.” 
The campaign, run by Amnesty International with the support of PEN, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Index on Censorship and numerous other organizations, encourages individuals to show support by posting a ‘selfie’ while holding a sign with the hashtag #FreeTurkeyMedia. Among those that have already backed the movement are artist Ai Weiwei, while dozens of cartoonists around the world are submitting work which will be judged by a panel including cartoonists Zunar, Steve Bell and Martin Rowson. 
“If it was right to demand freedom for the Al Jazeera journalists, it is right to demand #FreeTurkeyMedia,” said Peter Greste in a tweet.

0,Partisan Election of Judges + Death Penalty = Bad Idea,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/partisan-election-of-judges-death-penalty-bad-idea/,Most states elect judges in partisan elections; this can cause a conflict between appealing to voters and upholding the rule of law. Can we do better?," 
On November 6th, Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Sharon Keller was re-elected despite previously facing removal from the bench over a case in which she refused an after-hours appeal by a death row inmate who was executed later that night. 
The election of judges based on popular vote is not unique to Texas, though it is one of only 8 states that choose judges for its highest courts with partisan elections. 
But 39 states elect at least some judges by popular vote. Since this approach is implemented in most of the United States, it is important to evaluate whether picking judges this way is a good idea. Proponents of electing judges argue that it is more democratic than having them appointed, and that it makes judges directly accountable to the people.  But, especially for death penalty cases which as high profile crimes are usually deeply politicized to begin with, how fair and accurate can judges be when they are beholden, not just to the law, but also to voters? 
Electing judges by popular vote makes them politicians, with all that entails: campaigning, fundraising, partisan loyalties, etc. Concerns about the practice of electing judges have been raised since the 1990s when Stephen B. Bright, President of the Southern Center for Human Rights published a groundbreaking study in 1995 focusing on the prominence of the death penalty in the election, retention and promotion of judges.  The report called “for open and honest discussion of the political pressures on judges who must stand for election and retention.” 
Retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor has taken up the call, arguing that “what you get these days is large campaign contributions when you have elections. And I don’t think we should have any cash in our courtrooms.” She created the O’Connor Advisory Committee to encourage states to abandon direct elections. Her plan, which seeks to “balance the need for fair and impartial courts with the need for public accountability and transparency,” calls for appointment of judges, followed by non-partisan retention elections. 
Across the country, judges campaign based on their conviction rates. Electing judges based on their ability to conform to demand for the death penalty can corrupt the motives of the people we count on to place the rule of law above political self-interest.  When emotions are high, and life and death are at stake, more partisan politics is probably the last thing we need.",,"November 20, 2012 • Post",False
0,Age 19 + No Prior Record + Sloppy Lawyers = Death Sentence,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/age-19-no-prior-record-sloppy-lawyers-death-sentence/,"Anthony Haynes could be executed in Texas on Oct. 18; a teenager with no prior record, he was still given the ultimate penalty thanks to some bad lawyering.","Anthony Haynes, a 19-year-old at the time of the crime with no prior criminal history, is scheduled to be executed in Texas on October 18. 
As noted in this space previously, there were serious issues of racial bias in his case (African American defendant, 11 white jurors, judge cleaning guns during jury selection). There were also bad lawyers and a possibly coerced confession. Despite this, the state of Texas is prepared to put this man to death for a crime he committed as a teenager under the influence of crystal meth. 
Two days before Haynes fatally shot Kent Kincaid, an off-duty police officer, a friend of the family had given him crystal meth. It was Haynes’ first experience with the drug. The same friend wrote in a sworn statement that during those two days Haynes began “talking crazy,” saying he had been unable to sleep for days and thought someone was following him. When Sergeant Kincaid approached Haynes’ car, Haynes’ drug-induced paranoia really kicked in – he believed he would be dragged from the car. He shot and killed Officer Kincaid. 
A doctor who specializes in psychiatry concluded in 2005 that Haynes’ actions that night were inconsistent with previous behavior and his diminished capacity was due to his first-time use of meth. The jury never heard that Haynes had used crystal meth prior to the shooting. 
Sloppy Lawyers 
Predicting “future dangerousness” is a prerequisite for Texas death sentences, and Anthony Haynes’ lawyer failed to offer a strong challenge to the state’s weak case for his future dangerousness.  Without the violence inducing effects of meth, there was little to suggest Haynes would be an ongoing threat. 
Haynes has no previous criminal record. More than 3 dozen friends and family offered to testify about Haynes’ good character and against the claim that Haynes would be a future threat to society. Yet Haynes’ defense lawyer refused most offers of testimony and failed to even interview many family members. 
Haynes’ inadequate representation continued into his habeas corpus appeal. His court appointed habeas lawyer didn’t investigate the failures of his trial lawyer. In a 2006 article in the Austin American-Statesman, the habeas attorney was cited as one of the “sloppy lawyers failing clients on death row”, due to a habit of submitting habeas corpus petitions that were “copied largely verbatim” from the prisoner’s previous appeal. 
A Coerced Confession? 
For Texas to obtain the death penalty in this case, the prosecution also had to prove that Haynes knew Sergeant Kincaid was a police officer at the time of the shooting. Kincaid was off-duty the day of the shooting and was dressed in plain clothes, driving his personal car. In his initial statement, for which he waived his right to have a lawyer present, Haynes confessed to the shooting and to knowing that Kincaid was a police officer. 
Haynes has since maintained that this confession was coerced, and that he did not know Kincaid was an officer. During and before his interrogation, Haynes was not allowed to use the bathroom, eat or rest, and was still feeling the effects of his meth use. As we have all seen recently, it doesn’t always take much to coerce a false confession. Despite Haynes’ allegation that the confession was coerced, the judge allowed it to be used as evidence that led to his being sentenced to death in 1999. 
Stop this execution 
Anthony Haynes should be granted a new sentencing hearing so that the mountains of unheard mitigating evidence can finally be presented. At the least, he should be granted clemency and have his sentence commuted.  Executing Anthony Haynes after such a dubious legal process would be a fundamental injustice.",,"October 5, 2012 • Post",False

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
I am alarmed to learn that Hussein Abo al-Kheir, a Jordanian national and father of eight is at imminent risk of execution following the authorities’ resumption of executions for drug-related offences. This contravenes the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) decision 36/2022, issued in October 2022, which found that he is arbitrarily detained and called for his death sentenced to be quashed and his ‘immediate and unconditional release.’ 
Hussein Abo al-Kheir was arrested on 18 May 2014 by customs officials while crossing the Durra border from Jordan to Saudi Arabia for alleged drug smuggling. Upon arrest, he was held in incommunicado detention at an unknown location by the Durra counter-narcotics authority for a period of 12 days. He was only allowed to contact his family two weeks after his arrest. 
During this period and throughout his pre-trial detention, Hussein Abo al-Kheir said that he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment to extract his “confession”, including being suspended from his feet, and subjected to beatings and insults. Abo al-Kheir retracted his confession before the Tabuk Criminal Court on 15 December 2014 and again on 6 July 2017, stipulating that the authorities had tortured him into signing the “confession” with his fingerprint because he was beaten to the point that he could not hold a pen. Despite his request for a medical report before the court on 6 July 2017, his torture allegations were never investigated. 
During his pre-trial detention and trial proceedings, Abo al-Kheir had no access to legal representation or consular assistance. 
We call on Your Majesty to not ratify the death sentence of Hussein Abo al-Kheir and the competent authorities to quash his conviction and re-try him in proceedings that are fully consistent with international fair trial standards, without resort to the death penalty. Furthermore, I call on you to order a prompt, impartial, independent, and effective investigation into Abo al-Kheir’s claims of torture and other ill-treatment. I also call on you to declare an official moratorium on all executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia.

Dear President, 
I am writing to you to express my deep concerns regarding the ongoing arbitrarily detention of Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and urge you to ensure his immediate and unconditional release. His physical and mental health gravely deteriorated after he started a hunger strike in April 2022 to protest his unjust imprisonment and denial of consular visits, escalating it to a water strike on 6 November, the first day of the UN Global Climate Change Conference (COP27). The Egyptian authorities held him incommunicado for two weeks, barring all visits and written correspondence. Security forces prevented his lawyer from seeing him on three occasions between 10 and 14 November ignoring authorizations from the public prosecution. His relatives were finally allowed a visit, through a glass window on 17 November and reported that he was “exhausted, weak and vulnerable”. He recounted a disturbing episode which took place on 8 November and involved prison officials restraining him after he became increasingly distressed, banged his head against the wall and threatened to commit suicide due to the prison authorities’ refusal to record his hunger and water strike. The following day, 9 November, he again banged him head against the wall to compel the authorities to take action. The following day, an investigator from the prosecution questioned him and recorded his hunger strike and demands. On 11 November, he lost consciousness in the shower, and when he regained it, he was held by a cellmate, surrounded by a large crowd and had a tube inserted into his body. Following this near-death experience, he decided not to resume his hunger strike immediately, but vowed to continue if “ there continues to be no real movement on his case”. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker immediately and unconditionally, as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. In the meantime, the Egyptian authorities must allow lawyers and UK consular officials to immediately visit him. The authorities must protect him from torture and other ill-treatment and urgently grant him access to adequate healthcare, at a facility of his family’s choice where he can be treated by qualified medical professionals in compliance with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy and informed consent.

Dear President, 
I am writing to express my deep concerns for the fate of arbitrarily detained Egyptian-British activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and urge you for his immediate release. For over 200 days, he has been consuming only 100 calories daily to protest his unjust imprisonment and denial of consular visits. On 31 October, in a letter to his family, he announced that he was escalating his hunger strike by stopping any calorie intake on 1 November and stopping water consumption on 6 November. The authorities’ have refused to either allow Alaa’s family or lawyer to see or contact him or to provide detailed information about his health, fate and whereabouts. The authorities have barred any family contact since 31 October. Between 7-9 November, Laila Soueif – Alaa’s mother – has been going to Wadi al-Natrun prison daily to deliver correspondence and collect a letter from her son and leaving without news. On 10 November, a security officer told her that a “medical intervention” had taken place with the knowledge of the judicial authorities but provided no further details and instructed her to no longer come to the prison. Security officers denied Alaa’ lawyer access to him on 10 November, ignoring an authorization by the public prosecution issued on the evening of 9 November. Given the well-documented patterns on the denial of adequate healthcare in prison, I am concerned that medical decisions over Alaa’s healthcare are not being made by independent medical professionals in compliance with medical ethics and free from coercion or interference by the authorities. 
Alaa Abdel Fattah was last arrested in September 2019, subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and convicted by an emergency court in December 2021 of bogus charges stemming solely from the peaceful exercise of his human rights. He is a prisoner of conscience, who should not have ever been detained. The Egyptian authorities are ultimately responsible for his life. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker immediately and unconditionally, as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. In the meantime, the Egyptian authorities must immediately disclose information about Alaa’s health and his whereabouts, and allow his family, lawyers, and UK consular officials to immediately visit him and permit regular phone calls. The authorities must protect him from torture and other ill-treatment and urgently grant him access to adequate healthcare, at a facility of his family’s choice where he can be treated by qualified medical professionals in compliance with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy, and informed consent.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr. A.R.P.J. Alwis, 
I am deeply concerned about the situation of student leaders Galwewa Siridhamma Thero and Wasantha Mudalige, who have been detained since 18 August 2022 and had their detention extended for 90 days on 21 August 2022 under the draconian anti-terror law Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). 
I find it alarming that they have been held under squalid conditions and denied due process and fair trial rights. Their families fear for their safety and health while in detention. Siridhamma Thero has contracted dengue fever while in custody and was later hospitalised with high fever. Detaining protesters using terror charges is a clear violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sri Lanka is a state party. 
Using a draconian law—which the government itself has committed to reform—to crackdown on protesters is against Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations, especially relating to the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. This points to the environment of systematic crackdown and stifling of dissenting voices against the background of the current economic hardship in the country. 
As people in Sri Lanka face the brunt of the ongoing economic crisis, they have the right to express their opinions and call for accountability including through peaceful protests. 
I, therefore, urge you to immediately drop all terror related charges against Galwewa Siridhamma Thero and Wasantha Mudalige. In the meantime, I urge you to ensure their access to prompt and regular medical care as necessary. 
I also call on the Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which does not meet international human rights standards, and to uphold the commitment to end its use. The authorities should immediately review the detention of others held under the PTA, ensuring adequate access to fair bail hearings, and immediate release for all those not facing internationally recognizable charges.

Your Excellency, 
Human rights lawyer Hoda Abdelmoniem has been arbitrarily detained for four years, solely in relation to her human rights work. After spending 35 months in pre-trial detention, the Supreme State Security Prosecution referred her to trial in front of an Emergency State Security Court (ESSC). She is charged with joining, financing and supporting a “terrorist group” and disseminating news on social media in order to incite violence against state institutions in relation to accusations of human rights violations by security forces published on a Facebook page titled “the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms”. Proceedings by the ESSCs, which are special courts activated when there is a state of emergency, are inherently unfair as their verdicts are not subject to appeal. Her right to adequate defence has also been violated, as she is banned from meeting with her lawyer except in court. The trial began on 11 September and is still ongoing. During a court hearing held on 15 October, Hoda Abdelmoniem briefly told her husband about her worsening conditions of detention but had no opportunity to provide further details. 
On 23 August 2022, Hoda Abdelmoniem’s husband and daughters were allowed to visit her in prison for the first time since her arrest. The visit, which lasted 25 minutes, took place in the presence of security officers which prevented her from speaking freely. She has a heart condition, kidney disease, arterial thrombosis, and high blood pressure, and said in court in October 2021 that a prison doctor recommended for her to have a cardiac catheterization. Despite this, officials at the al-Qanater Prison for women, where she is held, continue to refuse her transfer to an outside hospital for treatment and deny her relatives, access to her medical records, further raising their anguish about her health. 
In light of the above, I urge you to ensure that Hoda Abdelmoniem is immediately and unconditionally released and all charges against her are dropped as her detention and prosecution stem solely from her human rights work. Pending her release, I call on you to ensure that she is provided with the means to regularly communicate with her family and lawyers, has access to adequate health care, including outside of prison when needed, and is provided with her medical records. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Governor Parson, 
The State of Missouri is planning to execute Kevin Johnson on 29 November 2022. A jury sentenced him to death in late 2007 for the July 2005 murder of a Kirkwood police officer. The crime was undoubtedly serious, but I urge you to consider the circumstances that preceded it – the sudden death of Kevin Johnson’s younger brother on the same day as the shooting, as well as Kevin’s traumatic childhood and psychosocial (mental) disabilities. 
Kevin Johnson has a history of auditory hallucinations and severe depression that started at the age of six. He had suicidal ideation and attempted suicide as a young teenager. The defence lawyers did not present any expert mental health evidence about Kevin Johnson’s mental state at the time of the shooting. Given that the jury at his first (hung) trial in early 2007 were just two votes from convicting him of second-degree murder, the fact that the jury at the second trial were denied such expert evidence is particularly troubling. Indeed in 2016, a neuropsychologist concluded that the combination of psychological disorders and impaired frontal lobe functioning meant that Kevin Johnson’s “moral compass was effectively offline” when he shot the police officer after the death of his younger brother, and that such information “could have been raised as a mitigating issue with regard to his moral culpability at the time of the offense”. 
Under the US Constitution, the death penalty must be “limited to those offenders… whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution” (Roper v. Simmons, 2005). I ask you to consider how the execution of someone who was just 19 years old at the time of the crime, emerging from a childhood of appalling deprivation, neglect and sexual and physical abuse, and with mental disabilities that may have impacted his ability to deliberate at the time of the shooting, meets this standard. 
Please stop this execution and commute Kevin Johnson’s death sentence. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express concern over the arbitrary detention of human rights defender Rida Benotmane merely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. 
On 9 September, the National Judicial Police Brigade (BNPJ) in Casablanca interrogated Rida Benotmane over a Facebook post he published on 13 September 2021, which called for a public march against abuses by security forces and two YouTube videos from 2021, in which he criticized the authorities for ignoring people’s demands for social justice and warned against the authorities’ use of vaccine passes as a tool of repression. The BNJP arrested Rida Benotmane and detained him in Arjate 1 prison, over 30km from where he and his family live in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, where he remains. His appeals hearing has been rescheduled several times and is now due to take place on 31 October 2022. 
On 10 September, the King’s prosecutor in the Rabat First Instance Court charged Rida Benotmane with “insulting a body regulated by law”, “insulting public officials while carrying out their duties”, and “broadcasting and distributing false allegations without consent” under articles 265, 263, and 447-2 of the Penal Code respectively. He was also charged with breaching the decree law on the state of health emergency because he criticized the use of the vaccine pass, saying that it could be used by the authorities to restrict freedoms. 
Rida Benotmane’s detention is emblematic of Morocco’s crackdown on critical voices and its recourse to arbitrary detentions to silence peaceful dissent. His detention violates the right to freedom of expression, as guaranteed by both international human rights law and the Moroccan constitution, which states in Chapter 25 that freedom of thought and expression is guaranteed in all its forms. 
Considering the above, I urge you to ensure that Rida Benotmane is immediately and unconditionally released, and that all charges against him are dropped. I also urge you to ensure that the prosecution of journalists, bloggers, and human rights defenders for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression is brought to an end and all criminal investigations against them are dropped. Finally, I urge you to ensure the amendment or repeal of all laws which punish the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression, including Articles 263 and 265 of the Penal Code.

I am writing to raise concerns about the ongoing detention of whistle-blower and anti-corruption activist Mohamed Benhlima, a 33-year-former military official, who’s been detained in El-Blida military prison since April 28, 2022. He remains held in solitary confinement, granted 10-minute breaks per day and continuously denied any contact with other prisoners. Officers at El Blida military prison have also banned him from receiving meals, clothes and even books provided by his family. 
He was sentenced to death in absentia in 2021, while still an asylum seeker in Spain, on charges of espionage and desertion. On September 4, 2022, an Algiers appeal court upheld the conviction and sentenced him to a total of twelve years in prison in three different cases. He stood charges for “participation in a terrorist group” (Article 87bis 3 of the Penal Code) and “publishing fake news undermining national unity” (Art.196 bis). On June 19, 2022, he had testified in front of a judge in Kolea court that military security agents in S’hawla intelligence center in Algiers subjected him to torture and other ill-treatment for many days straight after his refoulement to Algeria on March 24, 2022. The allegations include him being stripped naked and freezing water poured on his body. The Algerian authorities did not publicly share proof of a formal investigation into Mohamed Benhlima’s claims of torture and other ill-treatment taking place despite his family formally requesting an investigation in a letter they addressed to the Algerian authorities on June 25, 2022. The prison administration also practice discrimination against him and his family as they leave them waiting until the official visit time is almost over and that all other families have finished their visits before allowing them to see him for less than 10 minutes and in the presence of guards. several acts of intimidation against them. They reported unnecessary questioning by El Blida prison staff following every visit paid to Mohamed Benhlima. 
I urge you to ensure the immediate release of Mohamed Benhlima, to quash his death sentence in absentia, and to drop all the charges against him as they are based solely on the exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is removed from solitary confinement and that he is held in conditions meeting international standards and protected from torture and other ill-treatment. Finally, I urge you to continue to grant him, meanwhile, the right to regularly communicate with his family and lawyers and to refrain from any act of intimidation against them.

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
I am alarmed to learn that 10 Egyptian Nubian men were sentenced to prison terms ranging between 10 to 18 years by the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) in the capital Riyadh on 10 October. According to one of the men’s relatives, they were sentenced under Articles 34, 43, and 44 of Saudi Arabia’s Counter-Terrorism Law on charges of establishing an association without a license, showing solidarity with the Muslim Brotherhood and posting on social media. The families of the 10 men were prevented from attending the sentencing hearing. According to one of the men’s relatives, some of them are older and suffer from health problems, such as diabetes and cardiovascular issues. 
On 14 July 2020, the 10 men were arrested by the Saudi General Directorate of Investigation (al-Mabahith) in relation to a cultural event they had planned on 25 October 2019 to mark the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. They were detained incommunicado with no access to their lawyers or family members for the first two months of their detention. The 10 men attended their first hearing before the SCC on 10 November 2021, where they met their lawyer for the first time in almost 16 months. At the second hearing, which took place on 24 January 2022, the defence statement included allegations that the confessions provided by the men were extracted under coercion. The prosecution objected to this paragraph and the judge ordered the defence lawyer to amend it. 
I urge you to release all ten men immediately as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I call on you to ensure that they have full access to medical care, lawyers of their choice and regular contact with their families. Furthermore, I urge you to protect minorities of all ethnic, cultural, and linguistic identities, and grant them their basic human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association in Saudi Arabia.

Dear Mr. President, 
I am appalled by the continued unlawful detention of human rights lawyer, Tony Germain Nkina, whose conviction on trumped-up charges was upheld by the Court of Appeal of Ngozi a year ago, on September 29, 2021. He appealed this decision through the Supreme Court’s cassation proceeding. The hearing at the Supreme Court is scheduled for October 7, 2022. Tony Germain Nkina was sentenced to five-year imprisonment by the Court of Kayanza on June 15, 2021 and a fine of one million Burundian francs ($USD 500). 
He was arrested on October 13, 2020, in Kayanza province, northern Burundi, and accused of collaborating with the armed opposition group, RED-Tabara while visiting a client in Kabarore commune and advising him on a land dispute case. He remains held in Ngozi prison in northern Burundi. 
During the appeal hearing, the prosecution failed again to substantiate allegations that Tony Germain Nkina was linked in any way to RED-Tabara or produce any witness to support their case against the lawyer. 
In a statement issued on October 8, 2021, Amnesty International and five other human rights organizations denounced the decision of the Court of Appeal and pointed to the fact that Burundi continues on a sad path of shrinking civic space despite your multiple promises of a positive change in upholding its human rights obligations since your inauguration in June 2020. 
I call upon you to ensure that Tony Germain Nkina is immediately and unconditionally released and that all the charges against him are immediately dropped. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he has full access to his lawyers and family and is protected from torture and other ill-treatment.

Dear Minister of Justice, 
I write to you to urge you to reinstate the 57 judges and prosecutors arbitrarily dismissed on vague grounds that included obstructing terrorism-related investigations, financial corruption, “moral corruption,” and “adultery by President Kais Saied on June 1, including the 49 judges, as ordered by the Tunis Administrative Tribunal which reversed their dismissal. Those men and women should benefit, like any other citizen, from the protection of the rule of law and have their rights to work and to fair trial reinstated as ordered by the court. Instead, they are currently at the mercy of the government’s arbitrary measures. 
In the Tunis Administrative Tribunal’s ruling on the cases of the 49 judges and prosecutors on 10 August, the tribunal found that the government had “made the contested decision without informing the judges of the allegations against them, which is a serious breach of defence rights, the presumption of innocence and fair trial guarantees set forth in the Tunisian constitution and laws.” The tribunal further stated that the dismissal amounts to a “Damocles sword for judges, undermines the independence of the judiciary …and seriously violates their reputation and right to work….” 
Among the 49 judges and prosecutors, whose dismissal was suspended by the administrative tribunal, are Hamadi Rahmani, magistrate counselor at the Court of Cassation; Mohamed Taher Kanzari, juvenile affairs judge in the Court of Siliana; and Ramzi Bahria, assistant prosecutor in the Mahdia First Instance Tribunal. On 22 June, the three went on hunger strike (Hamadi Rahmani and Ramzi Bahria for 15 days and Mohamed Taher Kanzari for 36 days) to protest their arbitrary dismissal. They told Amnesty International that the Ministry of Justice had not at any point informed them of the grounds for their dismissal and they had not had access to review any official document or evidence against them or challenge it. All three said they were shocked when they heard the news of their dismissal which they learned through social media or colleagues. The authorities did not provide them with a written reasoned decision, access to their disciplinary or judicial files to review any evidence against them, or a means of appeal the denial of these rights. The dismissed judges and prosecutors have been denied their right to work, and have been without their salaries, and medical coverage for over three months. 
I therefore urge you to immediately reinstate the judges and prosecutors arbitrarily dismissed as their revocation is an assault on the independence of the judiciary.

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
I am alarmed to learn that Salma al-Shehab, an academic and activist, was sentenced to 34 years in prison followed by a 34-year travel ban, by the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on August 9, 2022. 
On January 14, 2021, she was arrested at the General Directorate of Investigations after she was called in for interrogation a few days before she was due to go back to the United Kingdom to continue her PhD studies at the University of Leeds. 
Salma al-Shehab’s trial began on October 25, 2021, and according to court documents reviewed by Amnesty International, she was detained in solitary confinement for 285 days before she was brought to trial, in violation of international standards and Saudi Arabia’s own Law on Criminal Procedures. She had no access to legal representation throughout her pre-trial detention, including during interrogations. 
In mid-2022, Salma al-Shehab was initially sentenced to six years in prison under the counter-terrorism law. At her appeal trial, the prosecution demanded a harsher punishment. Her sentence was increased to 34 years based on the discretion of the judge, after her initial sentence was overturned and she was convicted of “supporting those who seek to disrupt public order, destabilize security and the stability of the state” and publishing tweets that “disturb public order, destabilize the security of society and the stability of the state” under the counterterrorism and anti-cybercrime laws. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Salma al-Shehab and quash her conviction as she is being held solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression. I also call on you to stop equating free speech with “terrorism”, and repeal or substantially amend the counterterrorism and anti-cybercrime laws that criminalize dissent and enact new laws that are fully compatible with international human rights law and standards.

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, 
On August 4, 2021, Ali Maziad, a 58-year-old Lebanese Shia Muslim man, was abducted from his house in the Saudi capital, Riyadh by a group of seven men in civilian clothes. His fate and whereabouts have been unknown since then. 
Ali Maziad’s family told Amnesty International that they immediately contacted several police stations and government agencies in Saudi Arabia to seek information about his fate and whereabouts, but the authorities provided no information to the family. In November 2021, over three months after Ali Maziad’s disappearance, the Lebanese Embassy in Riyadh informed the family that he was being detained by Saudi Arabia’s State Security without having any further information. “We don’t even know if he is alive. We haven’t had any contact with him since they [group of men] took him away,” Ali Maziad’s relative told Amnesty International. 
Ali Maziad has been living and working in Saudi Arabia intermittently since 2004. According to his family, he takes medications to treat several health illnesses. Ali Maziad’s relative told Amnesty International: “His cancer recurrence requires proper health care and follow up. He also has diabetes, irregular heartbeats, and glaucoma—all of which requires medication.” 
I urge you to immediately disclose the fate and whereabouts of Ali Maziad and release him. In the meantime, I call on you to ensure that he has adequate access to health care, a lawyer of his choice and regular contact with his family.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to you about the unjust imprisonment of researcher and anthropology master’s student Ahmed Samir Santawy, who was convicted on July 4, 2022, on retrial by a Misdemeanours Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) of spreading “false news to undermine the state, its national interests and public order and spread panic among the people”, the same charge of which he was convicted by an ESSC in his initial trial on June 22, 2021. The court reduced his prison sentence from four to three years’ imprisonment. Proceedings in front of the ESSCs are inherently unfair and its verdicts cannot be appealed, they are only subject to authorization by the president. 
After President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered Ahmed Samir Santawy’s retrial on February 16, 2022, a new trial started on February 21, 2022, again in front of an ESSC. His right to a fair trial was violated throughout both proceedings, including his right to have the conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal and to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense, since his lawyers were not allowed to meet with him in private throughout the pre-trial and trial proceedings. His conviction on retrial is solely based on social media posts criticizing human rights violations in Egyptian prisons and the state’s mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that he denied writing. Regardless of the author of the posts, criminalizing the dissemination of information based on vague concepts such as “false news” is contrary to the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution and international human rights law. 
Ahmed Samir Santawy is held in Mazraet Tora prison, part of the Tora Prison Complex south of Cairo, in a small windowless cell he shares with another prisoner. When his family last saw him on July 16, 2022, he complained of a high fever and recurrent vomiting for days, amid reports about the renewed spread of COVID-19 in the prison and the closure of the prison hospital. Amnesty International learned from informed sources that authorities have not transferred him, or other ill prisoners held in the Tora Prison Complex, to outside hospitals in recent weeks. 
I urge you to quash Ahmed Samir Santawy’s conviction and sentence and release him immediately and unconditionally as he is a prisoner of conscience held solely for peacefully exercising his human rights. Pending his release, he must be granted access to his family, lawyers and any healthcare he may require, including outside prison if necessary.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to raise concern about torture allegations made by whistleblower Mohamed Benhlima, who has been in solitary confinement in El-Blida military prison since April 28, 2022. He is being held in a small cell with only 10-minute breaks daily without any contact with other prisoners. On June 19, 2022, he testified in front of the judge in Kolea court that military security agents in S’hawla intelligence center in Algiers subjected him to torture and other ill-treatment for many days after his refoulement to Algeria on March 24, 2022. The allegations include him being stripped naked and freezing water poured on his body. 
During their bi-weekly visits, his family reported visible weight loss, pale face and dark circles under his eyes. During the June 19, 2022, visit, his family noticed his moustache was plucked, not shaved, and both his hands and arms had many little holes as if his skin had been pierced by what could have been a nail clipper or a hot instrument. His family requested an investigation into the torture allegations in a letter that they addressed to the Algerian authorities including the Military Attorney General, the President of the Republic, and the Minister of Justice on June 25, 2022. In the same letter, the family complained about the conditions of the bi-weekly visits they are allowed to pay him in El Blida military prison. The prison administration leaves the family waiting until the official visit time is almost over and that all other families have finished their visits before allowing Mohamed Benhlima’s family to see him for less than 10 minutes and in the presence of guards. 
On June 19 and 22, Algerian national television aired new videos of Mohamed Benhlima entitled “new confession from terrorist Benhlima”. These videos, deemed defamatory by his lawyers, gravely violate his rights to privacy and a fair trial, and jeopardise the investigation process. 
I urge you to ensure the immediate release of Mohamed Benhlima, end his prosecution under charges stemming from the exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and quash the death sentence against him. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is held in conditions meeting international standards and protected from torture and other ill-treatment. Finally, I urge you to continue to grant him the right to regularly communicate with his family and lawyers and refrain from any form of intimidation against his defense team.

“The Biden administration must stop its brazen support of shocking crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by its allies, knowingly facilitating rampant abuses with impunity,” said Paul O’Brien, Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director. 
“President Biden must seize this opportunity to prioritize the advancement of human rights over short-term interests, and make clear that there can be no double standards when it comes to promoting human rights. If the U.S. continues on its current course, it will only embolden abusive governments to further silence dissenting voices, oppress minorities and ruthlessly crush the rights of millions of people in the region.” 
Israel, the OPT, and the Palestinian authorities: U.S.-backed apartheid 
The killing of Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh while covering an Israeli military raid in the West Bank on May 11 provided a stark reminder of the crimes committed by the Israeli authorities to maintain their system of oppression and domination over Palestinians and of the U.S.’s role in shielding Israel from accountability. Unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment, collective punishment and forced displacement occur in the context of a system of apartheid against Palestinians across Israel and the OPT. 
The Israeli government has forcibly displaced entire Palestinian communities and demolished hundreds of thousands of Palestinian homes. In Masafer Yatta, in the southern West Bank, and in Ras Jrabah, in the Naqab/Negev area of Israel, residents are at imminent risk of forced displacement. During the latest armed conflict in the Gaza Strip in May 2021, Israeli forces committed apparent war crimes, leaving hundreds dead and thousands injured. Hospitals, homes and other essential infrastructure cannot be rebuilt because of Israel’s blockade on Gaza since 2007. 
“The lack of accountability for the government of Israel’s serious violations, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, is perpetuated by U.S. policy. Instead of providing cover for impunity, the US must support independent, thorough, and credible investigations into these crimes, such as that opened by the International Criminal Court,” said Paul O’Brien. 
The Biden administration and U.S. Congress must stop the supply of arms to the Israeli military until it is guaranteed that such equipment would not be used for serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. 
Palestinian authorities continue to repress freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Security forces responded to protests against the torture and killing of Nizar Banat, a political critic, on June 24, 2021, with the use of unlawful force, arrests and torture and other ill-treatment. 
Saudi Arabia: Vicious abuses behind shiny façade 
Saudi Arabian authorities continue their crackdown on the rights to freedom of expression, association, and movement. By mid-2021, most human rights defenders, including women’s rights activists, independent journalists, writers and activists in the country had been arbitrarily detained for their human rights work or social media activity. 
Amnesty International documented 30 cases of Saudi Arabian activists and human rights defenders who were sentenced following grossly unfair trials – most often by the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) –  to imprisonment to be followed by travel bans. Relatives of activists have also been subjected to unofficial travel bans without any judicial orders or notification. 
More than three years after the state-sanctioned murder of Jamal Khashoggi, his family have no information about the whereabouts of his remains while all those involved in his killing have not been held accountable. 
Amnesty International urges President Biden to pressure Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all activists and human rights defenders held for peacefully exercising their human rights, lift all arbitrary travel bans imposed on them and their family members for the purpose of punishing, intimidating and silencing those who dissent and disclose the whereabouts of Khashoggi’s remains. 
The United States must stop supplying arms to the Saudi-led coalition until there is no longer a substantial risk that such equipment would be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law in Yemen. Amnesty International has investigated dozens of air strikes that have unlawfully killed and injured civilians and repeatedly found and identified remnants of U.S.-manufactured munitions. 
Egypt: Deep-rooted human rights crisis 
In Egypt, authorities have intensified a campaign to cover up their appalling human rights record ahead of the country’s hosting of COP27 later this year. 
Egypt’s human rights crisis is characterized by entrenched impunity for unlawful killings, torture and enforced disappearances; mass arbitrary detentions; repression of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly; discrimination against women and girls, LGBTQ+ people and members of religious minorities; and a crackdown on human rights NGOs through travel bans, asset freezes and other draconian tactics to shut down civic work. Despite this, Egypt remains one of the largest long-term recipients of U.S. military aid. 
In recent months, authorities released dozens of prisoners held for political reasons but thousands continue to be arbitrarily detained while arrests of peaceful critics continue unabated. 
Amnesty International urges President Biden to press Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in public as well as privately, for meaningful and long-lasting human rights reforms, starting by immediately and unconditionally releasing all those arbitrarily detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights or for reasons of discrimination. 
President Biden must also urge the Egyptian authorities to close once and for all criminal investigations into the work of human rights NGOs, known as Case 173/2011, lift all arbitrary travel bans and asset freezes against human rights defenders, and guarantee a safe environment for human rights organizations.

“Protection from gender-based violence should be a priority for all states in the Americas, as should the protection of those fleeing massive human rights violations in their countries of origin. Instead, Venezuelan refugee women are facing a double and brutal lack of protection, as our report on the situation in Colombia and Peru reveals,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
More than six million people have fled Venezuela in recent years because of massive human rights violations. Colombia and Peru have received the largest numbers of Venezuelans, together hosting more than 50% of all those who have fled Venezuela (1.84 million and 1.29 million respectively). Amnesty International believes that Venezuelans are in need of international protection and have the right to request that their refugee status be recognized. 
This new report highlights how Venezuelan refugee women, who represent 50% and 58% of the Venezuelan population in Colombia and Peru respectively, face violence and discrimination in all aspects of their lives because of their gender and nationality. In public spaces, they face attacks both along the migration routes and in the places where they settle. In the family, they face economic, patrimonial, physical and sexual violence, predominantly from partners or former partners. And in the work environment, they experience various forms of violence and labour exploitation, including being co-opted for work for the purpose of sexual exploitation. 
Faced with this pervasive violence, Amnesty International has concluded that the Colombian and Peruvian states are manifestly not complying with their obligation to guarantee a life free from violence and discrimination to Venezuelan refugee women, or to guarantee access to justice for survivors of gender-based violence. 
“Many Venezuelan women who are victims of male violence and whose lives are at risk prefer not to report for fear of being expelled from the country owing to their documentation status. The violence and risks they face are exacerbated by the absence of specialized protocols to support and protect them. Regularizing their migration status is a fundamental step so that they can report the violence they experience,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru. 
Extensive research was carried out during the first half of 2022, virtually and in the field, including visits to Lima and Tumbes in Peru, and Bogotá, Cúcuta and Soacha in Colombia. For this report, Amnesty International interviewed 63 Venezuelan refugee women and conducted 45 research interviews with civil society organizations, including Venezuelan women’s organizations; international agencies, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and UN Women; and state institutions. 
According to official figures, gender-based violence against Venezuelan refugee women in Colombia increased by 71% between 2018 and 2020, and in Peru by 31% between 2019 and 2021. Xenophobia, migration status, myths about foreign nationals causing security issues, and prejudices related to women’s perceived sexuality, coupled with socially predetermined gender roles, increase the risks faced by Venezuelan refugee women. 
The report reveals multiple areas where the state has failed to ensure protection in both Colombia and Peru. Firstly, Venezuelan women do not have effective access to international protection and migration regularization processes, which constitutes a primary and significant obstacle to ensuring protection of their other rights. 
Secondly, the Colombian and Peruvian states do not guarantee the right of Venezuelan women to access justice and health services without discrimination. Among many shortcomings in state responses in both countries, the research exposes the lack of awareness on the part of officials responsible for addressing the needs of survivors of gender-based violence about the rights, care pathways and protection measures that Venezuelan women should enjoy, as well as stereotypes related to the nationality and gender of these women, or their gender identity. It also exposes the lack of availability of and access to temporary shelters and the lack of adequate statistical information. 
Amnesty International calls on the Colombian and Peruvian authorities to take immediate measures to ensure that Venezuelan women can enjoy a life free from violence and without discrimination based on gender, nationality, migration status or any other grounds. In particular, the Colombian and Peruvian governments should combat stigmatization of and discrimination against Venezuelan women, ensure their access to international protection, ensure effective access to justice, improve measures to prevent and address gender-based violence, and ensure comprehensive healthcare for women survivors of gender-based violence.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
I am alarmed to learn that Abdullah al-Huwaiti is at imminent risk of execution following an Appeal Court’s decision on June 13, 2022, to uphold his death sentence. 
As you may be aware, Abdullah al-Huwaiti was only 14 years old at the time of his arrest and when he was tried with five other defendants on May 11, 2017. Following a re-trial ordered by the Supreme Court in 2021, he was re-sentenced to death by a Criminal Court in Tabuk on March 2, 2022. As this decision has since been upheld by the Appeals Court, I fear for the life of Abdullah al-Huwaiti as the Supreme Court could ratify his death sentence at any moment. 
It is further distressing that, during his detention, Abdullah al-Huwaiti was detained in solitary confinement for four months and was not allowed to speak to his family and access a lawyer throughout this period and during interrogation. Disturbingly, despite the fact that he was a child at the time of the arrest, he was detained in the criminal investigations unit of Tabuk instead of the juvenile detention centre (Dar Al Mulahaza). Abdullah al-Huwaiti told the court: “Everything in the ‘confession’ is not true, and I was forced to confess as I was beaten and threatened… I was also told to change my testimony to match that of other defendants”. Abdullah al-Huwaiti refused to sign his testimony as he maintained it is not true; yet, the court refused to withdraw his testimony and consequently sentenced him to death. 
The Saudi Human Rights Commission said in a statement to Amnesty International in February 2022 that the country no longer executes individuals “for crimes committed by minors” and has commuted all such outstanding sentences. Meanwhile, Abdullah al-Huwaiti’s death sentence was still upheld following a re-trial. 
I urge you not to ratify the death sentence of Abdullah al-Huwaiti, and to quash his conviction, given the grave concerns about the fairness of his trial and his age at the time of arrest, and to order a re-trial in proceedings that are fully consistent with international fair trial standards, without resort to the death penalty. Furthermore, I call on you to order a prompt, impartial, independent, and effective investigation into his claims before the court of torture and ill-treatment and to immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. 
Sincerely,

Your Excellency, 
Aisha el-Shater, the 41-year-old daughter of senior Muslim Brotherhood leader Khairat el-Shater, and her husband lawyer Mohamed Abo Horeira have been arbitrarily detained for over three and a half years, solely for peacefully exercising their human rights and for their family affiliations. On August 23, 2021, after spending more than 32 months in pre-trial detention, prosecutors indicted them and referred them to trial by the Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) on charges of joining, financing and supporting a “terrorist group”, in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. The trial began on September 11, 2021 and has been adjourned to June 13, 2022. 
Officials at al-Qanater women’s prison held Aisha el-Shater in solitary confinement in a small poorly ventilated cell, without a bathroom, from January 2019 until December 2020. Guards forced her to wear light clothes in her unheated cell during cold winter months and regularly conducted searches of her cell, confiscating her hygiene products and other personal belongings. Since her detention, the authorities have denied her any family visits, and barred any written or phone communication with her family and lawyers. This treatment amounts to torture, a crime under international law. Aisha el- Shater has aplastic anaemia, a rare and serious condition affecting the blood, which increases the risk of infections and uncontrolled bleeding. Despite this, the authorities have denied her access to adequate and specialized healthcare in an outside hospital. Her health deteriorated in detention, and she was admitted, while handcuffed, to Al-Qasr al-Ainy hospital twice in October 2019, with significant bleeding, and was given a platelet transfusion. Since December 2020, she has been held at the al-Qanater prison clinic, but she requires specialist and ongoing treatment in adequately equipped facilities, not available in prison. During the May 15, 2022 trial hearing, the ESSC ordered for Aisha el-Shater’s examination by a committee of three doctors to advise on whether she needs treatment outside prison. As she is banned from communicating with the outside word, her family and lawyers have no information on whether the examination has taken place. 
We urge you to ensure that Aisha el-Shater and Mohamed Abo Horeira are immediately and unconditionally released and all charges against them are dropped as their detention and prosecution stem solely from their relationship to a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader and from the exercise of their human rights. Pending their release, we call on you to ensure that they are provided with the means to regularly communicate with their family and lawyers and provided with access to adequate health care including outside prison.

I write to call on you to reverse your decision to ‘categorically ban’ the peaceful campus-based Pride march, planned for Friday June 10, 2022. The grounds cited in your email sent to all METU students on June 7, 2022, namely the ‘damage that would be caused to the University’s prestige’ are not among those permitted under Türkiye’s domestic laws, nor are they permissible under binding international human rights laws and standards. 
In May 2019, during the last campus-based peaceful march, 18 students and one academic staff who were detained by police who used unnecessary and excessive force. They were prosecuted for their participation in the march but acquitted in their trial heard by the Ankara Penal Court of First Instance No 39 in October 2021. In the light of this court decision, any attempt to prevent this peaceful assembly would represent a new and serious restriction on those who wish to exercise their rights. 
I therefore urge you to ensure that all participants in METU Pride, students, and staff, are able to exercise their right to peaceful assembly on June 10 freely and without fear of reprisal or punishment. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 
Two Bahraini Shi’a men, Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadeq Majeed Thamer are at imminent risk of execution following the Supreme Court’s decision in April 2022 to uphold their death sentences, despite the defendants’ claims before the court that they had been subjected to severe beatings during their interrogations. The two men were convicted of a range of offences including: “Joining a terrorist entity … which aims to cause chaos and shake the security of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain”; “Participating in protests in Bahrain”; and smuggling bags of explosives to Saudi Arabia “with the aim of breaching Saudi Arabia’s security”. The Specialized Criminal Court sentenced both men to death in October 2021 after a prolonged and unfair trial which had begun in January 2019. The Appeals Court upheld their sentences in January 2022. 
Both men were detained incommunicado and in solitary confinement for three-and-a-half months following their arrest on May 8, 2015. They were only allowed to call their families 115 days later, during which time prison officials did not allow them to discuss their detention or interrogation conditions. Their families were allowed their first visit in October 2015. Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadeq Majeed Thamer had no access to legal representation throughout their pre-trial detention and interrogation. According to court documents, they told the court that they were tortured and that their so-called confessions were extracted under duress. Jaafar Mohammad Sultan also told the court that he was beaten with cables and threatened that he would not see his family until he signed the “confession” as formulated by the investigator. According to the court document detailing his defence, he was subsequently transferred to the prison hospital for 10 days due to the torture he endured. 
I urge you not to ratify the execution of Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadeq Majeed Thamer, and to quash their conviction and death sentence, given the grave concerns about the fairness of their trial, and to order a re-trial in line with international fair trial standards, without recourse to the death penalty. Furthermore, I call on you to order a prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigation into their claims before the court of torture and ill-treatment and to immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia.

Dear President, 
I am writing to raise my concerns about the unjust imprisonment of activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and human rights lawyer Mohamed Baker, who were convicted by an emergency court in December 2021 for “spreading false news” and sentenced to five and four years in prison, respectively. They have already spent 31 months in arbitrary detention pending investigations into bogus accusations in relation to separate cases, all stemming solely from the peaceful exercise of their human rights. 
Alaa Abdel Fattah’s health has sharply declined since he began his hunger strike on April 2, 2022, only consuming water and salt, in protest of his unjust imprisonment and cruel and inhuman prison conditions, including being banned from accessing any reading material or outdoor exercise for two and a half years. Prison and security officials only allow him monthly family visits, which are only allowed in their presence and through a glass partition, preventing any physical contact with his loved-ones. Concerns for his life have risen further after he appeared frail and seemed to have lost considerable weight during his mother’s last visit on May 12, 2022. He also told his mother that he was beaten while handcuffed by the deputy prison warden at Tora Maximum Security 2 prison on May 7, 2022, for asking to be allowed to exercise outdoors. In a statement on May 15, 2022, the head of the National Council for Human Rights, a state institution, claimed having received official assurances that Alaa Abdel Fattah’s rights were guaranteed. Amnesty International believes that prison officials are torturing him by intentionally keeping him in cruel and inhuman prison condition conditions, causing him severe pain and suffering, to punish him for his activism and prominent role in the January 25, Revolution of 2011. 
After Alaa Abdel Fattah obtained British citizenship through his British-born mother, a consular visit was formally requested in December 2021, though the Egyptian authorities’ have failed to grant or even respond to the request. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker immediately and unconditionally, quash their convictions and drop all charges against them, as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I urge you to ensure that they are held in conditions meeting international standards, provided with adequate healthcare in hospitals outside prison, protected from torture and other ill-treatment and allowed to regularly communicate with their families and lawyers. Alaa Abdel Fattah must have access to qualified health professionals providing health care in compliance with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy, and informed consent and be immediately granted a consular visit in accordance with the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
We are appalled at the news of the death sentence pronounced against activist, former military official and whistleblower Mohamed Benhlima by a military court on charges of espionage and desertion. Mohamed Benhlima was not informed of this sentence until 8 May, almost two months after his refoulement to Algeria on March 24, 2022. According to information that Amnesty International has obtained, upon arrival in Algeria, the security forces physically assaulted Mohamed Benhlima. He was initially placed in El Harrash prison, in Algiers, in the same wing as Hirak detainees, and later transferred to the military prison of El-Blida where he is awaiting completion of investigations and trial on several cases before the military and civil courts. 
The Spanish authorities refouled Mohamed Benhlima to Algeria without a full evaluation of his asylum claim and in violation of his due process rights in a blatant violation of its international obligations on non-refoulement. The Spanish authorities ignored international outcry for the safety of Mohamed Benhlima, including a UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR) report to the Spanish government stating that his asylum request should be studied thoroughly in a regular procedure and not rejected expediently, arguing that the risk of torture was credible, and that Algeria’s criminalisation of peaceful opposition was internationally recognised. 
Mohamed Benhlima was sentenced in absentia in two other cases to a total of 20 years in prison on charges including “participation in a terrorist group” (Article 87bis 3 of the Penal Code) and “publishing fake news undermining national unity” (Art.196 bis), two articles that are widely instrumentalised by the authorities to criminalise peaceful expression. A lawyer who appeared in a video published on Facebook, along with Mohamed Benhlima’s mother on May 12, 2022, and who held the authorities responsible for defaming Mohamed Benhlima through a video that they aired on public television channels, was arrested the night of May 13, 2022. 
I urge you to ensure the release of Mohamed Benhlima, end his prosecution under charges stemming from his criticism of Algerian authorities and exercise of his rights to free speech and assembly, and quash the death sentence against him. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is held in conditions meeting international standards and protected from torture and other ill-treatment. Finally, I urge you to continue to grant him the right to regularly communicate with his family and lawyers and refrain from any form of intimidation against his defence team.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr. A.R.P.J Alwis, 
I write in relation to the case of Mohamed Imaam Mohamed Imran, a computer engineering student, who was arrested by the police in Kattankudy on May 9, 2019, under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), when he was just 20-years-old. Three years since his detention, Imran is yet to be charged and the state has not produced any evidence of him committing an internationally recognizable crime. This is a violation of Imran’s rights to be free from arbitrary arrest, and to be promptly informed of any charges against him. 
According to Imran’s family, upon his arrest, no arrest receipt or detention order was provided to them. A detention order was only issued to Imran on March 29, 2022, two years and ten months after Imran’s arrest. These procedural lapses, along with abusive provisions within the PTA, violate due process safeguards and international human rights law. 
Imran has only been produced in court four times since his arrest, the last time being September 2021. The lack of judicial oversight and prolonged administrative detention in this case leaves Imran at risk of torture or other ill-treatment at the hands of the police. 
The prolonged detention without charge of Mohamed Imaam Mohamed Imran is a violation of international fair trial standards and the authorities’ legal obligations in line with Sri Lanka’s obligations under the ICCPR. 
I therefore urge you to release Mohamed Imaam Mohamed Imran, or if there is sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing, promptly charge him with a recognisable offence, in accordance with international standards. Pending release or charge, authorities must ensure his fair trial rights are guaranteed, that he has the right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention, and has access to fair bail hearings. 
Sincerely,

Dear Chief Prosecutor, 
I am writing to urge you to support and not to oppose any application for the release of Osman Kavala, Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Tayfun Kahraman, and Hakan Altınay who were convicted on April 25, 2022, in the prosecution dubbed the ‘Gezi trial’. Osman Kavala has spent more than 4.5 years in pre-trial detention. In handing down the guilty verdicts, the court also ordered the remand of six other defendants. A warrant for the arrest of Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi, the eighth defendant, has been issued. 
Osman Kavala received an aggravated life sentence for ‘attempting to overthrow the government’ but was acquitted of the ‘political and military espionage’ charge for which he has been in pre-trial detention since February 2020. The acquittal was due to ‘lack of evidence’ after, along with the other seven defendants, he had already been acquitted in the first trial. 
The other seven defendants were convicted for allegedly aiding Osman Kavala and sentenced to 18 years in prison each. The Court ordered their immediate remand on grounds that they are a flight risk. 
Throughout the first and the second trial, the prosecuting authorities failed to present any evidence that would prove the defendants’ guilt of the alleged charges, a fact that was acknowledged in the verdict by one of the three judges who stated in his dissenting opinion that ‘because there is no concrete, certain and believable evidence that would prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, [the court] should rule for the acquittal of the defendants.’ I call on you to support and not to oppose the seven defendants’ requests for their release from prison pending the determination of their appeals.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Governor, 
The State of Arizona is planning to execute Clarence Dixon on May 11, 2022, for a murder committed in 1978. 
Clarence Dixon, a member of the Navajo Nation, has a long history of mental disability, including multiple diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia. His mental disabilities predate the 1978 crime – indeed, at that time the state was under a court order to commence civil commitment proceedings for his in-patient treatment. Clarence Dixon’s 2007 trial and 2008 sentencing were impacted by his mental disability when his delusional belief system – which persists to this day – led him to fire his court-appointed attorneys and represent himself. He presented a single mitigation witness at the sentencing phase of the trial, which meant that the jury never heard any expert or other mitigation evidence about his mental disability before it voted to sentence him to death. 
International law, binding on the USA, prohibits the execution of anyone who faces “special barriers in defending themselves on an equal basis with others, such as persons whose serious psychosocial… disabilities impede their effective defence”. In a recent evaluation, a psychiatrist again diagnosed Clarence Dixon with paranoid schizophrenia. In his opinion, his mental disability “significantly affects his ability to develop a rational understanding of the State’s reasons for his execution”, and his disconnection from reality is further aggravated by “visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations”. 
US law prohibits the execution of anyone who does not have a rational understanding of their punishment. And, again, international law prohibits the execution of anyone who has “a diminished ability to understand the reasons for their sentence”. 
I urge you to stop the execution of Clarence Dixon and to commute his death sentence.

Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the ill-treatment in detention of Sahrawi activist Mohamed Lamine Haddi. He told his family in a phone call that on March 15, 2022, five prison guards entered his cell and beat him with batons and used metal pliers to cut his beard against his will. He had announced to the prison guards the previous day that he planned to do a hunger strike on March 16 and 17 to protest his prison conditions and the denial of a medical visit, despite repeated demands, and said that if his demands were still not met, then he intended to go on indefinite hunger strike from March 18. The beating of Mohamed Lamine Haddi, in what appears to be retaliation for his planned hunger strike, is a violation of his right to freedom of expression, as well as ill-treatment against a detainee. The authorities should not use measures to punish hunger strikers or to coerce them to end a hunger strike. 
In a phone call to his family on March 21, Mohamed Lamine Haddi said that the guards returned to his cell on March 17, 18 and 21, and beat him again with batons. He has a hematoma on the left side of his face from where the guards beat him, and prison guards have refused his requests to see a doctor and to have medicine for his serious digestive problem. He told the prison guards on March 21, that he wanted to make a complaint to the King’s Prosecutor about the guards’ ill-treatment towards him. The guards said that they would not lodge his complaint and beat him. The phone-call to his family on March 21, 2022, lasted a total of four minutes as the guards cut-off the call twice; according to his sister, whenever he begins to tell his family about his ill-treatment by the guards, they cut the phone-line. 
Since September 17, 2017, the authorities have held Mohamed Lamine Haddi and other Gdeim Izik prisoners in solitary confinement. He is confined alone in his cell for 24 hours per day, with no contact with other inmates. Visits by his lawyer, Olfa Ouled, and family have been banned since March 2020. 
I urge you to end the ill-treatment of Mohamed Lamine Haddi, holding accountable all those responsible, and to remove him from solitary confinement. I also urge you to grant him immediate access to adequate medical care, regular and unfettered access to his family and lawyer and ensure that his detention conditions conform to international law and standards. Finally, I urge you to take all measures in order for a fair retrial for Mohamed Lamine Haddi and other Gdeim Izik prisoners to take place soon before an ordinary civilian court, in line with international law.

I am writing to raise concern about the deteriorating health condition of Algerian journalist Merzoug Touati, who has been on hunger strike since March 29, 2022, to protest against his prison conditions and transfer to Al-Aghouat prison, 500km away from his residence in Bejaia, Algeria. He had previously been held in Ghardaia prison during his first instance and appeal trials. He was transferred to the new prison on February 16, 2022, and placed in a crowded transit area dedicated to new incoming prisoners who are supposed to stay there only for two weeks due to Covid-19 regulations. However, Merzoug Touati has already spent more than one month and a half in this transit area, placing his health at further risk. 
On April 9, 2022, his family visited him in prison. They told Amnesty International that he had lost half his weight and was barely able to move. He complained of stomach pain and asked his family to get him medicine from outside prison, as the prison administration has not provided him with any medical attention needed and instead continued to disregard his hunger strike. 
Police in Ghardaia summoned Merzoug Touati on December 28, 2021, without mentioning any reason. They kept him in custody for one night before transferring him to Ghardaia prison on December 29, 2021. The first instance court in Ghardaia sentenced him to one year in prison, confirmed on appeal, for “harming public institutions” and publishing “fake news”, under articles 146 and 196 bis of the penal code, respectively, after he posted on Facebook a comment denouncing the prison conditions of a detained activist. 
In light of the above, I urge you to quash the sentence against Merzoug Touati and release him immediately and unconditionally as he is imprisoned only for exercising his right to freedom of expression. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is held in conditions meeting international standards and provided with the adequate medical treatment he may require, including during his hunger strike.

Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express my grave concern for Uyghur woman Buheliqiemu Abula and her 13-year-old daughter who were detained near the Holy City of Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on March 31, 2022. The police told them they were going to be deported to China, according to a message received by friends of Buheliqiemu Abula. Buheliqiemu Abula is the former wife of Nuermaimaiti Ruze, who with Aimidoula Waili, has been detained without charge in Saudi Arabia since November 2020. The Kingdom must abandon all plans to deport these four Uyghur people as this would amount to a clear violation of Saudi Arabia’s non-refoulement obligations. 
The Chinese government has gone to great lengths to cover up the human rights violations taking place in Xinjiang, and to prevent members of the Uyghur diaspora from speaking up about them. To that end, the Chinese government has been requesting extradition of many Uyghur people living abroad branding them “terrorist” or “extremist” simply for their peaceful activism. Chinese law defines “terrorism” and “extremism” in an overly broad and vague manner, and these laws have been used to crack down on Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities. 
There is now ample evidence, including leaked government documents, hundreds of testimonies, as well as drone videos and satellite imagery that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang based on their religion and ethnicity. 
It is extremely alarming to have learned that if forcibly returned to China, Buheliqiemu Abula, her daughter, Nuermaimaiti Ruze, and Aimidoula Waili will be in real danger of arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment. Their deportation would violate the Kingdom’s obligations under international law. 
I therefore urge you to immediately halt the deportation of Buheliqiemu Abula, her daughter, Nuermaimaiti Ruze, and Aimidoula Waili to China, and immediately release them unless there is sufficient, credible, and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognizable offence.

Your Excellency, 
On March 16, 2022, a group of at least four American activists from ‘Unarmed Civilian Protection’ and ‘Human Rights Action Center’, two international non-profit organizations working to promote human rights and peace building worldwide, managed to visit the home of Sultana Khaya, a peaceful activist for Sawhrawi self-determination who has been arbitrarily confined to her home in Boujdour, Morocco, since November 2020. 
Since then, security forces have decreased their presence outside Sultana Khaya’s house but have reportedly increased their presence in the peripheries of her neighbourhood. Between March 17 and 20, 2022, neighbours, activists and family members were able to access Sultana Khaya’s house and stand in solidarity with her despite the presence of security agents in the neighbourhood. This soon changed as security forces in plain clothes began assaulting and harassing women as they left Sultana Khaya’s house. On March 21, 2022, at least five women were stopped on their way out of Sultana Khaya’s house; they were pushed around by security agents in plain clothes. A woman activist told Amnesty International that security forces beat her and snatched her phone as she left Sultana Khaya’s house on March 21, 2022. She said that the security agents insulted her and refused to give her back her phone. Sultana Khaya’s sister Luaara Khaya, who together with another sister and their mother, is also being held in the same house under de facto house arrest, has been able to leave the house to run errands on several occasions since March 16, and on April 5, 2022, she was able to go to a local administration to renew her passport and came back into the house without being stopped. Sultana Khaya’s mother was able to leave her house and go to Laayoune for medical treatment of shoulder and muscles injuries resulting from police violence. 
I urge you to ensure a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, transparent, and effective investigation into the security forces’ abusive force and attacks against her and her family, including the report of rape and sexual assault, and ensure that those suspected of responsibility are brought to justice in fair trials. I also urge you to ensure that Sultana Khaya and her family are provided with access to justice and effective remedies, including adequate compensation, and guarantee of non-repetition for the violations of human rights to which they have been subjected. I further urge you to immediately announce an end the arbitrary house arrest against Sultana Khaya and grant safe and free access to her domicile for all who wish to visit her, including Sahrawis.

Your Excellency, 
Qatari brothers Hazza and Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri, both lawyers belonging to the Al Murra tribe, have been detained in solitary confinement since their arrest over seven months ago. 
In July 2021, the Emir – Qatar’s ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani – ratified a law paving the way for the first legislative elections of the Shura Council. In early August 2021, members of tribes, mainly the al-Murra tribe, protested against their exclusion from the Shura Council elections. Hazza al-Marri took part in the protests, and on August 8, 2021, he tweeted a video-recorded message addressed to the Emir criticizing the law. On August 10, 2021, members of the Criminal Investigation Department arrested Hazza al-Marri at his home. His brother Rashed al-Marri went to the Public Prosecution offices to enquire about the reasons for Hazza al-Marri’s arrest and requested access to his brother as his legal representative. He was told that he would have to submit the request in writing, which he did. Rashed al-Marri was then summoned to appear before the Public Prosecution on August 11, 2021, where he was immediately detained. The two men were initially held by the cybercrime department until August 22, 2021. They were then moved to a State Security detention facility in the Fereej Bin Omran area of Doha, the capital, where they remained until the end of December 2021 before their transfer to another State Security detention facility near the Industrial area in Doha, where they continue to be held in solitary confinement. The brothers are granted family visits and calls twice a week. 
The two men have appeared three times before a judge in sessions that took place behind closed doors. During the first one, on January 26, 2022, the judge appointed a defence lawyer without granting them the option to appoint a lawyer of their own choosing. Two other brief sessions took place on February 22 and March 8, 2022. 
I urge you to immediately release Hazza bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri and Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri unless they are promptly charged with a recognizable criminal offence, in accordance with international law and standards. Pending their release, they must have immediate access to lawyers of their choice and any medical attention they may require.

Your Excellency, 
Social media influencers 23-year-old Hanin Hossam and 21-year-old Mawada el-Adham are serving unjust lengthy prison sentences, following their conviction by Cairo’s Criminal Court in June 2021 of inciting young women to broadcast “indecent” content on social media to earn money, commercial exploitation, human trafficking, and other offences. Amnesty International believes that they are being punished for the way they dance, talk, dress and attempt to “influence” the public online, amid the authorities’ crackdown on women’s freedom of expression and attempts to police women’s conduct online. The organisation reviewed the videos that led to their convictions, as well as their verdicts, and found no credible evidence linking the two women to acts that would amount to trafficking in persons, as defined by the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, or other internationally recognizable criminal offences. 
During the issuing of the verdict, the presiding judge openly expressed bias and hostility against the women, accusing them of tarnishing the nation’s morals and warning against using social media tools to undermine Egypt’s values. Mawada el-Adham’s appeal against her six-year prison sentence is pending. Hanin Hossam, who was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in her absence, is now standing trial again in accordance with the Egyptian Code of Criminal Procedures, which gives those convicted in their absence the possibility to request a retrial. Amnesty International is concerned about Hanin Hossam’s mental health, as she repeatedly expressed her despair during her court hearings. On December 20, 2021, she told the presiding judge: “I live in a swamp, in a swamp I swear, and I am dying 100 times every day because my future is lost”. Her next hearing is scheduled for March 22, 2022. They were held in al-Qanater prison for women at the time of writing. 
I urge you to quash Hanin Hossam and Mawada el-Adham’s convictions and sentences and release them immediately as they are being punished for their conduct online in the name of “morality” and “decency”; protect their rights to privacy, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and bodily autonomy; and put an end to the wider crackdown on women social media influencers in Egypt.

Dear President of Congress, 
I am writing to express my concern regarding Bill 5272, passed on March 8, 2022, by the Guatemalan Congress (Decree 18-2022). 
Contrary to international human rights standards that oblige Guatemala not to discriminate against any person, Decree 18-2022 discriminates against LGBTIQ people by expressly prohibiting same-sex marriage, as well as teaching about sexual diversity in public schools. In a pre-existing context of persistent violence against LGBTIQ people, this law reinforces stigmatization and discrimination against them and normalizes it, putting the lives of thousands of people at risk. In addition, it would violate the right of children and adolescents to comprehensive sexuality education. 
Furthermore, by modifying the penal code to criminalize miscarriages and increase penalties and sanctions for women and medical personnel with respect to abortions, the law would put the lives of women and girls at risk; and would have serious implications for public health in the country, already so affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Guatemalan Congress must refrain from promoting laws that foment hate speech, prejudice, discrimination, and violence. It must embrace its obligation to guarantee the right of all people not to be discriminated against, including on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and it must guarantee the right of all people to sexual and reproductive health, as well as autonomy in their decisions about their own bodies. 
Therefore, I urge you to shelve Decree 18-2022 and refrain from pursuing the approval of any other decree that violates the rights of women, girls or LGBTIQ+ persons.

Morocco is obliged under international law not to transfer any individual, including through deportation or extradition, to a country where that person would be at real risk of torture or other serious human rights violations.

Since his deportation to Pakistan, his family has not been granted access to him, nor do they have any idea about where he might be – or if he is even alive. 
Abdul left Pakistan in 2012, when he and his family faced violent threats to their lives. His wife and son are terrified that he will meet the same fate as his father – who was shot dead in Balochistan in 2012 – and his brother – who was abducted in 2010 allegedly by security forces and found dead two weeks later. The family must be told his whereabouts, and what the charges against him are so that they can adequately prepare for trial – his constitutional right as a Pakistani national. 
I urge you to reveal Abdul Hafeez’s whereabouts to his family and allow him regular communication with them and a lawyer of his choice. If he is charged with internationally recognizable crime, his fair trial rights must be fully guaranteed and respected.

On July 19, 2020, a court ordered his release in relation to investigations into accusations of “joining a terrorist group” and “spreading false news” in Case No. 488/2019 connected to anti-government protests in March 2019. He was not released, and in August 2020 the Supreme Sate Security Prosecution (SSSP) ordered his detention pending investigations into unfounded terrorism accusations in a new case (Case No. 855/2020). He remains in pre-trial detention in violation of the Code of Criminal Procedures, which sets the maximum duration for pre-trial detention at two years for crimes punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment. He has not been charged, presented with evidence linking him to any crime, or allowed to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. 
On January 30, a judge renewed Mohamed Salah’s pre-trial detention for another 45 days in his absence. In an open letter written the following day from Mazra’at Tora prison, where he has been held since September 2021, Mohamed Salah called on the authorities to refer him to trial, noting that his continued pre-trial detention was unlawful. On February 1, his lawyer filed a request to the Public Prosecutor calling for his release or referral to trial. The complaint was also shared with the National Council for Human Rights, the national human rights institution. On February 6, Mohamed Salah’s family joined the family of arbitrary detained human rights defender Ibrahim Ezz el-Din and the families of six other detainees in publicly calling for the releases of all pre-trial detainees held for over two years or their referral to trials. 
On July 23, 2020, Mohamed Salah was transferred to Dar Essalam police station, where he remained held until his transfer to the Tora Investigations Prison on January 10, 2021. During this period, he reported being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment including beatings and denial of medical care, but no investigations were opened into his claims. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Mohamed Salah as he is held solely for the peaceful exercise of his human rights and to open prompt, independent, impartial, transparent, and effective investigations into allegations that he has been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in Dar Essalam police station with a view of bringing those suspected to be responsible to justice.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Highness, 
Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace is serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in Bahrain’s 2011 uprising. He has been in Jaw prison for over a decade, in violation of his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. As he enters his seventh consecutive month on hunger strike, his health condition has further deteriorated with the on-duty doctor and an ambulance crew intervening and putting him on oxygen. 
On July 8, 2021, he started a hunger strike to protest the confiscation by prison authorities of a book on Bahraini dialects that he spent the last four years researching and writing. Ten days later, he was transferred from prison to the Kanoo Medical Centre where has since been detained. The same month, the Bahrain Ministry of Interior Ombudsperson declared that Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace’s book could not be handed to his family until a “legal decision” was made. In November 2021, a legal decision clarified the apolitical nature of the book and yet the book has still not been returned. 
At the end of November 2021, Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace’s weekly video calls to his family were suspended and, distressingly, he was not yet able to see his new grandson. In protest, he has been refusing to take IVs, vitamin supplements, and oral medication. Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace also suffers from medical conditions, including severe intermittent headaches, a prostate problem, arthritis in his shoulder joint, tremors, numbness, and diminished eyesight, for which he has not received adequate health care for. He has still not been informed of the outcome of an MRI scan taken in November 2021 and is still awaiting a CT scan as requested by his doctor. 
We call upon your Highness to release Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace immediately and unconditionally as he is held solely for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. In the meantime, we urge you to ensure he receives adequate health care, in compliance with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy, and informed consent. We also call on you to ensure that his access to video calls to his family is reinstated and his work is immediately handed over to them.

0,Statement on “Freedom Convoy” Blockade,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/statement-on-freedom-convoy-blockade/,Amnesty International has been following with great concern the developments relating to the “Freedom Convoy” blockade in Ottawa.  ,"Amnesty International has been following with great concern the developments relating to the “Freedom Convoy” blockade in Ottawa. 
“Amnesty International Canada is deeply troubled by the reports of violence, harassment, intimidation, and hate speech which have surfaced since January 29th,” said Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Ketty Nivyabandi. “Nazi flags, Confederate flags, and other symbols of racism and hate exhibited have no room in peaceful protests. Equally concerning is the affiliation of some of the Convoy organizers with overtly racist, white supremacist groups.” 
The failure of law enforcement agencies to respond swiftly and appropriately to reports of violence and harassment demands a prompt, thorough, and impartial public inquiry. The inquiry must also address instances of interference with residents’ rights to public health and social services delivery, as well as the harassment of healthcare workers, reporters, people living with disabilities, and racialized and other marginalized persons. 
“Authorities hold an equal international obligation to protect people from violence and harassment, and to respect the rights of all protesters to peaceful assembly and expression of their views. Violence and harassment however are not part of exercising the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Amnesty International calls on authorities to take immediate and appropriate action to facilitate peaceful protests, while investigating and holding those perpetrating violence or inciting hate to account,” added Nivyabandi. 
Throughout the demonstrations, racialized workers and residents have reported being singled out for abuse. Over 400 hate messages are under investigation by the Ottawa Police. Frontline services have expressed concern about the impact of the ongoing demonstration on their ability to provide to already vulnerable clients. People with disabilities have reported disruptions and delays in receiving supportive care, given ongoing street blockages by demonstrators. Journalists experienced threats and harassment, both online and while reporting from the demonstration zone. Until a recent court injunction, residents were subjected to almost continuous high-decibel noise levels, including honking, air horns, train whistles, street parties and fireworks since the demonstration began at the end of January. 
The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, Algonquins of Pikwakanagan, the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council, and Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg have also expressed concerns about the misuse and appropriation of sacred, traditional objects and ceremonies. 
Further, Amnesty International Canada notes with great concern the permissive response afforded by the Ottawa Police to a largely white-dominant protest group. This response is in sharp contrast with how law enforcement authorities have mistreated Indigenous and racialized protesters in the past. 
“Amnesty International Canada expresses solidarity with the frontline organizations, including homeless and women’s shelters whose operations have been impacted by these protests, as well as 2SLGBTQI+ and racialized communities – particularly Jewish, Muslim, Black and Indigenous communities – who have been targeted by hate propaganda,” said Nivyabandi. 
Further Background on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly 
Peaceful protests are a fundamental part of a vibrant society. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is a vital means of political engagement, with a long history of being a valid and effective means of bringing issues and grievances to light. Facilitating and protecting the right to freedom of assembly contributes to the protection of other human rights, including freedom of expression. 
The right to hold assemblies and demonstrations on public roads has been consistently upheld by regional and international human rights bodies, which have established that urban space is not only an area for circulation but also a space for participation. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association has affirmed that “the free flow of traffic should not automatically take precedence over freedom of peaceful assembly.” However, these rights are not unlimited. They can be restricted in order to protect the rights of others, public order and public health. The UN Human Rights Committee has said that “an assembly that remains peaceful but which nevertheless causes a high level of disruption, such as the extended blocking of traffic, may be dispersed, as a rule, only if the disruption is ‘serious and sustained’.” In any case, the onus is on the authorities to justify any restrictions. 
Under international human rights law, states also have the obligation to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination, including in the enjoyment of the right to security of the person and protection by the State against violence. The UN Human Rights Committee clearly stated that “… peaceful assemblies may not be used for propaganda for war (…) or advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence (…). As far as possible, action should be taken in such cases against the individual perpetrators, rather than against the assembly as a whole.” 
Amnesty International has produced reports outlining good practices on the policing of assemblies, as well as guidelines on the use of force by law enforcement officials.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear President, 
I am writing to raise my concerns about the unjust imprisonment of activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and human rights lawyer Mohamed Baker who on December 20, 2021, were convicted by an emergency court for “spreading false news undermining national security” and sentenced to five and four years in prison, respectively, solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights. Proceedings before emergency courts are inherently unfair as their verdicts are not subject to appeal by a higher tribunal. The defendants were also denied their right to adequate defence as their lawyers were prevented from communicating with them in private and photocopying the casefiles, indictments and verdicts. Their lawyers filed complaints to the office responsible for ratifying Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) verdicts, calling for you to quash the verdict in accordance to Article 14 of the Emergency Law. 
Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker have been arbitrarily detained since September 2019 and are held at the Tora Maximum Security 2 Prison in Cairo in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions, which violate the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment. On January 9, 2022, their pre-trial detention was renewed for an additional 45 days in a separate case (No. 1356 of 2019) in connection to unfounded terrorism-related accusations. During the hearing, Alaa Abdel Fattah spoke to the presiding judge about the unlawfulness of his detention as well as his dire conditions in prison, including being denied reading material, exercise in the prison yard and a bed or mattress. He also raised concerns about witnessing violations against other prisoners, being threatened by a security officer with further dire consequences if he does not remain silent and being isolated from other prisoners during transfers from prison to court. 
On January 18, 2022, the Court of Cassation rejected the final appeal by Alaa Abdel Fattah, Mohamed Baker and 27 others against their arbitrary inclusion in the “terrorists list” in November 2020, without due process as part of Case No. 1781/2019. The effect of the decision includes a travel ban, an asset freeze and prohibition from engaging in political or civic work for five years. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker immediately and unconditionally, quash the verdict against them and drop all charges against them as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I urge you to ensure that they are held in conditions meeting international standards, protected from torture and other ill-treatment and allowed to regularly communicate with their families and lawyers. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express concern over the authorities’ failure to grant detained journalist Omar Radi a fair trial. His was sentenced to six years in prison on July 19, 2021 for espionage and rape following a trial marred by flaws. 
Omar Radi’s lawyers’ requests to cross examine a key prosecution witness in the rape charge was denied by court on spurious grounds. The defense team repeatedly asked the court during the trial sessions to summon for testimony a man the alleged victim said was her fiancé and who testified before the invesntigative judge that he was in communication with her the night of the incident. The judge refused all requests, saying there is no need for such cross examination because it will delay the trial. Omar Radi was sentenced for the espionage charge for the receipt of foreign funds and his contacts with foreign diplomats, which are part of his legitimate journalistic and consultancy work. During several hearings throughout the duration of the trial, his defense team emphasized the need to summon all the witnesses in the espionage case, including diplomats and organizations cited by the prosecution, as suspected of being foreign agents fomenting trouble against Morocco. These requests were all refused because the prosecution argued their testimony will not be impartial as they are foreign agents. 
Furthermore, Omar Radi’s right to consult with his lawyers privately was not respected. On June 1, 2021, during his trial session at the Casablanca Court of Appeal, he complained to the judge about the lack of privacy in the room where he consults with his defence team in prison. This lack of privacy has been ongoing since the start of the trial. One of his (international) lawyers was also banned from attending his trial after receiving a deportation order. 
While the rape accusations must each be considered on their merits and Amnesty International is not well placed to assess their veracity, I note with concern that the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found in another case that the detention of another Moroccan journalist also accused of rape amounted to “judicial harassment attributable to nothing other than his investigative journalism”. 
Therefore, I urge you to grant Omar Radi a fair appeal trial in accordance with international fair trial standards and to ensure he is immediately provided an opportunity for his ongoing detention to be reviewed by a court, with a presumption that he will be released pending the end of his trial. 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Ivey, 
Matthew Reeves is facing execution on January 27, 2022. He was convicted in 1998 of a murder committed in Selma, Alabama, in 1996. Eighteen years old at the time of the crime, he has been on death row for more than half of his life. 
According to the evidence presented since the trial, at most, Matthew Reeves functions in the borderline range of intellectual ability. In post-conviction proceedings, the state’s expert found his IQ to be 68, which is below the threshold for intellectual disability. According to a neuropsychologist who should have testified at trial, Matthew Reeves has intellectual disability. 
The trial lawyers pressed for funding so they could appoint the above neuropsychologist to assess Matthew Reeves’ intellectual functioning, but after their request was granted, they failed to contact the expert they had said was crucial for their mitigation case, and they went to trial having not hired any mental health expert at all. The entire sentencing phase lasted a mere 90 minutes. The jury and judge were deprived of key mitigation evidence. Three federal judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and four Supreme Court Justices have said Matthew Reeves’ legal representation at trial was inadequate. It also failed to meet international standards for a fair trial. 
I urge you to grant clemency to Matthew Reeves and commute his death sentence.

Re: Amnesty International USA and UK call on Ambassador Reeker to publicly oppose the UK government’s Northern Ireland legacy proposals 
  
Dear Ambassador Reeker: 
We write regarding the UK government’s plans to deal with the legacy of the Northern Ireland conflict. The legacy bill, which is expected early in the new year, will seek to establish a de facto amnesty for grave human rights abuses committed during the Northern Ireland conflict. The proposals outlined in the command paper published in July would violate the UK’s international and domestic human rights obligations and remove all legal remedies available to victims. We strongly urge you to publicly oppose these plans. 
The UK government should be working bilaterally with the Irish government to establish human rights compliant mechanisms to finally deliver the truth, justice, and accountability to which victims are entitled. Instead, they are pursuing a path which will unduly interfere in the justice system, undermine the rule of law, perpetuate impunity, and grossly dismiss victims’ suffering. 
Given the long-standing role and influence of the U.S. government in the peace process in Northern Ireland, the Biden administration is uniquely positioned to influence the UK. This role was recognized by 21 U.S. lawmakers in their November 10 letter to Secretary Blinken. Amnesty shares their concerns and joins their call for the Biden administration to publicly reject the proposed legacy law. 
We note with appreciation the several statements that President Biden and administration officials have issued on preserving peace in Northern Ireland. Having already recognized the necessity of existing agreements, we hope that you will make a public statement opposing the UK authorities’ plans and urging them to deal with the past in a rights-respecting manner. 
We would welcome an opportunity to discuss further. We are working with a number of victims of both state and non-state actors with whom you may also wish to speak.

Dear Nicolás Maduro, 
I am deeply alarmed that prisoner of conscience and human rights defender Javier Tarazona, director of the organization FundaREDES, continues to be detained and subjected to an unfair criminal proceeding. He must be released immediately and unconditionally, in so that he can receive the medical attention and treatment he requires urgently. 
FundaREDES monitors, documents and reports human rights abuses committed by non-state actors in border areas of Venezuela. The charge he faces, and for which Javier Tarazona continues to be unfairly detained, appears to be politically motivated as SEBIN (Servicio Bolivariano de Inteligencia Nacional) agents detained him without a warrant and the court charged him with “terrorism”, both elements of the well-documented pattern of arbitrary detentions. Two other FundaREDES defenders, Rafael Tarazona and Omar de Dios García, are also subject to arbitrary criminal proceedings that must be closed immediately. 
We urge you to immediately and unconditionally release prisoner of conscience Javier Tarazona, close all criminal investigations into these three human rights defenders, and end the harassment and criminalization of non-governmental organizations in Venezuela.

Dear Minister, 
I write to express my concern about the authorities’ plans to deport Mohamed Nour Ammar, Samar Mohamed Nour Ammar and Salem Tawlidi Adhanom, three Eritrean nationals who are arbitrarily detained at al-Qusayr police station, Red Sea governorate. The three were part of a group of 18 Eritreans from the same family, who were arrested on October 24, 2019 at the Egyptian-Sudanese border. Egyptian authorities deported eight of them on October 31, and seven on November 18, 2021. The 18 individuals were denied their right to legal representation and access to asylum procedures and were held without any legal basis. They were held in cruel and inhuman conditions, crammed into narrow cells and denied exercise or access to sunlight. The authorities did not provide them with any clothes or items for personal hygiene including sanitary napkins for women and girls. Their families were only able to visit them four times during their two years of detention. 
In a statement issued on November 19, 2021, UN human rights experts condemned Egypt’s deportation of the Eritreans without any due process and expressed concern about the disappearance of the eight Eritreans expelled in October, noting that those returned “are often detained upon arrival to Eritrea, questioned, tortured, held in extremely punitive conditions and disappeared”. Amnesty International understands that Mohamed Nour Ammar, Samar Mohamed Nour Ammar and Salem Tawlidi Adhanom have not yet been deported due to lack of travel documents. 
In October, the authorities halted their plans to deport Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi, two other Eritrean nationals who have been arbitrarily detained for more than seven years at al-Qanatar Prison for men, north of Cairo. However, they have travel documents and risk deportation at any time. 
I urge you to immediately halt the deportation of Mohamed Nour Ammar, Samar Mohamed Nour Ammar, Salem Tawlidi Adhanom, Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi, release them and grant them access to asylum procedures. Pending their release, ensure that they are held in conditions meeting international standards on the treatment of prisoners. I also urge you to end the deportation of all Eritreans without access to asylum procedures as it violates the principle of non-refoulement.

Your Excellency, 
Human rights lawyer Hoda Abdelmoniem has been arbitrarily detained for over three years, solely in relation to her human rights work. After spending 35 months in pre-trial detention, the Supreme State Security Prosecution referred her to trial by the Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) on charges of joining, financing, and supporting a “terrorist group” and disseminating news on social media accusing the security forces of human rights violations through a Facebook page titled “the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms” in order to incite violence against state institutions. These charges relate to her work with the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF). Proceedings by the ESSCs, which are special courts activated when there is a state of emergency, are inherently unfair and their verdicts are not subject to appeal. Hoda Abdelmoniem’s right to adequate defence has also been violated, as she is banned from meeting with her lawyer except in court. The trial, which began on September 11, 2021, has been adjourned to December 15, 2021. 
During a court hearing held on October 11, 2021, Hoda Abdelmoniem told the judges that the prison doctor said she required a cardiac catheterization and requested her release on medical grounds. She reported also being told by the prison doctor that transfers to external hospitals were suspended because of Covid-19. Amnesty International is aware of the transfer of other prisoners to external hospitals since the Covid-19 outbreak, including Hoda Abdelmoniem’s brief transfer on November 30, 2020, for treatment for suspected kidney failure. In addition to her heart condition, she has kidney disease, arterial thrombosis, and high blood pressure. Officials at the al-Qanater Prison for women, where she is held, have denied any prison visits or other contact with her family since her detention on November 1, 2018. Her relatives also continue to be denied access to her medical records, raising their anguish about her health. The judges presiding over her trial dismissed requests to ensure her access to adequate health care and family visits. 
We therefore urge you to ensure that Hoda Abdelmoniem is immediately and unconditionally released and all charges against her are dropped as her detention and prosecution stem solely from her human rights work. Pending her release, we call on you to ensure that she is provided with the means to regularly communicate with her family and lawyers, has regular access to adequate health care including outside of prison and is provided with her medical records.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
At 5:30am on November 15, 2021, dozens of members of the Moroccan security forces in civilian clothes broke into the house of Sahrawi woman activist Sultana Khaya, where she is under de facto house arrest along with her two sisters and mother, subjected her to rape and sexually harassed her sisters and mother. They also searched the house, after entering from the roof, damaging doors and closets, throwing belongings onto the floor and pouring toxic substances around the house. The authorities have still never presented Sultana Khaya with an arrest warrant or justification for the house arrest. 
Four of the security agents held Sultana Khaya down on the floor and immobilized her, one by putting his hands on her mouth and one by putting his ankle on her flank before opening the bottom of her traditional dress and raping her by the insertion of four fingers inside her vagina for around 20 minutes, according to testimonies from Sultana and sister, Waara Khaya to Amnesty International. The men also sexually assaulted her mother and two sisters, touching them inappropriately. According to Waara Khaya’s testimony, they put their hands inside her trousers and touched her breasts. 
Sultana Khaya told Amnesty International that she was left with wounds from the rape. She did not go to a doctor because she is prevented from leaving the house and from receiving visitors, due to their house arrest. Security forces have repeatedly assaulted Sultana Khaya, members of her family and their visitors since the start of the house arrest in November 2020. 
I urge you to put an immediate end to the brutal attacks against Sultana Khaya and her family and to carry out a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, transparent, and effective investigation into the security forces’ abusive force and attacks against her and her family, including the report of rape and sexual assault, and ensure that those suspected to be responsible are brought to justice in fair trials. I urge you to ensure that Sultana Khaya and her family are provided with access to justice and effective remedies, including adequate compensation, and guarantee of non-repetition for the violations of human rights to which they have been subjected. I further urge you to immediately end the arbitrary house arrest against Sultana Khaya and her family and respect their rights to freedom of movement, expression, and association.

A dialogue during which several prominent human rights defenders and critics continued to be tried and sentenced in sham trials for exercising their rights to free speech. 
Amnesty and the signatories to the letter have thoroughly documented flagrant, systemic human rights abuses and crackdowns by the Egyptian government. The Biden administration’s lack of robust action in response to Egypt’s brazen human rights abuses renders hollow its commitment to “protecting and supporting human rights defenders,” and it is time for this administration to exercise real political will and stand up to the Egyptian government on human rights.

Dear Secretary Blinken, 
Our organizations write to you in response to the disappointing U.S.-Egypt Strategic Dialogue held on November 8-9 in Washington, DC. In the days leading up to the dialogue, the State Department both publicly and privately committed to elevate human rights and accountability for abuses as a topline priority with Egyptian authorities. By all appearances, the Biden administration has failed that commitment. 
The Joint Statement released after the dialogue mentions human rights in passing, certainly in far less depth than the numerous “defense cooperation” commitments agreed upon with the Egyptian government. In fact, the statement fails to mention any specific human rights concerns or agreements. 
The Biden administration also “welcomed Egypt’s National Human Rights Strategy, and national plans to advance human rights in the country in cooperation with civil society.” This “strategy,” launched by President Abdel al-Sisi in September, is not a meaningful commitment to addressing the human rights crisis in Egypt. It fails to acknowledge the Egyptian government’s wielding of draconian legislation to criminalize freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as the violations committed by security forces with absolute impunity. The strategy also ignores Egyptian authorities’ ongoing abuse of vague counter-terrorism laws to stifle and punish critics and civil society, as well as the widespread use of extrajudicial killings, torture, enforced disappearances, and systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities, LGBTQ+ Egyptians, migrants, and asylum seekers. It also fails to hold security forces accountable for the killing of over 900 protestors in the 2013 Rabaa massacre. 
The claim that al-Sisi’s government intends to meaningfully cooperate with civil society and implement genuine reforms is belied by the ongoing crackdown on human rights groups. Instead, authorities broadly and unjustly continue to arbitrarily detain, target, and punish rights defenders, civil society workers, journalists, and opposition politicians over their lawful criticism of Egyptian authorities and Egypt’s human rights record. The Biden administration knows their names: Ibrahim Ezz el-Din, Patrick George Zaki, Haytham Mohamdeen, Ezzat Ghoniem, Hoda Abdelmoniem, Mohamed Baker, Alaa Abdel Fattah, Zyad el-Elaimy, Hossam Moanis, Hisham Fouad, Abdel Nasser Salama, and countless more. In these and many other cases, authorities have tried and imprisoned critics on spurious charges of “spreading false news” in blatant sham trials. 
At the time of writing, prominent human rights defender and director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights Hossam Bahghat has been awaiting his verdict next week on spurious charges stemming from his human rights activism. Egyptian courts also convicted Bahey el-Din Hassan, director of the Cairo Institute for Human Rights, in two separate cases in absentia, sentencing him on fabricated charges to a total of 18 years of imprisonment for exercising his human rights. Additionally, criminal investigations under Case 173 are still targeting at least 15 rights defenders and civil society workers, and even those no longer under investigation in the case still face arbitrary travel bans and asset freezes imposed by Egyptian authorities. 
While the Strategic Dialogue was held in Washington, thousands in Egypt remain arbitrarily imprisoned. This includes rights defenders, journalists, and opposition leaders targeted by abusive terrorism-related charges, in many cases subjected by authorities to torture, ill-treatment, and denial of adequate medical care. At least 83 executions have been recorded so far in 2021, an alarming rise for the world’s third worst executioner in 2020. Especially concerning is that at least 36 men remain at risk of execution following unappealable convictions by emergency courts in grossly unfair trials rampant with violations and claims of “confessions” extracted under torture. Calls and recommendations by UN bodies and member states, along with international and Egyptian rights groups, have been largely ignored by Egyptian authorities who have instead given a façade of “reform” via the release of a limited number of detainees–some arbitrarily held for years–without dropping the threat of further arrest and prosecution. 
Despite President al-Sisi’s lifting of Egypt’s four years-long nation-wide state of emergency, Egypt’s parliament quickly passed other amendments to further entrench the president’s exceptional powers and the unjust jurisdiction of military courts over civilians, and dozens of dissidents continue to face sham trials in “emergency courts.” Broadly, Egyptian authorities have transformed Egypt into an “open-air prison for critics,” increasingly using extreme measures to destroy rights defenders’ lives, all with the green light of billions in U.S. security aid. This repression extends beyond Egypt’s borders, with authorities carrying out reprisals against families of Egyptian dissidents living abroad. The Biden administration knows well the case of Mohamed Soltan, a U.S-based rights defender, and his father Salah Soltan–held incommunicado in Egypt in apparent reprisal for Mohamed’s activism. 
U.S. law prohibits the continuation of arms transfers to any government determined to have carried out such a pattern of harassment against individuals in the United States. The Foreign Assistance Act also clearly bars the United States from providing security assistance to grave rights abusers such as the Egyptian government, let alone when credible evidence confirms use of U.S.-provided arms in said abuses. There are no exceptions in these laws that support the administration’s convoluted justifications. 
Yet, with this Strategic Dialogue, the administration made no public acknowledgement or indication of the need to reevaluate and condition U.S. security assistance to Egypt on the basis of human rights–which the U.S. should do until al-Sisi’s government takes tangible measures to end systemic abuses and improve human rights conditions. As the U.S. begins its membership term on the UN Human Rights Council in January 2022, it should also push for the establishment of a UN human rights monitoring mechanism in Egypt. The Biden administration should take such steps to promote meaningful accountability for the systemic rights violations carried out by the Egyptian government with total impunity. 
The Biden administration’s lack of robust action in response to Egypt’s brazen human rights abuses renders hollow its commitment to “protecting and supporting human rights defenders,” and it is time for this administration to exercise real political will and stand up to the Egyptian government on human rights.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear President Xi, 
I am writing to express grave concern for the life of citizen journalist Zhang Zhan (张展), who has been on partial hunger strike in protest of her incarceration. A prisoner of conscience imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression when she reported about COVID-19, Zhang Zhan should not have spent a single day in prison. 
It is alarming to learn that, due to her dire health condition, Zhang Zhan’s family do not expect her to live through the winter if she is not immediately released on medical grounds. Feeling incredibly weak, she reportedly has no energy to walk nor raise her head and, with yellowed skin, looks to be suffering from a life-threatening condition. 
Following an interrupted video call on October 14, 2021, her family were distressed to find out that Zhang Zhan had again been forced fed and was restrained for 11 days to prevent her removing her feeding tube. Instead of respecting her right to express her opinion and her choice to be on hunger strike, the prison authorities punished her in a manner that violated the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, going against China’s obligations under international human rights law. 
It is further worrying that Zhang Zhan still does not have regular access to her family members and lawyers and there is no way to verify her health and wellbeing. 
There is an alarming pattern of deaths of imprisoned Chinese activists, either in detention or after being belatedly released on medical parole. To ensure that no one else dies while in your detention facilities, I urge you to:

Dear H.E Cleopas Dlamini, 
I am writing to express my deep concerns stemming from the ongoing unrest in the Kingdom of Eswatini. Amid a wave of pro-democracy protests, two members of your parliament, Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza of Ngwempisa constituency and Mthandeni Dube of Hosea constituency, were arrested on July 25, 2021, under the draconian Suppression of Terrorism Act and other trumped-up charges. Their trial began on October 20, 2021. 
The two MPs’ arrests came amid a wave of protests sparked in June 2021 calling for political reform following the mysterious death of 25-year-old law student, Thabani Nkomonye, who allegedly died at the hands of the police in early May 2021. Since their arrest in July, peaceful protests and demonstrations have emerged nationwide calling for their release and an end to the use of excessive force against peaceful protestors. Following a High Court Judge’s refusal to grant MP Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and MP Mthandeni Dube bail on September 14, 2021, there has been an even further escalation resulting in arbitrary arrests of peaceful protestors, loss of life, allegations of torture and other ill treatment. 
Not only are certain provisions in the Suppression of Terrorism Act of 2008 threatening to human rights and inherently repressive – they also breach Eswatini’s obligations under international and regional human rights law and the Constitution of Eswatini. This is directly in violation of the rights of freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly. Activism, be it political or otherwise, should be possible in Eswatini without fear of reprisal. Despite political differences, respect for human rights law should be adhered to. 
In light of the above, I urge you to immediately release MP Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and MP Mthandeni Dube, and all others arbitrarily detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and drop all charges against them. I also urge you to repeal or amend repressive laws such as the Suppression of Terrorism Act, the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act and the Public Order Act.

Your Majesty, 
On November 10, 2021, 10 Egyptian Nubian men are due to attend their first hearing before the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC), after having been detained for almost 16 months without charge. The Saudi General Directorate of Investigation (al-Mabahith) arrested the men on July 14, 2020, in relation to a cultural event they had planned on October 25, 2019 to mark the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. 
According to one of the detainees’ relatives, the men were first arrested on the morning of the said event. Saudi security officials interrogated them about the event, namely accusing them of failing to include the photo of Egyptian President General Abdelfattah al-Sisi in the event’s announcement poster, alongside other Egyptian army generals. The detained men explained that the event was not political but rather focused on celebrating Nubian soldiers who had taken part in that war. On December 25, 2019, after two months in detention without charge, the men were released on travel ban pending the case’s resumption. On 14 July 2020, all 10 men were re-arrested and detained in al-Ha’ir prison in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. In April 2021, they were transferred to Assir prison in Abha city, where they have been denied access to lawyers of their choosing, appointed instead lawyers by the authorities, and have continued to be held without charge. The Egyptian consulate in Riyadh has failed to date to provide any consular assistance or facilitate the consular rights of those detained, despite the families’ recurrent pleas for action. Instead, it issued a statement on October 29, 2020 supporting their detention. 
A relative of one of the men told Amnesty International: “Some of the detainees are senior and suffer ailments like diabetes, gangrene and cardiovascular problems. They are rarely allowed to contact their families, and they fear speaking on the phone because of surveillance.” 
I urge you to release all ten men immediately as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I call on you to ensure that they have full access to medical care, lawyers of their choice and regular contact with their families. Furthermore, I urge you to protect minorities of all ethnic, cultural, and linguistic identities, and grant them their basic human right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and association in Saudi Arabia.

Police in Adrar arrested Mohad Gasmi on June 14, 2020. His house was searched and police seized his phone, computer and USB flash drive. He was charged with “glorification of terrorism” for a Facebook post where he attributes the radicalization of a prominent Algerian militant, considered a “terrorist” by the Algerian authorities, to their failure to deliver justice and dignity to their population. 
Mohad Gasmi is a civil society and environmental activist who was among the leaders of the protest movement against the exploitation of the shale gas in the south of Algeria between 2012 and 2015. He also took part in the Hirak protests which erupted in February 2019 and called for political change in Algeria. 
The Algerian authorities are increasingly resorting to trumped up terrorism-related charges to prosecute journalists, human rights defenders and political activists in the country. Journalists Hassan Bouras and Mohamed Mouloudj are currently held in pre-trial detention on terrorism-related charges for their online publications criticizing the authorities. Three members of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights in Oran are also being prosecuted for “terrorism” to punish them for their participation in the Hirak movement. 
In light of the above, I ask you to immediately release Mohad Gasmi and quash his conviction, as he is detained solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. I also call on you to stop using bogus charges of terrorism to crackdown on peaceful activism in Algeria.

Dear Minister, 
I write to you to draw your attention to the case of human rights defender and LGBTI activist Badr Baabou, who was insulted and violently assaulted, apparently in connection with his work as an activist. 
According to testimony that Badr Baabou provided to Amnesty International, around 9:00pm on October 21, 2021, Badr Baabou left a cafe in downtown Tunis and was looking for a taxi when two men whom he believes were members of the security forces, and who identified themselves as ‘cops’ when asked by the activist, insulted him, accosted him, and beat him severely. As Badr Baabou lay on the ground, his head bleeding, the men stole his laptop and mobile phone, and told him the beating was retaliation against him for filing complaints against the police and “defending whores and [a derogatory term in Tunisian Arabic for homosexuals].” The remarks appear to be a clear indication that Badr Baabou is being targeted for his LGBTI rights activism. 
Badr Baabou suffered numerous injuries during the assault, including to his head, face, chest, spine, and upper limb, as described in a medical report he provided to Amnesty International. He also has multiple bruises and oedemas on his face, neck and shoulder, and suffers from pain in his neck, back and right shoulder that limits his movements. 
Badr Baabou is the chairman of ‘DAMJ, the Tunisian association for justice and equality’, one of the Tunisia’s most prominent LGBTI rights groups. In past years he has been frequently assaulted and harassed by the security forces. On October 25, 2021, the activist filed a complaint with Tunis’ Court of First Instance directed against Tunisia’s General Director of National Security, General Director of Public Security, Regional Head of Public Security, and the two men who assaulted and robbed him and whom he alleges to be members of security forces. The complaint has yet to be responded to. 
In light of the above, I call on you to ask the public prosecutor to open an effective and impartial investigation into Badr Baabou’s violent assault and the ones that preceded it, bringing all those found to be responsible to account in fair trial proceedings. These repeated attacks must end immediately. I also call on you to end the impunity enjoyed by police officers. Il-treatment and violence against citizens remain rampant in Tunisia today. The overwhelming majority of investigations into members of the security forces hardly ever make it past the investigative phase and none have led to successful sentencing of perpetrators.

Your Excellency, 
On September 28, 2021, human rights defender and master’s student Patrick George Zaki was referred to trial in front of the Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) on the charge of “spreading false news at home and abroad” in connection to an article published in 2019, containing exurbs from his personal diary about the discrimination faced by Coptic Christians in Egypt. He already spent 20 months in unjust pretrial detention pending investigations into charges of “disseminating false news”, “incitement to protest” and “incitement to violence and terrorist crimes” in a separate case. Proceedings by the ESSCs, which are special courts activated when there is a state of emergency, are inherently unfair, and their verdicts are not subject to appeal. His trial was adjourned to December 7, 2021, following requests by his lawyer to obtain a copy of his casefile. 
Patrick George Zaki’s friends and supporters were able to see him during the September 28, 2021, court hearing and reported that he appeared angry and distraught by his unjust detention. Even though he suffers from asthma, he has not been vaccinated against Covid-19. His lawyers’ complaint to the administrative court against the failure of the authorities to vaccinate him was pending at the time of writing. He is also suffering from back pain due to his detention conditions and is forced to sleep on rough blankets on the floor as prison authorities deny him a bed or mattress. 
Patrick George Zaki has been detained in Tora Investigation Prison since his arbitrary arrest at Cairo airport in February 2020 upon his return from Italy where he was studying. According to his lawyers, following his arrest, National Security Agency (NSA) officers subjected him to torture and other ill-treatment, including though the administration of electric shocks and beatings during interrogations which revolved around his human rights work. Amnesty International considers Patrick George Zaki to be a prisoner of conscience held solely for the peaceful exercise of his human rights. 
I therefore ask you to ensure that Patrick George Zaki is released immediately and unconditionally and that all charges against him are dropped, as they stem solely from his exercise of his human rights. I also urge you to open an independent investigation into his torture allegations, with a view to bringing those responsible to justice. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is provided with adequate access to healthcare, including to Covid-19 vaccines, and held in conditions meeting international standards on the treatment of prisoners.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Minister, 
I am writing to express concern about plans to forcibly return Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi, two Eritrean nationals arbitrarily detained at al-Qanater Prison for men, north of Cairo, to Eritrea where they would be at risk of arbitrary detention and torture. 
On September 9, 2021 prison officials forced them to undergo Covid-19 PCR tests at a hospital outside the prison and to sign documents in Arabic that they were unable to read, before informing them about plans to deport them without specifying a date. Security forces arrested 42-year-old Alem Tesfay Abraham at the Salloum border crossing with Libya on March 10, 2012, while 37-year-old Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi was arrested on December 30, 2013 in North Sinai Governorate. According to their lawyer, they have not been charged with any criminal offence since and have been repeatedly pressured to “voluntarily” return to Eritrea by officials at the migration department of the interior ministry. The two men have refused and have repeatedly requested to register for protection with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
On July 23, 2020, three UN independent experts wrote to the Egyptian government raising concerns about the two men’s prolonged arbitrary detention and denial of the right to seek asylum. According to a refugee rights activist, shortly after this communication, prison officials verbally and physically assaulted the two men, and threatened to deport them. Going ahead with plans to deport them would violate the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning anyone to a place where they would be at real risk of torture and other serious human rights violations. 
I therefore ask you to immediately halt any plans to forcibly return Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi to Eritrea, release them as they are detained arbitrarily without any legal basis and grant them access to asylum procedures. Pending their release, I urge you to protect them from torture and other ill-treatment and ensure that they are held in conditions in line with international standards for the treatment of prisoners. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Nicolás Maduro, 
I am deeply alarmed that human rights defenders, Javier Tarazona, Rafael Tarazona and Omar de Dios García from the organization FundaREDES have not been released after having spent over three months arbitrarily detained. Their arbitrary detention and the ensuing criminal investigations against them must be stopped immediately. 
FundaREDES monitor, document and report on human rights abuses committed by armed groups in Venezuela’s border regions. The charges they face appear to be politically motivated since SEBIN officers arrested them without an arrest warrant, and the court charged them with terrorism, which are elements of a well-documented pattern of arbitrary detentions. In addition, they have been denied access to trusted legal representation, and the delays to their pre-trial hearing violates their right to due process. 
We urge you to release Javier Tarazona, Rafael Tarazona and Omar de Dios García immediately and unconditionally, close all criminal investigations into these human rights defenders, and put an end to the harassment and criminalization of non-governmental organizations in Venezuela. 
Sincerely,

Circuit Court granted the government’s request for stay in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, allowing the Biden administration to continue expelling families and children to danger under its inhumane Title 42 policy. Two weeks ago a federal judge ruled Title 42 illegal, issuing an injunction that would have taken effect today. The Biden administration’s decision to continue defending the policy in court has put that injunction on pause. The consequences for families and children seeking safety will be deadly.","Yesterday the D.C. Circuit Court granted the government’s request for stay in Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, allowing the Biden administration to continue expelling families and children to danger under its inhumane Title 42 policy. Two weeks ago a federal judge ruled Title 42 illegal, issuing an injunction that would have taken effect today. The Biden administration’s decision to continue defending the policy in court has put that injunction on pause. The consequences for families and children seeking safety will be deadly. 
Members of the #WelcomeWithDignity campaign, which include organizations serving people expelled under Title 42 and litigators in the Huisha-Huisha case, responded to the ruling: 
“Once again, the Biden Administration has shown that it is more committed to defending Title 42 than upholding the human rights of asylum-seekers,” said Amy Fischer, Americas Advocacy Director at Amnesty International USA. “The continued weaponization of the pandemic to expel people from our border will result in serious harm for the thousands who have been denied protection, including thousands of Haitians who have been brutalized and expelled under the policy in recent weeks. There is simply no way around it – Title 42 must end, and every day the Biden Administration fights to uphold it, they choose xenophobia and racism over protecting human rights.” 
“The Biden administration should have never appealed this case,” said Tami Goodlette, Director of Litigation at Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES) and co-counsel in the Huisha-Huisha case. “The lower court concluded Title 42 was illegal and should not be applied to exclude families from seeking asylum in the U.S. But rather than allow families to seek refuge in our country — which is legal under U.S. law and international law — the administration chose to further promulgate the Trump administration’s racist and xenophobic policies by appealing the case, and then proceeding to expel thousands of Haitians from Del Rio, Texas under Title 42. The Biden administration has lost its way and needs to remember its promises from the election. Migrants deserve better. Our country deserves better.” 
“The Biden administration’s embrace of Title 42 has exposed people seeking safety to untold violence and suffering,” said Neela Chakravartula, Managing Attorney at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and co-counsel in the Huisha-Huisha case. “The administration’s decision to defend the policy in court is unconscionable, and a complete betrayal of the president’s promise to restore access to asylum. Recent events have laid bare the tragic consequences of Title 42. In less than two weeks, the administration has expelled over 5,000 Haitians to a country plagued with widespread violence and insecurity – a human rights travesty, and no small operational feat. They could have used those resources to safely welcome Haitians seeking refuge. Instead, the president has adopted Trump’s racist policy as his own, without regard for the families and children harmed as a result.” 
“All President Biden needed to do to stop applying Trump’s Title 42 to families was not seek a stay or appeal, but they did,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, Immigrant Defenders’ Co-Founder and Executive Director. “Expelling families with kids and other asylum seekers back to the dangerous countries they have fled with no due process is now a Biden policy, one that the Biden Administration fought hard to keep.” 
“Abusing an obscure public health rule to shut down our asylum system is Stephen Miller’s racist legacy. Every day that the Biden administration allows this policy to remain in place is a day that the government knowingly puts children and families in harm’s way. What we witnessed at Del Rio last week is a stark reminder of just how violent this policy is. It’s an insult to America’s family values that within the past month thousands of Haitians — including babies and toddlers — have been expelled back to danger,” said Paola Luisi, Director of Families Belong Together. “The Biden administration should live up to its promises and end Title 42 immediately. The world is watching Mr. President: we should be protecting children and families, not expelling them back to danger.”  
“The Biden Administration’s embrace of Title 42 is so absolutely maliciously evil because they’ve done that political calculus that this obscure policy is just complex enough to never grip the mainstream media’s and public’s full attention so the government can just continue harming immigrants without being held accountable,” said Jonathan Goldman, Executive Director of the Student Clinic for Immigrant Justice. “There is no excuse here. They are complicit in the harm started by Trump. The Biden Administration has not simply continued the policy, which would have been bad enough, but they’ve actively attempted to keep it alive.” 
“The Biden Administration’s continued defense of Title 42 and its ongoing, devastating effects on human rights at the U.S-Mexico border, which includes over 5,400 Haitians unjustly and cruelly expelled pursuant to these policies within the last 11 days, is outrageous and unconscionable. We will not rest until these practices are eliminated and full reparations have been made to all those who have been affected by these serious human rights crimes,” said Camilo Pérez-Bustillo, on behalf of the leadership team of Witness at the Border. 
“What we know about Title 42 after a year of witnessing its impact firsthand at the border is this: it puts vulnerable migrants in danger, it violates asylum law and it empowers criminal groups to take advantage of those who are expelled,” said Dylan Corbett, Executive Director of Hope Border Institute. “Title 42 was the driving force behind the mass deportations of Haitian refugees, one of the largest mass expulsions in US history. The court’s decision yesterday was a troubling denial of the reality at the border and the unnecessary suffering of the families we are putting in harm’s way.”  
“Title 42 was a disgrace under the Trump Administration, and now, a disgrace under the Biden Administration.” said Karen Tumlin, Founder and Director of Justice Action Center. “The unlawful and immoral policy has never been about protecting public health, but rather, the power to summarily expel asylum seekers back to the very danger they are fleeing. That the Biden Administration would deliberately pursue to uphold the application of Title 42 to children and families is particularly shameful, and immigrant communities and advocates will continue to call on President Biden to end this immoral and unlawful policy once and for all.” 
“The D.C. Circuit court’s decision, which allows the Biden administration to continue to shut the door to people seeking protection and send them back to harm without due process, is beyond disappointing, it is devastating,” said Luis Guerra, CLINIC’s Strategic Capacity Officer.  “We will continue to urge the Biden administration to take bold action at our border by creating safe and dignified pathways for those seeking protection and stop hiding behind and upholding the xenophobic policies of the prior administration. The continued use of Title 42 is shameful, unconscionable and simply inhumane; President Biden has the power and means to end it today. Continuing Title 42 is an absolute affront to our laws and our humanity.” 
“The Florence Project is dismayed that a court has granted the Biden administration’s request to halt a court order that would have protected families seeking protection in the United States,” said Chelsea Sachau, an attorney with the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights  Project. “People we meet on the Arizona-Sonora border tell us every day that Title 42 puts them in extremely dangerous situations. Asylum seekers tell us that they want to abide by a safe, orderly asylum process. However, despite campaign promises to the contrary, the Biden administration has failed to give them one, even after nine months in office. In fact, they are fighting tooth and nail to defend this indefensible, Trump-era policy and as a result, to prolong the tremendous human suffering it causes. We can welcome asylum seekers safely and with dignity – the Biden administration is choosing not to at every single opportunity.” 
“The calls come daily, a young journalist in Nicaragua whose life is being threatened because of his political views, a mother and her two young children who watched her brother’s murder by cartel and was told they were next, the thousands of people standing on the other side of a horrific wall seeking refuge from climate disasters, violence, and so much more, all turned away because of a public health law dug up by Stephen Miller to forward his racist agenda”, said Laurie Benson, Founder of Madres e Hijos. “Every day that the Biden Administration fights to keep this policy in place is a day that they put politics before people, political agendas before humanity.” 
“The Biden administration’s continued embrace of Title 42 expulsions defies domestic and international law, disregards experts’ repeated advice on how to handle public health, and puts families and individuals in danger,” said Andrew Geibel, Policy Counsel at HIAS. “Its continued use, including its use to deport over 5,000 vulnerable Haitians back to a country that cannot properly integrate them, shocks the conscience. The Biden administration should end this appeal immediately.” 
“The federal court of appeals ruling allowing the Biden Administration to continue migrant expulsions at the border under Title 42 is a major disappointment,” said Joan Rosenhauer, Executive Director of Jesuit Refugee Service USA. “When President Biden campaigned in 2020, he promised he would repair our asylum process and rebuild it from the Trump Administration’s attempts to dismantle it and prevent asylum seekers, as well as refugees and other immigrants, from entering the United States. Instead, he is continuing some of the Trump Administration’s worst policies. Rather than defending and legitimizing President Trump’s legacy, the Biden Administration should be putting more policies in place based on respect for international law and the United States’ legacy of welcoming the stranger and providing safety for those fleeing persecution. Title 42 represents the complete opposite.”  
“While yesterday’s decision from the court was disappointing, ultimately nothing is preventing the Biden administration from doing the right thing and choosing to end its use of Title 42 to expel families and adults seeking protection at our border,” said Ursela Ojeda Senior Policy Advisor for Migrant Rights and Justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “Title 42 is an unlawful and xenophobic Trump-era policy that weaponized public health to shut down access to protection at the border. We are outraged by the Biden administration’s decision to continue such expulsions which summarily return vulnerable individuals and families to harm and perpetuate suffering and chaos at the border. We call on the administration to finally restore access to asylum, including by reopening ports of entry.” 
“Just days after witnessing images of the horrific abuses of Black migrants seeking safety at our borders under Title 42, it is disturbing that the Biden administration would continue to maintain and defend this callous policy harming people seeking refuge,” said Avideh Moussavian, director of federal advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center.  “That last night’s ruling came on the same day that DHS issued new enforcement priorities that arbitrarily and unjustly label people as threats to borders security based solely on their attempt to enter the U.S. – often under the most vulnerable and desperate circumstances – speaks to this administration’s deeply harmful focus on deterrence. We will continue to fight this policy and others that disproportionately impact Black and LGBTQIA+ asylum seekers and push to hold this administration accountable to its promise to build a 21st century immigration system that centers the dignity of everyone.”

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Counsellor, 
I am writing to raise my concerns about the ongoing arbitrary detention of activist Alaa Abdel Fattah and lawyer Mohamed Baker, who have been in pre-trial detention over unfounded terrorist-related accusations since September 29, 2019, solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights. They are held in cruel, inhuman and degrading conditions, that violate the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, at the Tora Maximum Security 2 Prison, in Cairo, the Egyptian capital. 
On September 13, 2021 Alaa Abdel Fattah’s lawyer and family publicly raised the alarm about him being in “imminent danger” and expressed concerns that he may be suicidal. In a statement published on September 14, 2021, his family denounced the authorities’ barring him from reading books and newspapers and accessing sunlight and clean water, noting that these horrid conditions are having a detrimental impact on his mental health. They wrote: “His mental health is failing after two years of careful planning and cruel implementation by the interior ministry and National Security Agency [a specialized police force with a mandate of policing terrorism and security threats]. His life is in danger, in a prison that operates completely outside the space of the law and with the complete disregard of all officials, foremost among them the public prosecutor, the interior minister, the justice minister, and of course the president.” Despite his mother, Leila Souef’s, near daily trips to, and hours-long wait at, the prison gate since September 19, 2021, the prison authorities have been cruelly denying her a letter from him raising further concerns about his wellbeing. Prison authorities are holding Mohamed Baker in similarly cruel conditions. He is confined around the clock in a small and poorly ventilated cell and deprived of a bed, books, and newspapers. 
Both men remain in pre-trial detention pending investigations into bogus terrorism accusations in violation of the Egyptian Code of Criminal Procedures, which sets the maximum duration for pre-trial detention at two years for crimes punishable by the death penalty or life imprisonment. They have not been charged, presented with evidence linking them to any crime, or allowed to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker immediately and unconditionally and drop all charges against them as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I urge you to ensure that they are held in conditions meeting international standards, including being granted access to adequate medical care, including in specialized facilities outside prison when required, protected from torture and other ill-treatment, and allowed to regularly communicate with their families. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Alfredo Pacheco, 
Right now, human rights activists across the Dominican Republic are demanding that the reform of the country’s criminal code includes the protection of LGBTIQ+ rights and the decriminalization of abortion in three limited circumstances: when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life of a pregnant woman or girl, when the fetus could not survive outside the womb, and when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. These demands are a human rights imperative for the Dominican Republic and must be approved. 
The Dominican Republic’s current legislation that outlaws abortion under all circumstances causes a serious and urgent public health problem, leading to avoidable deaths of women and pregnant people, generally from the most vulnerable sectors of the population. 
Over the last 25 years, more than 50 countries have changed their laws to allow for greater access to abortion, recognizing the vital role that access to safe abortion plays in protecting lives and health. Such reforms are widely supported by human rights standards, as well as by public health experts. The World Health Organization, along with prominent medical associations, support the decriminalization of abortion, asserting that criminalization does not have the intended effect of reducing the numbers of abortions and only leads to women seeking unsafe clandestine abortion that put their lives and health at risk. 
Sadly, the Dominican Republic continues to be amongst the last countries in the world to maintain a complete ban on abortion. The current debate over the reform of the country’s criminal code represents an historic opportunity to change this situation and stand on the right side of history. 
Equally, by failing to ensure that the Criminal Code includes protections against torture, violence and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Dominican Republic would sustain inequalities, perpetuate discrimination and stigmatization of LGBTIQ+ people, preventing them from enjoying a whole range of other rights. 
Therefore, I call on to you to approve a reformed criminal code that meets the Dominican Republic’s obligations under international human rights law to respect, protect, and fulfil the rights of women, girls, and LGBTIQ+ people to life, health, autonomy, and dignity.

Dear Prime Minister, 
I am writing to express my concern about Talalelei Pauga (Pauga), an Australian citizen with dual Samoan nationality, who is subject to an extradition request from the former Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi (Tuilaepa) over an alleged plot to assassinate him. Because of his vocal opposition to the former Samoan Prime Minister, Amnesty International believes the charges against Pauga are politically motivated and without merit and that he may not receive a fair trial if extradited. 
Under Australia’s extradition laws with Samoa, minimal evidence is required for the Australian government to act on the extradition request from Samoa. As a result, Pauga has been detained in Australia since August 2020 (more than a year) without knowing the evidence against him. This raises serious concerns about arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial. 
Amnesty International and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers have expressed their concerns on the independence of judges and lawyers in Samoa following law reforms in 2020. In addition, the former Prime Minister Tuilaepa, now opposition leader in Samoa, continues to exert significant influence in the country that may undermine the right to a fair trial. 
Samoa should re-establish its position as a leader on human rights in the Pacific region and ensure that no one is charged or imprisoned for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and political opinion.

Your Excellency, 
Human rights lawyer and former parliamentarian, Zyad el-Elaimy, journalist and politician Hossam Moanis, trade unionist and socialist politician Hisham Fouad, and three others were referred to trial in July 2021 in front of an Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) on the charge of “spreading false news to undermine the state, national security, public security and spreading panic among the people” in Case No.957/ 2021. 
Amnesty International considers the three men to be prisoners of conscience, targeted solely due to their peaceful political activities. They have been held in pretrial detention since July 2019 and denied the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention. On June 23 and July 6, 2021 the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) questioned Zyad el-Elaimy about his social media posts and opinion pieces, some dating back to 2013. On June 28, 2021 the SSSP also questioned Hossam Moanis and Hisham Fouad. Hisham Fouad was interrogated about his political views, labour rights activism and social media posts. On July 10, 2021 he went on hunger strike against his arbitrary detention, ending it 16 days later due to health concerns. In reprisal of his hunger strike, prison authorities moved him to a solitary confinement cell. 
Their trial, which started on July 15, 2021 has been adjourned until August 17, 2021 following requests by defence lawyers to access and photocopy the case file, which exceeds 2,000 pages. The presiding judge barred independent journalists from attending the hearings. According to a source present during trial, the prosecution’s evidence consisted of the defendants’ articles and media interviews about the human rights and political situation in Egypt. Proceedings in front of the ESSC, a special court that operates when a state of emergency is in force, are inherently unfair. Its verdicts cannot be appealed and are only subject to authorization by the president to become final. A day before the trial started, the Court of Cassation upheld the arbitrary decision by a lower court to include Zyad el-Elaimy on the “terrorists list”. 
I therefore ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Zyad el-Elaimy, Hossam Moanis, Hisham Fouad, as their detention is arbitrary and solely based on the peaceful exercise of their human rights. I also call on you to ensure that charges against them are dropped, and the decision to include Zyad el-Elaimy on the “terrorists list” rescinded. Pending their release, I urge you to ensure that they have access to adequate healthcare and are held in conditions meeting international standards for the treatment of prisoners.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Union Attorney General Dr. Thida Oo, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the prosecution of Thin Thin Aung, who has been targeted simply for her connection to news outlet Mizzima, which has reported on the Myanmar coup and subsequent human rights violations by security forces. She is among the more than 5,200 individuals who are in detention simply for the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. I urge you to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of her and thousands of others who remain arbitrarily detained across Myanmar. 
Thin Thin Aung was arrested in Yangon on April 8, 2021 and is facing up to three years in prison under Section 505 (a) of the Penal Code. She was accused of “inciting public unrest” and “causing fear” with materials Mizzima has published since its license was revoked on March 8, 2021, even though she had resigned from her role as Director of Mizzima on February 4. 
I am alarmed that media workers, as well as peaceful activists, human rights defenders, medical workers, political opponents, and critics of the military, continue to be targeted for arrest, detention, prosecution and imprisonment on politically-motivated grounds. It is imperative that Myanmar respects and protects the right to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly along with other human rights, in line with its obligations under international law. 
While I appreciate that over 2,300 prisoners were released on June 30, 2021, Thin Thin Aung and thousands of others remain in arbitrary detention. It is distressing to learn that reports of enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment and deaths in custody continue to emerge. 
I am further worried about Thin Thin Aung’s health in detention. Already suffering from a chronic condition of asthma, she is at heightened risk in a crowded prison, which presents prime conditions for a Covid-19 outbreak. 
Therefore, I call on you to: 
Sincerely,

Dear Prosecutor, 
I am writing to express my dismay about the arbitrary detention and ongoing unfounded criminal prosecution of civil society activist Mikhail Iosilevich. 
On October 8, 2020, Mikhail Iosilevich was charged under Article 284.1 of the Russian Criminal Code for his alleged cooperation with an “undesirable organization”. The investigators purport that he provided premises for a training conducted by Open Russia, an organization whose UK registered namesake is listed as “undesirable”. This is a “crime” only under Russian legislation, which contravenes Russia’s international human rights obligations and must be repealed. Moreover, the prosecution of Mikhail Iosilevich is completely unfounded; the training had been conducted by another organization, Golos, (a Russian movement of election monitors), and there is no evidence of his involvement with Open Russia. 
On January 30, 2021, a district court remanded Mikhail Iosilevich for allegedly making a threatening phone call to a “witness” in his case. An expert examination of the audio recording of the alleged call concluded that it was not Mikhail Iosilevich’s voice. However, the Nizhnii Novgorod Regional Court rejected Mikhail Iosilevich’s appeal and supported his detention. His detention was subsequently extended, the last time until August 28, 2021. It is expected that the case will be submitted to court shortly after. Mikhail Iosilevich has committed no internationally recognizable crime. He is being targeted for his peaceful activism and for the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and association. 
I urge you to ensure Mikhail Iosilevich’ immediate release and an end to his unfounded criminal prosecution.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Attorney General, 
I am deeply concerned about the prolonged detention of Sri Lankan lawyer and minority and civic rights activist Hejaaz Hizbullah. Detained since April 14, 2020 on trumped-up charges under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), no credible evidence of wrongdoing has yet been presented before a court. 
It is distressing to learn that, since his arrest, Hejaaz Hizbullah has been repeatedly denied due process safeguards recognized by international law. He has been held in prolonged administrative detention without judicial oversight to monitor his wellbeing, without access to bail. While in police custody he was prevented from accessing his legal counsel in private until an order was made by the Court of Appeal. Even following his indictment in February 2021 and being moved to judicial remand, access to family and counsel has been restricted. 
The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) has had a chilling effect on the exercise of the right to freedom of expression in Sri Lanka as it provides authorities with sweeping powers to arbitrarily detain individuals for up to 18 months without charge or trial on mere suspicion of an offence. The principle of legality requires laws to classify and describe offences in precise and unambiguous language that narrowly defines the punishable behaviour. However, the PTA’s offences are overly broad, vague and subjective, and have been used in the past to suppress critics of government. 
Hejaaz Hizbullah has been a vocal critic of the government, raising issues of discrimination against the Muslim minority in Sri Lanka, among his other human rights work. I find it alarming that, instead of supporting his advocacy against discrimination, he has been targeted by the authorities simply for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. 
Hejaaz Hizbullah is a Prisoner of Conscience targeted for his work and opinion, and I, therefore, urge you to drop all charges against him and call for his immediate and unconditional release. I also call on the Sri Lankan authorities to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) and end its use immediately.

Your Excellency, 
Social media influencers 22-year-old Hanin Hossam and 20-year-old Mawada el-Adham were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms and fines by Cairo’s Criminal Court on June 20, 2021 for inciting young women to broadcast “indecent” content on social media to earn money, commercial exploitation, human trafficking and other offences. Amnesty International believes that they are being punished for the way they dance, talk, dress and attempt to “influence” the public online, amid the authorities’ crackdown on women’s freedom of expression and attempts to police women’s conduct online. 
The human trafficking charge relates to videos the women had posted online. In the Instagram video that led to her conviction, Hanin Hossam, who has over one million followers on TikTok, encouraged women over the age of 18 to post videos of themselves on the application ‘Likee’ that is monetized based on the number of viewers. Mawada el-Adham, who has over three million followers on TikTok, was convicted based on TikTok videos showing her dancing with a six-year old girl and jokingly asking her if she was dating. In court, the girl’s parents raised the issue of their consent to post the videos online. Amnesty International reviewed the videos and found no credible evidence linking the two women to acts that would amount to trafficking in persons as defined by the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons. 
During the issuing of the verdict, the presiding judge openly expressed bias and hostility against the women, accusing them of tarnishing the nation’s morals and warning against using social media tools to undermine Egypt’s values and morals. To date, the women’s lawyers have not received a written reasoned judgment. Hanin Hossam, who was sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment in her absence, was rearrested on June 22, 2021 and is now awaiting retrial. Mawada el-Adham has appealed her six-year prison sentence. They are both being held in al-Qanater Prison for women. 
I urge you to quash Hanin Hossam and Mawada el-Adham’s sentences and release them immediately as they are being punished for their conduct online in the name of “morality” and “decency”, protect their rights to privacy, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and bodily autonomy, and put an end to the wider crackdown on women social media influencers in Egypt.

Your Excellency, 
Dear Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, 
I write to you out of concern for the safety and life of Mr. Seengar Noonari, a human rights defender from Nasirabad who was abducted from his home at 3:00 am on June 26, 2021 Seengar is currently the Sindh Labour Secretary of the Awami Workers Party. 
I am alarmed to learn that no information has yet been released as to where Seengar has been detained, the charges being laid against him or even if he will be presented in civilian court. While a petition for his release has been filed in Sindh High Court, it is crucial that his family is immediately notified about his current status. 
Few punishments are as cruel as enforced disappearances and not knowing the whereabouts and fate of their loved one is a source of immense pain and anguish for Seengar’s family. 
Seengar Noonari has spent his life fighting for girls’ education, fair wages and proper working conditions. It is distressing that his abduction – which may amount to enforced disappearance, a crime under international law, comes after he began organizing his community against illegal land grabs. 
At a time when there have been announcements from the Federal Government about criminalizing enforced disappearances, events like Seengar’s abduction serve to only undermine those intentions and inhibit crucial progress against this tool of terror. 
I call upon your government to immediately disclose the whereabouts of Seengar Noonari to his family, and either release him or ensure that he is brought promptly before a judge in a civilian court to rule on the lawfulness of his arrest or detention. I urge you to uphold justice, truth and reparation for him and his family. He must be granted access to his lawyer and family immediately.

“At this time of great political and social uncertainty, it would be unconscionable and unlawful for the United States to refuse the entry of Haitians seeking protection at the U.S. border or to pursue removal proceedings, detention, deportation or expulsion of any Haitian nationals to conditions that can only be described as dangerous,” the groups stated in a joint letter addressed to President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, Ambassador Rice, Advisor Sullivan and Secretary Blinken. 
Though the Biden Administration redesignated Haiti for temporary protected status (TPS) on May 22, 2021 for an 18-month period, eligible Haitians still await publication in the Federal Register so that they can apply for TPS. 
Guerline Jozef, Co-founder and Executive Director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance said: Given the current state of Haiti, we ask the Biden-Harris Administration to immediately and comprehensively act to protect Haitian nationals seeking safety. This requires addressing systematic anti-Black racism and discrimination against Haitians that prohibit Haitians from receiving fair access to asylum. As an urgent first step, the Administration should start with issuing parole to all Haitians seeking protection at a U.S. border, and refrain from pursuing removal proceedings or detaining or deporting Haitian nationals. We demand that the U.S. immediately put an end to Title 42 and provide protection for all people — single persons, children and families — seeking refuge. We stand against both internal and external violence that continues to create chaos in Haiti, and urge the Administration to ensure no Haitian seeking safety is turned away or sent back to danger.” 
Denise Bell, Researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA said: “Haitians are a vital part of our communities, including in states such as Florida, New York and Massachusetts where over a million people are a part of fabric of our cultural, artistic, and business life, yet thousands more are stranded by the U.S. government and left in treacherous conditions in Mexican border towns as they attempt to seek safety here, a feat almost insurmountable due to the misuse of the public health quarantine Title 42. The United States can and must do more to welcome Haitians into our communities, starting with ensuring Haitians are not forcibly returned to harm and can access safety, just like all people seeking safety must be allowed. The U.S. must immediately put TPS into action, lift Title 42, and stop deportations.” 
The organizations are calling for the administration to put in place protections that prevent the forced return of Haitians to Haiti at this dangerous time and give full access to asylum:

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing regarding the Court of Cassation’s verdict on June 14, 2021 upholding the convictions and death sentences against 12 men following a grossly unfair mass trial marred by allegations of enforced disappearance and torture. The 12 men, namely: Abdelrahman Abdelhamid el-Bar, Mohamed Mohamed Ibrahim el-Beltagy, Safwat Mohamed Hamouda Higazy, Osama Yassin, Ahmed Mohamed Aref, Ihab Wagdi Mohamed, Mohamed Abdelhai Hussein al-Faramawy, Mostafa Abdelhai Hussein al-Faramawy, Ahmed Farouk Kamel, Haytham al-Sayed al-Araby, Mohamed Mahmoud Ali Zanati and Abdelazim Ibrahim Attiya, have no recourse but a commutation or pardon from Your Excellency. The 12 men, who include a former minister, a former parliamentarian and other senior figures in the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, are imprisoned in conditions that violate the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement and denial of adequate medical care. 
In September 2018, a terrorism circuit in Cairo’s Criminal Court handed down death sentences against 75 people, convicting them of participation in illegal protests, the murder of seven members of the security forces and 10 others, attempted murder and other charges in relation to their involvement in the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square sit-in dispersal, as well as other protests and clashes between supporters and opponents of former president, Mohamed Morsi, that had taken place from June 21 to August 14, 2013. Amnesty International considered the mass trial, involving 739 defendants, to have been grossly unfair. Despite this, the Court of Cassation upheld the verdict, convicting all defendants of all charges, without establishing individual criminal responsibility. The proceedings were marred by violations of fair trial rights, including the right to adequate defense; the right not to self-incriminate; the right to be tried by a competent, impartial and independent tribunal; the right to call and examine witnesses; and the right to a genuine review. 
We therefore urge you to commute their death sentences, quash their convictions and order retrials in accordance with international fair trial standards, in proceedings that exclude coerced “confessions” and without recourse to the death penalty. We also urge the Egyptian authorities to halt any planned executions, to commute all existing death sentences and immediately establish an official moratorium on executions, with a view to abolishing the death penalty.

Your Excellency, 
I am writing to you about researcher and anthropology master’s student Ahmed Samir Santawy, who started a hunger strike on June 23, 2021 in protest over his unjust conviction by an Emergency State Security Court, a special court whose proceedings are inherently unfair and not subject to appeal. He was convicted of publishing “false news to undermine the state, its national interests and public order and spread panic among the people” and sentenced to four years imprisonment on the basis of social media posts criticizing human rights violations in Egyptian prisons and the state’s mishandling of the pandemic that he denied writing. Regardless of the author of the posts, criminalizing the dissemination of information based on vague concepts such as “false news” is contrary to the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution and international human rights law. 
Ahmed Samir Santawy, who is currently jailed at Liman Tora prison, has been arbitrarily detained since February 1, 2021, when he was arrested by officials from the National Security Agency (NSA). The Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) initially ordered his detention pending investigations over unfounded terrorism-related accusations, on the basis of secret NSA investigations that neither he nor his lawyers have been allowed to examine. That investigation is still ongoing. On May 28, 2021 the SSSP referred him to trial in a separate case. Amnesty International considers Ahmed Samir Santawy to be a prisoner of conscience, targeted because of his research work on gender and religion, topics on which NSA officers and SSSP prosecutors questioned him extensively. 
I therefore ask you to quash the verdict against Ahmed Samir Santawy, release him immediately and unconditionally, and ensure that investigations into unfounded terrorism-related accusations against him are dropped. Pending his release, I urge you to instruct the Minister of Interior to ensure that he has regular access to his family, lawyers and adequate healthcare, including in hospitals outside prison, as required.

Dear Senator: 
Re: Co-sponsor Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2275) 
Amnesty International USA urges you to co-sponsor the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2275).  Introduced on June 24 by Sen. Booker, S. 2275 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to build safer thriving communities by investing in community-based violence reduction initiatives.  Importantly S. 2275 would include $5 billion funding (over eight years) to support community gun violence intervention programs, as requested by the President in the American Jobs Plan. 
If passed and enacted into law, S. 2275 would provide funding for federal grants to communities that experience 20 or more homicides per year and have a homicide rate at least twice the national average, or to communities that demonstrate a unique and compelling need for additional resources to address gun and group-related violence.  S. 2275 would transform community violence intervention programs nationwide and would reduce gun violence in Black and Brown communities across the U.S. 
In 2020-21 the COVID-19 pandemic fueled the highest number of gun homicides in over 20 years. This public health and human rights crisis disproportionately impacts Black and Brown communities. Gun homicides are the leading cause of death among Black men ages 15–34 and the second-leading cause of death for Latino men and boys of the same age range. 
There are evidence-based approaches for dramatically reducing the increase of gun violence. These approaches have been around for many years and have proven track records of success in many cities.  What has always been sorely lacking, however, is a strong federal commitment to scaling a comprehensive infrastructure commensurate with that magnitude of the gun violence crisis. 
Effective community-based programs narrowly focus on the tiny percentage of individuals at highest risk to shoot or be shot and, in life-giving ways, work to prevent shootings from happening in the first place. The most effective programs are typically linked to broader systems of city or county-wide support that integrate public health, economic development, public safety, and community-based agencies. 
Amnesty International USA is counting on your solid support of Break the Cycle of Violence Act, so we can get this critical bill across the finish line.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Joanne Lin at 202/281-0017 or [email protected].

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Prosecutor, 
I am gravely concerned about the Langkat Regency Prosecutor’s Office’s decision to appeal the court verdict of Syamsul Bahri and Samsir, members of Nipah Farmer community in North Sumatra. According to information obtained by Amnesty International, no reliable evidence was presented during the trial that clearly demonstrates their involvement in any criminal activity. Convicted on what is feared to be spurious charges, it is believed that the men have been targeted for their work as environmental human rights defenders. 
As individuals who peacefully conserve the environment and defend their access to land, Syamsul Bahri and Samsir should be protected as in accordance with Article 66 of Law No. 32/2009 on the Environmental Protection and Management, which stipulates that “every person who defends the right to a good and healthy environment shall not be prosecuted by criminal or civil offence.” Their criminalization does not only violate their rights, but also put the work and the rights of all human rights defenders at further risk in Indonesia. 
I believe that Syamsul Bahri and Samsir should not have been convicted in the first place. Therefore, while the verdict exempted them from being sent to jail, I find the prosecutors’ appeal decision further troubling as I am afraid they might be wrongfully imprisoned. Furthermore, the spread of COVID-19 in prison would put their health at risk, specifically Syamsul Bahri who also suffers from diabetes and cholesterol that requires regular medication. 
I, therefore, urge you to immediately ensure that the appeal is dropped. I also call upon authorities to ensure that all human rights defenders in the country can carry out their peaceful activities without fear of fear of harassment, intimidation, persecutions, arbitrary detention or imprisonment, in line with Article 66 of Law No. 32/2009. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear President, 
Human rights activist and prisoner of conscience Sanaa Seif, 26, is serving an unjust one-and-a-half-year prison term, solely stemming from her peaceful exercise of her human rights. 
Unidentified security forces seized Sanaa Seif on June 23, 2020, without presenting a warrant, from outside the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Cairo, the Egyptian capital, where she was planning to file a complaint about a violent assault she had suffered the day before, in full view of security forces. That day, Sanaa Seif, her mother, Laila Soueif, and sister, Mona Seif were waiting outside the Tora Prison Complex in Cairo, to receive a letter from her arbitrarily detained brother, the activist Alaa Abdel Fattah. A group of women approached the family and beat them with sticks, tore their clothes, dragged them onto the ground and stole some of their belongings. To date, the Egyptian authorities have failed to investigate this attack. 
On March 17, 2021, the 10th South Cairo Criminal Court convicted Sanaa Seif on bogus charges of “disseminating false news”, “misuse of social media” and insulting a police officer on duty. The latter charge relates to a verbal altercation with a police officer in front of the Tora Prison Complex when he pushed her mother on the day of the assault and relaying the incident on her social media. Sanaa Seif had also been publicly critical of the authorities’ mishandling of Covid-19 outbreaks in Egypt’s overcrowded and unhygienic prisons and has been calling for the release on those arbitrarily detained including her brother. Amnesty International has reviewed the evidence against Sanaa Seif – including comments posted online about the June 22, 2020 attack – and found that the criticism she expressed did not amount to advocacy of hatred constituting incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. 
We therefore urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Sanaa Seif and quash her conviction. We also urge you to take measures to end the relentless harassment of her family, and conduct independent, impartial and thorough investigations into the assault against Sanaa Seif, her mother and sister in front of the Tora Prison Complex on June 22, 2020 in full view of security forces, with a view of bringing those responsible to justice in proceedings meeting international standards of fair trial.

The statement — released as part of a week of action to end the global gag rule — was released in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish, demonstrating the diversity of just some of the communities harmed by the rule over the past 37 years. 
In addition to the over 200 organizations from 88 countries across six continents that signed the statement today — and countless other people around the world — 70% of Americans favor ending the global gag rule. 
Tarah Demant, the director of the Gender, Sexuality, and Identity Program at Amnesty International USA: 
“Ending the Gag rule forever is possible, it is urgent and it will make communities here at home as well as communities around the world much safer. It will also speed up the global recovery from COVID-19, advance global health, empower communities, and promote equity and human rights for all. Our lawmakers have an opportunity here and now to make certain that future presidents cannot reinstate the policy or interrupt life-saving health services ever again and now is the moment for them to seize that opportunity.” 
Dawn Laguens, interim executive director, Planned Parenthood Global: 
“Study after study has demonstrated that the neocolonialist global gag rule devastates health care access for people around the world, especially those who already face systemic barriers to care. And yet, since 1984, the global gag rule has come and gone with each party shift in the White House. President Biden took an important step by ending this harmful rule for now, but real relief will not be felt until we can permanently end this devastating policy. The global community deserves true partnership from the U.S., but the threat that this destructive policy could reemerge undermines relationships and harms people around the globe. We come together today to tell the U.S. government: It’s time to end the global gag rule once and for all.” 
Alvaro Bermejo, director general, International Planned Parenthood Federation:  
“Since its inception, the global gag rule has been a constant threat to the lives of women and girls and their right to decide what happens to their bodies. Designed to deny people safe and legal abortion care, it has also caused unfathomable damage across the health care spectrum — from HIV prevention and treatment to maternal health care. Our member associations on the front lines of care have witnessed this damage first hand. Whilst we applaud President Biden on rescinding the global gag rule, history has shown us that it is ready to be weaponized by coercive, anti-abortion administrations. We urge the U.S. government to break the violent cycle of the global gag rule permanently, so organizations like IPPF can provide life-saving health care without the fear of our ability to deliver being snatched away from us with the stroke of a pen. Together we can work toward a world where no one is left behind when it comes to their sexual and reproductive health and rights.”  
The global gag rule prohibits non-governmental organizations in other countries from receiving any U.S. global health assistance if they provide, refer, counsel or advocate for legal abortion in their country — even if these activities are supported solely with non-U.S. funds. This cruel policy was originally imposed by the Reagan administration, before being rescinded in 1993 by President Clinton, and then reinstated in 2001 by President Bush on his first business day in office. President Obama rescinded the global gag rule in January 2009, but less than a decade later, President Trump reimposed and radically expanded the policy, extending its harm and devastation to even more women and communities. President Biden then rescinded the gag rule in a presidential memorandum signed on January 28, 2021. 
Marginalized communities — including women and girls, young people, and LGBTQ+ people — have experienced the most devastating constraints on services as a result of the global gag rule. Tragically, this harm does not fully stop even when the policy is not in effect. According to the joint statement: 
“The prospect of reinstatement under future administrations casts a long shadow and leaves the health and lives of millions of people vulnerable to the whims of future U.S. presidents… Even when presidents lift the global gag rule immediately upon taking office, high-quality health partners face long delays in resuming participation in U.S. global health programs. Permanent repeal of the policy is urgently needed to promote sustainable progress in global health and to build and maintain long-term partnerships between the U.S. government, local organizations, and the communities that they serve… Urgent action is needed to finally end the global gag rule once and for all and advance health, human rights, and gender equality across the globe.”

Your Excellency the State President, 
I am writing to express my grave concern over the recent arrest of Nguyen Thuy Hanh, a humanitarian and human rights defender who should be celebrated and supported by the Vietnamese authorities, rather than harassed and detained. 
Nguyen Thuy Hanh’s work has focused on helping the families of prisoners so that they can see their loved ones who are serving lengthy prison sentences once a month. Many of these prisoners have been separated from their families for years and even decades, often in dire prison conditions. 
It is distressing to learn that Nguyen Thuy Hanh faces up to 20 years in prison under Article 117 of the Criminal Code. Her selflessness, sincerity, and tireless work on behalf of those in need have made her one of the most widely respected human rights defenders in Viet Nam. 
Nguyen Thuy Hanh is a prisoner of conscience, who has been detained solely for her peaceful exercising of her human rights and undertaking humanitarian work. 
Therefore, I urge you the State President, to ensure that:

The report, “Needs Improvement: A Progress Report on the Biden Administration’s Record on Making the United States a Safe Refuge,” analyzes the Biden administration’s approach to immigration detention, access to asylum at the border, unaccompanied children, climate displacement, refugee protection, and temporary protected status, and makes specific policy recommendations for each.  
In most areas, AIUSA has found the administration is making progress, slow as it might be in some cases. However, AIUSA has determined that a course correction is urgently needed in the administration’s approach to both immigration detention and access to asylum at the border, from continuing the prior administrations’ arbitrary, mass detention of people arriving at the border to continuing the reckless misuse of a public health quarantine for border control purposes.  
Shortly after President Biden took office, ICE reported detaining 13,860 people on February 5. As of June 11, the number of people ICE reported detaining has skyrocketed 82 percent to 25,238 — an indictment of how it is falling back on prior administrations’ playbooks of the blanket use of detention for people arriving at the border. The Biden administration has also shamefully continued the Trump administration’s policy of misusing the Title 42 public health authority to block and expel people at the border, recklessly endangering lives. Between March 2020 and May 2021, the government summarily expelled nearly 875,000 people — the Biden administration expelled over 400,000 of those people. This misuse of Title 42 particularly affects Black immigrants and asylum-seekers.  
“Nearly half a year in, the administration has still not delivered on change that has not only been promised, but is of the utmost urgency. There is no excuse that can get the United States government out of its human rights obligations,” said Denise Bell, Researcher for Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International USA.  
AIUSA’s recommendations include: 
“President Biden has a clear choice: retain inhumane policies and own the stain they leave on his administration’s human rights record, or turn a promised commitment to human rights and racial justice into concrete action. There is still hope for change, but words alone will not achieve it,” said Bell. ",,"June 17, 2021 • Report",True

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Secretary of State Anthony J. Blinken, 
I am writing you to express my deepest concern for the worsening situation in Colombia. Since April 28, 2021 people took the streets to reject a proposed tax reform and asking for significant improvements in the government’s health, social, and economic policies. Protestors have also called for an end to the killings of human rights defenders in the country and the full implementation of the Peace Accords. 
The harsh response from the government has ranged from the stigmatization of those protesting, to the security forces engaging in excessive use of force accounting for dozens of cases of possible extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, torture and other cruel and inhumane treatment and gender based violence, among others. All these are human rights violations and possible crimes under international law. 
In addition, there are credible reports of urban paramilitarism, that is individuals in civilian clothes, acting with the acquiescence and tolerance of the security forces, that have killed and injured protesters in several cities. 
A month and a half after the beginning of the national strike, Member States of the Organization of Americas States (OAS) are alarmingly unresponsive. The silence of Member States is costing dozens of lives and risks an escalation of the situation in a country known for its sad history of conflict. 
It is time for member states to take concrete actions to help overcome this crisis. 
I therefore call on to you to lead a regional diplomatic initiative within the Organization of Americas States to analyze and propose human rights-based solutions to the current crisis in Colombia.

Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the incommunicado detention of Sahrawi activist Mohamed Lamine Haddi held in Tiflet II prison in Rabat, Morocco. 
Mohamed Lamine Haddi’s lawyer and family have not heard from him since April 9, 2021 when he called to inform them that the prison director of Tiflet II had threatened to put him in a small, dungeon-like cell, if his family continued to publicise his case. According to his lawyer, the prison authorities previously detained Mohamed Lamine Haddi in such a cell in 2018 as punishment. His lawyer described the cell as a small room of 2m² with no window, tap nor toilet. It is known as the “punishment cell” or “coffin” because it is the same size. Since April 9, 2021 his family called the King’s prosecutor and the prison director several times, with no response. Mohamed Lamine Haddi’s lawyer and family both called the prison separately on June 1, 2021 and the phone was hung-up on them at the mention of Mohamed Lamine Haddi’s name. 
Mohamed Lamine Haddi’s health has been deteriorating since his 69-day hunger strike in January demanding an end to his ill-treatment. On March 23, 2021 he told his family that prison guards ended his hunger strike by force-feeding him, that he did not receive any medical care during his hunger strike and that he was suffering partial paralysis, trembling, memory loss and severe pain. His lawyer is concerned that the lack of news from him since April indicates the worsening of his health. Since September 17, 2017, the authorities have held Mohamed Lamine Haddi and other Gdeim Izik prisoners in solitary confinement in Tiflet II prison. Mohamed Lamine Haddi is confined alone in his cell for at least 23 hours per day, with no contact with other inmates. Family visits have been banned since March 2020, due to COVID restrictions. 
In light of the above, I urge you to end the solitary confinement of Mohamed Lamine Haddi, grant him immediate access to adequate medical care and ensure that his detention conditions conform to international standards. I also urge you to ensure that he has regular access to his family and lawyers, and in keeping with the Mandela Rules which provides in Rule 59 that prisoners shall be allocated, to the extent possible, to prisons close to their homes, to grant the transfer of Mohamed Lamine Haddi and the other Gdeim Izik prisoners to El-Ayoun to be closer to their families. Finally, I urge you to hold a fair retrial for Mohamed Lamine Haddi and the other Gdeim Izik prisoners in line with international standards.

Based on the evidence collected by Amnesty International in the report “Like We Were Enemies in a War”, the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution in Xinjiang. Lawful activities many of us take for granted such as living, travelling, studying abroad; communicating with people abroad; reciting the Qur’an or wearing religious clothing can be considered a reason to be sent to an internment camp or a prison, where detainees are subjected to a relentless forced indoctrination campaign, physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
Family members living overseas are desperate to get in touch with their loved ones, many of whom they have not heard from in years. Further to their desperation is the fact that, without any access to a lawyer of their choice, the detained individuals (mostly Uyghurs, Kazakhs and those from other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups) are at even further heightened risk of torture or ill-treatment.

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, 
In the last week of May 2021, Mustafa al-Darwish’s case was referred to the Presidency of State Security. In the absence of transparent information around judicial processes, it is Amnesty International’s assessment that this referral could signal his imminent execution as soon as Your Majesty ratifies the death sentence. On May 25, 2015, Mustafa al-Darwish (born in 1994), was arrested by security forces and detained for two years in al-Mabahith prison in Dammam, the capital city of the Eastern Province in Saudi Arabia, before he was brought to trial. During his detention, he was placed in solitary confinement and incommunicado for the first six months of his detention, with no access to legal counsel until the beginning of his trial – all serious violations of his procedural rights and right to a fair trial, which have marred his trial leading to a death sentence. 
On March 28, 2018, the Specialized Criminal Court sentenced Mustafa al-Darwish to death over charges relating to his participation in protests, including “participation in armed rebellion against the rulers, blocking roads and sowing discord” and “seeking to disrupt national cohesion through his participation in more than 10 riots”. According to court documents, the aforementioned charges against Mustafa al-Darwish were based on his “confessions” or signed statement that he had participated in over 10 riots between 2011 and 2012, photos of him shooting at security patrols and a technical report of his phone which allegedly contained photos offensive to security officials. However, given that the official charge sheet doesn’t specify the exact months of the alleged crimes, Mustafa al-Darwish could have been 17 or 18 at the time of his alleged participation in riots – therefore making it unclear as to whether Mustafa al-Darwish’s case should be revised under the new juvenile law. Moreover, the “evidence” on which the death sentence is based had resulted from a seriously flawed due process which involved subjecting Mustafa al-Darwish to prolonged pre-trial detention for over two years, and according to his testimony to the judge, obtaining confessions from him under torture. 
I urge you not to ratify the execution of Mustafa al-Darwish, and to quash his conviction, given the grave concerns about the fairness of his trial, and order a re-trial in line with international fair trial standards, without recourse to the death penalty. Furthermore, I call on you to order a prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigation into the allegations of torture and ill treatment and to immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in Saudi Arabia.

The climate crisis is a human rights crisis. While we offer recommendations with respect to the report’s consideration of “options for protection and resettlement of individuals displaced directly or indirectly,” these recommendations should be seen as part of a comprehensive human rights framework to address climate change. We have attached the embargoed executive summary to Amnesty International’s forthcoming publication on climate change, Stop Burning Our Rights! What Governments and Corporations Must Do to Protect Humanity from the Climate Crisis, which sets forth governments’ human rights responsibilities to tackle the climate crisis and immediate steps to implement their obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil human rights in the face of the climate crisis. We will send the report once it is released on June 7, 2021. Additionally, our letter to President Biden and letter to Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry provide further human rights recommendations to the U.S. government for addressing climate change impacts. 
The administration’s forthcoming report positions the U.S. to lead globally on climate displacement at a time when governments have failed to address this issue, endangering humanity’s collective security, rights, and future. Assuming global leadership on climate displacement will not only directly benefit humanity, it will also further the U.S.’s own adaptation and resilience to climate change. 
Many solutions already exist for building the policy framework for climate displacement. As with tackling climate change itself, the U.S. response to climate displacement will require adaptation in policy and process, but tools are available: enhancing existing protection mechanisms and admission pathways, supporting Congressional initiatives to develop new mechanisms, and providing robust financial support and international cooperation and assistance. 
As the administration seeks to robustly address climate change, it must not sacrifice people’s rights under the guise of climate adaptation and resilience. No one wants to leave home without a choice, and every effort should be made to ensure people can live with dignity, safety, and security in their home countries. But when they cannot and are forced to leave, their right to seek asylum must be upheld and other safe and orderly pathways to protection must be ensured. 
Tackling climate-related mobility through only a national security lens, or for immigration deterrence and enforcement purposes, will undermine human rights and exacerbate already precarious situations, magnifying suffering and harm. Successful adaptation and resilience require addressing human rights and humanitarian protection, or root causes will never be adequately addressed and the cycle of grievous reasons for climate-related human mobility and human rights violations will continue. 
The U.S strategy to address climate displacement should be based on human rights and humanitarian protection. Our recent letter to Vice President Kamala Harris on addressing root causes of displacement and migration from Central America lays out regional context and recommendations. 
Amnesty recommends that the administration: 
Enhance pathways for admission and protection 
Strengthen support to internally displaced persons and refugee programs 
Ensure the participation of people displaced by climate change 
Strengthen multilateral and regional cooperation 
Reduce the likelihood and extent of climate-related displacement 
Provide support to address loss and damage 
Please find attached a fuller description of our recommendations. Amnesty’s specialists on refugee/migration and climate justice stand ready to brief the National Security Council and relevant agencies. We look forward to working with the administration to implement a human rights framework for climate displacement.

SAFEGUARD THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF PEOPLE DISPLACED OR AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE 
The impacts of the climate crisis are already a significant driver of human mobility. In 2019, 23.9 million people were internally displaced by weather-related events. Without adequate climate change mitigation, adaptation, and resilience measures, the number of people forced to move internally and across borders is anticipated to increase. 
The U.S.’s human rights obligations should inform analysis and recommendations in the interagency report, as well as the U.S. government approach to climate change generally. In order to comply with its human rights obligations, the U.S. must urgently adopt strategies that protect human rights from the climate crisis. This requires taking all feasible steps to the full extent of its capacity to reduce emissions in the shortest timeframe possible and in a manner compatible with the imperative of keeping the global average temperature rise as low as possible and no higher than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It also means adopting all necessary measures to assist those within its jurisdiction to adapt to the foreseeable and unavoidable effects of climate change. Based on the duty of international cooperation and assistance, as a wealthy country, the U.S. must also substantially increase funding and support for human rights-consistent climate change mitigation and adaptation initiatives in less wealthy countries and provide additional finances and access to legal remedy to people whose rights have been negatively affected as the result of loss and damage caused by climate change. The U.S. must abide by its human rights obligations in all aspects related to climate change, including ensuring the rights to information and participation of affected people and ensuring that climate action does not violate human rights and contributes to ending all forms of discrimination. 
The climate crisis also triggers rights and responsibility-sharing around the protection of individuals affected by climate displacement,[3] including the right to seek asylum[4] and the availability of alternative pathways,[5] and the obligation to uphold the principle of non-refoulement – not returning an individual to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights harm, including the serious human rights violations caused by the climate crisis.[6] 
As a first step to meet its human rights obligations, the administration should accommodate and establish equitable and predictable pathways to protection for all refugees, including those affected by climate displacement, as well as protection against refoulement. It should also work with other governments and the United Nations to meet the needs of people forcibly displaced, including those displaced by the climate change. It must also ensure meaningful, effective, and informed participation of migrants and refugees in decision-making processes related to climate change and human mobility. Measures intended to protect people from the effects of climate change must be applied without discrimination and not result in the violation of other human rights. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL USA RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION 
1.1     Expand use of humanitarian protection from forced return: TPS and DED 
The U.S. should not remove people to any place where they would face a real risk of human rights violations as a result of the adverse effects of climate change. Utilizing the already existing protection pathways of Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) and Deferred Enforced Departure (“DED”) enables the U.S. to uphold its obligation to prevent forced return in violation of the obligation of non-refoulement in the context of climate change. 
The U.S. Congress envisioned TPS as a form of humanitarian protection for people already in the U.S. from forced return to their countries of origin affected by environmental disasters.[7] Successive administrations have continued to utilize TPS to provide safe haven to people whose home countries are gripped by earthquakes, floods, droughts, or other environmental disasters.[8] 
As codified, TPS encompasses the interconnectedness of climate change and environmental disaster. Climate change has led, and will increasingly lead, to the increased intensity and frequency of certain rapid-onset weather events already envisioned by TPS, such as extreme rainfall and flooding and increased intensity of hurricanes.[9] Similarly, drought, a slow-onset event of climate change, is statutorily named as an example of environmental disaster. In order to meet its human rights obligations, the risks of other slow onset disasters arising from climate change, such as glacial melting, sea-level rise, salt-water intrusion and ocean acidification, and shifting wildlife populations and habitats and biodiversity loss, should be considered in order to provide protection from forced return in the context of climate change.[10] 
The U.S. should: 
The U.S. should also expand the use of DED to prevent forced return to any place where individuals would face a real risk of serious human rights violations as a result of the adverse effects of climate change. Less frequently used than TPS, DED is another form of humanitarian protection for people already in the U.S. from forced return to their countries of origin affected by natural disaster or political or civic conflict.[11] Unlike TPS, DED derives from the president’s authority to conduct foreign relations and does not have a statutory basis or defined criteria. It is rooted in Extended Voluntary Departure (“EVD”), a measure used under presidential authority to protect against forced return from 1960 to 1990.[12] As with TPS, expanding DED to include protection from forced return in in the context of climate change recognizes that both rapid-onset and slow-onset weather events are linked to natural disaster. 
The U.S. should: 
1.2. Evaluate human rights impacts from climate change in asylum and refugee eligibility determinations 
Under the 1951 Refugee Convention and its accompanying 1967 Protocol which the U.S. ratified and codified in the 1980 Refugee Act, a refugee is “any person who is outside any country of such person’s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.”[13] This definition of refugee also applies to people seeking asylum.[14] 
According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (“UNHCR”), under some circumstances protection claims made in the context of climate change or a disaster can qualify for refugee status.[15] This is especially true for people who are already marginalized or at risk of human rights abuse. For example, members of particular populations may have a well-founded fear of being persecuted on account of discriminatory access to or denial of relief aid; the politicization of post-disaster relief; or targeted environmental degradation for political aims. 
The U.S. should: 
1.3     Increase refugee resettlement  
A fundamental principle of refugee protection is responsibility-sharing and international cooperation. These are required to reduce the impact of large-scale refugee populations on host countries, and each state should contribute to the maximum of its capacity.[17] Resettlement is a key component of responsibility-sharing and allows states to support each other by agreeing to settle refugees from host countries.[18] 
Because protection claims made in the context of climate change or a disaster can qualify for refugee status, increasing refugee resettlement would also benefit some people displaced in the context of climate change. Additionally, utilizing expanded community sponsorship, inclusive of a private sponsorship program, would welcome refugees more directly into communities, supporting their integration and outcomes and building more resilient communities and advocates for refugee resettlement. This form of synergy benefits both refugees and communities and communicates that people determined to be refugees on account of climate change are welcomed as refugees too. Resettlement opportunities should also be expanded regionally to better uphold the rights and security of refugees from Central America and Venezuela, with safeguards to evacuate individuals at risk of imminent harm. 
This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Refugee Convention. After four years of devastating retreat on refugee resettlement, the U.S. should use this moment to assert leadership in refugee protection by meeting the refugee admissions commitment and leveraging global commitments to re-establish the importance of this lifesaving program through international cooperation for refugee protection, including for those displaced in the context of climate change. 
The U.S. should: 
1.4     Restore and expand access to asylum 
Because there are mixed drivers of forced displacement and irregular migration, the U.S. must respond with a variety of tools at its disposal, starting with ensuring the right to seek asylum, which is enshrined in both international and domestic law. 
The U.S. must immediately stop the unlawful use of Title 42 of U.S. Code Section 265 (“Title 42”) to effectively shut down access at the U.S.-Mexico Border for asylum-seekers and migrants. Disregarding the objections of its own experts, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) issued an order under Title 42 in March 2020, allegedly as a public health measure responding to COVID-19. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) subsequently used the Title 42 order to close U.S. borders to migrants and asylum-seekers. The unlawful use of Title 42 has resulted in the summary expulsion of over 500,000 families and individuals, and particularly affected Black migrants and asylum-seekers. Recent developments exempting individuals identified as uniquely vulnerable from Title 42 are a positive development for the small number of people permitted to exercise their right to seek protection in the U.S. but does not relieve the government of its urgent need to rescind the unlawful CDC order and uphold all people’s right to see asylum. 
All of this was entirely preventable, endangered lives, and is in violation of the U.S.’s obligations under international and domestic law to uphold the right to seek asylum and not forcibly return individuals to a place where they would be at risk of serious human rights harm – the principle of non-refoulement. The U.S.’s public health laws should not be used to evade U.S. obligations under human rights and refugee law. 
Immigration deterrence and enforcement should not masquerade in the guise of supporting climate adaptation and resilience. The reported bilateral agreements with Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras to increase border security, and the reported proposal to help train Guatemala’s border protection force, should not be efforts to hinder the ability to seek asylum or result in refoulement. Similarly, the reported U.S. policy memo urging Mexico to implement measures to decrease the number of migrants and asylum-seekers trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico, including by facilitating the U.S.’s expulsions of families and individuals under Title 42, should be fully repudiated. This memo further exposes that the U.S. is using Title 42 for border control – not public health – purposes. The U.S. must halt such measures to prevent people from seeking safety. 
The U.S. should: 
1.5     Expand the use of other admission pathways 
The U.S. should enhance safe and regular migration pathways to ensure that those who live in areas where climate change is negatively impacting their human rights have the option to migrate safely and regularly. The U.S. should identify and address the specific barriers faced by disadvantaged and marginalized groups in accessing these other admission pathways. 
The U.S. should: 
The U.S. should act to fortify protection regimes for people forcible displaced, including by climate change. The protection system is under duress, and returning to prior levels of humanitarian assistance is not sufficient. Governments need technical and financial support to uphold the rights of internally displaced persons and refugees and meet their human security needs. 
Already, most displaced people around the world are situated in climate hotspots, in regions such as South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, where they are exposed to secondary or repeated displacement internally and across borders and have reduced chances of being able to return home.[20] 
Displaced people also face specific challenges following extreme weather events, such as barriers to housing and accessing crucial or even life-saving information and disaster relief, loss of identity documents necessary to prove regular status or support asylum applications, and disruption of services. They may find themselves in temporary camps for displaced people, or may settle in urban informal settlements, often in unhealthy living conditions and/or in locations which are themselves particularly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate change impacts. 
2.1     Support the rights and security of internally displaced persons 
The vast majority of those who move in relation to climate change do so within their country, generally from rural to urban areas, either because they are suddenly displaced as the result of a weather event or because the adverse effects of climate change force, or contribute to, their decision to move internally.[21] The World Bank estimates that by 2050, climate change could contribute to the internal displacement of 140 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America alone. 
Many governments are not sufficiently equipped to protect the rights and address the human security needs of those who are internally displaced.[22] For example, Tropical Cyclone Idai, described by the UN as “one of the deadliest storms on record in the southern hemisphere,” left a trail of destruction across the three southern African countries Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe in March 2019; it was followed one month later by Cyclone Kenneth in northern Mozambique. Between 5 and 10 percent of the population affected by the cyclones was displaced and faced challenges in accessing aid and disrupted services.[23] In northern Central America, the devastation wrought by the unprecedented back-to-back hurricanes Eta and Iota in 2020 drove displacement as they also aggravated poverty and inequalities in the affected areas. Hurricanes Eta and Iota further exacerbated the precarious conditions for people living in the “Dry Corridor” of southern Mexico and Central America, already severely impacted by climate change. 
Without sufficient services, adequate support to relocate internally, or humanitarian assistance, internally displaced persons (“IDP”) may choose to migrate as they are exposed to secondary or repeated displacement and reduced chances of being able to return home.[24] 
The U.S. should: 
2.2     Increase support for refugee programs 
Refugees are frequently hosted in areas prone to environmental disasters or highly at risk of climate-related impacts. Host countries can exacerbate this by locating refugee populations to inhospitable places, especially in prolonged and intractable situations. For example, Rohingya refugees fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar have been hosted in the border district of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, which the World Bank predicts will be the district worst hit by climate change in all of South Asia by 2050. In 2020, Bangladesh’s government began carrying out its plan to relocate up to 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char, a previously uninhabited low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal, putting the refugees at high risk of flooding and other extreme weather events. In 2016, 75,000 Syrian refugees were trapped in a desert no-man’s land at the Syria-Jordan border in the informal Rukban camp called the “berm,” virtually cut off from humanitarian aid. In 2020, Jordanian authorities forcibly transferred at least 16 Syrian refugees, including eight children aged between four and 14, to the berm, where its remaining 10,000 residents lack access to sufficient and affordable food, clean water, medical care, and sanitation. 
The administration should invest in refugee and humanitarian programs at new levels. Returning to U.S. funding and assistance levels of President Obama’s administration is not sufficient. Refugees cannot continue to live in places that are unsustainable, and cannot be deprived of measures to support resilience and adaptation to climate change. 
The U.S. should: 
Climate change has thrown into stark relief structural inequalities and systemic discrimination in countries around the world. The principle of equality and non-discrimination is essential to shape the content of climate action. Governments should ensure that the people most affected by the climate crisis are not left behind and that climate actions reduce and redress, rather than exacerbate, structural discrimination and inequality. Groups disproportionately affected by the climate crisis should be given equal and meaningful opportunities to participate in shaping climate measures, including by taking leadership roles.[25] 
The U.S. should: 
President Biden signing an executive order to have the United States rejoin the Paris Agreement as one of his first actions as president was a critical and welcome step for the U.S. to re-engage globally on climate change. The U.S. should further this international cooperation by supporting mechanisms to address climate displacement, without using such engagement to prevent people from migrating. 
The U.S. should: 
Climate change alone can rarely be isolated as the main driver of displacement and migration.[27] Rather, it is a threat multiplier, exacerbating the difficulties and challenges faced by marginalized people such as poverty, discrimination, lack of social protection, and an adverse political context.[28] Reducing the likelihood and extent of climate displacement requires mitigation and adaption, and measures to tackle socio-economic inequality and discrimination, as these magnify the risk of displacement. 
To reduce the likelihood and extent of climate-related displacement, the U.S. should: 
The climate crisis is already seriously harming the enjoyment of human rights for people around the world and already acting an important driver of migration and displacement. People in some small low-lying island states face an existential threat as the entire or most or their countries’ territory is predicted to become inhabitable in the next few decades. 
Given its historical responsibility for global emissions and its obligations under human rights law, the U.S. must: 
Amnesty International continues to strongly urge the U.S. government to commit to national, regional, and international mechanisms that uphold fair, predictable, and equitable responsibility sharing to address the climate crisis. Efforts to address the root causes of displacement in the context of climate change should be centered on protecting human rights.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express deep concern about the continuous threats to the safety of Sahrawi activist Sultana Khaya, and several members of her family. Sultana Khaya and her family have been under arbitrary house arrest since November 19, 2020, enduring the daily presence of security forces in front of their house, a ban on movement even for few metres away from their house, house raids and physical assaults. 
In the last month there has been a serious escalation of the crackdown on Sultana Khaya’s freedom of movement and physical security: on May 10, 2021 security forces raided her house at 5 am, cuffed her sisters arms and legs, stole valuables including Sultana Khaya’s phone and computer. Sultana Khaya told Amnesty International that on the eve of the Muslim celebration of Eid-al-Fitr, on May 12, 2021 dozens of masked members of the security forces entered her house again from the roof. They dragged her on the floor, twisted her arms and tied them behind her back, beat her and tried to rape her with batons. Sultana Khaya said that her sister was also attacked and some of the masked men raped her by forcing a baton between her legs and beat her. She said that security forces had also broke windows and spilled a foul-smelling substance on the house floor, purposefully making the house unhabitable. Prior to this raid, security forces forcibly removed the electricity meter leaving Sultana Khaya and her family with no electricity in an apparent attempt to further isolate the family from the outside world. 
From the start of her house arrest, the authorities have failed to present Sultana Khaya with an arrest warrant or a court order, or to inform her of the reason for her arrest. She was only told verbally, by the head of the police forces in Boujdour, that she was forbidden from leaving her house. Her and her family’s prolonged house arrest amounts to arbitrary detention, and it imposes arbitrary restrictions on their rights to freedom of movement and association. 
In light of the above, I urge you to immediately end the arbitrary house arrest against Sultana Khaya and her family and respect their right to freedom of movement, expression and association. I further urge you to put an end to the assaults that Sultana Khaya and her family are subjected to, open an investigation into the security forces’ arbitrary and abusive force against her and her family, including the report of rape and attempted rape, and provide them with adequate reparation for the violations of human rights to which they have been subjected.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Counselor, 
I am writing to raise my concerns about the ongoing arbitrary detention of lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer and activist Alaa Abdel Fattah, who have been in pre-trial detention over unfounded terrorist-related accusations since October 1, 2019, solely for their peaceful exercise of human rights. They are held in inhumane conditions at the Tora Maximum Security 2 Prison, in Cairo. From October 1, 2019 to May 9, 2021, Mohamed el-Baqer and Alaa Abdel Fattah shared a small poorly ventilated cell of 3.5m x 5m with two other prisoners. Prison authorities have denied them beds and mattresses; they have been sleeping on the floor on rough blankets. Unlike other prisoners, they are prohibited from exercising in the prison yard and are not allowed to use the prison library nor to receive books or newspapers from outside prison at their own expense. The prison authorities have also been denying them adequate clothing, radios, watches, access to hot water and any personal belongings, including family photos. On May 11, 2021, during a visit, Mohamed el-Baqer informed his wife that he had been transferred to another cell with similar conditions. He said that as a result of limited movement and poor prison conditions, he developed pain in his joints and muscles. 
The families of Mohamed el-Baqer and Alaa Abdel Fattah have lodged official complaints about their treatment in prison, including their exclusion from the COVID-19 vaccine rollout amid concerns that detainees are being transferred from prisons to courts without personal protective equipment (PPE) and held in cramped unhygienic conditions. On May 10, 2021, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), an independent human rights organization, filed a lawsuit before the State Council, an administrative court with jurisdiction over complaints regarding state bodies’ action or inaction, against the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Interior, which has oversight of prisons in Egypt, for their failure to include prisoners in national vaccine plans. The organization is calling for the authorities to enable prisoners to register for the vaccine, and to either transfer prisoners to designated medical facilities or to allocate suitable facilities inside prisons for vaccination. A similar lawsuit was also filed by Alaa Abdel Fattah’s lawyer. On May 18, 2021, authorities announced the vaccination of 5,000 older or chronically ill prisoners and 1,400 medical staff and other prison workers. No additional details have been provided. 
I urge you to release Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed el-Baqer immediately and unconditionally and drop all charges against them as they are detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Pending their release, I call on you to ensure they have access to adequate health care, including COVID-19 vaccines, and that they are held in conditions meeting international standards including being granted adequate bedding and outdoor exercise time; and protected from torture and other ill-treatment.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Counselor, 
I am writing to raise concerns about the arbitrary detention of journalist Mohamed Salah since November 26, 2019 and about alarming reports that he has been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. 
On July 19, 2020, a court ordered Mohamed Salah’s release in relation to case No. 488 of 2019, connected to the March 2019 anti-government protests, and he was transferred to Dar Essalam police station in Cairo on July 23, 2020 in preparation for his release. However, on August 23, 2020, the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), a special branch of the Public Prosecution responsible for prosecuting crimes that relate to “state security”, ordered his detention pending investigations into a new case (No. 855/2020) over unfounded terrorism accusations. 
According to his family, he was not allowed visits from his transfer to the police station on July 23, 2020 until December 28,  2020, when relatives saw him for a few minutes after having submitted multiple requests and complaints in December 2020 to the Cabinet of Egypt, which is presided by the Prime Minister. Relatives of his cellmates followed suit in submitting similar complaints. On January 8, 2021, in apparent retaliation for these complaints, security forces stripped the fourteen detainees held in Cell 6 of Dar Essalam police station naked, suspended them by their feet and beat them using batons and water pipes. Security forces also confiscated their blankets, flooded the cell with cold water and denied them health care, including for injuries sustained as a result of beatings. On January 10, 2021, Mohamed Salah was transferred to the Tora Investigations Prison, in Cairo, but barred from family visits until the end of March 2021. Informed sources reported that Mohamed Salah’s injuries were infected and his torn clothes were covered with blood when he was first transferred to prison. He received some basic treatment at the prison clinic, including bandage changes. Authorities ignored lawyer and family requests to refer him to forensic examination to record his injuries. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Mohamed Salah as he is held solely for the peaceful exercise of his human rights and to open prompt, independent, impartial, and effective investigations into allegations that he had been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in Dar Essalam police station . Pending his release, he must be granted access to regular family visits, his lawyers and adequate health care and protected from further torture and other ill-treatment.

On behalf of Amnesty International USA and our members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. Amnesty International is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the United States. Human rights in Afghanistan, including the rights of Afghan human rights defenders, internally displaced persons, and Afghan women and girls, are a top priority of our organization. 
Afghanistan is plagued by an almost incalculable series of human rights challenges. Corrupt government officials abuse and extort their citizens, anti-government elements including the Taliban and Islamic State – Khorasan have routinely targeted and killed civilians, U.S. and coalition drone strikes have reduced people’s homes to rubble, over four million internally displaced persons are consigned to lives of abject poverty, and women are denied their human rights. In this environment, human rights defenders (HRDs) call the world’s attention to human suffering of incredible proportions. To do so, they travel to dangerous locales and shine the spotlight on powerful people who would prefer to remain in the dark. As members of various Afghan communities, they have an intimate knowledge of local customs and languages. Without their work, major human rights abuses would simply go unreported. Yet precisely because of their invaluable service, human rights activists in Afghanistan face severe threats to their lives. In many cases, they are on their own. Their government has failed to prevent attacks against them, denied their requests for assistance, refused to hold their attackers to account and, at times, punished them for seeking justice. 
Human rights defenders, activists, and journalists are continuously subjected to intimidation, violence, and even death. In the 2019 Amnesty International report “Defenseless Defenders,” our organization documented multiple instances of violence and intimidation against human rights defenders. In the report, human rights defenders share the staggering violence they face while doing their jobs. One activist who worked to document the government of Iran’s mistreatment of Afghan refugees and raise concerns about growing levels of radicalization in Afghanistan was shot seven times while driving home. The activist had received threats for weeks prior to the attack, including from the Taliban and from diplomats of the Islamic Republic of Iran. When he reported the harassment to Afghanistan’s security officials, they took no action. In another case, a renowned women’s defense attorney who represented clients accusing powerful individuals of domestic violence was threatened with having acid sprayed in her face. Her car was stolen, and her brother was severely beaten. When she complained to the authorities, they accused her of fabricating evidence. 
Some of the pressure faced by HRDs remains below the surface and is marshalled by powerful people through quiet messages and phone calls. When an Afghan civil society organization drafted a “shadow report” for the UN Committee against Torture in 2017, they shared the document with several peer organizations for review. Shortly thereafter, they received a phone call through an anonymous number detailing in-depth knowledge of the report, its authors, and its contents. The caller demanded that the names of several prominent Afghan officials be removed from the report and threatened the authors. 
The challenges facing HRDs have increased in recent years. Amnesty International has noticed increased attacks against both men and women human rights activist. Many activists and journalists have left the country to seek refuge from attack. 
Following years of research and advocacy by Afghan and international civil society organizations, Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani signed a decree establishing a Joint Commission for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in December 2020. Prior government efforts to protect rights activists proved limited, unambitious, and hobbled by budget constraints. None of the pre-existing bodies, for example, were empowered to provide immediate support for rights defenders or investigate abuses. Yet, despite this encouraging move, the commission remains merely a promise on paper. In the months since the announcement, the government of Afghanistan made no progress on forming a functional commission to address the protection needs of rights defenders.  Meanwhile, attacks on human rights defenders have spiked. In February 2021, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) issued a new report documenting a sharp rise in killings of human rights defenders and media workers in targeted attacks. Mere days after President Ghani signed the decree, Freshta Kohistani, a prominent women’s rights activist, and her brother were shot by unknown gunmen near their home in Kapisa province. 
Amnesty International has closely tracked the plight of Afghanistan’s Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) through periodic long form reports, informed by extensive on-the-ground research. In that time, the major thing to change was their number.  In 2012, half a million Afghans were IDPs. In 2016, that number rose to 1.2 million. Today, there are an estimated four million internally displaced people in Afghanistan, a number approximately equivalent to the population of the United States’ second largest city, Los Angeles. The violence, poverty, and insecurity endemic to their daily lives represents an international policy failure. 
Our research has documented how many of these IDPs live lives of staggering privation, unable to provide for their most basic needs. Many of those who eke out meager survival are one crisis away from death. In these situations, the loss of a breadwinner spells catastrophe for the family, marking the difference between sustenance and hunger, shelter and the elements, life and death. 
The increase in internal displacement is largely driven by the accelerating pace of the conflict in Afghanistan, which has expanded from the traditional hotspots in the south and southeast to encompass much of the country. Fractures within Taliban forces and the emergence of additional anti-government elements loyal to the Islamic State – Khorasan have prompted further violence and catalyzed even more displacement. U.S. negotiations with the Taliban and subsequent intra-Afghan dialogues have not abetted the violence. According to UNAMA, the first quarter of 2021 marked a 29 per cent increase in civilian casualties compared with the same period last year. 
In February 2014, the Afghan government launched a National Policy on IDPs that was based on the UN Guiding Principles for Internal Displacement. Although the policy was hailed by international observers at its inception, it has demonstrated little impact to date. The Afghan government ministry charged with implementing the policy, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, has been hamstrung by limited resources and repeated charges of corruption. 
For many Afghans interviewed by Amnesty International, the IDP policy has made not an iota of difference. Shelter in IDP camps is flimsy and unable to provide safety and security. Displaced Afghans live in makeshift huts made from mud and poles and covered with plastic sheets, or under tarpaulin tents. In other cases, where Afghan families can afford more permanent structures (also constructed from mud), rainwater frequently floods the dwellings, leaving the streets between them virtually impassable. When not flooded, mud brick huts provide almost no protection from Afghanistan’s summer heat and winter cold, as well as from insects and other wildlife. 
Access to water and food in displaced communities remains a critical challenge. People are forced to make arduous trips to gather water from wells installed by aid agencies. In other cases, residents are forced to purchase water at rates far beyond what they can afford from private proprietors. When pumps fail, there is often nobody to repair them. A community leader at a displaced person’s camp in Kabul told Amnesty, “Food is a luxury here, no one can afford it. We mostly live off bread or spoiled vegetables from the market”. 
Displaced Afghans face few avenues to gain employment. Most families draw income from one breadwinner, typically the father, who finds irregular work through informal channels, often manual labor or construction. Children are sometimes forced to seek employment to supplement family income. Children in displaced families are often unable to access educational opportunities. Many families cannot afford books, school uniforms or other basic educational materials. Some families reported to Amnesty International that their only option was to send children to attend religious instruction at a local mosque. Women are often hardest hit by economic insecurity, having previously worked in agriculture on their family’s land that has become inaccessible to them following their displacement. In many cases, Afghan IDPs suffer from illiteracy and innumeracy are prevented from gaining meaningful employment outside of trades that involve manual labor. 
As the world first awoke to the threat of COVID-19 in early 2020, Iran quickly emerged as a global hotspot for infections by the virus. As feared by many observers, the virus quickly spread across the porous Iran-Afghanistan border into Herat Province. The impact of the pandemic compounded numerous pre-existing challenges faced by people in Afghanistan. Healthcare facilities are few and of low caliber, doctors are rare and concentrated in urban areas, personal protective equipment (PPE) is limited, and Afghans frequently live in multigenerational households and in close proximity to one another, making it difficult to implement social distancing measures or isolate the sick. 
Internally displaced Afghans have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to other Afghans, they are far more likely to live in inadequate housing and lack access to health care, clean water and sanitation. COVID-19-associated lockdowns have worsened their economic situation. Because IDPs primarily work low-paying jobs in the informal sector, lockdowns have resulted in a rapid loss of income for many displaced families. Additionally, COVID-19 lockdown measures have caused a spike in commodity prices, often rendering IDP families unable to afford goods previously available to them. This, in turn, has forced many IDP families to push their young children out of school and into the labor market to help the family make ends meet. In the past, international aid agencies and humanitarian organizations would step in to fill these gaps. However, the pandemic has forced them, too, to curtail operations. 
Under Taliban rule, a patchwork of laws and edicts barred women from seeking employment outside their home and shuttered education opportunities for Afghan girls. A draconian modesty code, enforced routinely with physical violence, allowed the Taliban to punish minute violations of their morality code with beatings, humiliation, and sometimes killings. Women could not leave their homes without an escort or secure medical care from a male physician. Upon capturing a town or city, Taliban forces would immediately discontinue education for girls, often spreading news of their decision via loudspeaker. Women were routinely executed in public on flimsy allegations of crimes or for no crimes at all. The Taliban instituted a series of brutal punishments, including bodily mutilation, for real or perceived infractions of their moral code. In one instance representative of many similar cases, a woman caught wearing nail polish was “punished” by the Taliban by having the end of her thumb cut off. 
Since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, the situation for women has improved dramatically. Slowly but deliberately, Afghan women have progressed up the ranks of their country’s bureaucracies. Today, women are ministers, generals, ambassadors, members of parliament, entrepreneurs,  and civil society leaders. The constitution of Afghanistan recognizes the equality of men and women, rape is criminalized, and women are legally empowered to seek education and health care. 
Without doubt, Afghanistan’s women and girls continue to face tremendous challenges. Their life expectancy is scandalously low, and child marriage rates are stunningly high. Women account for almost all suicides, and almost all women experience domestic violence. Working women are threated, intimidated, and killed. From January- May 2021, at least six women working in media and polio vaccination efforts were shot dead in Nangarhar provinces. In majority of provinces, women fear their safety. They have either opted reduced activities, moving out of the province or even the country in some cases. Still, Afghan women are eager to protect their gains and secure more of them. Proving time and again they have no better advocate than themselves, Afghan women have shared their stories on social media and spoken out in forums across the world. 
Their ability to secure their rights has been stymied by the fact that women have been locked out of all but a few of the U.S. – Taliban negotiations. When pressed about why they were undertaking high-level and sensitive negotiations about the future of Afghanistan without the presence of women, U.S. officials replied that women would be granted a seat at future inter-Afghan dialogues. Yet, following the conclusion of the U.S.-Taliban negotiations, women were only granted limited representation in the inter-Afghan dialogues.  The latest round of talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban was scheduled to take place in April 2021 in Istanbul but has been postponed until after the end of Ramadan in May. 
Despite their progress and the changes that have occurred since 2001, many women remain afraid for their future. In various media outlets, women journalists and activists describe their fear that the future of their country does not include them.  Were their fears to come to pass, their lives and freedoms and everything they have struggled for would be imperiled.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr Wickramaratne, 
I am deeply worried about the situation of Sri Lankan poet and teacher Ahnaf Jazeem, who has been detained without charge since May 16, 2020 by the authorities. It is distressing to know that a year has passed, and no credible, admissible evidence of wrongdoing has ever been presented before a court. The draconian Prevention Terrorist Act (PTA) under which Ahnaf is arrested, allows authorities to arbitrarily detain individuals without any charges for up to 18 months without charge or trial. 
I find it alarming that he has been denied due process and fair trial rights, including unrestricted access to his lawyers and his family. Ahnaf’s legal counsel states that he has been coerced to make false confessions while under interrogation and has been made to sign documents written in a language he does not understand. These are all clear violations of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sri Lanka is a state party. 
Furthermore, I am concerned that he has been detained under squalid conditions that may amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, which has led to the deterioration of his health. Ahnaf’s family is concerned about his health and safety, a fear heightened by his restricted access to lawyers and family members and not knowing when this ordeal might come to an end. 
I, therefore, urge you to immediately release Ahnaf Jazeem or, if there is sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing, promptly charge him with a recognisable offence, in accordance with international standards. Pending release or charge, I call on you to ensure that his fair trial rights are guaranteed. I also call on the Sri Lankan government to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which does not meet international human rights standards, and immediately end its use. 
Sincerely,

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, 
On March 12, 2018, state security forces arrested Saudi national Abdulrahman al-Sadhan from his place of work at the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Society in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. They failed to present a warrant, confiscated his phone, and took him to an unknown location. After almost two years of no contact whatsoever, Abdulrahman al-Sadhan was finally allowed to call his family for the first time on February 12, 2020, wherein he mentioned being detained at al-Ha’ir prison, located approximately 25 miles south of Riyadh. 
On March 3, Abdulrahman al-Sadhan attended his first secret hearing at the Specialised Criminal Court (SCC), without legal representation and in the absence of his father, who had been assisting his legal defence. He was charged on the basis of a series of satirical tweets from an account the prosecution accused him of running, and a so-called “confession” extracted under duress. After a series of hearings, the SCC sentenced Abdulrahman al-Sadhan on April 5, 2021 to 20 years in prison, to be followed by a 20-year travel ban. The verdict was announced in a closed session, without the presence of his lawyer or father. Abdulrahman Al-Sadhan plans to appeal the verdict. 
I urge you to release Abdulrahman al-Sadhan immediately and unconditionally as he was sentenced to a lengthy prison sentence on charges related solely to the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. Furthermore, I call on you to order an independent and effective investigation into Abdulrahman al-Sadhan’s two-year enforced disappearance and his claims before the court that he was tortured and otherwise ill-treated, and to provide a remedy for Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, including by holding those suspected of responsibility accountable in fair trials.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to raise concern about the recent arrest and detention of Algerian journalist Rabah Kareche, a correspondent of the Liberté newspaper in Tamanrasset in southern Algeria. The Algerian security forces summoned him on April 18, 2021 and questioned him at length about an article that he published on the same day. The article in question covers a protest organized by the Touareg population of Tamanrasset to contest a recent administrative territorial demarcation and demand the authorities to abolish a new decree that sets new territorial boundaries that allows the transfer of a portion of Tamanrasset, rich in natural resources, into newly created wilayas (provinces). 
A prosecutor at the first instance court of Tamanrasset charged Rabah Kareche on April 19 with the offences of “spreading fake news or information which threatens security or public order” and “harming the national security or national unity” under Penal Code articles 196 bis and 79 respectively as well as “creating or supervising an electronic site to publish information likely to cause discrimination and hatred in society” under article 34 of the newly adopted Law on Preventing and Combating Discrimination and Hate Speech. An investigative judge at the same tribunal ordered Rabah Kareche’s pre-trial detention that same day in the Tamanrasset prison. His lawyers submitted a request for provisional release, but the court rejected it on April 27. Rabah Kareche will be in prison until his trial, which has not been scheduled yet. 
This is not the first time that Rabah Kareche has been targeted for his journalistic work. During the two months leading to this arrest, he was subjected to harassment and intimidation by the security forces who summoned him at least three times in the aftermath of publishing an article about sub-Saharan migrants in Algeria. Rabah Kareche alleged that the police pressured him to reveal his sources which he refused. 
In light of the above, I urge you to immediately drop all the baseless charges against Rabah Kareche, and immediately and unconditionally release him from detention as he is detained solely for peacefully exercising his human rights and carrying out his job as a journalist. I also call on you to ensure that authorities stop harassing and intimidating journalists in Algeria and that authorities respect, protect, promote and fulfil people’s right to freedom of expression and media freedom in line with international human rights standards, including through amending provisions of laws that are used to restrict freedom of expression.

Your Excellency, 
Monk Wael Tawadros, known as Father Isaiah, is at imminent risk of execution. Wael Tawadros was convicted in April 2019 of killing a Bishop and sentenced to death following a grossly unfair trial; the court relied on his torture-tainted “confessions”, even though he retracted them in court. In July 2020, the Court of Cassation upheld the death sentence, & the Grand Mufti approved it, making the sentence final. Wael Tawadros has no recourse other than a commutation from your Excellency. 
Wael Tawadros’ right to a fair trial was violated, including his right to access a lawyer, not to incriminate himself, & to receive a fair hearing before a competent, independent & impartial tribunal. According to his family, following his arrest on August 5, 2018, Wael Tawadros was subjected to an enforced disappearance. Until August 28, 2018, the Ministry of Interior refused to acknowledge his detention & reveal his fate & whereabouts. According to an oral statement given by Wael Tawadros in court on January 27, 2019, a recording of which was reviewed by Amnesty International, during this period, police officers took him to the monastery, where the murder took place, stripped him naked, forced him to wear his monk’s robe, beat him, gave him electric shocks, & then ordered him to act out the alleged murder on camera. 
According to Wael Tawadros’s family, the Abaadiya prison administration, in Al-Behira governorate, northern Egypt, where he has been held since August 2018, has been subjecting him to discriminatory & punitive treatment, by preventing him from any written correspondence and denying him regular access to a priest, in violation of international standards & Egyptian law. Others held at the same prison are granted such rights. Furthermore, he is held in a prison hundreds of kilometres from his family’s residence in Asyut governorate, increasing the costs of prison visits & putting an undue financial burden on his family. 
I urge you to commute the death sentence against Wael Tawadros , whose conviction should be quashed & who should be retried in accordance with international fair trial standards in proceedings that exclude coerced “confessions” & without recourse to the death penalty. I also urge you to ensure that he has regular access to his family, lawyer & a qualified representative of his religion. Finally, I urge you to immediately establish an official moratorium on executions, as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty.

Dear Nicolás Maduro, 
I am alarmed by the new regulations issued by your government aimed at controlling and limiting civil society work in Venezuela, particularly through the recent regulation no. 001-2021, published in the Official Gazette No. 42.098 of March 30, 2021. 
This regulation places unacceptable restrictions on NGOs, humanitarian organizations and other members of Venezuelan civil society, all in order to further control and limit their work on behalf of victims of human rights violations, recipients of humanitarian relief, and people in need in Venezuela. 
Civil society organizations carry out a vital mission in any country, but even more so in Venezuela, where millions are forced to cope with a dire humanitarian emergency, widespread and systematic human rights violations, and the effects of a global pandemic. 
I call upon you to ensure this regulation is repealed immediately, and to stop all the harassment, penal prosecution and or censorship of all civil society organizations working to protect the rights of all Venezuelans, particularly those in most need.

While there was an overall trend of decline, some countries pursued or even increased the number of executions carried out, indicating a chilling disregard for human life at a time when the world’s attention focused on protecting people from a deadly virus. 
2020 executioners included Egypt, which tripled its yearly execution figure compared to the previous year; and China, which announced a crackdown on criminal acts affecting Covid-19 prevention efforts, resulting in at least one man being sentenced to death and executed. Meanwhile the Trump administration resumed federal executions after a 17-year hiatus and put a staggering 10 men to death in less than six months. India, Oman, Qatar and Taiwan also resumed executions. 
“As the world focused on finding ways to protect lives from Covid-19, several governments showed a disturbing determination to resort to the death penalty and execute people no matter what,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“The death penalty is an abhorrent punishment and pursuing executions in the middle of a pandemic further highlights its inherent cruelty. Fighting against an execution is hard at the best of times, but the pandemic meant that many people on death row were unable to access in-person legal representation, and many of those wanting to provide support had to expose themselves to considerable – yet absolutely avoidable – health risks. The use of the death penalty under these conditions is a particularly egregious assault on human rights.” 
Covid-19 restrictions had concerning implications for access to legal counsel and the right to a fair trial in several countries, including the USA, where defense lawyers said they were unable to carry out crucial investigative work or meet clients face-to-face. 
Top five executing countries  
China classifies the total number of its executions and death sentences as a state secret and prevents independent scrutiny. Therefore, Amnesty International’s figures for all known executions do not include executions in China. However, China is believed to execute thousands each year, making it once again the world’s most prolific executioner ahead of Iran (246+), Egypt (107+), Iraq (45+) and Saudi Arabia (27). Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 88% of all known executions in 2020. 
Egypt tripled the number of yearly executions and became the world’s third most frequent executioner in 2020. At least 23 of those executed were sentenced to death in cases relating to political violence, after grossly unfair trials marred by forced “confessions” and other serious human rights violations including torture and enforced disappearances. A spike in executions occurred in October and November, when Egyptian authorities executed at least 57 people – 53 men and four women. 
Although recorded executions in Iran continued to be lower than previous years, the country increasingly used the death penalty as a weapon of political repression against dissidents, protesters and members of ethnic minority groups, in violation of international law. 
Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region continued to violate international law and standards which prohibit the use of the death penalty for crimes that do not involve intentional killing. Yet, the death penalty was handed down for drug offenses in China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam; for corruption in China and Viet Nam; and for blasphemy in Pakistan. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, death sentences were imposed by courts established through special legislation and which usually follow different procedures from ordinary courts. In the Maldives, five people who were below 18 years of age at the time of the crime remained under sentence of death. 
The United States is an outlier in the Americas 
The United States was the only country in the Americas to carry out executions in 2020. In July, the Trump administration carried out the first federal execution in 17 years, and five states put seven people to death between them. 
“The Trump administration’s pursuit of a staggering number of executions, while much of the world made strides in the opposite direction, caused some of the most harrowing outcomes we have seen in many years,” said Kristina Roth, the Senior Advocate of the Criminal Justice Program at Amnesty International USA. “In contrast, a new administration marks the first United States President and Vice President ever to express support of ending the death penalty. Given decades of grassroots support, research, and advocacy efforts of moving the United States toward abolishing the death penalty, we are hopeful and committed to seeing that the end of the use of the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment is in sight.” 
In 2020, the state of Colorado abolished the death penalty, with Virginia following suit in 2021. During the 2020 United States Universal Periodic Review by United Nations Member States, 33 countries advocated for the United States to take steps to abolish the death penalty at all levels of government where it persists. 
Amnesty International USA is calling on  U.S. President Joe Biden, to commute the death sentences of the 49 individuals who remain under federal sentence of death,  urging members of Congress to strongly support legislative efforts to abolish the federal death penalty and the Department of Justice to rescind the lethal injection protocol and the “Manner of Execution” regulation, to stop seeking the death penalty, deauthorize ongoing death penalty cases and the Department of Corrections should dismantle the federal death chamber at Terre Haute, Indiana, used to execute people under federal sentence of death. The sale and transport of chemicals used in lethal injections must be banned if the United States hopes to make further progress in death penalty abolition. 
Executions reach lowest number in a decade 
Globally, at least 483 people were known to have been executed in 2020 (excluding countries which classify death penalty data as state secrets, or for which limited information is available – China, North Korea, Syria and Viet Nam). Shocking as this figure is, it is the lowest number of executions recorded by Amnesty International in at least a decade. It represents a decrease of 26% compared to 2019, and 70% from the high-peak of 1,634 executions in 2015. 
According to the report, the fall in executions was down to a reduction in executions in some retentionist countries and, to a lesser extent, some hiatuses in executions that occurred in response to the pandemic. 
Recorded executions in Saudi Arabia dropped by 85%, from 184 in 2019 to 27 in 2020, and more than halved in Iraq, from 100 in 2019 to 45 in 2020. No executions were recorded in Bahrain, Belarus, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore and Sudan – countries that carried out executions in 2019. 
The number of death sentences known to have been imposed worldwide (at least 1,477) was also down by 36% compared to 2019. Amnesty International recorded decreases in 30 out of 54 countries where death sentences were known to have been imposed. These appeared to be linked in several cases to delays and deferrals in judicial proceedings, put in place in response to the pandemic. 
Notable exceptions were Indonesia, whose 2020 recorded death sentences (117) increased by 46% compared to 2019 (80); and Zambia, which imposed 119 death sentences in 2020, 18 more than in 2019 and the highest recorded in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Time to abolish the death penalty 
In 2020, Chad abolished the death penalty, Kazakhstan committed to abolition under international law and Barbados concluded reforms to repeal the mandatory death penalty. 
As of April 2021, 108 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and 144 countries have abolished it in law or practice – a trend that must continue. 
“Despite the continued pursuit of the death penalty by some governments, the overall picture in 2020 was positive. Chad abolished the death penalty, along with the U.S. state of Colorado, and the number of known executions continued to drop – bringing the world closer to consigning the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment to the history books,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“With 123 states – more than ever before – supporting the UN General Assembly call for a moratorium on executions, pressure is growing on outliers to follow suit. Virginia recently became the first U.S. Southern state to repeal the death penalty, while several bills to abolish it at U.S. federal level are pending before Congress. As the journey towards global abolition of the death penalty continues, we call on the U.S. Congress to support legislative efforts to abolish the death penalty. 
“We urge leaders in all countries that have not yet repealed this punishment to make 2021 the year that they end state-sanctioned killings for good. We will continue to campaign until the death penalty is abolished everywhere, once and for all.”

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
Washington, D.C. 20528 
  
Re:  Amnesty International USA comments on February 2021 Interim Guidance:  Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Priorities 
Dear Secretary Mayorkas: 
On behalf of Amnesty International USA,[1] we write to urge you to revise the February 2021 Interim Guidance: Civil Immigration Enforcement and Removal Priorities (“Interim Guidance Memorandum”) to comport with human rights standards and President Biden’s stated commitment to a fair, orderly, and humane immigration system.[2]  An administration pledged to uphold human rights and racial equity should seize this opportunity to reshape the immigration enforcement system to reflect that commitment. 
The Interim Guidance Memorandum uses broad categorizations to reduce people to security risks and deprive them of protection, and fails to address critical immigration enforcement issues undermining the U.S.’s human rights obligations.  The Interim Guidance Memorandum does not protect people fleeing to the United States in search of safety nor does it redress the cruelty suffered by those locked up in immigration detention.  The Interim Guidance Memorandum is also silent on privatized immigration detention and the continuing use of Title 42 at the U.S. southern border to expel families and adults seeking safety. 
During this 90-day interim period, before you issue new enforcement guidelines, we urge you to revise the Interim Guidance Memorandum to do the following: 
The Interim Guidance Memorandum specifies that all people who entered the United States on or after November 1, 2020, are considered a “border security” priority and therefore will be considered priorities for detention and removal.  This includes adults and families seeking humanitarian protection. 
People seeking safety are not “border security” risks.  They need protection and humane treatment, not detention and deportation.  Casting asylum-seekers as security risks undermines the United States’ obligations under domestic and international laws to provide safe haven for asylum-seekers. 
The right to seek asylum is enshrined in both international and domestic law.  Under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, the latter of which the United States has signed and incorporated into domestic law through the 1980 Refugee Act, governments must uphold the right to seek asylum.[3]  The U.S. government has codified in domestic law the right to seek asylum both at and between ports of entry along the U.S. border.[4] 
Detaining an entire class of people as security threats solely on account of their immigration constitutes arbitrary detention, a violation of international law.  Both refugee and international human rights law require the U.S. government to respect and ensure personal liberty and security as all individuals’ default condition.[5]  Arbitrary detention is prohibited.[6]  Immigrants and asylum-seekers, as anyone else, must benefit from a legal presumption of liberty and not be subjected to arbitrary detention. 
The U.S. government has an obligation to ensure that the human rights of immigrants and asylum-seekers are respected, protected, and fulfilled.  Detention should be the exception and can only be permitted in very narrow circumstances.[7]  It must be justified in each individual case, subject to judicial review, necessary and proportionate to a legitimate purpose, and non-discriminatory.[8]  When detention occurs, it must be the least restrictive as possible for the shortest period of time.  In order to show that detention is necessary and proportionate, a government must demonstrate that alternatives to detention would not to be effective before resorting to detention.[9]  The blanket use of detention for the “border security” priority constitutes arbitrary detention and is unlawful – it is not based on an individualized assessment of its necessity and proportionality and is used as a default measure instead of an exception.[10] 
The arbitrary detention of people seeking safety also deprives them of a fair opportunity to ask for asylum and consequently jeopardizes lives with the threat of refoulement.  The United States government is under an obligation not to return individuals to a situation in which they would be at risk of torture or other serious human rights abuses: the principle of non-refoulement.[11]  This includes not only their countries of origin, but any other place where they would face risk of serious harm.[12]  The blanket use of detention for border enforcement undermines the U.S.’s obligation to provide a fair opportunity to seek asylum, given the well documented issues with meaningful access to legal counsel for people in detention.[13]  Without a meaningful opportunity to ask of protection, people seeking safety could be returned to the very danger they fled, in violation of the U.S.’s obligation of non-refoulement 
The use of arbitrary detention for border enforcement further undermines the right to seek asylum because it seeks to deter people from seeking safety in the United States.  Refugee and international law establish the right to seek asylum without penalty regardless of how a person enters a country, and the right to liberty and security, free from arbitrary detention.[14]  The Refugee Convention recognizes the humanity behind flight: people fleeing violence and persecution often have little choice about how they cross borders in their search for safety and compassion demands they not be penalized for the matter of entry.  In fact, as noted above, U.S. law permits people to apply for asylum regardless of how they enter — whether at or between ports of entry.  The blanket use of detention to deter people from crossing a border to ask for asylum is not only wholly inconsistent with refugee protection and human rights standards, it is also at odds with U.S. law guaranteeing the right to seek asylum regardless of how they entered the country. 
The inclusion of families in the “border security” priority violates the U.S.’s obligations toward the treatment of immigrant children.  The detention of immigrant children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied, is prohibited in international law as it is not in their best interests.[15]  Additionally, detaining children because of their parents’ immigration status will never be in their best interests, nor will separating them from their parents.[16]  Children should not be detained and families should be released as a unit.[17]  The detention of families must end altogether. 
Amnesty International has documented the grievous harm of detention and a punitive immigration enforcement system, and campaigned to free families and individuals detained simply because they were seeking safety at the U.S. southern border.  Under the Interim Guidance Memorandum, these families and individuals would be detained simply because they came to the U.S. southern border asking for safety: 
Families, with children as young as infants and toddlers, who were detained from multiple months to nearly two years after they asked for asylum at the U.S. southern border.  Some children grew up in detention, such as Josué*, who learned to walk and talk while detained at the Berks County Family Residential Center.  Other families such as Britany* and her son Gerry* and daughter Angela*, Andrea* and her son Mario, and Monica* and her son Jafeth* were forcibly separated in the spring of 2018, only to be reunified and then detained at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Texas for months.  The government chose to detain even infants such as Jose*, even after he developed breathing problems after days held in a Customs and Border Protection facility and was sent to a hospital for five days and put on a machine to help him breathe.  Instead of releasing him during the pandemic, the government sent him and his mother to detention at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Texas.  The detention of all of these families was solely predicated on their coming to the U.S. southern border asking for asylum.  It was arbitrary, unnecessary, and harmful. 
Pastor Steven Tendo, who was detained at the Port Isabel detention facility in Texas for nearly 26 months after he fled to the U.S. seeking asylum.  He had been tortured by Ugandan government forces who amputated two of his fingers, detained him more than a dozen times and subjected him to further abuse, and killed several of his family members shortly before he escaped.  While detained at Port Isabel, his health rapidly deteriorated due to inadequate care: his diabetes was left untreated, he lost vision in one eye and was losing vision in the other, and suffered numbness and tingling in his extremities; he also had recurring boils on his body.  Due to public outrage, he finally received medical care that restored vision in one eye, managed his diabetes and other health conditions, but his immune system remained compromised and ICE continued to detain him.  Working with his lawyers and other advocacy organizations, Amnesty International campaigned to free him and he was finally freed in February 2021.  While Pastor Steven’s treatment in detention reflected the punitive nature of a system toward people seeking safety, his direct experience also speaks to the systemic racism that Black immigrants endure in ICE detention. 
Alejandra Barrera, who was detained for more than two years at the trans pod at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico after asking for asylum at the U.S. southern border.  While in detention, she did not receive adequate health care.  Despite requiring specialized medical care, and having a sponsor waiting to welcome here, she was denied parole five times.  While Alejandra was detained, a transgender asylum-seeker named Roxana Hernandez died at a local hospital in ICE custody after she was transferred from Cibola.  Alejandra was depressed and scared she would face a similar fate.  Alejandra’s situation is not unique; there are many more trans women seeking asylum in the United States who are detained after asking for safety at the southern border, and at risk of ill-treatment while in detention because of their gender identity, medical needs, or the trauma they have endured. 
Categorizing people as security risks simply because of how they enter the United States feeds a harmful narrative that has dehumanized immigrants and people seeking safety.  Such broad brushstrokes bolster discriminatory treatment of people simply because they come from another country. 
Not only does the “border security” priority create harm by subjecting immigrants and people seeking safety – including families with children – to arbitrary enforcement solely based on their identity, it is also inconsistent with the administration’s other proposed reforms at the border.  Notably the U.S. Citizenship Act (HR 1177 / S 348) proposes the establishment of a path to citizenship for those who entered on or before January 1, 2021, while the Interim Guidance Memorandum classifies anyone who enters the U.S. after November 1, 2020, as a “border security” priority. 
We urge you to eliminate the arbitrary and harmful “border security” priority and chart a new course grounded in human rights and the recognition that people entering the United States are not threats because of their immigration status.  Rather, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should prioritize humane and respectful reception for asylum-seekers at the southern border recognizing their right to seek protection and upholding their humanity and dignity. 
The Interim Guidance Memorandum does not address the thousands of people currently detained by Immigration and Customs enforcement (“ICE”). 
All people in ICE detention should have a review of their case with the presumption of liberty, in line with the U.S.’s human rights obligations to respect and ensure personal liberty and security as all individuals’ default condition and not subject people to arbitrary detention – including immigrants and asylum-seekers.[18]  As discussed above, the blanket use of detention in the U.S., not uncommonly for prolonged and even indefinite periods, violates those obligations. 
In February 2021, one hundred groups, including Amnesty International USA, urged DHS to establish an affirmative file review process to consider release for all persons in ICE custody.[19]  This process should prioritize people who are most vulnerable to harm in custody including families and children, transgender individuals, HIV+ individuals, pregnant people, and those at heightened risk of COVID-19.  All persons should be considered eligible for release pursuant to this process, including those subject to statutory mandatory custody under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c).  This is in line with ICE officials exercising their discretion to release people detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) for urgent humanitarian reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic.[20] 
ICE’s case review process must be replaced with this affirmative review process.  ICE’s current process puts the burden on the detained person – or their counsel, if the person is fortunate to have counsel – to ask for a case review, instead of the government assuming the responsibility to free people unjustly detained.  Advocates report that ICE’s case review process is implemented inconsistently, without transparency, and with limited benefit for people currently detained.  It does not reflect meaningful engagement to create a fair and humane immigration system. 
Creating an affirmative case review process upholds a presumption of liberty for people in detention.  Instead of putting the burden on detained people, the vast majority of whom do not have counsel and/or fall outside ICE’s own enforcement priorities, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate why someone should be detained.  The population under consideration is just over 14,000, making the process contemplated even more feasible. 
Amnesty International has campaigned to release people who are not a priority enforcement under the Interim Guidance Memorandum, and yet remained detained: 
Originally from Guatemala, Alida* sought safety in the U.S. with her daughter after years of severe physical, psychological, and sexual abuse at the hands of her partner.  In February 2021, a U.S. immigration judge found that this heinous treatment amounted to torture, and granted Alida protection under the Convention Against Torture.  Despite this, ICE continued to detain in York County Prison in Pennsylvania.  Only after Amnesty International intervened, shining a light on the continued detention of a survivor of torture, was Alida released. 
Maura fled to the U.S. from Mexico to escape relentless, transgender-based violence and abuse.  Originally from Nicaragua, she spent half her life in the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident, attending high school in San Diego, holding numerous jobs in the hospitality industry, and building a community that accepts her as a trans woman.  Maura is seeking humanitarian protection; she faces significant risk if returned to a country which is not safe for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals, particularly trans women.  Yet, for nearly two years, she’s been detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in California where she has suffered abuse and lacks adequate medical care, making her particularly vulnerable for COVID-19 complications.  Maura is not a priority under the Interim Guidance Memorandum, and ICE has the legal and discretionary authority to release her.  Maura should be released. 
To uphold its human rights obligations, DHS should issue guidance based on the presumption of liberty for people in the immigration system.  The new guidance should commit to individualized consideration of release for all people in ICE custody.  No one should be detained for seeking safety or detained solely because of their immigration status.  Moreover, Black and brown communities again and again bear the brunt of harsh, punitive enforcement policies and practices anchored in detention.  Failure to address these systemic harms undermines President Biden’s commitment to racial equity and human rights. 
The Interim Guidance Memorandum is silent on privatized immigration detention.  As a presidential candidate, Joe Biden promised to “[e]nd for-profit detention centers” as “[n]o business should profit from the suffering of desperate people fleeing violence.”[21] 
The vast majority of people in ICE custody – from 70 to 80 percent – are detained in immigration detention facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations.[22]  Many of these facilities have a well documented record of harsh conditions and negligent care, and lack of accountability.[23] 
Amnesty International has exposed the horrifying conditions in immigration detention, including facilities operated by private prison companies – a lack of physical distancing, overcrowding, inadequate hygiene, and negligent medical care.[24]  These rights violations have made ICE detention facilities tinderboxes for the spread of COVID-19. 
We commend President Biden’s January 2021 executive order eliminating the use of privately operated criminal detention facilities:  “To decrease incarceration levels, we must reduce profit-based incentives to incarcerate by phasing out the Federal Government’s reliance on privately operated criminal detention facilities.”[25]  The Department of Justice is phasing out of private prison companies for use by the Bureau of Prisons because the U.S. government has found private prison companies to provide substandard and unsafe conditions for criminal detention facilities and incentivize mass incarceration. 
In December 2016, the Homeland Security Advisory Council, an expert panel of law enforcement, national security, military, and other experts who advise the DHS Secretary, voted to recommend that DHS shift away from using private prisons to detain immigrants and asylum-seekers.[26] 
The reliance on privately operated and owned detention facilities has fueled arbitrary, mass detention and provision of care and conditions that are negligent and dangerous for people in ICE custody.  Yet, private prison companies continue to operate in the context of immigration detention. 
Equity and racial justice demand that DHS develop and implement a plan to phase out ICE contracts with private prison companies, as is being done by the Department of Justice.  People in ICE custody detained in facilities owned or managed by private prisons companies should be afforded equal protection and consideration of their rights and well being. 
DHS should also phase out contracts with state and local prisons and jails and other criminal detention facilities, including those privately owned and operated, for immigration detention.  Facilities with the worst records for negligent and abusive care and conditions and lack of accountability should be prioritized in phasing out contracts. 
Finally, in order to facilitate a broader shift away from immigration detention, DHS should expand community-based alternatives to detention. It must also halt the detention of asylum-seekers.  These detention reforms will move the U.S. toward compliance with its human rights obligations, drastically reduce the number of people detained by ICE, and save hundreds of millions of dollars. 
As with criminal detention, Black and brown communities comprise the majority of people in immigration detention, both a reflection and perpetuation of systemic racism.  Upholding President Biden’s commitment to racial equity and human rights unequivocally rests on resetting the racialized and punitive assumptions of the U.S.’s current immigration enforcement system.  Private prison companies are a principal driver of this abusive system, and their unchecked and unexamined presence must end. 
The Interim Guidance Memorandum is silent on the use of the Title 42 of the Public Health Services Act, which the government continues to use to expel families and people seeking safety at the U.S. southern border. 
In March 2020, the previous administration began misusing Title 42 of U.S. Code Section 265 to effectively shut down access to the asylum system.  The unlawful use of Title 42 has resulted in the summary expulsion of over 500,000 immigrants and asylum-seekers.[27]  Title 42 has particularly affected Black immigrants and asylum-seekers, who have been summarily returned to the countries they fled because the Mexican government is largely only receiving immigrants and asylum-seekers from the northern countries of Central America who are expelled under Title 42.[28]  Over the course of Black History Month in February 2021 and then in March 2021, the Biden administration expelled over 1,200 Haitians to danger in Haiti, including children, infants, and families.[29] 
All of this was entirely preventable, endangered lives, and is in violation of the U.S.’s obligations under international and domestic law to uphold the right to seek asylum and not forcibly return individuals to a place where they would face persecution. 
The U.S.’s public health laws should not be used to evade U.S. obligations under human rights and refugee law.  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has made clear that blanket measures restricting access to asylum on health grounds, without safeguards to protect against refoulement, is discriminatory, does not meet international standards for protection, and cannot be justified.[30]  As President Biden assumed office, UNHCR yet again reminded governments: “The right to seek asylum is a fundamental human right.  The COVID-19 pandemic provides no exception.”[31]  Yet, the Biden administration continues to use Title 42 to expel people seeing safety under the pretext of public health, violating their right to seek asylum and protection against refoulement – bedrock principles of refugee protection. 
Furthermore, the use of Title 42 does not advance the public health justifications on which it is purportedly based.  The use of Title 42 contradicts public health experts, who have clearly assessed and confirmed that there is no public health rationale for denying people their right to claim asylum at the U.S. border.[32]  Despite experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determining there was no public health rationale to close the border, the order invoking the use of Title 42 was still issued over their objections.[33] 
Simply put: there is no public health rationale to treat immigrants and asylum-seekers differently, but it is causing irreparable harm to them.  Public health experts have published a series of recommendations on how to restart the asylum process safely by using common-sense measures.[34] 
UNHCR has warned that “[m]easures restricting access to asylum must not be allowed to become entrenched under the guise of public health.”[35]  We urge you to heed that warning and revoke Title 42 and the practice of summarily expelling immigrants and people seeking safety – including families with children.  The exemption of unaccompanied children from Title 42 is long overdue, as it conflicts with the TVPRA and human rights obligations.  But continuing to apply Title 42 to adults and families is unlawful, not based on science, and perpetuates the systemic racism permeating the U.S.’s punitive immigration enforcement system.  It also risks creating family separation and endangering children by creating a risk parents, seeking their children’s safety, will allow them to travel to the U.S. alone to ask for protection. 
The solution is to uphold the rights of immigrants and people seeking safety, without discrimination to their status, country of origin, or other characteristics, and implement a fair and humane system that ensures the timely processing of asylum-seekers and immigrants without the default use of detention.  The desire to implement processes to regulate border entry can be achieved based on protecting public health and respecting human rights.  The U.S. has the capacity, and must marshal the political will, to act. 
We urge you to reframe the Interim Guidance Memorandum, starting from the basis of protection, racial equity, and human rights.  Rather than portraying asylum-seekers and immigrants as categorical threats, the Interim Guidance Memorandum should be revised to communicate the valued place asylum-seekers and immigrants have in the United States and our communities, and whose rights should be protected as equally as all others rather than as people to be targeted.  A rights-positive and equitable framework shapes not only public perception but also institutional culture. 
The moment is now to build a more just, compassionate, and humane immigration enforcement system: one that does not punish and criminalize asylum-seekers and immigrants, jeopardize human rights, and perpetuate the systemic harms of racial inequity and harmful narratives.  A reframed Interim Guidance Memorandum is instrumental in resetting the system, and we urge you to act.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr Wilson Ruiz Orejuela, 
I am writing to express concern for the health and safety of thousands of people whose rights are on peril if the Colombian government resumes the eradication of illicit crops through aerial spraying glyphosate. Colombia should ensure that efforts to prevent illicit drug cultivation or eradicate illicit crops do not adversely affect the enjoyment of human rights, including of peasant communities whose livelihoods depend on such crops. 
It is widely documented that the use of glyphosate has had a serious impact on the environment and the human rights of thousands of people, such as right to life, health, water, to a healthy and safe environment and to an adequate standard of living.  The force eradication of illegal crops with glyphosate will exacerbate the situation of conflict in the country, leaving rural communities in an even more vulnerable situation. 
We urge you to immediately agree on a suspension of aerial spraying with glyphosate, and to refrain from adopting drug policies that harm people. In this sense, I call on you to develop instead policies that address the underlying socio-economic causes that lead people to cultivate these crops and avoid entrenching poverty and deprivation in these communities. The government must provide peasants farmers who depend on such crops with the necessary support to develop economically viable and sustainable alternatives and to realize their right to work and an adequate standard of living. The programs for voluntary substitution, recognized in the Peace Agreement, have proven to be more sustainable and effective for the protection of communities’ human rights. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER
 
Your Majesty, 
In March 2021, the Court of Appeals in Riyadh upheld the sentence of Saudi woman human rights defender Nassima al-Sada, signalling that the verdict is now final and leaving her without any further recourse to justice. The verdict had been issued by the Criminal Court in Riyadh on November 25, 2020 and consisted of a five-year prison term – partially suspended by two years – to be followed by a travel ban of five years. This verdict followed a trial that was marred by serious violations of her due process rights, including prolonged solitary confinement which could amount to torture. 
Indeed, Nassima al-Sada’s ordeal started in July 2018, when she was arbitrarily arrested and then detained without charge or trial for almost a year. After a year, she was charged with unspecified crimes based on the cybercrime law, making it clear that she is being prosecuted simply for her peaceful human rights activities, namely advocating for civil and political rights and for the right of women to drive, before the driving ban was lifted in June 2018. 
Nassima al-Sada is a brave Saudi woman who has dedicated her life to advocating for peaceful change and is being made to pay with the pain of family separation, isolation, and continuous violations of her rights, for her peaceful activities. She should never have been locked up in the first place – her place is with her family, her three children, her ailing husband, more than ever, during the Holy Month of Ramadan. 
I urge you to ensure that Nassima al-Sada is immediately and unconditionally released, and her conviction and sentence are quashed, as she was detained and tried solely for peacefully advocating for equality for women. I also urge you to respect Nassima al-Sada’s right to movement by lifting the travel ban imposed on her for the coming five years.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Inspector General Mirza Shahid Saleem Baig, 
I write to you to out of alarm for the sharp decline in health of death row prisoner Shafqat Emmanuel. Shafqat is completely paralyzed from the waist down and must rely on prison guards to perform the most basic tasks like leaving his bed and using the bathroom. Furthermore, as per the application submitted by his lawyer to the Inspector General of Prisons in Punjab, he has painful bed sores and needs urgent health care. 
Currently held in Central Jail, Faisalabad I find it alarming that in March, according to his family, Shafqat was in a coma for three days and yet was still not provided adequate medical care. Shafqat and his wife Shagufta Kausar, were convicted of “blasphemy” and sentenced to death in 2014 for allegedly sending “blasphemous” text messages to a mosque cleric. 
The couple should not be in jail at all, let alone at risk of execution. Pakistan’s blasphemy laws do not meet human rights law and standards, they lack essential safeguards to minimize the risk of rights violations and illustrate the dangers faced by the country’s religious minorities. The urgency with which the injustices in this case must be remedied is heightened by Shafqat’s pain and lack of access to appropriate health care. 
I find it highly distressing that a prisoner who needs urgent health care is not being shifted to the jail hospital. He should not be detained in the first place, and if he is not going to be released, prison authorities must ensure provision of adequate health care whether it is available inside or outside the prison 
Therefore, I strongly urge you to grant Shafqat prompt, regular and unrestricted access to adequate health care as necessary. In addition to that, him and his wife Shagufta should be immediately and unconditionally released. We call for the couple and their lawyer to be provided with adequate security upon their release. 
Sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to renew my call for the release from pre-trial detention and fair trial for journalist Omar Radi who has been detained in pre-trial detention since July 29, 2020 and who is facing his first trial session on April 6, 2021. 
On March 23, 2021, an investigative judge indicted him for  “harming the internal and external security of Morocco” based on an accusation that he had received funds from sources “linked to foreign intelligence agencies”. Amnesty International has found that Omar Radi has received funds transferred from abroad for research grants in the context of a journalism fellowship and freelance consultancies, both related to his exercise of freedom of expression. Amnesty International therefore has serious concerns that the charge is spurious and indicates a similar pattern used by the Moroccan authorities to intimidate critics. Similar charges were brought against academic Maati Monjib for legitimately receiving funding from a foreign non-governmental organization in 2015. 
Omar Radi is also charged with “rape” and “indecent assault against a female” based on an accusation by a woman who alleges he assaulted her on July 12, 2020. He denies this, affirming that he had a “consensual sexual relationship” with her. The witness in this case, journalist Imad Stitou, who was present during the alleged incident, has denied throughout the investigation that rape took place.  As a result Imad Stitou has also been indicted as an accomplice of rape. He is facing trial on the same date. 
Rape accusations must each be considered on their merits and Amnesty International is not well placed to assess their veracity. We note that there has been a recent pattern of sexual assault charges being brought against critics of the government in the context of detention or prosecutions related to their freedom of expression. In one case of a detained newspaper publisher,  the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that his detention in relation to rape accusations amounted to “judicial harassment attributable to nothing other than his investigative journalism”. 
I urge the Moroccan authorities to release Omar Radi while he awaits and undergoes trial.  Under international law, pretrial detention should only be used as an exceptional measure and only when the authorities can demonstrate a specific risk of, for example, absconding.  Omar Radi is already under a travel ban and has pledged to participate fully in the judicial process. I also call on you to drop the “national security” charge against Omar Radi as it is related to his legitimate exercise of journalistic work. Finally, I call on the authorities to grant Omar Radi a fair trial in accordance with international due process standards.

Dear Prosecutor General, 
I am gravely concerned about the arbitrary detention of twenty-year-old Salekh Magamadov and Ismail Isaev who has just turned 18. According to the Russian LGBT Network, they were detained by police at a flat in Nizhnii Novgorod, in an abduction-style operation, on February 4, 2021, and forcibly transferred to Gudermes, Chechnya. There, they were questioned as witnesses and nominally released, only to be arrested and taken away immediately after, first to the village of Sernovodskoe and then to the town of Urus-Martan. On February 9, an Urus-Martan court ordered their remand as persons suspected of “aiding and abetting an illegal armed group”. The court’s decision (upheld on February 20 by the Supreme Court of Chechnya) was issued without informing their lawyers or family members despite Ismail Isaev still being a minor at that time. They were only allowed to see their lawyers in mid-March, in the Grozny pre-trial detention facility SIZO-2. They complained about their ill-treatment and multiple violations of fair trial guarantees, including being forced to sign a “confession” and to refuse the services of the lawyer of their choice. 
Salekh Magamadov and Ismail Isaev are being prosecuted solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, including in connection with their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity. They had already suffered unlawful deprivation of liberty and alleged torture and other ill-treatment at the hands of the Chechen authorities back in March 2020, when they were arbitrarily detained by the Chechen police and unlawfully held in secret detention. They are at further risk of torture and other ill-treatment and face up to 15 years in jail on fabricated charges. 
In light of the above, I urge you to:

Your Majesty King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, 
On March 10, 2021 exactly one month after her conditional release, the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) upheld the conviction of Saudi woman human rights defender Loujain al-Hathloul and denied her appeal to quash her sentence. The SCC had issued its verdict on December 28, 2020, following a grossly unfair trial which included claims of torture and sexual harassment during her detention, sentencing her to five years and eight months in prison – partially suspended by two years and ten months. 
This latest judicial development, whereby the SCC upheld the verdict, effectively means that even though she is no longer behind bars, Loujain al-Hathloul is still not free. She continues to face probation, which effectively means she is at risk of re-arrest in case she violates the terms of her probation, as well as a travel ban of five years. In parallel, Loujain al-Hathloul had demanded that the regular Criminal Court investigate her claims of being subjected to acts of torture, harassment, and ill-treatment during the first three months of her detention. The Criminal Court confirmed the Public Prosecutor’s decision that no torture had taken place, and effectively placing the burden of proof on Loujain al-Hathloul, who then took the case to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal in turn confirmed the primary verdict of the Criminal Court that no torture had taken place. 
Loujain al-Hathloul continues to pay a price for her peaceful activism and remains at risk of re-arrest, under severe movement restrictions, and effectively restricted from pursuing any peaceful activism. She should be free, enjoying her freedom and provided with a remedy for the violations she has suffered throughout her arbitrary detention and unfair trial. 
I urge you to ensure that Loujain al-Hathloul’s conviction and sentence are quashed, as she was detained and tried solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression. I also urge you to respect Loujain al-Hathloul’s right to movement and travel by lifting the ban imposed on her for the coming five years, as well as removing the travel ban on her parents. Furthermore, I call on you to ensure an effective investigation into the allegations that Loujain al-Hathloul was tortured, and otherwise ill-treated in prison, prosecuting those suspected of responsibility in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty and providing Loujain al-Hathloul with a remedy. Finally, I urge you to ensure Loujain al-Hathloul’s safety and protection from threats, harassment, and any kind of punitive measures, to enable her to safely continue her human rights work without intimidation or fear of prosecution.

The Honorable Alejandro Mayorkas 
Secretary of Homeland Security 
Washington, D.C. 20528 
  
March 11, 2021 
  
Dear Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas: 
On behalf of the Board of Directors of Amnesty International USA,[1] we write to you to urge you to act on the promise of President Biden’s immigration agenda by building an immigration enforcement system based on humanity, compassion, fairness, and respect. 
As initial steps, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) should release people in immigration detention through an affirmative file review process with a presumption of liberty, end family detention, and end the use of facilities run by private prison companies and county jails for immigration detention. 
Release people in detention through an affirmative file review process with a presumption of liberty 
Last month, Amnesty International USA, as part of a coalition of 120 legal, medical services, and advocacy organizations, sent a letter to the White House and DHS urging the implementation of a file review process to reconsider the custody determination for every person currently in ICE custody.[2] 
We urge you again to swiftly establish an affirmative file review process to consider release of people in detention, with a presumption of liberty. This process should prioritize people who are most vulnerable to harm in custody, including individuals who face a heightened risk of serious illness or death from COVID-19, transgender people, pregnant people, HIV+ people, and all families and children. All persons should be considered eligible for release pursuant to this process, including those subject to statutory mandatory custody under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c). This is in line with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials exercising their discretion to release people detained under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(c) for urgent humanitarian reasons, including the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Further, DHS should adopt guidance based on the presumption of liberty for people in the immigration system, and that commits to individualized consideration of release for all people in ICE custody. No one should be detained for seeking safety or detained solely because of their immigration status. 
The use of detention as a default response must cease, and the thousands of immigrants and asylum-seekers in detention should be freed. Such affirmative action is in line with President Biden’s stated commitment to racial equity and human rights. 
Instead of detention, the norm should be that asylum-seekers and immigrants are allowed to live in the community, supported by sponsors, community-based services, and case management programs. These are proven, compassionate alternatives that are humane, support dignity, and facilitate compliance. They also save considerable government resources. 
End family detention 
The policy and practice of family detention should be ended immediately, and all three family detention facilities closed. Children should never be detained because of their immigration status, and families should not be separated. Children should live in freedom with their families as they pursue their right to seek safety. 
The recent developments at the three family residential centers (FRC) suggest a reconsideration of the use of family detention. We urge you to provide clear, public information about proposed plans for these facilities and to take the necessary next steps: not to detain additional families; close the facilities; and end family detention altogether. 
The FRCs in Texas are reportedly to be used as “reception centers,” while the FRC in Pennsylvania is reportedly empty. We urge immediate, open access for families held in these facilities to attorneys who can provide information on the asylum process and ensure that their rights are respected. They should be open to nongovernmental actors such as humanitarian case workers, medical personnel, volunteers and others, and requests for access by human rights monitors should not be subject to unreasonable delay. Initial processing of asylum-seeking families should be moved from FRCs, which should bee closed, and instead conducted by humanitarian staff in humanitarian reception facilities. 
End the use of facilities run by private prison companies and county jails for immigration detention 
For-profit detention should be ended. The vast majority of people under ICE custody are detained in immigration detention facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations. These facilities have a well documented record of harsh conditions and negligent care, and lack of accountability. 
In line with the Department of Justice phasing out of private prison companies for use by the Bureau of Prisons, DHS should develop and implement a plan to phase out ICE contracts with private prison companies. Just as private prison companies have been found to provide substandard and unsafe conditions for criminal detention facilities and incentivize mass incarceration, the same is true for the use of private prison companies for immigration detention. The reliance on privately operated and owned detention facilities has fueled arbitrary, mass detention and provision of care and conditions that are negligent and dangerous for people in ICE custody. 
At the same time, DHS should phase out contracts with state and local prisons and jails and other criminal detention facilities, including those privately owned and operated, for immigration detention. Facilities with the worst records for negligent and abusive care and conditions and lack of accountability should be prioritized in phasing out contracts. 
Black and brown communities again and again bear the brunt of harsh, punitive enforcement policies and practices anchored in detention and powered by private prison companies. Failure to address these systemic harms undermines President Biden’s commitment to racial equity and human rights. 
The moment is now: you have the opportunity to turn away from harsh practices that punish and criminalize asylum-seekers and immigrants and perpetuate the systemic harms of racial inequity, and begin to build a more just, compassionate, and humane immigration system. 
Thank you for your urgent action. 
Sincerely, 
Amnesty International USA Board of Directors

The YouGov poll for the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a global coalition of organizations including Amnesty International, Oxfam and Public Citizen, shows that a majority of respondents support the removal of patents for COVID-19 vaccines and other intellectual property barriers, which would allow for mass production of treatments against the disease.  
70% of U.S. adults also felt that the continued spread of COVID-19 elsewhere in the world poses a substantial risk to the national economy, while nearly half (47%) felt it was a large or significant threat to them personally. 
These poll numbers come as the World Trade Organization (WTO) prepares this week to discuss a proposal which would override the monopolies held by pharmaceutical companies and allow an urgently needed scale up in the production of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines to ensure everyone in the world who needs a vaccine, regardless of how much money they have, can get one. The vast majority of low and middle income countries are supporting this proposal, but the U.S. is amongst richer countries opposing it.   
The U.S. government has already ordered more than 20 percent of the world’s supplies of vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials, enough to immunize the entire U.S. population four times over. 
“We cannot bring this pandemic to an end unless pharmaceutical companies share the knowledge, technology and intellectual property to do so. This survey shows that the American public recognizes that COVID-19 will continue to threaten the lives and livelihoods of billions of people across the world, including in the U.S., until action is taken to drastically scale up global vaccine supply,” said Joanne Lin, National Director for Advocacy and Government Affairs at Amnesty International USA.  
“No one should be blocked from getting life-saving vaccines because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket. Only by working with others to share resources and technology to scale up supply can we bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic.”  
“In the battle against COVID-19, we must always remember that COVID anywhere is COVID everywhere. We can’t end the pandemic or rebuild the economy without a vaccine that is free, fair, and available to all. Americans recognize this. In order to win against COVID, companies must share vaccine knowledge, technology, intellectual property, data and know-how to boost supply, reduce price and enhance equity,” said Niko Lusiani, Senior Advisor with Oxfam America. 
“The sharing of information and knowledge is what allowed the U.S. government and vaccine manufacturers to develop COVID-19 vaccines in record time. The legal barriers to sharing medical technology so more manufacturers can help ramp up vaccine production can easily be overcome. All that is needed is political will and cooperation,” said Peter Maybarduk, Director of Access to Medicines with Public Citizen. 
The People’s Vaccine Alliance has previously warned that many poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against COVID-19 this year unless urgent action is taken by governments and the pharmaceutical industry to make sure enough doses are produced.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I write to you today to express my serious concern about the situation of four minors – Husain Abdulrasool Salman Abdulla Husain (16), Sayed Hasan Ameen Jawad Abdulla (16), Faris Husain Habib Ahmed Salman (17) and Mohammed Jaafar Jasim Ali Abdulla (16) – who are being tried as adults before Branch Four of the High Criminal Court, a court specializing in terror-related cases. They stand charged with arson for handling (and using) Molotov cocktails on 14 February 2020 in Karrana, a village north west of the capital, Manama. They each face between two and ten years in prison. 
On 30 November 2020, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) summoned Husain Abdulrasool, interrogated him without the presence of a lawyer or a parent, and detained him. The CID referred his case to the prosecution unit for terrorism crimes. On 10 February 2021, the CID summoned the other three boys and their fathers and told them to attend court the next day. On 11 February, the court held the four boys’ first trial hearing during which three boys were formally charged and detained. All four denied the charges. Later, the CID interrogated Sayed Hasan without the presence of his lawyer or father. The court held two further hearings on 16 and 24 February. The next one is scheduled for 4 March 2021. The 4 boys remain held at the Juvenile Reform and Rehabilitation Center at Dry Dock. 
As a state party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) Bahrain is in breach of its obligations. Being under the age of 18, the four boys are children and should be treated in accordance with the principles of a child justice system. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has stated that “children… should always be dealt with in specialized child justice systems” and “treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child’s sense of dignity and worth”. 
In light of the above, I urge you to investigate the reasons why the boys have been interrogated without a lawyer or legal guardian and urge you to refer their cases to the child justice system. I call on you to treat all four boys in a manner consistent with their best interests as children and ensure that detention is used only as a measure of last resort, and for the shortest possible time; and prioritize use of alternatives to custody, throughout proceedings. 
Yours sincerely,

To Help End the Pandemic as Quickly as Possible and Restore U.S. International Cooperation, Please End Trump’s Blockade of the COVID-19 Emergency Waiver
of WTO Rules So More Vaccines and Treatment Can Be Produced 
Dear President Biden,
Congratulations on becoming President. We are encouraged by the administration’s steadfast efforts to eradicate COVID-19 and in so doing save countless lives and livelihoods. Many Americans are hopeful that your administration will improve the pace of COVID-19 vaccine production and deployment in the United States. But, that alone will not hasten the end of the global pandemic. 
We the undersigned organizations respectfully urge you to reverse a dangerous and self-defeating position taken by President Trump that threatens the prospects of ending the COVID-19 disaster. Namely, we urge your administration to lift the U.S. blockage of the “Waiver from Certain Provisions of the TRIPS Agreement for the Prevention, Containment and Treatment of COVID-19” supported by more than 100 nations at the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
With global supply limited, many people in low- and middle-income countries around the globe will not have vaccine access until at least 2022, according to the British Medical Journal. Most of the world’s poorest countries will have to wait until 2024 for mass immunization if current trends continue, reports the Economist Intelligence Unit. We are sure you agree this is unacceptable. 
Such global inequity is not only a catastrophic moral failure that will lead to needless suffering and loss of life. Ongoing outbreaks anywhere mean greater risk of new variants developing against which vaccines are not effective and/or that can evade the antibodies developed by survivors. There simply is no way to defeat the pandemic in the United States without bold action worldwide. 
The science is clear: People in developing countries need urgent access to vaccines and treatments to achieve herd immunity, just as people in the United States do. Without global action, the health crisis and resulting economic crisis here and worldwide will continue. A new International Chamber of Commerce report concluded that the current best-case scenario of wealthy nations being fully vaccinated by the middle of 2021 and poor countries largely shut out could cause economic losses exceeding $9 trillion. Nearly half of those costs would be absorbed by wealthy countries like the United States, Canada and Britain. The WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires WTO signatory countries to provide lengthy monopoly protections for medicines, tests and the technologies used to produce them. After a global campaign by public health and development groups, in 2001 the WTO issued a binding declaration about better balancing TRIPS intellectual property protections and public health needs. A temporary emergency COVID-19 waiver is in line with the WTO members’ agreement that intellectual property rules cannot create barriers to health treatments that unnecessarily cost human lives and undermine the global economy. 
Notably, governments, particularly the United States, provided billions in upfront payments, clinical trial support, and guaranteed purchase, so pharmaceutical firms did not bear risk. Many precursor technologies used in the new vaccines resulted from long-term U.S. government efforts, in collaboration with scientists in the United States and around the world. Yet now the corporations will control where and how much vaccine is made. Even as some firms holding vaccine monopolies have contracted others to manufacture, there is insufficient supply. Thus, while U.S. participation in programs like COVAX is important, unless production is quickly ramped up around the world to
meet global demand, there simply will not be enough supply for COVAX to provide countries in need. The corporate monopoly rights and resulting supply shortages also threaten access for billions of people in the developing world, to the COVID-19 treatments that are bringing down mortality rates here. The TRIPS rules limit government options to gain access to vital COVID treatments at an affordable price. 
Today, the many nations that cannot obtain the COVID-19 vaccines and treatments needed to cover their populations must attempt to negotiate the slow “product by product” and “country by country” compulsory license approach allowed under TRIPS. (And attempts to exercise these rights has led to fierce U.S. opposition in recent years, evidenced in the U.S. government’s Special 301 Report.) In contrast, the TRIPS waiver would remove a key obstacle to governments and manufacturers worldwide accessing the technology needed to invest in making COVID vaccines and treatments as rapidly as possible, in as many places as possible, for the billions who still need them. 
It is rare that one policy change can so significantly impact a global health effort that could save millions of lives. Supporting this waiver is the right thing to do in and of itself. But doing so would be not only altruistic. Ending the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as possible worldwide is also necessary to reboot the global economy on which so much of the U.S. economy relies. 
And, with so many of the world’s nations supporting this emergency waiver already, you can also help restore America’s moral and public health leadership in the world by siding with the majority to prioritize saving lives over protecting pharmaceutical corporation monopolies and profits. This new position would be widely noted, given U.S. officials’ shameful attack on the waiver at a January WTO meeting. 
We welcomed your promise “absolutely positively” to commit to sharing technology and access to any COVID-19 vaccine developed in the US, during an interview with Ady Barkan. At the time you said, “It’s the only humane thing in the world to do. It’s not only a good thing to do, it’s overwhelmingly in our interest to do it as well.” We are asking you to deliver on that promise. 
Thus, we respectfully request that you break with the unconscionable policies Trump supported and,  before the next WTO General Council meeting March 1-2, announce that the United States will no longer oppose the temporary, emergency COVID-19 WTO waiver of certain TRIPS provisions. We also request that your administration inform our trade partners that the United States will apply the same temporary, emergency waiver of the same intellectual property rules included in U.S. bilateral and regional trade agreements for COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatments.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr. Yılmaz and Mr. Uçar, 
I am writing regarding the orders of pre-trial detention issued by a court in Cağlayan Courthouse, (in Istanbul’s Sisli district), of two peaceful protestors, both students at Boğaziçi University, and the orders to hold 14 others in house arrest. The two students were detained pending trial on 30 January 2021 for allegedly ‘inciting the public to enmity and hatred’ over artwork on display in an art exhibition held at the Boğaziçi University Campus. 
Seven others – mostly students – were remanded in pre-trial detention by courts in the Anadolu Courthouse (in Istanbul’s Kartal district) between 5 and 8 February for their participation in peaceful protests in the Kadıköy district of Istanbul in support of the Boğaziçi University protestors. Thirteen others are under house arrest. 
The decisions to deprive these people of their liberty were made because of their participation in overwhelmingly peaceful protests following the appointment of Professor Melih Bulu as rector of Boğaziçi University on 1 January 2021. According to the Minister of Interior, more than 800 protestors have been taken into police custody throughout Turkey for exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression since the start of the protests on 4 January. Hundreds have been subjected to judicial controls. Law enforcement officers used unnecessary and excessive force against protestors and several detainees were allegedly subjected to ill-treatment. 
  
Amnesty International believes the unfair pre-trial detention and house arrest decisions are in violation of the Boğaziçi University protestors’ right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 
I urge you to drop all criminal investigations against all protestors for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly; request the immediate and unconditional release of all those deprived of their liberty solely for peacefully exercising their human rights, either in pre-trial detention or house arrest; and launch prompt, thorough independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of use of unlawful force and ill-treatment and bring those responsible to justice in fair trials. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Counselor, 
I am writing to express concern about the arbitrary detention of 29-year-old researcher and anthropology master’s student Ahmed Samir Santawy. Ahmed Samir Santawy was arrested on 1 February after he presented himself at the office of the National Security Agency (NSA), a specialized police force, in New Cairo, in response to a verbal summons. He was subjected to enforced disappearance until 6 February, when he was brought to the SSSP for questioning. He told the prosecutor that during this period he was held without access to his family or lawyer in three separate locations. He said he was blindfolded and punched in the head and stomach during questioning at the NSA office in the Fifth Settlement Police Station. NSA interrogators focused on his studies and involvement in an anti-government Facebook page. The prosecutor failed to order investigations into his allegations of being forcibly disappeared and beaten, and instead questioned him about this academic work and ordered his detention for 15 days pending investigations into charges of “membership in a terrorist group”, “spreading false news” and “using a social media account to spread false news” in Case No.65/2021. The SSSP based its accusations on a Facebook post deemed critical of the authorities that Ahmed Samir Santawy denied authoring, as well as a file prepared by the NSA, which Ahmed Samir Santawy and his lawyers were not allowed to review. 
Ahmed Samir Santawy is currently held at Liman Tora Prison in the south of Cairo, without access to his family or lawyers. His detention without contact with the outside world raises concerns about his health and wellbeing. He also has a history of mental health concerns, which may be exacerbated in prison particularly in the absence of adequate mental health care. I ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Ahmed Samir Santawy and open a prompt, independent, impartial, and effective investigation into his allegations of being forcibly disappeared and beaten. Pending his release, he must be granted immediate and regular access to his family and lawyers and provided with adequate health care. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Majesty, 
Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari, an 83-old Palestinian national, needs urgent medical care as his health is steadily deteriorating in the prison of Abha, Saudi Arabia. When he was arrested on 4 April 2019, he was undergoing cancer treatment, and concerns for his health have increased with the COVID-19 pandemic and risks for an older person with underlying medical conditions. Earlier this year, Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari lost partial function of his right hand and lost some of his teeth. He is currently dependent on his son, detained with him, to feed him and help him around the prison. 
In November 2020, Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari and his son, Dr. Hani al-Khudari, were transferred to Abha prison, which lacks medical specialists and the standard care required by Dr. al-Khudari. Although he has been allowed access to medical care in jail, he was denied consultation with specialist doctors to conduct check-ups and assess tumor size. The last time he had access to a specialist was three months ago in Dhahban prison. On 8 March 2020, both men were charged before the SCC with “joining a terrorist entity” – understood to be Hamas de facto authorities – as part of a mass trial of 68 individuals. Dr. al-Khudari was additionally charged with holding several leadership positions within the entity. Their trial has been marred by numerous and serious violations of their due process rights, including enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and detention, being held incommunicado and solitary confinement. 
I call on you to ensure these unfounded charges against Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari and Dr. Hani al-Khudari are dropped and that they are released. In the interim, ensure that both men are given regular access to their lawyer. Pending the dropping of charges, I call on you to urgently transfer Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari to a hospital where he is able to receive the urgent specialized medical care he needs. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Secretary Mayorkas, Acting Director Johnson, and Ms. Olavarria: 
Our organizations provide legal and medical services to and advocate for people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). We write to urge you to prioritize the implementation of a file review process, initiated by ICE, to reconsider the custody determination for every person currently in ICE custody. 
We are heartened by the early steps the Biden-Harris Administration has taken to reorient the U.S. immigration system toward a framework that embraces human rights and compassion. However, we are concerned that these policies have not yet been implemented in a meaningful or systemic way with regard to the approximately 14,000 people in ICE detention. Leaving behind the thousands who continue to suffer in detention will undermine efforts by your agencies to rebuild trust with communities and is at odds with President Biden’s stated commitment to racial equity and human rights. 
Many of our organizations provide services to countless individuals in ICE detention who do not fall within the interim enforcement priorities outlined in the January 20th memo issued by Acting Secretary Pekoske (hereinafter January 20th Pekoske Memo). Many of our clients have been detained by ICE for years. Some are at heightened risk of serious illness or death from the COVID-19 virus, face protracted separation from their young children, and/or struggle with histories of trauma while behind bars. Many had dared hope they might have a chance for freedom with the beginning of the new administration; this hope is diminishing and turning to despair. 
The January 20th Pekoske Memo called for a top-to-bottom review of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) enforcement mechanisms. Nowhere is this review more urgent than in ICE detention centers, which have been infected by abuse and corruption for decades, with medical neglect escalating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Just this past week two people have died in custody. Yet for those detained, the day-to-day has not markedly changed since the inauguration, and no meaningful process is available to escalate urgent requests for their release. Our organizations have begun renewing release requests to ICE for those clients for whom detention poses the gravest risk; these requests sit largely unanswered and in some cases have already been denied. The situation is even more dire for unrepresented individuals who lack meaningful access to email and have received no instructions as to how to renew their request for freedom. 
We urge you to immediately: 
Thousands of people remain detained because of unjust decision-making by Customs and Border Protection and ICE. Revisiting these decisions and releasing individuals to their loved ones and communities cannot wait. A file review process will require a significant commitment of resources but is feasible. The vast majority of those detained have a family member or loved one waiting to house and support them upon release. For those who do not, a network of community-based support programs and faith-based organizations stand at the ready to provide housing and services. Immigrants released from detention show up for their hearings, especially when provided legal representation; a study issued just two weeks ago by the American Immigration Council shows that over an 11-year period, 96% of all individuals with counsel appeared in court for every one of their hearings. 
We appreciate your attention to this urgent matter and request the opportunity to meet with you to discuss implementation of a file review process as soon as possible.

Dear President Maduro, 
I am dismayed to learn of the continued prosecution of civil society and humanitarian workers belonging to Azul Positivo. 
Johan León Reyes, Yordy Bermúdez, Layners Gutiérrez Díaz, Alejandro Gómez Di Maggio, Miguel Guerra Raydan, and Luis Ferrebuz are prisoners of conscience and their release from detention must be unconditional, not subject to criminal charges and restrictions to their freedom. 
Azul Positivo’s work as a humanitarian organization is admirable and much needed in Venezuela. Their work must be guaranteed, protected, and celebrated, not criminalized. 
I call upon you to ensure the immediate and unconditional end to the prosecution of all the staff of Azul Positivo and to end the harassment, prosecution, and censorship of all civil society organizations working to protect the rights of all Venezuelans. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency Prime Minister Imran Khan, 
I write to you to out of extreme concern for the life and safety of Muhammad Idris Khattak, a 56-year-old human rights defender and a former consultant with Amnesty International. Abducted by state authorities on 13 November 2019, no information about Idris’s whereabouts was shared with his family until seven months later when authorities admitted to having him in their custody. 
In the time since, few developments in his case have been shared with the public. I understand that he was granted a 20-minute meeting with his daughter, Talia Khattak, on 7 October 2020. This is the only time he has been allowed contact with his family in the time since his disappearance. It is cruel to keep him apart from his family, who still do not know his current whereabouts. 
It is distressing to see that his case will be heard in a notoriously non-transparent military court, which he should not be tried in as a civilian, according to Pakistan’s own international human rights commitments. These concerns become all the more urgent given that he may be at risk of the death penalty. 
I call upon your government to immediately disclose the whereabouts of Idris Khattak to his family, and that he is tried by an ordinary civilian court to rule on the lawfulness of his arrest or detention. He must be granted regular access to his lawyer and family immediately. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency Prime Minister Imran Khan, 
I write to you out of extreme concern for the health and safety of Professor Muhammad Ismail, who was arrested after his pre-arrest bail was canceled at an anti-terrorism court in Peshawar on 2 February 2021. 
The arrest follows heavy-handed intimidation tactics (including raids at his home), intrusive surveillance and repeated appearances in court for hearings since July 2019. Professor Ismail and his wife also remain on the country’s no-fly list, which prevents them from being united with their daughter Gulalai Ismail – who was forced to flee her home country in September 2019. It is distressing to learn that Professor Ismail is at risk of a lengthy prison sentence, as he faces trumped-charges under the draconian Anti-Terrorism Act and Electronic Crimes Act. What started as a ‘terrorism’ charge for defending his daughter online, has now become a ‘sedition’ allegation. 
I also wish to express my grave fears for the wellbeing of 66-year-old Professor Ismail, who has just recently tested positive for COVID-19. According to his family, his already ailing health has further deteriorated. Sending him to an overcrowded prison, with poor access to health facilities gravely violates his right to health. 
I call upon you to immediately and unconditionally release Professor Ismail, as he is imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising his human right to freedom of expression; immediately drop all charges against him and his family; ensure that Professor Ismail has access to adequate food, health care and prompt access to medical attention; and ensure that Professor Ismail has regular, unrestricted access to a lawyer of his choice and his family. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear President Biden: 
We are a diverse group of non-governmental organizations working at both the local and national levels, and on issues including immigrants’ rights, racial justice, and combatting anti-Muslim discrimination. We write to urge you to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, and to end indefinite military detention. 
Among a broad range of human rights violations perpetrated against predominantly Muslim communities, Guantánamo–designed specifically to evade legal constraints, and where Bush administration officials incubated torture –is the iconic example of the post-9/11 abandonment of the rule of law. Nearly eight hundred Muslim men and boys were held at Guantánamo after 2002, all but a handful without charge or trial. Forty remain, at the astronomical cost of $540 million per year, making Guantánamo the most expensive prison in the world. 
Guantánamo embodies the fact that, for nearly two decades following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States government has viewed communities of color –citizens and non-citizens alike –through a security threat lens, to devastating consequences. This is not a problem of the past. Guantánamo continues to cause escalating and profound damage to the men who still languish there, and the approach it exemplifies continues to fuel and justify bigotry, stereotyping, and stigma. Guantánamo entrenches racial divisions and racism more broadly, and risks facilitating additional rights violations. 
For example, President Trump proposed sending undocumented immigrants to Guantánamo to be held as “enemy combatants.” He further built upon the discriminatory animus, policies, and practices that Guantánamo represents through his odious Muslim Ban, each iteration of which was explicitly promulgated under the false pretense of protecting the nation from terrorism. And the Trump administration’s militarized federal response to protests against the extrajudicial killings of George Floyd and other Black people was fueled by the war-based post-9/11 security architecture and mindset that Guantánamo epitomizes. 
It is long past time for both a sea change in theUnited States’ approach to national and human security, and a meaningful reckoning with the full scope of damage that the post-9/11 approach has caused. Closing Guantánamo and ending indefinite detention of those held there is a necessary step towards those ends. We urge you to act without delay, and in a just manner that considers the harm done to the men who have been imprisoned without charge or fair trials for nearly twenty years.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Chief Public Prosecutor, 
I am writing regarding the suspected enforced disappearance of Hüseyin Galip Küçüközyiğit who was last heard of on 29 December 2020 at 3.40pm when he called his daughter Nursena Küçüközyiğit to arrange a meeting with her the next day in Kocaeli. Having tried to contact her father on numerous occasions in the following two days, the daughter reported him missing on 31 December at the local police station. 
On 4 January, Nursena Küçüközyiğit tried to also report her father’s disappearance to the Kocaeli Chief Public Prosecutor but was told they were waiting for the referral from the police. On 5 January, her lawyer petitioned the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor requesting that Hüseyin Galip Küçüközyiğit’s disappearance or abduction be investigated. On 27 January, the Kocaeli Chief Public Prosecutor ruled that there were no grounds for a prosecution. On 29 January, Nursena Küçüközyiğit was informed that a prosecutor had been assigned to the case in Ankara. 
In recent years, several men have disappeared in similar circumstances and appeared in official custody months later. Some of them described later in court the circumstances of their enforced disappearance and the torture and other ill-treatment they had been subjected to. 
I urge you to ensure a prompt, impartial and independent investigation is carried out to determine the whereabouts of Hüseyin Galip Küçüközyiğit and the circumstances of his suspected enforced disappearance; any information relating to his location and wellbeing must urgently be shared with his family. I also urge you to ensure that all those suspected of criminal responsibility are brought to justice in fair trials.

0,Fresh Evidence of Police Misuse of Tear Gas Leading to Protesters’ Deaths and Injuries – Updated Investigative Website,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/fresh-evidence-of-police-misuse-of-tear-gas-leading-to-protesters-deaths-and-injuries-updated-investigative-website/,"Amnesty International today published new evidence of the misuse of tear gas by security forces in several countries in the second half of 2020, including during protests around the election in Uganda, the Black Lives Matter movement in the USA, and in the repression of protesters in Lebanon.","Amnesty International today published new evidence of the misuse of tear gas by security forces in several countries in the second half of 2020, including during protests around the election in Uganda, the Black Lives Matter movement in the USA, and in the repression of protesters in Lebanon. 
The organization’s interactive website Tear Gas: An Investigation has now been updated to include new cases of police committing human rights violations against peaceful protesters around the world. 
Since first launching the site in June 2020, Amnesty International has verified recent incidents of tear gas misuse in several countries, including France, Guatemala, India, Mali, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia and Tunisia. 
“The ongoing misuse of tear gas by police forces around the world is reckless and dangerous, often injuring and sometimes even killing peaceful protesters,” said Patrick Wilcken, Deputy Director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Program. 
“Our updated analysis is further proof that security forces continue to misuse this less lethal weapon on a massive scale. Far too often in 2020, peaceful protesters were met with violence, including the widespread, unlawful use of tear gas, which can amount to torture or other ill-treatment in certain circumstances. 
“We are again calling on authorities worldwide to respect the right to peaceful protest, and hold to account those who used tear gas unlawfully against people exercising this right.” 
In total, the website now documents 31 events in 13 countries and territories where tear gas has been misused, with open source investigators verifying the location and date of each instance, and assessing its lawfulness. 
Misuse causing death and injury 
In Uganda, ongoing political unrest in the aftermath of the contested election has been met with an internet blackout, as well as a crackdown that has included killings, beatings and violent dispersal of opposition supporters using tear gas and rubber bullets. 
In Lebanon, protesters took to the streets following the devastating blast at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that killed at least 204 people. During the protests against the government’s response to the explosion, Lebanese security forces repeatedly used dangerous and unlawful force to attempt to control protests, including the excessive use of tear gas. 
In Nigeria, #EndSars protests broke out in October 2020, with people demanding an end to police brutality, extrajudicial executions and extortion by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian police tasked with fighting violent crime. They were met with unlawful use of force by the army and police forces, including the firing of tear gas, and at least 12 peaceful protesters were reportedly shot dead when the army opened fire on thousands of protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate. 
In dozens of cities across the USA, a range of law enforcement agencies targeted peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters with tear gas and other crowd control agents. There were similar examples of tear gas misuse during protests in Indonesia, Peru and Guatemala. 
Open source investigation 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab began researching tear gas misuse around the world from 2019, primarily through analyzing videos posted to social media platforms. 
Using open source investigation methods, the organization verified and highlighted events where tear gas has been misused. The analysis was carried out by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps, a network of students at seven universities on four continents trained in sourcing and verifying content from social media. 
The site includes a video produced with SITU Research, which analyzes the performance characteristics of tear gas, explains the inner workings of the munitions, and shows how their misuse can maim and kill. 
Amnesty International documented police abusing tear gas in multiple ways, including: firing into confined spaces; firing directly at individuals; using excessive quantities; firing at peaceful protests; and firing against groups who may be less able to flee or more susceptible to its effects, such as children, older people and people with disabilities. 
Poorly regulated trade 
Despite its widespread misuse, there are no agreed international regulations on the trade in tear gas and other chemical irritants. Few states provide public information on the quantity and destination of tear gas exports, hampering independent oversight. 
Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation have campaigned for more than two decades for greater controls on the production, trade and use of tear gas and other law enforcement equipment and weapons. As a result, the UN and regional bodies such as the EU and the Council of Europe have recognized the need to regulate the export of this equipment. 
Following high-level diplomatic advocacy by the 60+ states of the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade, supported by Amnesty International and Omega, the UN is now exploring the potential development of international trade controls on law enforcement equipment and weapons, and other goods, to prevent their use in torture, other ill-treatment and the death penalty. Amnesty International and Omega are now pressing for such measures to include tear gas and other chemical irritants.",,"February 1, 2021 • Press Release",False

Re: Domestic Human Rights Legislation to Advance in Congress in Early 2021 
  
Dear Member of Congress: 
On behalf of Amnesty International and our ten million members, activists, and supporters worldwide, I am writing to share our recommendations for domestic legislation the Judiciary Committee should advance in early 2021; we ask for your support in prioritizing and supporting these issues. 
The list of issues that follows is not exhaustive but are critical issues that can be immediately tackled by the 117th Congress. 
1. Restore a Fair Asylum System at the Border and Robust U.S. Refugee Admissions Program 
Seeking asylum and safety from armed conflict or persecution is a human right. But in recent years people, including families and children, in search of safety all around the world, including along the U.S.-Mexico border, have been punished for seeking protection. Instead of upholding its responsibilities, the U.S. has abdicated its duty to protect refugees, drastically cutting the number of refugees it will accept for resettlement and devising a series of policies to offshore them, criminalize them and those that seek to protect them, and deny them protection altogether. The U.S. government has also sought to cut programs that offer lifesaving and life-preserving humanitarian aid to displaced populations the world over. The U.S. government has a responsibility to step up and be a robust participant in offering protection for refugees and asylum-seekers and lead the way in investing in innovative solutions that protect the human rights of all displaced, persecuted, and at-risk populations. 
At the start of the 117th Congress, we are calling on the House to move with urgency to address the many damaging policies that have been enacted against refugees, migrants, and asylum-seekers, both in the U.S. and around the world, these last years. The U.S. should seek to ease pressure on countries currently hosting the greatest number of refugees by participating in equitable and predictable pathways to protection for refugees, including by expanding access to traditional resettlement, and by facilitating the successful integration of refugees in their host countries or helping to facilitate the conditions for voluntary return to refugees’ countries of origin. In addition to expanding resettlement, the U.S. should invest in other admission pathways, including humanitarian programs, family reunification, and a private sponsorship model, and expand community involvement in resettlement by robustly promoting community sponsorship through co-sponsorship programs and private sponsorship. Further, Congress should call on the President to increase the FY 2021 refugee admissions goal to at least 100,000 and provide for necessary additional funds to meet this goal. 
As a start, the House should take up and pass the Refugee Protection Act (H.R. 5210, S. 2936) which would provide for the admission and protection of refugees, asylum-seekers, and other vulnerable individuals, sets a minimum refugee admissions goal of at least 95,000, provides for in-country processing of refugees and asylum-seekers in the Northern Triangle countries, ensures due process and legal representation for asylum-seekers including unaccompanied children, and restores due process for asylum-seekers, among other provisions. We also strongly encourage the Judiciary Committee to hold public hearings at the start of the new Congress to explore how the U.S. can ensure we are fully applying the provisions of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol without discrimination, and ensuring the U.S. is doing all it can to be a robust participant in refugee protection and leading the way in investing in innovative solutions to protect the human rights of refugees, internally displaced persons, and all displaced persons worldwide. 
2. Curb immigration detention 
In recent years, the use of immigration detention has ballooned. Today, tens of thousands of immigrants, including thousands of asylum-seekers and families with children, are held in Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities throughout the country while they fight for their right to stay in the United States. Immigration detention serves as a form of punishment against people solely on the basis of their status and penalizes people who are fleeing persecution. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has ample discretion to release all people in immigration detention. Yet, disregarding the cries of detained immigrants, medical experts, and advocates, it has failed to do so. Since the onset of the pandemic, COVID-19 has spread throughout detention facilities: as of September 2020, at least seven people had died after contracting the virus in detention, and over 5,000 detained people thus far have tested positive for the virus. 
Experts have estimated that the virus is likely spreading rates much higher than DHS has publicized, a fear which has been borne out in the few facilities where ICE has engaged in mass testing: for example, in August, 90% of people detained at the privately operated ICE facility in Farmville tested positive for COVID-19. 
Both people in detention and their lawyers have shared harrowing details of ICE’s reckless endangerment of people in its custody, in violation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) standards on the prevention of COVID-19 in places of detention. ICE and its detention facilities have failed to provide detainees with sufficient soap and sanitizer or adequate social distancing. Additionally, ICE has not abided by CDC standards for quarantining and medical isolation, instead “cohorting” people presumed to be positive for the virus, a form of treatment one medical expert has likened to “COVID-19 torture.” 
As COVID-19 cases increase exponentially across the United States, detained people have launched hunger strikes in multiple ICE immigration detention facilities, demanding to be released, and have often been met with brutal repression by guards and security personnel. 
Now, ICE’s detention practices are exacerbating a crisis beyond U.S. borders: tens of thousands of people have been deported during the COVID-19 pandemic, including hundreds of people who tested positive after contracting the virus after being detained in unsafe and unsanitary US detention facilities. Deported people have reported facing exposure to the virus, rights-abusing quarantine regimes in their countries of return, and stigma. 
This public health crisis presents an opportunity for the United States to reform its practice of needless, costly, and punitive immigration detention, which has caused tremendous human suffering and has caused a crisis of contagion during the pandemic. 
We urge the swift passage of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act once reintroduced, which would make immigration detention the rare exception, not the norm, and eliminate the profit motive from immigration detention, as well as the Immigration Enforcement Moratorium Act, which would halt most enforcement activities during the pandemic and place a moratorium on deportations. 
3. Rescind All Versions of the Muslim and African Bans  
On September 24, 2017, President Trump issued the third version of his Muslim ban blocking travel to the United States from six predominantly Muslim countries, North Korea, and by certain Venezuelan officials.[1] On January 31, 2020, an additional travel ban was placed on nationals of four African countries, Myanmar, and Kazakhstan.[2] The Trump Administration’s multiple Muslim and Africa bans violate the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are an affront to human dignity. The Muslim ban is fueled by anti-Muslim sentiment and has caused direct harm to families in the U.S. and around the world, as we have documented for years. Similarly, the African ban demonizes those most at risk in the countries affected and sanctions discrimination against those fleeing conflict, torture, and who simply want to unite with their families in the United States. A fundamental principle of refugee protection is responsibility-sharing and international cooperation. Unfortunately, the U.S. government is abandoning its duty to share in its responsibility to protect refugees. Successive bans and policy changes have taken their toll, with many refugees who expected to be resettled to the U.S. stuck in a never-ending limbo of security vetting. 
Congress should immediately work to reverse policies and procedures intended to limit refugee resettlement and asylum in the United States – which violate the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other internationally recognized human rights standards – including passing legislation to rescind the Muslim, African, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans (Presidential Proclamations 9645, 9822, 9983, 9984, 9993, and 10014, and Executive Orders 13769, 13780, 13815, and 13888). In July 2020, the House passed the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (“NO BAN Act”) (H.R. 2486, formerly H.R. 2214; S. 1123 in the Senate). The bill would undo the Trump administration’s Muslim ban in place since 2017; check the President’s ability to discriminate on the basis of religion; rescind the administration’s initiatives to unlawfully limit the right to seek asylum at the U.S. border; remove impediments placed on refugees who are already subject to more vetting than any other group entering the U.S., and ensure that before any future restrictions are imposed the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) must consult with Congress. 
The NO BAN Act sends a clear message that the U.S. welcomes and protects people from all faiths and backgrounds. This legislation should be a top priority of the 117th Congress, coming right out of the gates in January 2021. 
4. Prioritize Passing Legislation to End Gun Violence and Providing Critical Funding for Programs Aimed at Ending and Preventing Gun Violence 
The U.S. has both the highest absolute and highest per capita rates of gun ownership in the world, and guns are easily accessible by those likely to misuse them. Killing an average of 109 people each day, gun violence is the second leading cause of death among children and disproportionately affects communities of color.  Yet the U.S. has failed to implement even a basic system for the regulation of firearms – with no requirements for universal background checks, licensing, and training for gun purchasers or for registration of guns. Further, it has continually failed to adequately fund violence prevention and intervention The U.S. crisis of gun violence impacts a broad range of people domestically, including women, children, communities of color, and students. 
It is time for a change: the crisis of gun violence in the U.S. and failure of the U.S. government to take effective action has resulted in the death of thousands and injuries to even more. The U.S. has an obligation under international law to ensure the rights and individual safety of people living in the country. Amnesty International USA believes that the U.S. has a duty to take positive action to address gun violence, especially where models exist that could reduce it while making a long term and lifechanging impact on systemically disenfranchised communities. 
Thus, in the 117th Congress, AIUSA renews its call on Congress take bold action to end gun violence by: 
5. Reform Policing 
In May 2020, the world came to know of George Floyd, but excessive force against and killings of Black people by law enforcement are as old as policing in the U.S. itself. Black people comprise about 13% of the US population, yet the Mapping Police Violence estimates that in 2020, Black people make up 28% of those killed by law enforcement. The video of the last moments of Mr. Floyd’s life, uttering a familiar refrain “I can’t breathe” woke up people around the world, and sparked possibly the largest protest movement in U.S. history and spurred Congress to advance policing reforms, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (JPA, H.R. 7120), passed by this committee on June 19, 2020 and the House on June 25, 2020. 
Before the introduction of the JPA, on June 1, over 400 organizations sent a letter to Congress supporting these priorities to be included in meaningful policing reform: (1) the creation of a use of force standard that allows force when necessary and as a last resort; (2) a statutory ban on chokeholds; (3) a ban on racial profiling; (4) the establishment of a publicly available police misconduct registry; (5) the inclusion of a “reckless” standard in 18 U.S.C. Section  242 that enables federal prosecutors to hold law enforcement accountable for criminal civil rights  violations; (6) a prohibition on no-knock warrants, especially in drug cases; (7) the elimination of the judge-made doctrine of qualified immunity, which allows officers and other government actors to evade accountability when they violate individuals’ civil rights; and (8) the demilitarization of law enforcement agencies. 
While H.R. 7120 from the 116th Congress makes clear improvements to the status quo, and some of the recommendations noted above were included in House-passed bill, since June 25, people continue to be killed by law enforcement in incidents that appear excessive. The bill, as is, fails to meet the needs of this moment and must better provide for meaningful transparency, accountability and recalibrate the role and scope of law enforcement in line with what historically over-policed communities need to feel safe. 
An overarching problem with the JPA as currently drafted is the amount of additional federal funding it would allocate to support law enforcement through provisions such as those that expand training, establish accreditation programs and body worn cameras grant programs, and create task forces to research “best practices.” The JPA provides hundreds of millions of additional federal dollars to state and local law enforcement agencies, including prosecutors’ offices, is particularly problematic because of its lack of significant guardrails to ensure those resources are used in the manner in which they are intended. 
These and all other additional funding provisions in the bill should be stricken. New funding in this bill not only contradicts our reasonable request to limit federal funding allocated for law enforcement and condition receipt of existing federal dollars on the adoption of the critical policies outlined in the bill. Now more than ever, it is critical that the federal government reallocate resources to provide for those programs that reduce the need for unnecessary law enforcement interactions and promote genuine public safety by improving the health and well-being of communities. 
We urge the committee to work to improve the JPA before it is reintroduction in the 117th Congress to meet all eight priorities named above and welcome the opportunity to provide feedback and input. We all want to see an end to these painful and too often unnecessary law enforcements caused fatalities and we sincerely believe that in order for that to happen, these improvements must be made. 
6. End Violence Against Native American and Alaska Native Women 
Rape and violence are committed against Native women in the United States with almost total impunity. While the available data does not accurately portray the extent of sexual violence against Native American and Alaska Native women, the U.S. Department of Justice’s own statistics indicate that Native American and Alaska Native women are more than two and a half times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than women in the United States in general and that 86% of the reported crimes are committed by non-Native men.  At least one in three Native women will be raped during her lifetime, and survivors face significant barriers to securing justice following rape or sexual violence, including inadequate police response, inadequate health and forensic services, and a lack of prosecutions. 
The federal government’s steady erosion of tribal authority and chronic underfunding of law enforcement agencies and health service providers compounds the failure to protect Native women from sexual violence. Tribal prosecutors cannot prosecute crimes committed by non-Native perpetrators. Tribal courts are also prohibited from passing custodial sentences that are in keeping with the seriousness of the crimes of rape or other forms of sexual violence. As a direct result of passage of the Tribal Law and Order Act, the maximum prison sentence tribal courts can now impose for any crimes, including rape, is three years, up from the previous maximum of one year. In comparison, the average prison sentence for rape handed down by state or federal courts is between eight years and eight months and 12 years and 10 months respectively. 
Tribal law enforcement agencies are also chronically under-funded – federal and state governments provide significantly fewer resources for law enforcement on tribal land than are provided for comparable non-Native communities. The lack of appropriate training in all police forces — federal, state and tribal — also undermines survivors’ right to justice. Survivors of sexual violence are not guaranteed access to adequate and timely sexual assault forensic examinations. As a consequence, Native women are denied justice. And the perpetrators are going unpunished. 
Current loopholes in the Violence Against Women Act mean that violent crimes against Native women and families committed by non-Native perpetrators are committed with virtual impunity.  This loophole is so widely known that the Department of Justice reports that some non-Native perpetrators flaunt the law openly, knowing that they can’t be prosecuted by local authorities. 
Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to: 
7. End the Federal Death Penalty 
The death penalty is a punishment that is error-prone, racially biased, and arbitrary; it carries irrevocable consequences and is incompatible with human rights. The US remains just one of 20 counties in the world that actively executes people. There is a growing consensus against the death penalty in the United States. Twenty-two states and Washington, DC, have repealed the death penalty as a sentencing option, and three states, California, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, have gubernatorial moratoria prohibiting executions. An additional 12 states have not carried out an execution in at least 10 years. Executions and new death sentences have both sharply declined, falling to 25 or fewer per year for each of the last five years, compared to a record high in 1999 of 98 executions. New death sentences have also fallen below 50 per year over the last five years, in comparison to the mid-1990s when 300 new death sentences were the norm. In 2019, the annual Gallup polls on the death penalty showed a record high number of people who support sentences other than the death penalty and a record low number of people who believe that this irrevocable punishment is applied fairly. 
This decline in public support stands in stark contrast to what has happened recently at the federal level, as the Trump Administration resumed executions for the first time in 17 years, in the midst of a global pandemic. In 2019, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a new lethal injection protocol, and with it, five federal execution dates were originally set to take place between 2019 and 2020. Between July 2020 and January 2021 Trump Administration carried out three time more federal executions than had been carried out by the federal government in the prior six decades. 
Today, people of color comprise 60 percent of those on federal death row, and most of those people of color are Black. Nearly half of the people on federal death row were sentenced to death in just three states: Texas, Missouri, and Virginia. The racial disparities in those jurisdictions are striking: all of the federal sentences from Virginia, all of the federal sentences from the Eastern District of Missouri, and three-quarters of the federal death sentences from Texas were imposed against people of color. Black federal defendants are still being sentenced by all white juries. Nationally, people of color have a higher risk of wrongful death sentences and executions. A majority of the 174 people who have been exonerated of all charges related to the wrongful convictions that initially put them on death row nationwide have been people of color, and most of those people are Black. 
As the federal government seeks to reimagine public safety and reject approaches that victimize communities of color and reinforce structural racism, the death penalty must be closely examined by this committee and ultimately rejected.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing about Sharif-Aminu, a 22-year-old singer. On 10 August 2020, an Upper Shari’a Court in Kano state convicted Yahaya Sharif-Aminu of blasphemy for circulating a song on WhatsApp that was considered blasphemous against Prophet Muhammad and sentenced him to death. He remains held in Kano prison. 
Yahaya Sharif-Aminu and his lawyer appealed the sentence. On 21 January, the Appeal Panel, presided by the Chief Judge of Kano State, ordered the retrial of Yahaya Sharif-Aminu’s case. The Panel ordered that the case be returned to the same Upper Shari’a Court where Yahaya Sharif-Aminu was sentenced but retried by a different judge on the basis that the defendant was not represented by a legal representative throughout his trial, adding that it was the duty of the court to ensure that he was duly and legally represented especially given the magnitude of the case. The Panel submitted that the failure of the defendant to be represented by a legal representative during the trial at the Upper Sharia Court was a clear omission which renders the proceedings of the case null. The Appeal Panel’s decision for Yahaya Sharif-Aminu to be retried provides a significant opportunity for him to be provided access to legal representation and ensure he receives a fair trial. 
Yahaya Sharif-Aminu should never have been sentenced to death in the first place. No one should be sentenced to death for freely expressing their opinions. The imposition of the death penalty following an unfair trial violates the right to life and hasty trials undermine the ability of defendants to seek effective remedies for the lack of legal representation during trial. Moreover, the use of the death penalty for blasphemy violates Nigeria’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which restricts the use of the death penalty to the “most serious crimes”. 
I request that you drop all charges against Yahaya Sharif-Aminu and ensure his immediate and unconditional release. 
Yours sincerely,

January 22, 2021 
Dr. Elizabeth Cameron
Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense
National Security Council
White House 
Dear Dr. Cameron: 
On behalf of Amnesty International (“Amnesty”) and our 10 million members, activists, and supporters worldwide, we commend President Biden’s executive actions to cease U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and to join the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (“ACT”) and the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility. While we welcome these executive actions, we urge President Biden to rescind the Trump Executive Order 13962 (Dec. 8, 2020) prioritizing shipment of the coronavirus vaccine to the U.S. population over other countries. 
In December 2020, Amnesty published a report titled A FAIR SHOT: Ensuring Universal Access to COVID-19 Diagnostics, Treatments, and Vaccines.  The report sets forth recommendations concerning the COVAX pillar, WHO Fair Allocation Framework, COVAX facility, intellectual property rights, World Trade Organization, and COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (“C-TAP”). In addition, here is my January 2021 article published on InterAction, laying out An International Human Rights Framework to COVID-19: Why We Must Prioritize Vaccine Distribution for Those Most at Risk. 
Amnesty urges the Biden administration to implement the following recommendations to ensure that the U.S. government’s response to the pandemic respects human rights: 
1. Rescind the baseless March 2020 CDC order, unsupported by science, that has resulted in over 200,000 expulsions of asylum seekers from the U.S. 
In March 2020, under the guise of public health concerns presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration issued a new policy via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), which provides for automatic expulsions of asylum seekers and accompanied children, in violation of the U.S. government’s obligations not to deport people seeking safety to places they may face grave harm. While a court has halted the expulsions of unaccompanied children, expulsions of others—including families and other asylum-seekers—continue. 
The CDC’s Division of Migration and Quarantine, led by Dr. Martin Cetron, had refused to comply with the Trump administration directive, stating there was no valid public health reason to issue it.  Former Vice-President Pence then directed then-CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield to use the agency’s emergency powers to seal the U.S. borders, overruling the CDC scientists who found there was no evidence the order would slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Consistent with President Biden’s commitment to be guided by science, the administration should immediately rescind the March 2020 order authorizing mass expulsions at the border. 
2. Support and fund global initiatives to ensure equitable distribution of COVID-19 health products 
The U.S. government has already has ordered more than 20 percent of the world’s supplies of vaccines, enough to immunize the entire U.S. population four times over. Meanwhile, 70 lower income countries may only be able to vaccinate 10 percent of their populace against COVID-19 in 2021 unless governments and the pharmaceutical industry take urgent action to produce enough doses. 
The international community cannot tackle the pandemic if lower income countries are denied access to vaccines because they cannot afford the number of doses higher income countries have secured.  Through ACT and COVAX, the Biden administration should work with the international community to ensure that distribution of COVID-19 vaccines is equitable in all regions of the world regardless of countries’ income levels. 
The administration should also assess intellectual property laws, policies, and practices to ensure that these are not a barrier to the availability and affordability of COVID-19 medical products for all people worldwide. To that end, the U.S. should join the WHO’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (“C-TAP”), a voluntary sharing platform created to foster greater collaboration around intellectual property rights, thereby increasing availability and affordability of COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines. The U.S. government should respect the spirit of the Doha Declaration on The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”) and Public Health and support the proposed World Trade Organization TRIPS waiver for COVID-19 related health products. 
In addition, the U.S. government should refrain from making bilateral agreements that may affect the global supply of a vaccine. Any public funding to companies should be conditional on terms and conditions being publicly disclosed, in line with principles of transparency and accountability. 
3. Support debt cancellation and Special Drawing Rights for lower income countries 
The economic fallout of COVID-19 has been particularly devastating for lower income countries. The 77 countries with lowest income need urgent support from the U.S. as they strive to respond to COVID-19.  In April 2020, G20 countries agreed to an eight-month repayment suspension for 76 of the world’s lowest income countries, which was later extended through April 2021. 
As the top bilateral lender to lower income countries, the U.S. should call on the G20 to cancel the debt owed by the world’s lowest income countries through the end of 2022, thereby freeing up resources for countries to respond to the pandemic.  Additionally, the U.S. government should support IMF issuance of Special Drawing Rights for economic and health mitigation efforts of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
4. Increase support to refugees and displaced peoples worldwide 
As vaccines are rolled out, governments must proactively include refugees, migrants, and displaced people in vaccination plans. The U.S. government should provide support to host countries to ensure refugees can enroll in national health insurance schemes. The U.S. government should work with the international community to ensure that all displaced persons have access to timely and accurate information and healthcare in the host nation’s public health systems. This should include people at the U.S.-Mexico border who have been expelled or turned back due to the March 2020 CDC order and U.S. border control and anti-asylum policies. 
The U.S. government should also increase financial support to international organizations working on the front lines to address the needs of refugees, migrants, and displaced persons, including ensuring that refugee camps and host countries have clean running water, adequate medical personnel, personal protective equipment, and supplies for testing, treatment, preventative measures, and vaccinations to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Through unilateral and international efforts, the U.S. government should address the need for additional shelter for refugees, migrants, and displaced persons in order to reduce density and allow for social distancing.  The U.S. government should help organizations build capacity to rapidly respond to the impacts of the pandemic on their operations if infection rates speed up, by ensuring the ability to provide additional staff, isolation units, and treatment facilities.  Finally, the U.S. government should support programs to address increased levels of gender-based violence. 
Amnesty looks forward to working with you and the NSC team on eradicating the pandemic worldwide, in a manner that respects human rights. Our experts stand ready to provide briefings on any issues outlined above. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at 202/281-0017 and [email protected].

Dear Director Gao, 
I am writing to express my concern for ethnic Kazakh Weilina Muhatai (维丽娜·木哈太) and her two sons, Muheyati Haliyoula (穆哈亚提·哈力尤拉) and Parisati Haliyoula (帕日萨提·哈力尤拉), who all went missing in August 2020. Despite attempts by family members overseas to make contact, there has been no communication with them for more than six months. 
I find it distressing to learn that no official information about their whereabouts or condition has been shared at all. Their possible detention is believed to be linked to the activism of their husband and father, who they suspect to have died in a “transformation-through-education” facility in December 2020. 
I am gravely concerned about the health and wellbeing of Weilina Muhatai, Muheyati Haliyoula and Parisati Haliyoula. With no contact having yet been made with them to date, and given the repeated allegations of torture and other ill-treatment in violation of international law in Xinjiang’s detention facilities, I believe their safety and lives are at risk. 
I call on you to release Weilina Muhatai, Muheyati Haliyoula and Parisati Haliyoula unless there is sufficient, credible and admissible evidence that they committed an internationally recognized offense and are granted a fair trial in line with international standards; and pending their release, disclose the whereabouts of Weilina Muhatai, Muheyati Haliyoula and Parisati Haliyoula and allow them access to their family and lawyers of their choices, as well as prompt and adequate medical care, as necessary or requested.

January 7, 2021 
Re:  Top International Human Rights Priorities for Congress in 2021 
  
Dear Members of Congress: 
On behalf of Amnesty International and our 10 million members, activists, and supporters worldwide, I am writing to share our international human rights priorities for 2021. At a December 9 House Foreign Affairs (“HFAC”) Subcommittee hearing, I testified about three disturbing global human rights trends: (1) internet shutdowns and restrictions; (2) Big Tech complicity in censorship and repression on an industrial scale; and (3) growing government attacks on civil society and NGOs including Amnesty International sections in Hungary, Turkey, and India. Here is the link to my written testimony submitted for the HFAC hearing on “International Human Rights and the Closing Civic Space” on December 9. 
While this letter highlights Amnesty International’s topline priorities for 2021, the full suite of Amnesty International’s 80 policy recommendations for the incoming Biden administration can be found here: https://bidenhumanrightspriorities.amnestyusa.org/. Our policy briefs address the spectrum of international and domestic human rights—organized by thematic area, region of the world, and country.  
Senators should advise all Presidential appointees (for leadership posts in the Department of State, Department of Defense, USAID, and USUN) to meet regularly and work closely with human rights defenders (“HRDs”) and civil society leaders. U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, prior to their deployment, should meet with U.S.-based human rights advocates with expertise in the relevant country, region, or thematic area. In addition, U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, once relocated to their post, should meet frequently, and work closely with, HRDs, civil society, and journalists in their assigned country or region. 
2a.  Rescind all the Muslim, Africa, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans 
The Trump Administration’s multiple Muslim, Africa, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans violate the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) and other internationally recognized standards. Congress should immediately reverse policies and procedures that limit refugee resettlement and asylum in the U.S. by passing legislation to rescind the Muslim, African, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans (Presidential Proclamations 9645, 9822, 9983, 9984, 9993, and 10014, and Executive Orders 13769, 13780, 13815, and 13888). 
In July 2020, the House passed the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (“NO BAN Act”) (H.R. 2486, formerly H.R. 2214; S. 1123 in the Senate). The bill would undo the Trump administration’s Muslim ban in place since 2017; check any President’s ability to discriminate on the basis of religion; rescind initiatives to unlawfully limit the right to seek asylum at the U.S. border; remove impediments placed on refugees who are already subject to more vetting than any other group entering the U.S., and ensure that the Department of State (“DOS”) and Department of Homeland Security must consult with Congress. The NO BAN Act sends a clear message that the U.S. welcomes and protects people from all faiths and backgrounds. 
2b.  Protect international human rights amidst COVID-19 pandemic 
While the end of 2020 brought most welcome news on the COVID-19 vaccine front, it is essential that Congress and the incoming Biden administration apply and implement an international human rights approach to the pandemic, by prioritizing vaccine distribution for those most at risk, including in lower-income nations. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we are only as safe as those of us who are most at-risk, and we will not be completely safe until those individuals most at-risk are vaccinated. Under international human rights law, wealthier states have a special responsibility to assist nations with fewer resources. But some governments, notably the current U.S. administration, have adopted a “me first” approach that could undermine the efficacy of a vaccine. 
Even though the U.S. population is just 4 percent of the global population, the U.S. government has ordered more than 20 percent of the world’s supplies of vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials, enough to immunize the entire U.S. population four times over. Wealthy nations, representing just 14 percent of the global population, have already bought up more than half of future vaccine supplies. 
As of November 2020, more than 80 percent of the planned 2021 supply of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines have already been purchased by rich countries, putting a strain on emerging economies’ ability even to acquire immunization. According to Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) Director-General, “The worst possible outcome is you’re offering vaccines to a whole country’s population before we’re able to offer it to the highest-risk ones in other countries.” Many low-income countries may not obtain enough vaccines to fully immunize their populations before 2024. 
To ensure equitable access to the vaccine with prioritization given to those most at risk, the incoming Biden administration should immediately rejoin the WHO and support global initiatives that aim to ensure fair vaccine access for all countries, such as the WHO’s COVAX pillar. 
Beyond COVID-19 vaccine access, leaders around the world have used the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to arrest critics, intensify surveillance, seize emergency powers, and discriminate against marginalized populations. Congress should take up and quickly pass the bipartisan Protecting Human Rights During Pandemic Act (“PHRDPA”) (S. 3819, H.R. 6986), introduced in June 2020. The House Foreign Affairs Committee marked up and approved H.R. 6986 in September 2020, but the Senate failed to advance S.3819. 
The PHRDPA would require DOS and USAID to outline a five-year strategy to address persistent issues related to internationally recognized human rights in the context of the COVID-19 response and authorize the establishment of foreign assistance programs designed specifically to support civil society organizations and human rights defenders in countries where the abuse of emergency measures has resulted in the violation of human rights. The bill would also prohibit, subject to a waiver in extraordinary circumstances, the U.S. government from providing security sector assistance to countries engaging in a “consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights” by way of “emergency laws, policies, or administrative procedures.” 
2c.  Pass bipartisan Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) 
Amnesty International has repeatedly found evidence that U.S.-made munitions have been used by Saudi Arabia and UAE-led Coalition (“coalition”) forces to target Yemeni civilians. Amnesty has documented 36 coalition airstrikes across six different governorates that appear to have violated international law. These airstrikes have claimed more than 500 civilian lives and appear to have deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, markets, and mosques. 
Although European countries have suspended arms transfers to the coalition, the U.S. government continues to provide the coalition with military support and arms sales. The U.S. government, therefore, has been complicit in the coalition’s violations in Yemen, some of which amount to war crimes. 
In 2019 the Trump administration pushed through emergency arms sales to Saudi Arabia, even over strong bipartisan, bicameral opposition. In an effort to block the arms sales to the coalition, Congress passed three resolutions, all vetoed by the President (Congress failed to meet the super-majority threshold required to overturn a Presidential veto). 
Congress should swiftly introduce and pass a companion bill to the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) to block all future arms sales to the Saudi Arabia-UAE-led coalition. 
2d.  Halt Myanmar’s atrocities against Rohingya and other minorities 
In August 2017 Myanmar security forces, led by the Myanmar Army, attacked the Rohingya in villages across northern Rakhine State, driving more than 740,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces carried out a relentless and systematic campaign, killing at least 10,000 Rohingya including children; raping hundreds of Rohingya women and girls; torturing Rohingya men and boys in detention sites; and burning hundreds of villages in a targeted and deliberate manner. Today more than 54 percent of the Rohingya who had previously lived in northern Rakhine State are now living in mass refugee camps in Bangladesh. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees live in threadbare camps in Cox’s Bazar. 
In response to these crimes against humanity, the House in 2019 passed the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act (H.R. 3190) and Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (H.R. 2327). These bills would apply much needed pressure against Myanmar authorities to halt atrocities against the Rohingya. H.R. 3190 would hold senior Myanmar military officials accountable for human rights abuses, while H.R. 2327 would direct DOS to assist civil society organizations in Myanmar working to free prisoners of conscience. Although the House passed both bills in 2019, the bills have languished in the Senate without a vote. 
Congress should take up these bills and quickly pass them in 2021, in order to hold those responsible for these atrocities and to ensure continuing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya in Bangladesh and Myanmar. 
2e.  Permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule and Helms Amendment 
U.S. foreign policies like the Global Gag Rule (also known as the Mexico City Policy) and the Helms Amendment harm the health and other human rights of millions by restricting women and girls, especially those living in developing countries, from accessing safe abortion services. The Helms amendment restricts U.S. foreign aid from going toward abortion services, and the Global Gag Rule prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations that receive U.S. foreign aid from using their own money to educate their communities on safe abortion services, advocate for safer abortion laws, or provide abortion services. 
The Helms amendment and Global Gag Rule do not reduce abortion rates; they simply make abortion unsafe. Unsafe abortion is responsible for 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide and represents one of the four major causes of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity. Abortion rates have been shown to increase when the Global Gag Rule is in place, and people lose access to sexual and reproductive health education and services. 
In 2021 Congress should quickly take up and approve the Global HER Act (S.368, H.R.1055), which would permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule, and a companion bill to the Abortion Is Health Care Everywhere Act (H.R.7816), which would repeal the Helms amendment. 
2f.  Support police reform in Nigeria 
Beginning in October 2020, protests in Nigeria demanded the government implement genuine, comprehensive police reform. While the demands initially focused on the Special Anti-Robbery (“SARS”) police unit, protestors are also calling for accountability for grave human rights violations committed by the SARS and other police units; access to SARS and other police detention centers; the review of the use of force and firearms by security agents to bring them in line with international standards; independent investigation into all cases of violence against protesters; respect and protection for the rights to peaceful protest, including the immediate release of all protesters held merely on grounds of their support of or participation in #EndSARS protests. 
Congress should introduce and pass the resolution Supporting the #EndSARS peaceful protest movement in Nigeria (H.Res.1216). 
2g.  Protect human rights in Ethiopia 
Armed conflict between the federal government of Ethiopia and the regional government of Tigray erupted in November 2020. Amnesty International has received reports of massacres being committed, including one on November 9 that resulted in the deaths of several hundred people. The federal government also reportedly stripped Tigrayan members of parliament of immunity and has detained them. 
Congress should introduce and pass the resolution Supporting respect for human rights and encouraging continued democratic progress in Ethiopia, and for other purposes (H.Res.1183). 
2h.   Lift restrictions on transferring detainees out of Guantánamo Bay 
The U.S. government opened the detention center at Guantánamo Bay in 2002 to house people outside the reach of the law after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, 780 men have been detained at Guantánamo prison. Eighteen years after its opening, 40 detainees remain imprisoned there indefinitely. Most have never been charged with a crime. Five have been cleared for release from Guantánamo prison for years by all relevant national security agencies, yet still remain imprisoned. The few charged have not received fair trials. The prison is not equipped to provide adequate medical care to these aging detainees, many of whom have serious underlying medical conditions, some of them created or exacerbated by U.S.-sponsored torture and ill-treatment. 
The Guantánamo prison costs more than $540 million per year to maintain for 40 prisoners and denies them their rights to due process and humane treatment. Other suspects accused of committing or attempting violence are routinely safely housed in federal detention centers on U.S. soil. They are also routinely tried in U.S. courts. 
One of the challenges President Obama faced in closing the Guantánamo prison was the restrictions placed by Congress on transferring detainees to the U.S., including for trial or medical treatment. Lawmakers should support amending the National Defense Authorization Act to remove the current restrictions (sec. 1043) that make it impossible to transfer Guantánamo detainees to the U.S. 
Amnesty International’s experts in the U.S. and around the world stand ready to work with Congress on any of these human rights issues. We look forward to working with you to protect and advance human rights around the world in 2021 and beyond. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 202/281-0017 or [email protected].

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Counselor, 
Ibrahim Ezz el-Din, a human rights researcher, detained arbitrarily since June 2019 appeared before the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) on 2 January 2021, just five days after the Cairo Criminal Court ordered his release on probation in case No. 488/2019. He is now under investigations in a new case (No. 1018/2020) over similar baseless charges of “belonging to a terrorist group”. Proceedings against Ibrahim were unfair as he was not granted the right to effectively challenge the legality of his detention or the right to adequate defense. Ibrahim’s lawyers were present, but they were not allowed to examine the case files including a report prepared by the National Security Agency (NSA), a specialized police force, that was used as the only evidence against him. The SSSP ordered his detention in the new case for 15 days. 
After the Cairo Criminal Court ordered Ibrahim’s release on probation on 27 December 2020, he was transferred to the Samanoud police station in the governorate of his residence – a procedure that generally precedes release. Ibrahim remained in detention waiting NSA clearance, but instead he was taken for questioning to the SSSP. 
According to informed sources, Ibrahim suffers from an inflammation in his lower back, chronic allergies, and a fungal infection of the tongue due to poor conditions of detention. According to medical professionals familiar with his case, the torture he endured while forcibly disappeared for 167 days from 11 June until 26 November 2019, in addition to the denial of adequate medical care by the Tora Investigation Prison authorities, might have triggered his depression. Ibrahim attempted suicide twice in 2020. 
Amnesty International considers Ibrahim Ezz el-Din to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for his peaceful human rights work. I urge you to release Ibrahim Ezz El-Din immediately and unconditionally given that his detention stems solely from his peaceful human rights work. I call on you to ensure that, pending his release, he has access to adequate health care, including psychiatric services if needed. I also urge you to open an investigation into his enforced disappearance and the torture to which he has been subjected and bring all those responsible to justice in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear President Xi, 
I am writing to express grave concern about citizen journalist Zhang Zhan (张展), who was sentenced to four years’ imprisonment by the Pudong New District People’s Court on 28 December 2020 for “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” (寻衅滋事罪). Zhang Zhan has been arbitrarily detained since May 2020 and has now been found guilty simply for exercising her rights to freedom of opinion and expression. Zhang Zhan travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the COVID-19 outbreak there. She reported detention of independent reporters, as well as the harassment of victims’ family members. After her detention, she chose to carry out a hunger strike to protest her detention and assert her innocence. As a result, the detention center authorities reportedly force-fed her against her will and made her wear leg shackles and hand restraints 24 hours a day for more than three months. Instead of respecting Zhang Zhan’s right to express her opinion and her choice to be on hunger strike, the detention center authorities punished her in a manner that violated the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, going against China’s obligations under international human rights law. 
Zhang Zhan is a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression when she reported about COVID-19. Although Zhang Zhan resumed eating on 28 December to avoid further punishment, I remain extremely concerned about her health and well-being, as well as the risk that she might again be subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in detention. 
I call on you to release Zhang Zhan immediately and unconditionally, unless there is sufficient, credible and admissible evidence that she has committed an internationally recognized offense; pending her release, ensure that Zhang Zhan has regular, unrestricted access to her family and lawyers of her choice and is not subjected further to torture; and respect Zhang Zhan’s right to health, autonomy and expression, and ensure that she has prompt and regular access to medical attention and health care. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Minister, 
I am writing to you regarding the serious allegations of torture and other ill-treatment that Mehmet Sıddık Meşe was subjected to on 1 December 2020. Mehmet Sıddık Meşe is currently held on remand in Diyarbakir T Type prison No. 3 on fraud charges. According to the testimony he provided to his lawyer, on the morning of 1 December, he was taken from the prison dormitory by four prison guards into a separate area dubbed the ‘Aquarium’ where he was beaten with wooden batons under his feet (bastinado – falaka) as well as all over his face and body by at least four guards for about 40 minutes. 
Mehmet Sıddık Meşe’s lawyer saw him on 2 December and could verify that his face was completely bruised and swollen, both his eyes were blood shot and his feet were entirely bruised. Mehmet Sıddık Meşe complained about dizziness and pain on his feet and back. He was not taken into a hospital for an independent forensic medical examination and the prison doctor’s examination report concluded that he had not been beaten. An investigation following a criminal complaint by his lawyer was eventually launched on 3 December. The prosecutor responsible for prisons interviewed Mehmet Sıddık Meşe on 8 December via video conference in the absence of his lawyer despite the request of the lawyer to be present. According to his lawyer, the camera footage of the prison in the investigation file was incomplete, only displaying a two-minute period. The prison prosecutor refused to process the request made as part of their criminal complaint to take Mehmet Sıddık Meşe to a hospital for examination in line with the Istanbul Protocol, which sets out guidelines for effective legal and medical investigations. The prison prosecutor made a decision not to prosecute on 9 December on the grounds of lack of evidence. 
I call on you to ensure that Mehmet Sıddık Meşe has urgent access to adequate medical care and is examined by independent forensic medical staff; and that a new prompt, independent and impartial investigation into the allegations of torture and ill-treatment is launched and all those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr Khitryk, 
I am writing to express my grave concern for the health of taxi driver, Viachaslau Rahashchuk, who is currently remanded in the pretrial detention center No. 6 and is suffering from serious health conditions which are the result of torture and other ill-treatment and require immediate hospitalization. 
Viachaslau Rahashchuk was violently and arbitrarily arrested by at least five police officers in Pinsk on the evening of 10 August while walking with his sister and her 12-year-old son. Protests in the town were continuing following mass allegations of electoral fraud and the previous day’s official announcement of the election results. He has committed no crime and his arrest and detention are arbitrary. He has been charged under Article 293 Part 1 of the Belarusian Criminal Code (mass riots) which carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years. On 11 August, one of Viachaslau Rahashchuk’s former cellmates contacted his mother and told her that Viachaslau Rahashchuk had been very badly beaten by prison officers. He said Viachaslau Rahashchuk had a hematoma behind his ear, three cuts to his head and bruises all over his spine. He also described there being pools of blood in the corridors from all those who were beaten. 
Since then, Viachaslau Rahashchuk has had a continuous ringing in his head. When his family asked for him to be sent for a head-scan they were told by a medic at the detention center that he is fine and to keep sending him medication to help with his symptoms. According to recent credible reports, Viachaslau Rahashchuk has been losing consciousness for up to twenty minutes at a time and has developed a tumor on the left side of his ribcage. The continued requests from his family for him to be examined by an independent doctor have been denied, and he is not receiving the medical treatment he urgently requires. 
I urge you to immediately transfer Viachaslau Rahashchuk to a hospital with adequate medical facilities to assess and treat his deteriorating health condition; and take any steps within your powers to ensure that Viachaslau Rahashchuk is not returned to pre-trial detention but is released immediately and unconditionally as he has committed no crime and—like thousands of others in Belarus since 9 August—has been detained arbitrarily. 
Yours sincerely,

Re: International Human Rights Priorities for 2021 
Dear Chair Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, and Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee: 
On behalf of Amnesty International and our 10 million members, activists, and supporters worldwide, I am writing to share our international human rights priorities for 2021. As the country emerges from the presidential election, the House Foreign Affairs Committee (“HFAC”) can and should use this opportunity to chart out a bipartisan foreign policy agenda that places human rights front and center—and in the process, model for Congress and the country how to find common ground, bring people back together, and advance human rights for all. 
While this letter highlights Amnesty International’s topline priorities for 2021, the full suite of Amnesty International’s 80 policy recommendations for the incoming administration can be found here: https://bidenhumanrightspriorities.amnestyusa.org/. Our policy briefs address the spectrum of international human rights—organized by thematic area, region of the world, and country. 
To start off, HFAC should honor and promote Human Rights Day by issuing a joint bipartisan statement that signals a bold, transformational approach to human rights. The statement should marry the fight for human rights abroad with the fight for human rights at home. Centered on the right to peaceful protest and restricting police use of force, the statement should lift up the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The statement should make connections between U.S. protest movements and protest movements in Nigeria, Belarus, Hong Kong, Thailand, Lebanon, Chile, and elsewhere. The statement should weave together the movements to root out systemic racism in the U.S. with movements to end political corruption, economic inequality, killings by security forces, and climate change worldwide. The statement should affirm the full spectrum of rights grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) and should highlight the critical role of human rights defenders (“HRDs”) and civil society. 
The statement should urge the incoming administration to rejoin the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the Paris Climate Accords, and to reverse International Criminal Court (“ICC”) sanctions. Finally, the statement should urge the President-elect to organize a 2021 global forum at the United Nations (“UN”) or State Department (“DOS”) that promotes the full spectrum of human rights and prominently features HRDs and civil society leaders from around the world. 
Members of the HFAC should encourage all Presidential appointees to meet regularly, and work closely, with human rights advocates and civil society leaders. U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, prior to their deployment, should meet with U.S.-based human rights advocates with expertise in the relevant country, region, or thematic area. In addition, U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, once relocated to their post, should meet frequently, and work closely with, HRDs, civil society, and journalists in their assigned country or region. 
The Trump Administration’s multiple Muslim, Africa, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans violate the rights enshrined in the UDHR and other internationally recognized standards. Congress should immediately reverse policies and procedures that limit refugee resettlement and asylum in the U.S. by passing legislation to rescind the Muslim, African, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans (Presidential Proclamations 9645, 9822, 9983, 9984, 9993, and 10014, and Executive Orders 13769, 13780, 13815, and 13888). 
In July 2020 the House passed the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (“NO BAN Act”) (H.R. 2486, formerly H.R. 2214; S. 1123 in the Senate). The bill would undo the Trump administration’s Muslim ban in place since 2017; check any President’s ability to discriminate on the basis of religion; rescind initiatives to unlawfully limit the right to seek asylum at the U.S. border; remove impediments placed on refugees who are already subject to more vetting than any other group entering the U.S., and ensure that DOS and Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) must consult with Congress. The NO BAN Act sends a clear message that the U.S. welcomes and protects people from all faiths and backgrounds. 
Leaders around the world have used the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to arrest critics, intensify surveillance, seize emergency powers, and discriminate against marginalized populations. The bipartisan Protecting Human Rights During Pandemic Act (“PHRDPA”) (S. 3819, H.R. 6986) was introduced in both chambers in June 2020. In late September 2020 the House Foreign Affairs Committee marked up and approved H.R. 6986. The Senate has yet to take up its companion bill. 
The PHRDPA would require DOS and USAID to outline a five-year strategy to address persistent issues related to internationally recognized human rights in the context of the COVID-19 response and authorize the establishment of foreign assistance programs designed specifically to support civil society organizations and human rights defenders in countries where the abuse of emergency measures has resulted in the violation of human rights. The bill would also prohibit, subject to a waiver in extraordinary circumstances, the U.S. government from providing security sector assistance to countries engaging in a “consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights” by way of “emergency laws, policies, or administrative procedures.” 
Amnesty International has repeatedly found evidence that U.S.-made munitions have been used by Saudi Arabia and UAE-led Coalition (“coalition”) forces to target Yemeni civilians. Amnesty has documented 36 coalition airstrikes across six different governorates that appear to have violated international law. These airstrikes have claimed more than 500 civilian lives and appear to have deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, markets, and mosques. 
Although European countries have suspended arms transfers to the coalition, the U.S. government continues to provide the coalition with military support and arms sales. The U.S. government, therefore, has been complicit in the coalition’s violations in Yemen, some of which amount to war crimes. 
In 2019 the Trump administration pushed through emergency arms sales to Saudi Arabia, even over strong bipartisan, bicameral opposition. In an effort to block the arms sales to the coalition, Congress passed three resolutions, all vetoed by the President (Congress failed to meet the super-majority threshold required to overturn a Presidential veto). 
The new House should introduce and pass a companion bill to the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) to block all future arms sales to the Saudi Arabia-UAE-led coalition. 
In August 2017 Myanmar security forces, led by the Myanmar Army, attacked the Rohingya in villages across northern Rakhine State, driving more than 740,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces carried out a relentless and systematic campaign, killing at least 10,000 Rohingya including children; raping hundreds of Rohingya women and girls; torturing Rohingya men and boys in detention sites; and burning hundreds of villages in a targeted and deliberate manner. Today more than 54 percent of the Rohingya who had previously lived in northern Rakhine State are now living in mass refugee camps in Bangladesh. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees live in threadbare camps in Cox’s Bazar. 
In response to these crimes against humanity, the House in 2019 passed the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act (H.R. 3190) and Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (H.R. 2327). These bills would apply much needed pressure against Myanmar authorities to halt atrocities against the Rohingya. H.R. 3190 would hold senior Myanmar military officials accountable for human rights abuses, while H.R. 2327 would direct DOS to assist civil society organizations in Myanmar working to free prisoners of conscience. Although the House passed both bills in 2019, the bills have languished in the Senate without a vote. 
Congress should take up these bills and quickly pass them in 2021, in order to hold those responsible for these atrocities and to ensure continuing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya in Bangladesh and Myanmar. 
U.S. foreign policies like the Global Gag Rule (also known as the Mexico City Policy) and the Helms Amendment harm the health and other human rights of millions by restricting women and girls, especially those living in developing countries, from accessing safe abortion services. The Helms amendment restricts U.S. foreign aid from going toward abortion services, and the Global Gag Rule prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations that receive U.S. foreign aid from using their own money to educate their communities on safe abortion services, advocate for safer abortion laws, or provide abortion services. 
The Helms amendment and Global Gag Rule do not reduce abortion rates; they simply make abortion unsafe. Unsafe abortion is responsible for 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide and represents one of the four major causes of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity. Abortion rates have been shown to increase when the Global Gag Rule is in place, and people lose access to sexual and reproductive health education and services. 
In 2021, HFAC should quickly take up and approve the Global HER Act (S.368, H.R.1055), whih would permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule, and a companion bill to the Abortion Is Health Care Everywhere Act (H.R.7816), which would repeal the Helms amendment. 
The U.S. government opened the detention center at Guantánamo Bay in 2002 to house people outside the reach of the law after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, 780 men have been detained at Guantánamo prison. Eighteen years after its opening, 40 detainees remain imprisoned there indefinitely. Most have never been charged with a crime. Five have been cleared for release from Guantánamo prison for years by all relevant national security agencies, yet still remain imprisoned. The few charged have not received fair trials. The prison is not equipped to provide adequate medical care to these aging detainees, many of whom have serious underlying medical conditions, some of them created or exacerbated by U.S.-sponsored torture and ill-treatment. 
The Guantánamo prison costs more than $540 million per year to maintain for 40 prisoners and denies them their rights to due process and humane treatment. Other suspects accused of committing or attempting violence are routinely safely housed in federal detention centers on U.S. soil. They are also routinely tried in U.S. courts. 
One of the challenges President Obama faced in closing the Guantánamo prison was the restrictions placed by Congress on transferring detainees to the U.S., including for trial or medical treatment. HFAC should support amending the National Defense Authorization Act to remove the current restrictions (sec. 1043) that make it impossible to transfer Guantánamo detainees to the U.S. 
Beginning in October, nationwide protests in Nigeria demanded the government implement genuine, comprehensive police reform. While the demands initially focused on the Special Anti-Robbery (“SARS”) police unit, protestors are also calling for accountability for grave human rights violations committed by the SARS and other police units; access to SARS and other police detention centers; the review of the use of force and firearms by security agents to bring them in line with international standards; independent investigation into all cases of violence against protesters; respect and protection for the rights to peaceful protest, including the immediate release of all protesters held merely on grounds of their support of or participation in #EndSARS protests. 
The United States is a critical ally of Nigeria and provides the country with significant security assistance. The House must continue to play a role in supporting nonviolent efforts to improve policing and respect for human rights in Nigeria by passing the resolution Supporting the #EndSARS peaceful protest movement in Nigeria (H.Res.1216). 
Armed conflict between the federal government of Ethiopia and the regional government of Tigray erupted on November 4. In just a matter of days, over 27,000 Ethiopians fled to Sudan where there is extremely limited capacity to receive and host refugees. There have been confirmed reports of missiles being used to hit targets in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, and in the Ethiopian state of Amhara. Amnesty International and other human rights groups have received reports of massacres being committed, including one on November 9 that resulted in the deaths of several hundred people. The Federal government also reportedly stripped Tigrayan members of parliament of immunity and has detained them. 
The United States will have to play a role in assembling international and regional pressure to ensure human rights are respected and protected by all actors in order to prevent Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region from being dangerously destabilized. This must include providing humanitarian support to Sudan and any other countries hosting Ethiopian refugees. At the same time, the Ethiopian government must not be allowed to trample human rights and renege on key human rights reforms that are essential to building trust in national institutions and the government’s commitment to the rule of law. The House can play a critical role in this effort by passing the resolution Supporting respect for human rights and encouraging continued democratic progress in Ethiopia, and for other purposes (H.Res.1183). 
Foreign governments need to immediately investigate and promptly prosecute those found responsible for the killing of HRDs, including the intellectual authors behind such crimes. The US government should also call on foreign governments to repeal any legislation or practices that criminalizes or restricts the work of HRDs, like in India, Turkey, China, Guatemala, and Russia. Amnesty also calls on foreign governments to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience around the world, and to fully, impartially, and promptly investigate any allegations of torture or other ill-treatment of POCs, and that those found responsible be held accountable.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Highness, 
The health of opposition leader, Hassan Mshaima, 72, has alarmingly deteriorated over the past two months. He is a diabetic and former cancer patient, and suffers from other chronic illnesses, including heart disease. On 19 October 2020, the Jaw Prison authorities transferred him to the Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) hospital as he was suffering from extremely high blood pressure and difficulty breathing. He was told that he needed to be seen by a specialist for his diabetes and his high blood pressure, but no appointment was made. His health further deteriorated, and he was again rushed to the hospital on 10 November 2020 but was returned to prison about six hours later. Hassan Mshaima told his son that the doctors suspected that he had suffered a stroke. On 15 November, he was seen by a cardiologist who prescribed him medication. 
On 13 November 2020, the Ministry of Interior stated that he was receiving all his rights, including full healthcare. However, as a former cancer patient, Hassan Mshaima requires regular check-ups such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans every six months. His last PET was in October 2019. He also hasn’t been seen by an endocrinologist for his diabetes for over four years. 
Hassan Mshaima was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2011 after an unfair trial for leading widespread peaceful anti-government protests. In the same case, 12 other opposition activists received sentences ranging from five years to life imprisonment. Two of them have since been released. 
I call on you to release Hassan Mshaima immediately and unconditionally as he is a prisoner of conscience convicted solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and assembly, and his advanced age and health issues put him at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. In the meantime, I urge you to provide him with access to adequate healthcare, including prescribed medication and regular check-ups. 
Yours sincerely,

Dear Counselor, 
Human rights lawyer, Hoda Abdelmoinem, has been arbitrarily detained for over two years, solely in relation to her human rights work. On 27 October 2020, the Cairo Criminal Court renewed her detention for 45 days pending investigations into unfounded “terrorism” related charges. Hoda Abdelmoinem’s pre-trial detention has exceeded the limit of two years permissible under Egyptian law. 
Officials at the al-Qanater Prison for women, where she is held, have denied Hoda Abdelmoinem a single prison visit or other contact with her family since her detention on 1 November 2018. On 30 November 2020, her relatives learned that she was transferred to an external hospital after suffering from severe pain. While her loved ones have been denied access to her medical records and therefore are kept in the dark about her exact medical condition, they were informed by other prisoners’ families that one of her kidneys had failed, while the other was functioning poorly. On 1 December 2020, the Ministry of Interior claimed in a Facebook post that she had received adequate medical care and that her condition was stable. Hoda Abdelmonein, who has high blood pressure, was hospitalized earlier this year after suffering a heart attack. The prison administration denied Hoda Abdelmonein’s lawyers verbal request to access her medical records. 
Hoda’s daughter told Amnesty International that relatives called the prison administration three times following the resumption of prison visits, suspended between March and August 2020 to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and were given verbal authorization to visit on 12 September 2020. When they arrived at the scheduled time, they were told the visit was canceled. Her relatives last saw her during her court hearing on 27 October 2020. A judge at Cairo Criminal Court allowed them to speak to her face to face without bars for about two minutes for only the second time since her arrest. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Hoda Abdelmoniem and drop all charges against her as her detention stems solely from her human rights work. Pending her release, I also call on you to ensure that Hoda Abdelmoniem is provided with the means to regularly communicate with her family and lawyers and has regular access to adequate health care and her medical records and for her family to be provided with detailed information about her health condition.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr. Upuldeniya, 
I’m writing to express my grave concern for the life of detained former Director of the Criminal Investigations Department, Gnendra Shani Abeysekara, who has recently tested positive for COVID-19 while in custody. It is distressing to learn that he was transferred to the Gallella military-run treatment facility against his will, without informing his family of his situation or whereabouts. I am worried that he is not receiving the care he requires, given his medical history. 
Already suffering from several serious health issues, including severe diabetes and heart disease, Mr. Abeysekara’s vulnerability to the health risks of COVID-19 is heightened. Latest reports suggest that he was transferred to the Infectious Diseases Hospital on 27 November. He must be immediately given access to medical care at a hospital. I am further concerned for his safety, as his family believes he is being targeted for exposing human rights violations implicating top politicians. This issue is only compounded by the fact that his family and independent human rights observers have been denied access to him. I urge you to provide access to independent monitors, such as the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka, so that they may assess Mr Abeysekara’s condition. Failing to provide adequate medical care to prisoners is a violation of Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations. As a state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Sri Lanka is legally obliged to respect, promote, protect and fulfill “the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.” Adequate healthcare and safety of prisoners must be guaranteed at all times. 
I urge you to ensure that Shani Abeysekara is granted prompt, regular and quality access to medical care at a hospital, and that he is given unrestricted access to his family members and independent monitors regularly. If contact visits are restricted due to COVID-19 preventive measures, they must be replaced with other means of contact. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Mr. Karanik, 
I am deeply concerned about the relentless harassment of Volha Vialichka in retaliation for her criticism of the authorities, targeting her and her family, but also the Hrodna children’s hospice of which she is the director. The hospice currently provides essential care that is not available anywhere else in Hrodna, including habilitative, psychological and social care, to 70 terminally ill children as well as crucial support to their parents. Volha Vialichka volunteered as an independent observer for the 9 August presidential elections. On 9 September Volha Vialichka was arrested while fundraising at a street charity event and spent 24 hours in detention. Shortly after, representatives from the school of her 14-year-old son requested to meet Volha Vialichka over their concerns about “family wellbeing” and Volha Vialichka’s son’s “home environment”. On 15 October, Volha Vialichka was fined for participating in the charity event under Part 1 of the article 23.34 of the Administrative Code of the Republic of Belarus. 
Since September, the children’s hospice that Volha Vialichka is the director of, has also become a target. The hospice has been operating successfully and has fulfilled its financial obligations since 2008, and in March 2020 it went through a successful financial audit. Currently, the hospice’s operations have been halted in two of the three premises it uses. Since 29 September, the hospice’s staff have been banned from entering the premises of a state-run factory where they rented rooms to run a volunteer center. To date, the hospice staff have been unable to collect hospice property from the factory building that includes important medical equipment and documentation. On 22 October, the state-run Children’s Hospital No. 2 unexpectedly notified Volha Vialichka that the rental agreement for a number of rooms the hospice used to provide care to the children was being terminated. On the same date, the hospice management was visited by representatives from the Financial Investigations Department who seized the hospice’s laptop and documentation, and later launched an ongoing fraud investigation against Volha Vialichka. 
I urge you to ensure that the harassment of Volha Vialichka stops and that the Hrodna children’s hospice can continue to provide essential medical care to terminally ill children as well as continue to support their families.

Yan Sidorov and his friend, Vladislav Mordasov, were arrested on 5 November 2017 for trying to organize a peaceful protest in support of dozens of Rostov-on-Don residents who had lost their houses in mass fires. They were 18 and 21 years old, respectively, at the time. They were falsely charged with “organizing mass disturbances” and following an unfair trial, on 4 October 2019, they were sentenced – Yan Sidorov to six years and six months and Vladislav Mordasov to six years and seven months in strict regime penal colony. On 10 December, the Third Court of Appeal in Rostov-on-Don upheld their convictions. In July 2020, each of their sentences were reduced to four years. 
Yan Sidorov and Vladislav Mordasov committed no crime and are prisoners of conscience imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression and intending to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. They should be released immediately and unconditionally, and their convictions should be quashed. 
I urge you to use your authority to support Yan Sidorov’s appeal for parole.

“Devastating though it has been, the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought out the best in people. We have witnessed countless acts of compassion and solidarity as people come together in their communities to help those most in need. Sadly, many governments have pursued the opposite course, detaining and persecuting people who stand up for human rights,” said Julie Verhaar, Acting Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“We are at a crossroads – we can all choose to build a future which puts kindness, solidarity, tolerance and human rights at its core. Governments must use this moment to show that they can put right injustices by releasing prisoners of conscience, ending the persecution of human rights defenders, and upholding every person’s right to freedom of expression.” 
Write for Rights: The world’s biggest human rights campaign 
Every December, people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts and postcards for those whose human rights are under attack, in what has become the world’s biggest human rights event. 
The cases selected for Write for Rights 2020 by Amnesty International USA are: 
Bob Goodfellow, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said: “This has been a particularly challenging time in the United States during a difficult year as the country grapples with a pandemic that continues to take too many lives. Now is also the time when we should be taking care of one another, looking after our communities, and advocating along with the people fighting for their basic rights. We’ve seen what people in this country can achieve when they raise their voices and Write for Rights can truly change individuals’ lives.”  
Campaign successes 
As seen in previous years, writing letters really does bring about change for the individuals whose cases are highlighted in Write for Rights, and also offers enormous emotional support and encouragement to them and their families. 
Nigerian teenager Moses Akatugba was arrested and sentenced to death when he was 15 years old, after being accused of stealing three phones. In 2019, he was released, after 800,000 Amnesty International supporters showed their support. 
“I was on death row because the police claimed I stole three phones,” says Moses. “But now I’m free, because people like you wrote letters to support me. After eight years in jail, and 800,000 letters from Amnesty International supporters all over the world, I was released. Those letters kept my fire burning. I am alive today because of these letters. So your letters can save a life.” 
In July 2020, a South Sudanese teenager had his death sentence quashed, due in part to Write for Rights. According to his testimony in court, Magai Matiop Ngong fired his father’s gun at the ground to warn off his cousin, who was trying to stop him fighting with another boy in his neighborhood. The bullet ricocheted and hit his cousin, who later died in hospital. Magai, who was just 15 at the time, faced trial for murder without a lawyer. He was convicted and sentenced to death. 
Our research shows that the death penalty is disproportionately used against poor and disadvantaged people. According to international law, and South Sudanese law, sentencing a child to death is illegal. 
  
More than 765,000 people took action and wrote to the South Sudanese government expressing solidarity with Magai. The South Sudan Court of Appeal eventually quashed the death sentence imposed on Magai because he was a child at the time of the crime, and sent his case back to the High Court to rule on an appropriate sentence. 
“The power of individual action to save lives and hold governments to account must never be underestimated. Year on year we see the powerful impact that simply writing a letter or email can deliver,” said Julie Verhaar. 
“Write for Rights is all about individuals helping other individuals, and this way of expressing our shared humanity has never been more important and relevant. Governments must respond to this widespread desire for change by delivering justice to those whose human rights are being attacked.” 
Background 
Write for Rights mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people around the world to change the lives of individuals at risk through taking action. Last year over six and half million actions were taken – an annual increase for the 18th consecutive year. The case of Yasaman Aryani in Iran received over one million actions alone.

These children and their families were arbitrarily placed in expedited removal proceedings instead of regular immigration proceedings. They did not pass the credible fear interview because of the Trump Administration’s asylum transit ban. Even though the asylum transit ban has been ruled invalid, ICE intends to deport these children – many of whom have been detained for nearly a year and a half – as soon as November 22, 2020. Immediate action is needed to prevent these children from being returned, in violation of the law, to the danger they fled.See the attached backgrounder for more about the families’ cases. 
Background 
Twenty-eight children detained with their parents at the ICE Berks and Dilley Family Detention Centers are facing imminent deportation to Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, El Salvador, Ecuador, Chile, Nicaragua and Peru. 
These families are brave and heroic. These children are bright, kind and scared. They should be welcomed to the United States, not summarily deported by this callous administration. Not only did they travel thousands of miles in search of protection, but when the Trump Administration refused to hear their asylum claims, they took the government to court and invalidated the policies they had been subjected to, over and over again. Yet because of the dysfunction and injustice in the U.S. immigration system, they are still subject to deportation. 
The whole time, however, they remained locked up in so-called family detention centers, celebrating holidays, birthdays, and other milestones without knowing what their future holds. After being cheated by the government out of their legal right to seek asylum, the Trump Administration will most likely deport them one of its last official immigration acts. 
Here is how these families’ U.S. nightmare began: 
After requesting asylum at the U.S./Mexico border, these 28 children and their families were arbitrarily placed in expedited removal proceedings, instead of regular immigration proceedings. As the expedited removal statute mandates, Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) referred the families to asylum officers, who then conducted interviews to determine whether the families have a “credible fear” of persecution or torture if returned to their countries of origin. When a family passes their credible fear interview, they are then released from detention and referred to an Immigration Judge so that they can formally enter the process of seeking asylum before the Immigration Court. 
But the credible fear interviews conducted with these families, these life or death determinations, were flawed in multiple ways: 
Rather than having a trained asylum officer conduct their interviews, these families were interviewed by unqualified CBP officers who conducted hostile, law-enforcement style interrogations. This is contrary to law per the D.C. District Court’s A.B.-B. v. Morgan, No. 20-cv-846, 2020 WL 5107548 (D.D.C. Aug. 31, 2020); 
  
The families were interviewed within 24 hours of arrival and categorically denied the right to consult with counsel prior to their interview. This was contrary to law per the D.C. District Court’s March 1, 2020 order in L.M.-M. v. Cuccinelli. 
  
The asylum office conducted these interviews under a heightened standard resulting from the Safe Third Country Transit Ban (STCTB or Asylum Ban 2.0), which disproportionately affected Black and Central American immigrants who had to travel great distances, under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, to seek protection in the United States. On June 30, Judge Timothy Kelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia vacated the interim final STCTB rule in Capital Area  Immigrants’ Rights (CAIR) Coalition et. al. v. Trump. Additionally, on July 6, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the STCTB nationally in East Bay Sanctuary Covenant et. al. v. Barr. Both courts reached the same conclusion: that the STCTB is unlawful as promulgated and as written. 
  
The asylum office conducted these interviews employing a Lesson Plan that has now been vacated by the D.C. District Court’s October 31, 2020 order in Maria Kiakombua v. Wolf. 1:19-cv-01872 (D.D.C.). 
  
The government subjected these families to a deficient process, which resulted in erroneous negative credible fear determinations. Because the interviews were conducted pursuant to the STCTB and a Lesson Plan that were declared unlawful, and both were vacated, the negative determinations should be vacated as well. The families should be issued a Notice to Appear before an Immigration Judge and should be released immediately from the Family Detention Centers. 
These families have fought for their right to access the asylum process in several courts. InM.M.V. v Barr, the families challenged the written regulations, directives, and procedures issued by the Administration to implement and enforce the Asylum Ban 2.0. In this case, the Court partially granted the government’s motion to dismiss and denied the families’ motion to stay their removal pending appeal. InD.A.M. v. Barr, the families challenged the government’s plan to remove them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, the Court found that it lacked jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, which bars judicial review of any claim “arising from or relating to the implementation” of expedited removal proceedings. 
Throughout, ICE has refused to release these families pending litigation on the validity of these negative determinations, even though it has the power to release them at any moment. It is clear their detention is retaliatory and punitive, and they are being targeted because they are a family seeking asylum. 
Most recently, lawyers supporting Aldea and Proyecto Dilley who represent the families moved to intervene inEast Bay, the case barring enforcement of the STCTB nationally. The families’ latest stay of deportation was pursuant to this motion to intervene. However, the Court inEast Bay issued an order denying their motion to intervene, but making an important notation: 
The Court takes no pleasure in this holding. “[T]he facts amassed by the plaintiffs are deeply troubling, and . . . Congress has been too parsimonious with judicial review in an area where individual lives and liberty are at stake.” M.M.V., 456 F. Supp. at 217. The Court respects the limitations on its jurisdiction set by Congress, but feels compelled to observe that Defendants may now remove Proposed Intervenors from the United States after denying them the right to apply for asylum based on an illegal rule. To put it mildly, that result is both “unsatisfying” and “unduly harsh.” Garcia de Rincon v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 539 F.3d 1133, 1142 (9th Cir. 2008). 
The legal team immediately filed an appeal before the Ninth Circuit, and reached an agreement with the government not to deport the families until at least until November 21, to give time to the Ninth Circuit to make a decision on whether to stop the families’ removal. We will seek to avail the children’s legal rights to address every unlawful policy they were subjected to, but time is of the essence. 
It is unacceptable for the government to continue to subject children in their custody to the torture of detention and to cheat them out of their lawful right to seek protection. It is made worse by the government’s relentless efforts to remove these children without a lawful process when that same government is also responsible for the torture of children who were separated from their parents, for those children whose parents remain missing, and for those children who the government continues to harm daily through the use of indefinite detention and expulsion. 
The children, their families, and representatives are looking to the government and its representatives to provide safety for these children and their parents who have been denied lawful access to the asylum system. Failing these children means that our government will be responsible for the removal of innocent children to harm, persecution and even torture.

The Families Belong Together coalition includes nearly 250 different groups comprising tens of thousands of Americans from all backgrounds who have joined together to fight the Trump Administration’s cruel family separation and anti-immigrant agenda. Led by the National Domestic Workers Alliance, MoveOn, the ACLU, FWD.us and The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Families Belong Together coalition organized the National Day of Action that saw hundreds of thousands of people protest the family separation policy and other inhumane immigration policies at more than 780 events in all 50 states. The coalition is at the forefront of the fight to permanently end family separation and incarceration, immediately reunite all families who remain torn apart, reverse the Trump administration’s zero-humanity policy that created this crisis, and hold accountable anyone who has profited politically or financially from the suffering of these families.",,"November 13, 2020 • Press Release",False

Re: International Human Rights Priorities for 2021 
  
Dear Chairman Risch, Ranking Member Menendez, and Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: 
On behalf of Amnesty International and our 10 million members, activists, and supporters worldwide, I am writing to share our international human rights priorities for 2021. As the country emerges from the presidential election, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (“SFRC”) can and should use this opportunity to chart out a bipartisan foreign policy agenda that places human rights front and center—and in the process, model for Congress and the country how to find common ground, bring people back together, and advance human rights for all. 
While this letter highlights Amnesty International’s topline priorities for 2021, the full suite of Amnesty International’s 80 policy recommendations for the incoming administration can be found here: https://bidenhumanrightspriorities.amnestyusa.org/. 
Our policy briefs address the spectrum of international human rights—organized by thematic area, region of the world, and country. 
To start off, SFRC should honor and promote Human Rights Day by issuing a joint bipartisan statement that signals a bold, transformational approach to human rights. The statement should marry the fight for human rights abroad with the fight for human rights at home. Centered on the right to peaceful protest and restricting police use of force, the statement should lift up the rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. The statement should make connections between U.S. protest movements and protest movements in Nigeria, Belarus, Hong Kong, Thailand, Lebanon, Chile, and elsewhere. The statement should weave together the movements to root out systemic racism in the U.S. with movements to end political corruption, economic inequality, killings by security forces, and climate change worldwide. The statement should affirm the full spectrum of rights grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”) and should highlight the critical role of human rights defenders (“HRDs”) and civil society. 
The statement should urge the incoming administration to rejoin the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and the Paris Climate Accords, and to reverse International Criminal Court (“ICC”) sanctions. Finally, the statement should urge the President-elect to organize a 2021 global forum at the United Nations (“UN”) or State Department (“DOS”) that promotes the full spectrum of human rights and prominently features HRDs and civil society leaders from around the world. 
As the President appoints his cabinet and other senior leaders, it is critical that ALL officials uphold the U.S. government’s obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights as enshrined in the UDHR and other international treaties. All presidential appointees including those to the State Department (“DOS”), Defense Department, U.S. Agency for International Development (“USAID”), and U.S. Agency for Global Media should commit to protect human rights. This includes all candidates for Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretary, Assistant Secretary, Inspector General, Legal Adviser, Ambassador, Representative, Administrator, Deputy Administrator, Associate Administrator, Assistant Administrator, CEO, Director, Board of Governors. All candidates should be asked the following questions: 
Candidates who fail to pledge unequivocally that they will uphold their obligation to respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, as well as any candidates who have previously been involved in authorizing or implementing human rights violations, should be considered unsuitable. 
Members of the SFRC should encourage all Presidential appointees to meet regularly, and work closely, with human rights advocates and civil society leaders. U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, prior to their deployment, should meet with U.S.-based human rights advocates with expertise in the relevant country, region, or thematic area. In addition, U.S. Ambassadors and Representatives, once relocated to their post, should meet frequently, and work closely with, HRDs, civil society, and journalists in their assigned country or region. 
Since its creation in 2014, the Senate Human Rights Caucus (“Caucus”) has provided a platform to highlight international human rights crises including threats to religious minorities. Unlike the Lantos Human Rights Commission in the House, the Senate Caucus has no dedicated staff, funding, or resources. The establishment of a Senate Human Rights Commission, similar to the Lantos Commission, would create a central organizing body in the Senate to promote international human rights, and would strengthen partnerships with non-governmental bodies. 
Res. 725 would establish and fund the Senate Human Rights Commission with its own full-time staff. Dedicated personnel would significantly increase the volume and effectiveness of the Senate’s work on international human rights. The Commission would complement the work of SFRC by drawing attention to human rights crises that SFRC may not have adequate capacity to cover. 
The Senate should speedily establish and staff up the Senate Human Rights Commission, in order to advance human rights worldwide. 
5a. Rescind all the Muslim, Africa, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans 
The Trump Administration’s multiple Muslim, Africa, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans violate the rights enshrined in the UDHR and other internationally recognized standards. Congress should immediately reverse policies and procedures that limit refugee resettlement and asylum in the U.S. by passing legislation to rescind the Muslim, African, refugee, asylum, and immigration bans (Presidential Proclamations 9645, 9822, 9983, 9984, 9993, and 10014, and Executive Orders 13769, 13780, 13815, and 13888). 
In July 2020 the House passed the National Origin-Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act (“NO BAN Act”) (H.R. 2486, formerly H.R. 2214; S. 1123 in the Senate). The bill would undo the Trump administration’s Muslim ban in place since 2017; check any President’s ability to discriminate on the basis of religion; rescind initiatives to unlawfully limit the right to seek asylum at the U.S. border; remove impediments placed on refugees who are already subject to more vetting than any other group entering the U.S., and ensure that DOS and Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) must consult with Congress. The NO BAN Act sends a clear message that the U.S. welcomes and protects people from all faiths and backgrounds. 
5b. Protect international human rights amidst COVID-19 pandemic  
Leaders around the world have used the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to arrest critics, intensify surveillance, seize emergency powers, and discriminate against marginalized populations. The bipartisan Protecting Human Rights During Pandemic Act (“PHRDPA”) (S. 3819, H.R. 6986) was introduced in both chambers in June 2020. In late September 2020 the House Foreign Affairs Committee marked up and approved H.R. 6986. The Senate has yet to take up its companion bill. 
The PHRDPA would require DOS and USAID to outline a five-year strategy to address persistent issues related to internationally recognized human rights in the context of the COVID-19 response and authorize the establishment of foreign assistance programs designed specifically to support civil society organizations and human rights defenders in countries where the abuse of emergency measures has resulted in the violation of human rights. The bill would also prohibit, subject to a waiver in extraordinary circumstances, the U.S. government from providing security sector assistance to countries engaging in a “consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights” by way of “emergency laws, policies, or administrative procedures.” 
5c. Pass bipartisan Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) 
Amnesty International has repeatedly found evidence that U.S.-made munitions have been used by Saudi Arabia and UAE-led Coalition (“coalition”) forces to target Yemeni civilians. Amnesty has documented 36 coalition airstrikes across six different governorates that appear to have violated international law. These airstrikes have claimed more than 500 civilian lives and appear to have deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, markets, and mosques. 
Although European countries have suspended arms transfers to the coalition, the U.S. government continues to provide the coalition with military support and arms sales. The U.S. government, therefore, has been complicit in the coalition’s violations in Yemen, some of which amount to war crimes. 
In 2019 the Trump administration pushed through emergency arms sales to Saudi Arabia, even over strong bipartisan, bicameral opposition. In an effort to block the arms sales to the coalition, Congress passed three resolutions, all vetoed by the President (Congress failed to meet the super-majority threshold required to overturn a Presidential veto). 
The new Senate should pass the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) to block all future arms sales to the Saudi Arabia-UAE-led coalition. 
5d. Halt Myanmar’s atrocities against Rohingya and other minorities 
In August 2017 Myanmar security forces, led by the Myanmar Army, attacked the Rohingya in villages across northern Rakhine State, driving more than 740,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh. Myanmar security forces carried out a relentless and systematic campaign, killing at least 10,000 Rohingya including children; raping hundreds of Rohingya women and girls; torturing Rohingya men and boys in detention sites; and burning hundreds of villages in a targeted and deliberate manner. Today more than 54 percent of the Rohingya who had previously lived in northern Rakhine State are now living in mass refugee camps in Bangladesh. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees live in threadbare camps in Cox’s Bazar. 
In response to these crimes against humanity, the House in 2019 passed the Burma Unified through Rigorous Military Accountability Act (H.R. 3190) and Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (H.R. 2327). These bills would apply much needed pressure against Myanmar authorities to halt atrocities against the Rohingya. H.R. 3190 would hold senior Myanmar military officials accountable for human rights abuses, while H.R. 2327 would direct DOS to assist civil society organizations in Myanmar working to free prisoners of conscience. Although the House passed both bills in 2019, the bills have languished in the Senate without a vote. 
The Senate should take up these bills and quickly pass them in 2021, in order to hold those responsible for these atrocities and to ensure continuing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya in Bangladesh and Myanmar. 
5e. Permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule and Helms Amendment  
U.S. foreign policies like the Global Gag Rule (also known as the Mexico City Policy) and the Helms Amendment harm the health and other human rights of millions by restricting women and girls, especially those living in developing countries, from accessing safe abortion services. The Helms amendment restricts U.S. foreign aid from going toward abortion services, and the Global Gag Rule prohibits foreign non-governmental organizations that receive U.S. foreign aid from using their own money to educate their communities on safe abortion services, advocate for safer abortion laws, or provide abortion services. 
The Helms amendment and Global Gag Rule do not reduce abortion rates; they simply make abortion unsafe. Unsafe abortion is responsible for 13 percent of maternal deaths worldwide and represents one of the four major causes of pregnancy-related mortality and morbidity. Abortion rates have been shown to increase when the Global Gag Rule is in place, and people lose access to sexual and reproductive health education and services. 
In 2021 SFRC should quickly take up and approve the Global HER Act (S.368, H.R.1055), which would permanently repeal the Global Gag Rule, and a companion bill to the Abortion Is Health Care Everywhere Act (H.R.7816), which would repeal the Helms amendment. 
5f. Lift restrictions on transferring detainees out of Guantánamo Bay 
The U.S. government opened the detention center at Guantánamo Bay in 2002 to house people outside the reach of the law after the 9/11 attacks. Since then, 780 men have been detained at Guantánamo prison. Eighteen years after its opening, 40 detainees remain imprisoned there indefinitely. Most have never been charged with a crime. Five have been cleared for release from Guantánamo prison for years by all relevant national security agencies, yet still remain imprisoned. The few charged have not received fair trials. The prison is not equipped to provide adequate medical care to these aging detainees, many of whom have serious underlying medical conditions, some of them created or exacerbated by U.S.-sponsored torture and ill-treatment. 
The Guantánamo prison costs more than $540 million per year to maintain for 40 prisoners and denies them their rights to due process and humane treatment. Other suspects accused of committing or attempting violence are routinely safely housed in federal detention centers on U.S. soil. They are also routinely tried in U.S. courts. 
One of the challenges President Obama faced in closing the Guantánamo prison was the restrictions placed by Congress on transferring detainees to the U.S., including for trial or medical treatment. SFRC should support amending the National Defense Authorization Act to remove the current restrictions (sec. 1043) that make it impossible to transfer Guantánamo detainees to the U.S. 
6a. Refugees and displaced peoples: SFRC should hold hearings to examine how the U.S. can fully implement the provisions of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The hearings should probe explore innovative solutions, including private sponsorship, to protect refugees, migrants, and displaced persons worldwide. 
6b. Protest movements: In recent years the world has witnessed a surge in protest movements as huge waves of people have taken to the streets to exercise their right to protest and demand change from those in power. From Nigeria to Belarus to Hong Kong to Lebanon to Chile—many governments have responded to protesters with excessive force, arbitrary detention, and crackdown on civil society in violation of human rights standards. 
6c. Debt cancellation for poorer nations recovering from COVID-19 pandemic: The economic fallout of COVID-19 has been devastating for developing countries. The poorest 77 countries will spend nearly $85 billion in debt repayments in 2020 and 2021. These countries need urgent support from the U.S., the top bilateral lender to developing countries. The U.S. government should call on the G20 to cancel the debt owed by the poorest countries. 
6d. Human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience: Since the adoption of the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in 1998, over 4200 human rights defenders (“HRDs”) have been killed worldwide. In 2019 alone 304 HRDs were assassinated for their work with Colombia and the Philippines being the most dangerous countries to be an HRD. Thousands of prisoners of conscience (“POCs”) languish in prisons, sometimes for years on end, in horrendous conditions. Many are subjected to torture and other forms of ill-treatment in severely overcrowded prisons. Countries of particular concern are Saudi Arabia, China, Bahrain, Turkey, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt. 
Foreign governments need to immediately investigate and promptly prosecute those found responsible for the killing of HRDs, including the intellectual authors behind such crimes. The US government should also call on foreign governments to repeal any legislation or practices that criminalizes or restricts the work of HRDs, like in India, Turkey, China, Guatemala, and Russia. Amnesty also calls on foreign governments to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience around the world, and to fully, impartially, and promptly investigate any allegations of torture or other ill-treatment of POCs, and that those found responsible be held accountable. Foreign governments must guarantee POCs access to legal counsel, medical attention, and family members. 
Amnesty International’s experts in the U.S. and around the world stand ready to work with the SFRC on any of these human rights issues. We look forward to working with you to protect and advance human rights around the world in 2021 and beyond. Please do not hesitate to contact me at 202/281-0017 or [email protected].

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the recent arrest of Pham Thi Doan Trang, who has peacefully advocated for human rights in Viet Nam for many years. I am particularly concerned that she is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment while held incommunicado in Prison Number One in Hanoi. 
Charged under article 117 of the Vietnamese Penal Code, it is alarming that Pham Thi Doan Trang could face up to 20 years in prison simply for writing about human rights and courageously helping to build a Viet Nam in which everyone’s human rights are respected. She has worked tirelessly to make that vision a reality. Unfortunately, instead of receiving protection and support from the Vietnamese authorities, Doan Trang has been subjected to relentless harassment by state security forces. In the past three years, Doan Trang has been arbitrarily detained, threatened, and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in police custody. 
Viet Nam has an obligation under international human rights law and also under its own Constitution to protect human rights defenders and ensure they can carry out their work in a safe and supportive environment. Pham Thi Doan Trang’s work to promote human rights is both constitutional and in line with the Vietnamese authorities’ voluntary international human rights commitments. 
Pham Thi Doan Trang is a prisoner of conscience, who has been detained solely for her human rights work. I therefore urge you to ensure that Pham Thi Doan Trang is released immediately and unconditionally; pending her release, grant Pham Thi Doan Trang prompt, regular and unrestricted access to adequate medical care, family visits and access to a lawyer of her choice; and ensure Pham Thi Doan Trang is treated in full accordance with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules), and is protected from torture and other ill-treatment, including poor conditions of detention and prolonged pre-trial detention. 
Yours sincerely,

“The administration’s statement that the court is forcing its hand to separate families is pure disinformation. On the contrary, it is ICE’s actions that have contributed to this untenable situation. This administration has consistently acted to keep families detained, instead of releasing them together, which is well within its discretion to do. The government has sought a path fundamentally destructive of a child’s best interests and family unity by keeping families together through prolonged detention. ICE has the authority to release parents with their children, and has historically done so.  But now, it’s doubled down on detention simply to deter and punish families for seeking safety. 
“The Department of Homeland Security flouts bedrock principles – the best interests of the child and family unity – so that it can continue to lock up families who came to this country to seek safety. This administration knows that it is well past time that they release families together but is deliberately choosing cruelty. 
“The government’s protests that it is standing up for family unity is deceptive and a public relations move. ICE supports family unity only if it’s in detention. This is the same administration that implemented a policy and practice of forcible family separation in 2018 and yet now maintains it is an advocate of family unity. Nothing could be further from the truth. If the administration is as concerned about the welfare of these families as it claims, it should release families together immediately.”

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I welcome the news that activists, Maikoul Zodi, Halidou Mounkaila and Moudi Moussa were provisionally released from detention on 29 and 30 September by a Niamey Court. However, I remain concerned that the charges against them and other civil society leaders – including Moussa Tchangari, Habibou Mounkaila and Karim Tanko who were also arbitrarily detained and have since been released – are still pending. 
All six activists were arbitrarily detained and charged for unauthorized gathering, complicity in damaging public property, arson and manslaughter, following a protest that they organized in Niamey, Niger’s capital, on 15 March, demanding an investigation into the allegations of misuse of funds by the Ministry of Defense. 
Amnesty International believes the charges against the activists have been fabricated to undermine the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of assembly and expression, and their demands for accountability. 
I urge you to end the prosecution of the six activists and ensure the charges against them are immediately dropped; ensure an independent, impartial, thorough and effective investigation into the deaths during the demonstration on 15 March is carried out, to bring the suspected perpetrators to justice, with due regard for the right to a fair trial; protect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression in Niger in this pre-electoral period; and put an end to harassment, intimidation and attacks against members of civil society.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
On 27 September 2020, the lawyers of political activist Abdallah Benaoum made yet another request for his transfer to hospital, following the rapid deterioration of his health in prison, which puts his life at risk. They have not received an answer to date. Adballah Benaoum is suffering from clogged arteries and his lawyers submitted a first request for provisional release in April 2020, which was rejected. The judge justified the rejection by the serious nature of the “crimes” he is accused of, which refer only to Facebook posts critical of the authorities. His posts on Facebook did not include any incitement to violence and were therefore fully protected by his right to freedom of expression. 
On 12 May, Benaoum’s cardiologist examined him and concluded that he is in urgent need of a second heart surgery. On 7 June, his lawyers submitted a request for him to be transferred to hospital to no avail. A few days later, the authorities transferred him from Belasal prison in Relizane to a small prison in Gdyel, a town in the governorate of Oran, 160 km from his place of residence, where there were no medical facilities available. The lawyers submitted another request on 21 June which led to another transfer to Oran prison where Benaoum remained until his trial on 16 July. He was yet again transferred back to Oran prison where he remains to date. 
During the trial on 16 July, Benaoum was visibly ill. His lawyers asked for an adjournment, but the judge continued with normal trial procedures for an hour before having a doctor examine Benaoum and confirm that he was not fit to stand trial. The hearing was suspended but the judge refused a request for provisional release and sent Benaoum back to jail. His lawyers filed another request for provisional release on 2 September, which was again denied. 
I call on you to drop all charges against Abdallah Benaoum and ensure that he is immediately and unconditionally released as he is being detained solely for the exercise of his right to freedom of expression. In the meantime, he must be transferred without further delay to a medical facility where he can receive the urgent medical treatment prescribed by his cardiologist. In the current context of COVID-19, his heart condition puts him at increased risk according to the World Health Organization and the authorities must take all measures to protect his life.

Please join us as Bill and Sushma discuss how rights evolve with changing circumstances, and what rights will look like ten, twenty, or fifty years from now. The authors argue that those who would hold that rights are static and immutable must adapt to new realities or risk being consigned to irrelevance. Preserving and promoting the good society—one that protects its members’ dignity and fosters an environment in which people will want to live—requires that we must at times rethink the meanings of familiar rights and consider the introduction of entirely new rights.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Honorable Minister Khan, 
I am gravely concerned by the repeated arrests of returning migrant workers in Bangladesh. The arbitrary detention of 32 returning migrant workers from Syria on 28 September 2020 takes the number of such detention of migrant workers from countries including Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Vietnam to at least 370 since July this year. In each case, the police accused them of “tarnishing the image of the country” by engaging in criminal activities abroad. Dhaka’s magistrate court has granted police requests to detain the workers until the police can determine their offense, even without requiring any specific allegation or evidence against them. 
The arrest and detention of these workers in the absence of any credible evidence of any criminal activity committed on Bangladeshi territory violate Bangladesh’s commitment to international human rights law including Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which prohibits arbitrary arrest or detention and protects everyone’s right to liberty. This is not only a clear violation of their human rights but fails to acknowledge that migrant workers are the lifeblood of Bangladesh’s economy which has earned $18.2 billion in remittances in the fiscal year 2019-20. Such ill-treatment of these workers is an injustice to their hard work and labor and tarnishes your own government’s image. 
I urge your government to either immediately charge each of the workers with a recognizable criminal offense under Bangladeshi law while ensuring the necessary due process or release them in line with your government’s obligations under international human rights law. 
Yours sincerely,

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am concerned by the decision to dismiss A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman, an assistant professor of Geography at the National University, for a Facebook post about Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her family. In 2013, he was arrested and suspended from the university because of the Facebook post. On 3 March 2014, the police filed another defamation case against him under section 57 the country’s draconian Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act. Now, seven years later, the professor was terminated from service on 2 September 2020. Not only has this decision denied A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman his right to freedom of expression, but it is in violation of the university’s own service rules. As you may be aware, university authorities cannot terminate an employee on an issue that is pending trial at the court, and without allowing them the opportunity to defend themselves. Such an action by a state institution demonstrates lack of transparency and accountability and would also deny A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman from his right to a fair trial. 
I find it worrying that this is not an isolated incident. Instead, it appears to be indicative of a dangerous pattern of repression of academics in Bangladesh. As you may be aware, Morshed Hasan Khan – another professor – was recently dismissed from the University of Dhaka for publishing his opinion in a newspaper, while two other public university teachers are being accused under the draconian Digital Security Act (DSA) for sharing Facebook posts that were deemed critical of Awami League politicians. 
I call on you to immediately reverse A.K.M. Wahiduzzaman’s termination and reinstate him to his position; drop all charges against him and all those prosecuted solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression; repeal the Digital Security Act unless it can be promptly amended in compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Bangladesh is a state party; and respect, protect, and fulfil the right to freedom of expression and academic freedom.

Dear President Xi, 
I am writing to express my grave concern for Cheng Yuan (程渊), Liu Yongze (刘永泽) and Wu Gejianxiong (吴葛健雄), who were tried in secret between 31 August and 4 September 2020 on the charge of “subversion of state power” (颠覆国家政权罪). Detained incommunicado for more than 14 months, with no way for their families or lawyers to check their physical and mental well-being, I fear that they are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. 
Family members of the three men were only informed of the trial on 10 September, almost one week after it had concluded. Instead of being duly notified about the case proceedings, the family members had to proactively seek information from government-appointed lawyers themselves. No further details about the case has been provided to them, and all family members have since been barred from entering the Changsha Municipality Intermediate People’s Court. Individuals like Cheng Yuan, Li Yongze and Wu Gejianxiong who advocate for the rights of marginalized groups and work to protect the rights of the most vulnerable people in society are being detained, accused of serious national security charges and subjected to a secret trial. The arbitrary detention for their activities as anti-discrimination NGO workers violates the principle of equality before the law and equal protection of the law under Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
Cheng Yuan, Liu Yongze and Wu Geijianxiong are prisoners of conscience who have been detained solely for carrying out their professional work and peacefully defending human rights. I call on you to immediately and unconditionally release Cheng Yuan, Liu Yongze and Wu Geijianxiong, as they have been detained solely for carrying out their professional work and peacefully defending human rights; and ensure that each has regular, unrestricted access to family members and lawyers of their choice and ensure that they are not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment while in detention

Dear Counselor, 
I am writing to raise concerns about the ongoing arbitrary detention of journalist and human rights defender Esraa Abdelfattah. Amnesty International considers her to be a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for her peaceful practice of her rights to freedom of expression, association and participation in public affairs. 
Esraa was abducted from the street by security forces in plain clothes on 12 October 2019 and held for eight hours at an undisclosed location managed by the National Security Agency (NSA), a specialized police force, during which time she said she was tortured. The next day she was transferred to the SSSP, a special branch of the prosecution responsible for investigating security threats, which ordered her detention in relation to case (No. 488/2019) over investigations into unfounded charges of “joining a terrorist group in achieving its goals”, “disseminating false news” and “misusing social media”. The SSSP prosecutor questioned Esraa about her previous political activism. Since then, her pre-trial detention has been renewed, most recently on 24 August by the Cairo Criminal Court for another 45 days. 
On 30 August 2020, Esraa was brought in front of the SSSP to face questioning over investigations into a new case (No. 855/2020). The case includes activists like Mahienour el-Masry, journalist Solafa Magdy and human rights lawyer Mohamed el-Baqer. Esraa was accused of “joining a terrorist organization” and “participating in a criminal agreement intended to commit a terrorist crime from inside prison”. Esraa’s lawyer told Amnesty International that the SSSP prosecutor accused Esraa of communicating with individuals outside prison to spread rumours and false news. He claimed that she was able to engage in such acts while in the prison courtyard exercising and during court sessions and appearances at the prosecution’s office. Esraa argued that the accusations were baseless as she had been cut off from the outside world from 10 March to 22 August 2020, when all prison visits were suspended by the authorities citing COVID-19 concerns. 
I ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Esraa Abdelfattah and drop all charges against her. Pending her release, I urge you to ensure that she is provided with means to regularly communicate with her family and lawyers. I also urge the Egyptian authorities to immediately release all those detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly and take measures to protect the health of all prisoners amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Esraa Abdelfattah’s allegations that she was tortured and otherwise ill-treated must be independently and thoroughly investigated and those suspected of criminal responsibility must be brought to justice in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty.

Dear Minister, 
I write to you today to express my concern about the arbitrary detention of Kameel Juma Hasan, a 17-year-old secondary-school student who has been jailed since 31 December 2019. 
Kameel is currently being held at the Juvenile Reform and Rehabilitation Center at Dry Dock. He faces over 20 separate prosecutions based on demonstrations against the Bahraini monarchy and appears to have been targeted because his mother, Najah Ahmed Yusuf, who was arbitrarily detained from 2017 to 2019, spoke up about her abuse in detention. On 13 September 2020, Kameel was sentenced to five years in prison on one such set of charges, in a trial of 39 defendants – all Shi’a citizens, reflecting discrimination in the criminal justice system of the Sunni-led government. Amnesty International has received credible reports that, in January 2020, Kameel was compelled to sign a prepared “confession” placed in front of him by interrogators after being beaten and forced to stand for prolonged periods of time. 
I urge you to immediately release Kameel, drop all outstanding charges against him stemming from his non-violent participation in demonstrations, end the targeting of his family, and quash his conviction in the unjust group trial concluded on 13 September. Pending his release, I urge you to ensure that he is granted access to his family and lawyers and protected from torture and other ill-treatment. Allegations that he has been tortured or otherwise ill-treated must be independently and effectively investigated, and statements obtained under torture must not be admitted as evidence in criminal proceedings.

SAMPLE LETTER 
Your Excellency, 
I am concerned about the harassment, intimidation and targeting of Professor Md. Morshed Hasan Khan, professor of the Department of Marketing, at the Dhaka University Syndicate, simply for publishing his opinion in a newspaper. He has been dismissed from his position at the Dhaka University, charged with sedition and threatened with death. It is alarming that an academic is facing life imprisonment merely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. 
Accused of “distorting” the history of war of independence and the post-war political situation in Bangladesh, Professor Morshed has been dismissed on the grounds of “moral turpitude” or “inefficiency” under Rule56(3) of Dhaka University Order 1973, despite procedural flaws in the conducts of the Enquiry Committee. 
In addition, Professor Morshed is also being charged with sedition under section 124A of Bangladesh Penal Code 1860 for merely sharing his opinion. A charge such as this is inconsistent with international human rights law and constitutes a violation of Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Bangladesh is a state party. Furthermore, I find it deeply disturbing to learn that Professor Morshed has reportedly been threatened with death by unidentified persons over phone and on social media. He is being forced to stay out of his campus residence, where his wife – a cancer patient – still resides. 
In order to protect the safety and security of Professor Morshed, uphold his right to freedom of expression, and to remedy the procedural flaws in his dismissal, I call on you to ensure Professor Morshed Hasan Khanand his family’s safety and security; immediately reverse Professor Morshed Hasan Khan’s dismissal and reinstate him to his position; immediately drop all charges brought against Professor Morshed Hasan Khan under Section 124A, Bangladesh Penal Code; and respect, protect, and fulfil the right to freedom of expression and academic freedom;

On 30 August 2020, Mahienour was brought in front of the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) to face questioning over investigations into a new case (No. 855/2020). She was initially accused of “joining a terrorist organization”, “releasing and spreading false rumors” and “the misuse of communication platforms”.

She is a prisoner of conscience, who should be immediately and unconditionally released.

On 9 August 2020, she was again brought to the SSSP Cairo headquarters, without her lawyers being notified. The SSSP opened investigations into two additional charges, namely ‘‘verbally insulting a police officer on duty’’ and ‘’defaming a police officer’’.

Doctor Tatyana Revva, an intensive care unit doctor from Kalach-on-Don, is facing reprisals after repeated complaints to her hospital’s management about the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tatyana Revva has suffered unjustified disciplinary measures for these and other work-related complaints and could lose her job for simply exercising her right to freedom of expression and raising concerns about matters of public interest. She has been trying to take effective action to combat the spread of COVID-19 and ensure the highest attainable standard of health. I am appalled to learn that on 23 July, a court rejected her civil claim against the hospital for imposing disciplinary measures on her. She is appealing this decision. 
Tatyana Revva received a letter in July stating that some of the issues she had complained about had been confirmed by the hospital inspection conducted by the regional prosecutor’s office. However, the same letter also stated that the Kalachevsky District prosecutor’s office had overturned the decision of the district police not to initiate a criminal case against her under Article 128.1 of the Russian Criminal Code (“Libel”). The letter stated that the police had been ordered to conduct an additional pre-investigatory examination into whether criminal proceedings should be opened against her. The initial pre-investigatory examination was conducted following a complaint from the head doctor at Tatyana Revva’s hospital. At that time, the police refused multiple times to open a criminal case as they did not identify supporting grounds. 
I urge you to take all necessary steps to end reprisals against Tatyana Revva. These should include a halt of the ongoing pre-investigatory examination, ensuring that she is able to perform her professional duties and exercise her right to freedom of expression, without obstruction or harassment. I also call on you to take steps to ensure health workers in the Kalach-on-Don hospital and other hospitals in Volgograd region are adequately protected in the context of COVID-19.

However, in 2018, the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) brought forward new medical evidence supporting both men’s claims of torture in detention. As a result, the Court of Cassation overturned the death sentences, pending a review by the High Criminal Court of Appeal under a new panel of judges. Despite the new evidence, the High Criminal Court of Appeal upheld the convictions and sentences again in January 2020. 
On 14 July 2020, the UN Human Rights Office spokesperson expressed deep concern that Bahrain’s highest court, has upheld the death penalty against the two men, and urged the authorities to halt immediately any plans to execute them. 
I call upon your Highness not to ratify the death sentences imposed on the two men and ensure they are not executed. I urge you to order an independent and impartial investigation into their allegations of torture with the view to bringing those responsible to justice. I also urge you to quash their convictions and sentences imposed after an unfair trial and the reliance on information extracted under torture. I acknowledge the authorities’ duty to prevent crime and bring those responsible to justice, but emphasize that this should always be done in accordance with Bahrain’s international human rights obligations; and urge you to commute all death sentences to terms of imprisonment and immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. 
Yours sincerely,

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Counselor, 
Amid rising fears over the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt’s overcrowded prisons, prisoner of conscience Zyad el-Elaimy’s health is at risk, as he suffers from sarcoidosis, asthma, hypertension and diabetes. Despite this, the prison authorities deny him access to adequate health care. According to a doctor with knowledge of his medical history, Zyad managed his health conditions before being imprisoned through regular diagnostic tests and adjustment of the dose of appropriate medications. However, his health has not been monitored on a regular basis during incarceration as prison authorities persistently refuse requests by his family and lawyers to conduct comprehensive medical evaluations. Zyad has also been denied medication for pericardial effusion, a condition he developed in prison. Without the proper diagnosis and treatment, Zyad’s health is at risk of further deterioration. 
Zyad has been denied access to his lawyer and family since the Egyptian authorities suspended all prison visits on 10 March as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but failed to ensure regular alternative means of communication. 
Zyad is facing three separate criminal proceedings as a result of his political activism. On 25 June 2019, security forces arbitrarily detained Zyad (in relation to case 930/2019, known as the “Hope Case”) on charges connected to his peaceful political activities. On 18 April 2020, the terrorism circuit of the Cairo Criminal Court included Zyad and 12 other detainees on Egypt’s “terrorism” lists for five years in relation to case 571/2020. The effect of the decision includes travel bans, asset freezes, and prohibition of political activities. On 2 June 2020, a higher court judge upheld his conviction and sentence in relation to case 684/2020 for conducting an interview with BBC Arabic on the human rights situation in Egypt. 
I therefore ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Zyad el-Elaimy, Hossam Moanis, Hisham Fouad and other individuals detained in case 930/2019, as their detention is arbitrary and solely based on the peaceful exercise of their human rights. I call on you to also ensure that all the charges against them are dropped, and the decision to include Zyad el-Elaimy on the “terrorism” list is rescinded. Pending their release, I urge you to ensure that Zyad el-Elaimy and the other detainees are provided with adequate health care and the means to regularly communicate with their families and lawyers. 
Yours sincerely,

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Counselor, 
Prisoner of conscience Ramy Shaath has been arbitrarily detained for a year, since 4 July 2019, pending investigations into the so-called “Hope Case” (Case 390/2019), which involves at least 105 individuals, including politicians and journalists. 
In May 2020, the Egyptian authorities finally allowed Ramy’s wife, Céline Lebrun Shaath, to speak to Ramy on the phone for 45 minutes for the first time since his arrest. Ramy, who is held in Tora Prison, told Céline that he is detained in a 25 square meter cell with 17 other detainees, amid the absence of adequate measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among the guards and detainees. Céline, who is based in France, also received assurances from the Egyptian authorities to grant her the possibility to return to Egypt for an in-person visit, once the “health situation allows” and air borders reopen. 
The Egyptian authorities suspended all prison visits on 10 March as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but failed to introduce alternative means of regular communication between detainees and their loved ones. Ramy’s last visit by Egypt-based relatives was on 4 March 2020. In June 2020, the Egyptian authorities finally allowed Ramy’s relatives to send him food and clothes after refusing to admit packages.

June 24, 2020 
RE: Vote Recommendation on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 7120) – VOTE YES 
Dear Representative: 
On behalf of Amnesty International USA (“AIUSA”), we recommend you vote YES on the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (H.R. 7120). This bill is scheduled for a floor vote on June 25. 
The persistence of police killings of Black people is a direct outgrowth of a law enforcement system that has shielded police abuses from accountability for decades. While AIUSA supports the Justice in Policing Act as a whole, we write to express our serious objections to the price tag associated with bill.  In this moment, we strongly believe that the functions of this bill do not require new funding. Through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, passed in March 2020, $850 million was made available for law enforcement purposes to states, localities, and police departments. The CARES Act money is on top of the already $547 million Congress appropriated for law enforcement in FY 2020. 
Police shoot and kill about 1,000 people every year, with many more killed by other uses of force by police. Since George Floyd’s murder on May 25, 2020, thousands of protesters in every state have been demonstrating for police accountability and systemic change. All people have the right to survive a police encounter, to be safe, to live free from discrimination, and to enjoy equal protection of the law. These rights should not depend on race, color, or zip code. 
Current laws on the use of force, including lethal force, do not adequately protect individuals from human right violations, including unlawful killing. AIUSA has found that all 50 states and the District of Columbia fail to meet international law and standards for the use of lethal force by police. Nine states and the District of Columbia have not enacted any laws on the use of lethal force by law enforcement. 
In order to remedy this long, systemic problem, Congress must enact more restrictive national standards that are in line with international law and standards. This includes provisions ensuring that force is only used when necessary and proportionate, and that lethal force be reserved as a last resort, against an imminent threat of death or serious injury, and after exhausting all other methods. 
Congress Should Pass Legislation to Establish Police Accountability and to Root Out Systemic Racial Bias Embedded in Policing.   
AIUSA urges Congress to swiftly pass meaningful policing legislation that advances the following eight priorities: 
Congress is long overdue in passing legislation that delivers true transformation in policing and public safety. We urge Congress to pass the Justice in Policing Act.  For questions or additional information, please contact Kristina Roth at [email protected] at 202-945-2021.

If clemency is denied, Stanislau and Illia Kostseu will be executed imminently.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President, 
I am writing to appeal to your sense of compassion and humanity, as values which the people of Belarus greatly admire and urge you to grant clemency to two young brothers on death row, Stanislau and Illia Kostseu. Their death sentences were upheld by the Supreme Court on 22 May, and they have now applied to you for clemency as their last chance. They are 19 and 21 years old, respectively. 
There is no doubt that the murder, for which they were convicted, is a serious crime. They have both expressed their deep regret and cooperated fully with the criminal investigation. Stanislau and Illia Kostseu are the youngest prisoners to be sentenced to death in Belarus in over ten years and their execution would be a terrible stain on Belarus’ record. I urge you to take into account their young age, and the plea from their mother and sister who raised them after their father died, when deciding their fate. 
The death penalty has been abolished in law or practice in every country in Europe and Central Asia, except Belarus, although there is a clear and welcome commitment from Belarus to join its neighbors and the global trend towards abolition. 
With international attention currently on Belarus, granting clemency to Stanislau and Illia Kostseu would be a clear signal of Belarus’ meaningful intention to end this practice. It would also give these very young men the opportunity to turn their troubled lives around and show that rehabilitation and reform is possible. 
Please make this an historic moment for Belarus and its future, and grant clemency to Stanislau and Illia Kostseu and commute their death sentences to terms of imprisonment.

Dear Governor, 
I am deeply concerned to hear that Adrian Vásquez Lagunes was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 16 June. The torture he suffered at the hands of Baja California police in 2012 left him with chronic injuries in his ribs and lungs, which makes him at risk as a COVID-19 patient. The lack of reparation awarded by the government and his work as a public transport and uber driver place him and his family in a precarious economic situation to cover any medical and livelihood costs. 
I call on you to urgently ensure immediate economic support and health care coverage for Adrián Vasquez and his family and ensure that his full reparation package is finalized without delay.

CONTACT INFORMATION 
  
SAMPLE LETTER 
Dear Prime Minister Hun Sen, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about reports that Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a 37-year old Thai activist, has gone missing in Phnom Penh. A family member reported Wanchalearm Satsaksit’s abduction on 4 June, after speaking to him on the phone around 4:30 pm that day. During the call, Wanchalearm left his apartment to purchase food. However, according to the relative, their conversation ended abruptly with Wanchalearm saying that he was choking and could not breathe. According to reports, CCTV footage from Wanchalearm’s apartment block apparently show a black Toyota Highlander SUV departing from outside the condominium. His whereabouts remain unknown. 
Thai authorities have filed charges against him on account of his peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression while in exile, most recently in 2018 under the Computer Crime Act and Article 116 of the Penal Code governing sedition, alleging that he had posted anti-government material on a Facebook group called “I will certainly receive 100 million from Thaksin.” Thai authorities have allegedly requested his extradition from Cambodia in the past. 
I therefore urge you to ensure that an effective, urgent, thorough and transparent investigation into Wanchalearm’s alleged abduction is carried out and that his family is informed of all efforts to determine his whereabouts; bring any person suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in a fair trial before a civilian court and without recourse to death penalty; and as provided by the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, to which Cambodia is a state party, not return Wanchalearm to Thailand, in line with your obligations not to engage in the forcible return of individuals to places where they would be at risk of human rights violations. 
Yours sincerely,

1) This Month’s Feature  
Amnesty International USA (“AIUSA”) Condemns Police Killings of African-Americans and Calls on Law Enforcement Nationwide to Stop Using Excessive Force. Amnesty International USA (“AIUSA”) condemns the brutal killings of George Floyd, Dreasjean “Sean” Reed, Breonna Taylor, and so many others.  Police are more than twice as likely to kill black people than white people.   In 2019 police shot and killed 1,004 people.  
Congress should pass the Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (“PEACE”) Act (H.R. 4359) which would limit the use of deadly force by federal law enforcement officers to be used only as last resort and require officers to employ de-escalation techniques. AIUSA joined 368 organizations in a letter to Congressional leadership outlining urgent reforms needed to stop police use of excessive force.  
In addition, in the wake of recent protests across the country, AIUSA calls for an immediate end to any force against peaceful protesters and for law enforcement to ensure and protect the legal right to protest.    
 
  
2) Major Human Rights News  
a) COVID-19 and Human Rights 
World Health Organization – Amnesty International Condemns President Trump’s Decision to Terminate Relationship with World Health Organization (“WHO”). On May 29 President Trump announced that the U.S. would be ending its relationship with the WHO. Amnesty International released a statement condemning this callous decision that will undercut the global effort to eradicate COVID-19. A once-in-a-century pandemic is not the time to play politics. As the world bands together to fight this pandemic, some countries have increased their financial contributions to the WHO.  The U.S. stands alone in severing ties with the WHO. In April, AIUSA sent a letter calling on Congress to speak out against the President’s plans to defund the WHO.  
Congress Must Provide Oversight on Palantir Tech Firm’s Role in Collecting Health Data for U.S. COVID-19 Response. On April 21 the Trump administration awarded a contract to collect COVID-related health data to the tech firm Palantir. This contract with the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) raises serious human rights concerns. In a May 21 Washington Post op-ed, Amnesty International describes Palantir’s history of facilitating immigration abuses, and urges Congress to ensure that HHS’s data collection does not violate privacy and human rights.  
Detainees/Prisoners – Congress Should Press Immigration & Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) and the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) to Release Eligible Detainees in Order to Curb Spread of COVID-19. AIUSA submitted a statement for a June 2 Senate Judiciary hearing on “Incarceration and Detention During COVID-19.”  Congress should mandate that: (1) ICE release all eligible detainees and (2) BOP release all eligible prisoners.  In addition, Congress should pass the Federal Immigration Release for Safety and Security Together (“FIRST”) Act (S. 3645, H.R. 6537) to provide urgent and critical restrictions on ICE to limit immigration detention.  
Family Separation 2.0 – Stop ICE from Forcing Families to Choose Either Separation from Their Children or Remaining Indefinitely Detained at Risk of Exposure to COVID-19. In May, reports broke that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) officials were offering detained families a so-called “choice” between continued indefinite detention with their children ,or separation from their children where the child would be released but the parent would remain indefinitely detained. Although ICE initially denied offering parents this “choice,” it conceded at a May 22 congressional hearing that it had. ICE must immediately release children and parents together, to preserve family unity as enshrined in the Flores settlement and international law and to protect them from COVID-19.   
 
b) U.S. 
Gun Violence – Congress Should Pass Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671, H.R. 4836). Violence intervention and prevention projects achieve significant reductions in firearm violence.  However, because of COVID-19, community-based gun violence prevention programs are endangered at a time when they are needed most.  Congress should commit at least $150 million annually for 10 years, and Congress should pass the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671, H.R. 4836) which would provide renewable grants to these evidence-driven programs.  Members of Congress are also encouraged to mark National Gun Violence Awareness Day (June 5) including on their social media channels by using the hashtag #WearOrange.  
Social Media – Executive Order Targeting Social Platforms Is Dangerous and Irresponsible.  On May 28 the President signed an executive order designating that social media companies are shielded from liability for user-generated content.  He issued the executive order after Twitter implemented a new policy of fact-checking tweets.  AIUSA released a statement denouncing the executive order. Everyone should have access to information, especially during a pandemic, where accurate information could mean the difference between life and death.   
  
b) Asia 
Hong Kong – Chinese Government Introduces New “National Security” Legislation to Intensify Crackdown on Hong Kong Protests. On May 22 China’s parliament, National People’s Congress (“NPC”), proposed new “national security” legislation that poses a serious threat to human rights in Hong Kong. In late May 2020 Amnesty International published a new briefing documenting how police have met protestors with tear gas, batons, and water cannons in protests over the national security and anti-sedition law introduced by the NPC in Beijing. The draft proposal bypasses Hong Kong’s legislature and would outlaw “subversion” against the central government. The proposed law would allow China’s security officials to operate in Hong Kong, increasing the risks of persecution of dissidents and activists. A May 30 Amnesty International oped explains how Chinese authorities have used a broad definition of “national security” to target journalists, activists and critics. Further, authorities have banned the June 4 vigil marking the Tiananmen Square massacre anniversary, citing COVID-19 concerns. On June 1 Amnesty International released a statement calling on authorities to help facilitate a socially distant vigil as opposed to banning it.

China – AIUSA Applauds Passage of Uyghur Human Rights and Policy Act (S. 3744). On May 27 the House passed legislation to hold Chinese government officials accountable for the arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.  Thanks to Senator Rubio (R-FL), Senator Menendez (D-NJ), Congressman Smith (R-NJ-4) and Congressman Suozzi (D-NY-3) for getting this bill passed through Congress. We urge the President to swiftly sign the legislation into law.

Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories – Congress Should Pressure Israeli Authorities to Lift Travel Ban on Amnesty International Campaigner. Since October 2019 Israeli authorities have barred Laith Abu Zeyad, Amnesty International Campaigner on Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories. Laith, a Palestinian living in the occupied West Bank, is barred from travelling abroad for undisclosed “security reasons.” Amnesty’s previous attempts to repeal the ban through administrative channels have been rejected. Congress should pressure Israeli authorities to lift Laith’s travel ban as it has impaired his ability to do critical human rights work.   
Qatar – Contact Tracing App Security Flaw Exposed Sensitive Personal Details of More Than One Million. A recent investigation by Amnesty International’s Security Lab discovered a critical weakness in the configuration of Qatar’s EHTERAZ contact tracing app. Amnesty alerted the Qatari authorities to the vulnerability shortly after making the discovery on May 21. The authorities acted swiftly to fix the weakness. The vulnerability would have allowed cyber attackers to access highly sensitive personal information, including the name, national ID, health status and location data of more than one million users. Serious security vulnerabilities in Qatar’s mandatory contact tracing app is a wake-up call for all governments rolling-out COVID-19 apps to ensure privacy safeguards are central to the technology.

Detained for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression, Ramzy Razeek must be immediately and unconditionally released, and all charges against him dropped.  
TAKE ACTION:  
  
Dear Mr. Wickramaratne, 
I am deeply worried about the fate of Ramzy Razeek, who was arbitrarily detained on 9 April 2020 for simply exercising his right to peaceful freedom of expression on Facebook. Further to my concern is the fact that Ramzy’s family have not been allowed to communicate with him since the arrest. With several health complications, including arthritis, kidney failure, liver problems and leg ulcers, it is critical that he receives adequate access to healthcare. 
I understand that Ramzy Razeek filed a complaint through email to you at 11:04 AM on 9 April 2020 for death threats he received in response to recent social media posts on his private Facebook account. However, instead of thoroughly and effectively investigating the threats, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) arrested Ramzy for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. According to his lawyers, the Police cited the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act and Computer Crimes Act for his arrest. 
The use of the ICCPR Act to detain and prosecute people for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression is a clear violation of international human rights law, and an infringement of the rights guaranteed by the constitution of Sri Lanka. 
Ramzy Razeek is now at heightened risk due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As this devastating virus sweeps across the globe, prisons are at risk of becoming a dangerous hotspot for COVID-19 outbreaks. It is more important than ever that states take urgent measures to protect all those who are deprived of their liberty, especially by releasing all individuals who are held simply for peacefully expressing their human rights. 
I therefore, urge you to drop all charges against Ramzy Razeek and immediately and unconditionally release him; pending his release, provide him with adequate access to healthcare, and contact with family and lawyers; and stop using ICCPR Act to threaten, harass and prosecute dissidents and activists for peacefully expressing their opinions. 
Yours sincerely,

The individuals who have been targeted are believed to have either bought or read books printed by the publisher, or to have worked for the publishing house.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc, 
I am writing about the crackdown against members and patrons of the Liberal Publishing House (Nhà Xuất Bản Tự Do), a local independent publisher that has produced books on public policy and political thought in Viet Nam. I find it distressing to learn about two of its members who have been arbitrary detained and tortured, and many others who have had to flee for their safety over the last year. 
On 8 May 2020, police in Ho Chi Minh City arrested and detained Thủy Tuất, a member of Liberal Publishing House when he was delivering books to a reader. Thủy Tuất was interrogated and brutally tortured. Upon release, despite having serious injuries, Thủy Tuất went into hiding fearing that police might re-arrest him. Subsequently, police arrested his 24-year-old daughter and refuse to release her unless Thủy Tuất returns to the police station. She remains in detention. 
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Police in Ho Chi Minh City have been accused of arbitrarily detaining and torturing a staff member of Liberal Publishing House before. Across the country, hundreds of people have reported their experience of being interrogated for buying books from Liberal Publishing House since October 2019. 
Both Viet Nam’s Constitution and international human rights law guarantee the right to freedom of expression, which includes the right to receive and impart information and ideas. This includes accessing and reading information contained in books such as those printed by the Liberal Publishing House. 
I urge you to release Thủy Tuất’s daughter immediately and stop the harassment and intimidation against Thủy Tuất and his family; stop the crackdown against Liberal Publishing House and its supporters immediately, and order an independent and thorough investigation into the alleged torture and arbitrary detention cases; and ensure that Liberal Publishing House and other independent publishers can enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and information.

After an unfair trial characterized by lack of notification for the defense and a collapse of the defendant in the court room, an appeals court sentenced Karim Tabbou to one year in prison for speech related charges. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
Karim Tabbou’s trial was yet again postponed to 1 June 2020, as part of regulations to control the spread of COVID-19. Karim Tabbou has been imprisoned for more than 8 months now and has suffered dire health conditions in prison as reported by his lawyers who continue to pay him visits. 
Karim Tabbou was first arrested on 11 September 2019 and charged with “undermining the morale of the army” which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison under article 75 of the penal code. More than two weeks after this arrest, he was released on 25 September 2019, pending trial. To his surprise, he was immediately arrested again the next day for a video that he had published in April 2019. This time, he was charged with “inciting to commit acts of violence with the intention of harming national defense” and “harming national unity” by preparing and publishing videos on social media. For these speech-related charges, Tabbou was first tried before the Sidi M’hamed first instance court on 11 March 2020. The court sentenced him to a fine and 12 months in prison, 6 months of which were suspended. He was due for release on 25 March 2020 having already served the six months in prison. However, a day before the due release date, on March 24, the Ruisseau Court of Appeals upheld his conviction in a trial that violated fair trial principles and returned him to prison. 
Karim was only notified of the trial the same morning, when he was then transferred from Koléa prison to the appeals court without his family or lawyers’ knowledge. His lawyers were only notified of the trial by a colleague who happened to be at the courtroom at the time. Karim collapsed at the court room due to a spike in blood pressure and his lawyers rushed to court to find him at the courtroom’s infirmary. They boycotted the trial after the judges refused to postpone it and pronounced a verdict in absentia in a flagrant violation of his due process rights. 
I ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Karim Tabbou and quash his conviction as he is a prisoner of conscience. Pending his release, I call on you to ensure he has access to adequate health care and protection from the risks of infection with COVID19. I finally call on you to investigate the conditions of his arrest and detention and release all other prisoners of conscience in Algeria. 
Yours sincerely,

The prison authorities failed to transfer him to the SSSP for seven weeks to attend his detention renewal session.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Counselor, 
Amid rising fears over the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Egypt’s overcrowded prisons, the Egyptian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release prisoner of conscience Patrick Zaki George. Patrick should never have been detained for his legitimate work as a human rights defender. His asthma puts him at a higher risk to the virus according to the World Health Organization’s list of vulnerable groups. The well-documented concerns over overcrowded, unhygienic and unsanitary detention conditions in Egyptian prisons aggravate risks of the spread of COVID-19 infections. 
Patrick’s last family prison visit was on 9 March 2020. The following day, the Egyptian authorities suspended all prison visits as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, the authorities failed to introduce regular alternative means of communication between detainees and their families and lawyers, including bi-monthly phone calls as prescribed by Egyptian law. Some, but not all, inmates have been able to send and receive letters. 
On 7 February 2020, immigration officers at Cairo airport arbitrarily arrested human rights researcher Patrick Zaki George at 4:30 am upon his return from Italy where he had been doing an Erasmus study program in Bologna. According to his lawyers, Egyptian National Security Agency (NSA) officers asked him about his human rights work during his time in Egypt and beat him on his stomach and back and tortured him with electric shocks on his upper body during interrogation. The following day, prosecutors in al-Mansoura ordered his detention for 15 days pending investigations on “terrorism”-related charges. Prosecutors said they were relying on Facebook posts as evidence but did not allow him or his lawyer to examine them. 
I ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Patrick Zaki George as his detention stems solely from his human rights work and political opinions he has expressed on social media. I also urge you to open an independent investigation into torture allegations. I further urge the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience. All persons in detention in Egypt must be guaranteed access to lawyers, family and adequate healthcare, especially if they are at high risk of COVID-19.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Attorney-General U Tun Tun Oo, 
I urge you to drop the politically motivated charges against Aung Marm Oo. As Editor-in-Chief and Executive Director of Development Media Group (DMG), it is believed that he is being targeted due to the news agency’s reporting on violations during the ongoing armed conflict between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army in Rakhine and Chin States. 
It is concerning to learn that, more than a year after Special Branch police filed charges under Section 17(2) of the Unlawful Associations Act, the authorities have yet to provide information in writing to his family or to Development Media Group about why Aung Marm Oo has been charged. No explanation has been provided about why the authorities searched his house; questioned his family members; and interrogated his colleagues about his whereabouts. 
Under international human rights law and standards, all people charged with criminal offenses have the right to be promptly informed in detail about the nature and cause of the charges against them. The right to freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media. I am also alarmed by the ongoing crackdown on independent media and peaceful activists in Myanmar. At least three media workers from other media outlets have been accused of violating counter-terrorism laws in the last two months, and DMG is facing difficulties in renewing its media and publishing licenses. 
I request that you drop all charges against Aung Marm Oo and other media workers facing imprisonment for doing their journalistic work; review and repeal, or amend laws that restrict the right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, to bring them in line with international human rights standards; and ensure a safe environment for all media workers, human rights defenders and activists to carry out their work and exercise their human rights.

Detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression, Shafiqul Islam Kajol is a prisoner of conscience and must be released immediately and unconditionally.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Honorable Minister Khan, 
I am relieved to learn that Bangladeshi photographer and newspaper editor Shafiqul Islam Kajol is alive, after being disappeared for 53 days. I am, however, concerned that instead of ensuring his wellbeing and letting him return to his family, authorities are holding him in indefinite pre-trial detention. 
It now appears that he faces at least three cases under the repressive 2018 Digital Security Act (DSA), for allegedly publishing “false, offensive, illegally obtained and defamatory” content on Facebook that “could deteriorate law and order”. The DSA violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Bangladesh is a state party. 
The police have also registered a fourth case against Shafiqul Islam Kajol under the Bangladesh Passport Order, 1973 accusing him of “trespassing” into his own country on 3 May 2020, the day Benapole police confirmed having him in custody. The Jashore magistrate court granted him bail in the “trespassing” case, but police refused to let him go and filed another case against him later that evening under section 54 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 to keep him in detention until he is prosecuted under the DSA. 
At a time when countries across the world, including Bangladesh, are taking steps to release prisoners to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, it is disheartening to know that Shafiqul Islam Kajol is being kept in jail. 
I call on you and the Bangladesh government to immediately and unconditionally release Shafiqul Islam Kajol and close investigations against him and all those held solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression; decriminalize defamation, and treat it as a matter of civil litigation; and promptly amend the Digital Security Act in compliance with international human rights law including ICCPR, to which Bangladesh is a state party and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance

1) This Month’s Feature 
World Health Organization – Amnesty International USA Calls on Trump Administration to Reverse its Decision to Halt Funding for the World Health Organization (“WHO”). In an April 20 letter to Congress, Amnesty International USA expressed serious concerns about the Trump Administration’s decision to freeze funding to the WHO, pending a two-month review. Congress must press the White House to reverse the decision to suspend payments. The WHO plays a key role in coordinating the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The White House decision to suspend financial support to the WHO imperils the lives of people around the world. 
  
2) Major Human Rights News 
a) RightsNow! – Amnesty International USA Launches New Campaign to Center Human Rights in the COVID-19 Response and Recovery. On May 11 Amnesty International USA will launch a new campaign to put human rights at the center of the U.S. government’s COVID-19 response and recovery. The campaign, called RightsNow!, includes a 10-Point Plan on COVID-19 and human rights; a new call on Homeland Security (“DHS”) to free all families from immigration detention and protect them from COVID-19; and a new call on Congress to fund community gun violence prevention programs and pass the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671, H.R. 4836). 
Gun Violence – Congress Should Fund Community Gun Violence Prevention and Pass the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671, H.R. 4836). Communities of color that are already disproportionately impacted by gun violence are also hit the hardest by COVID-19.  Community organizations designed to prevent gun violence have had to cut staff, programming, and outreach, drastically affecting their ability to curb gun violence. Congress should commit at least $150 million annually for 10 years to community gun violence prevention programs and establish a national strategy to address the disproportionate impact of this public health crisis on communities of color by passing the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671 H.R. 4836). 
Immigration Detention – Homeland Security Should Release Immigration Detainees. DHS is locking up around 250 families in arbitrary and prolonged detention at three U.S. facilities in Pennsylvania and Texas. Although children are supposed to be held in these facilities for no more than 20 days under the long-standing FloresSettlement Agreement, that limit is regularly ignored. These children and parents came here seeking safety from violence and persecution and were instead thrown behind bars. Now, during a global pandemic, they are exposed to a deadly virus and increased risk of COVID-19 infection while in crowded conditions with inadequate hygiene and negligent medical care. Congress should press DHS/ICE to free all families now. 
Amnesty International USA Publishes 10-Point Plan to Center Human Rights in the COVID-19 Response and Recovery. Governments and communities across the world are grappling with the immediate and longer-term implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone in the U.S. is impacted by this, and many are experiencing hardship, sacrifice, illness or devastating loss as a result of this virus. Yet some of us are affected much more deeply as our country’s long-standing inequalities — including by gender, by race and by class — shape everything, from who performs the “essential” functions of the economy to which communities suffer the greatest loss of life. How we respond now to COVID-19 will determine not only our ability to survive — but whether we all can finally thrive. The U.S. government’s response to COVID-19 must center human rights at all stages of the crisis — prevention, preparedness, containment, treatment and recovery — in order to best protect public health and support people who are most at risk; Amnesty International’s new 10-Point Plan shows how. 
  
b) Immigration – President Trump’s Ban on Immigration Will Not Stop the Spread of COVID-19. On April 22 President Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting immigration for 60 days. The President must not manipulate the pandemic to further his xenophobic agenda. The U.S. cannot address the spread of COVID-19 without the unending efforts of immigrants providing healthcare and home aid, staffing grocery stores, and producing food, whose work has been deemed essential while they are simultaneously struggle to access to care, support, and services. 
  
c) Detainees/Prisoners – Congress Must Press for Release of Prisoners of Conscience Worldwide. As prisoners of conscience around the world languish in prisons, Amnesty International calls on Congress to help get them released now. The tragic news of the passing of prominent Saudi human rights defender Dr Abdullah al-Hamidwhile in detention last week highlights the even more urgent need for authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience. On May 4 Amnesty International launched aglobal campaigncalling for the release of all prisoners of conscience worldwide, highlighting 150 emblematic cases. Members of Congress can select a case from the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission’s Defending Freedoms Project, and advocate on behalf of that prisoner of conscience and help to get them released. 
  
d) Gender – In Response to Increase in Domestic Violence During Time of COVID-19, 
Congress Must Prioritize Ending Gender-Based Violence (“GBV”) Globally. Levels of gender-based violence (“GBV) globally are rising due to COVID-19. Amnesty International USA joined the Coalition to End Violence Against Women and Girls Globally to call on Congress to ensure adequate funding to address GBV; support program measures that integrate GBV prevention and mitigation; ensure U.S. Government programs are based on a gender analysis and that sex- and age-disaggregated data is collected. 
Senate Must Pass Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”) Reauthorization (S. 2843). During COVID-19 reports of domestic violence have increased, and yet the Senate has since allowed VAWA to lapse, leaving shelters and services in even more chaos as funding streams dry up.  The House has passed a reauthorization that further closes the legal loophole that has contributed to high rates of violence against Native women, expands tribal jurisdiction over crimes such as rape, and closes the “boyfriend loophole” that has allowed stalkers and abusers to keep guns. The Senate should pass the version introduced by Senator Feinstein (S.2843), which includes these stronger protections for Native women and closes the “boyfriend loophole.” 
Commission on Unalienable Rights Must Protect Human Rights of Women and Girls. On May 1 Amnesty International joined 167 signatories in raising grave concerns about the work of the State Department’s Commission on Unalienable Rights and any potential report or output that undermines the international human rights system and purports to reinterpret its respective treaties and monitoring bodies. 
  
e) Asia 
Rohingya – Humanitarian Response to COVID-19 Must Address Heightened Risks to Older Refugees. In an April report Amnesty International documented how older Rohingya refugees in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh are being left out in the humanitarian response to COVID-19. Since older people face higher health risks from COVID-19, the lack of adequate care could have deadly consequences. Older people have been disproportionately impactedby the conflict and displacement in Myanmar. Any humanitarian response must prioritize older peoples’ access to health, food, water and sanitation. 
India – Indian Authorities’ Harassment of Journalists Violates Freedom of Expression. Since the onset of COVID-19, Indian authorities have been harassing journalists. Authorities accused Masrat Zahra, an award-winning photojournalist, on April 20 of “uploading anti-national posts [on Facebook] with criminal intentions to induce the youth.” Indian authorities must stop the harassment and intimidation of journalists through draconian laws that threaten the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and create an atmosphere of fear and reprisal. 
Hong Kong – Authorities Must Not Use the Pandemic to Further Restrict Freedom of Assembly. On April 18 Hong Kong authorities arrested 15 prominent pro-democracy leaders and activists for their role in organizing and joining “unauthorized assemblies” that took place six months earlier. The Chinese government is taking further action to crack down on protesters in Hong Kong. 
  
f) Africa – Congress Should Press AFRICOM for Details of New Reporting on Civilian Casualties. On April 1, the U.S. Africa Command (“AFRICOM”) announced it would begin regular reporting on civilian casualties resulting from its military operations in Africa. Although it has taken more than a decade, this is an important step towards providing truth and accountability for the African victims of U.S. air strikes and their families.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Mr Wickramaratne, 
I am deeply concerned about the arrest and detention of Sri Lankan lawyer, Hejaaz Hizbullah, on 14 April 2020. Two weeks have passed, and he has not been informed of any charges, nor has he been granted access to lawyers, and his right to appear before a court to challenge the lawfulness of his detention has been violated. These are all violations of rights guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sri Lanka is a state party. 
Mr. Hejaaz’s family is concerned about his safety, a fear heightened by his prolonged detention without charge and without access to a lawyer and believes that he has been targeted for his professional work as lawyer in various civil and political rights cases. According to international human rights law, anyone who is arrested or detained has the right to be informed of the reasons for their arrest, the charges against them and has the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a court without undue delay 
I urge you to release Mr. Hejaaz or, if there is sufficient evidence of criminal wrongdoing, charge him with a recognizable offense, in accordance with international standards. Pending release or charge, I call on you to ensure that his fair trial rights are guaranteed, including his unrestricted access to a lawyer and his right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention. 
Yours sincerely,

0,Judge to government: promptly and safely release kids from detention centers,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/judge-to-government-release-kids-from-detention-centers/,Responding to a decision by Judge Dolly M. Gee of the United States District Court directing the government to make every effort to promptly and safely release children currently being … ,"Responding to a decision by Judge Dolly M. Gee of the United States District Court directing the government to make every effort to promptly and safely release children currently being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody, including children subjected to the so-called “Remain in Mexico” program, or the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), Denise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA said: 
“It is well past time that children were released. No child should ever be detained because of their immigration status and the continued detention of children as a global pandemic has spread quickly and forcefully, has placed lives at great and unnecessary risk. 
“We have documented again and again that conditions these children have been placed into are dangerous, unsupportive, and cannot arguably be considered in any child’s best interests during a health emergency. The best interests of the child are to be with their family, and their community. 
“Children in ORR custody should be expeditiously released to sponsors, and children detained by ICE must be released together with their parents, guardians, and caregivers. It is unconscionable that ICE continues to balk at releasing children with their mothers and fathers, let alone from detention. ICE must stop separating families. 
“Once released, the children can finally receive the care they needed all long, but only time will tell how many have been impacted by close contact in facilities and have had their health already compromised in dangerous and cruel ways.” 
Background 
Amnesty International USA is calling for the release of all families from ICE detention, and has launched a campaign featuring three families held in prolonged detention, including a 1-year-old who at one point was hospitalized and placed on a machine to breathe. Amnesty International USA is further calling for immigrants and asylum-seekers to be released, many who have family, faith, and other community members in the U.S. long waiting to welcome them, and for the government to ensure all people have the same access to care and safety – no matter where they may be. Amnesty International has documented the negligent care and ill treatment in immigration detention of people seeking safety in the U.S., including families in three ICE detention facilities, further jeopardizing them during COVID-19. 
Amnesty International has documented how President Trump’s policy of family separation has in some cases constituted torture as defined under U.S. and international law,  denounced the Remain in Mexico policy which has pushed asylum-seekers into dangerous and precarious conditions in Mexico, and spoken out against asylum agreements and asylum bans that cut off access to the U.S. asylum system.

The threat followed the publication of her article about the spread of COVID-19 in Chechnya. She is in grave danger and Russian authorities must take urgent steps to ensure her safety. 
 TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President Putin, 
I am writing to express my grave concern regarding the death threat posted on Instagram by the Head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov on 13 April. The threat is aimed at Novaya Gazeta journalist Elena Milashina and came as a reaction to her article, published in Novaya Gazeta on 12 April, regarding the authorities’ response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Chechnya. Ramzan Kadyrov accused Novaya Gazeta and its journalists of being “puppets of the West” and directly appealed to the Presidential administration and the Federal Security Service (FSB) “to stop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people.” He further alluded that unless they do it, someone in Chechnya would have to commit a crime to silence the journalist. 
I am concerned that the Presidential Press Secretary dismissed those very real and serious threats as “nothing out of the ordinary” and a mere “emotional” reaction “which is understandable in such a (COVID-19 pandemic) situation.” Moreover, the Prosecutor General’s office ordered that Elena Milashina’s article be removed from the Novaya Gazeta website. 
This is not the first time that threats and attacks against human rights defenders and journalists in Russia are being neglected and even condoned by the authorities. This is a violation of Russia’s international human rights obligations to protect human rights defenders and journalists and to promote freedom of expression. 
I call on you to publicly condemn the threats against Elena Milashina and take meaningful steps to ensure that this does not happen again and that Elena Milashina is safe; and to uphold the right of journalists to investigate and report on the COVID-19 pandemic and to protect the right to freedom of expression and information.

Trump to sign an executive order “to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States”, Joanne Lin, the national advocacy director of Amnesty International USA, said: 
“While the scope of Trump’s new proposed policy is unclear, the message it sends is: the President is manipulating a pandemic to further the bigotry and xenophobia that have been hallmarks of his presidency from day one. 
“We are one country and there is no way we could address the spread of COVID-19 without the unending efforts of immigrants providing healthcare and home aid, staffing grocery stores, and producing food, whose work has been deemed essential while they are simultaneously struggle to access to care, support, and services. 
“As the United States leads in COVID cases in the world, measures that health experts agree will stop the spread, like access to widespread testing and self-isolation, have been derided and undermined by Trump. If President Trump wants to limit the spread and the deaths occurring under his leadership, now is the time to look to health experts, and not point fingers at immigrants.” 
Background and context 
Amnesty International has documented anti-immigrant policies enacted by President Trump since his first week in office, when he signed what has become known as the Muslim ban and set into motion a series of events that continue to leave families in uncertainty and danger to this day. Amnesty International USA has stood against the Muslim ban from its first iteration, calling on Congress to nullify it through passage of the NO BAN Act (H.R. 2214 / S. 1123). Amnesty USA’s members from around the country mobilized against the ban in states across the country, participated in a protest march and rally in DC, delivered a nationwide petition to Congressional leadership, and galvanized communities in airports and conducted gatherings to inform people of their rights. 
In the aftermath of the ban, AIUSA created a dozen case studies of the harms caused to individuals and families from Yemen, Iran, Sudan and elsewhere and documented the ways lives had been upended by the ban, and in 2019, Amnesty International USA’s researchers traveled to Lebanon and Jordan to conduct nearly 50 interviews with refugees that as a result of the ban, have been stranded in countries where they face restrictive policies, increasingly hostile environments, and lack the same rights as permanent residents or citizens. AIUSA’s report, “The Mountain is in Front of Us and the Sea is Behind Us,” documented how Trump’s discriminatory policies have decimated refugee resettlement from Lebanon and Jordan, which host the highest number of refugees in the world relative to their populations. Amnesty International has also detailed how returns of refugees from Lebanon to Syria is premature and, in late 2019, published a further report, Sent to a war zone: Turkey’s illegal deportations of Syrian refugees, detailing how Turkey has deported Syrian refugees to Syria where they are at grave risk. 
Amnesty International has documented how President Trump’s policy of family separation has in some cases constituted torture as defined under U.S. and international law, documented the negligent care and ill treatment of people seeking safety in the U.S. further jeopardizing them during COVID-19, denounced the Remain in Mexico policy which has pushed asylum-seekers into dangerous and precarious conditions in Mexico, and spoken out against asylum agreements and asylum bans that cut off access to the U.S. asylum system.

However, the law excludes many prisoners that should qualify for early release, including journalists, human rights defenders and others imprisoned unfairly under anti-terror laws simply for exercising their rights, and people in pre-trial detention. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I have learned that Parliament passed a law on 13 April which will allow the early release of up to 90,000 prisoners. In the context of the deadly spread of COVID-19 across Turkey, any decrease of numbers of prisoners in Turkey’s overcrowded and unsanitary prisons is a welcome step. 
However, the law fails to include many persons who should qualify for early release, and as a result, is putting the lives of thousands of prisoners and staff at serious risk. According to your own figures, at the time of writing, three prisoners have died, and 17 prisoners and 79 prison staff have tested positive. 
Due to the seriousness of the situation, I urge you to immediately release unjustly imprisoned people including journalists, human rights defenders, activists and others jailed unfairly under anti-terror laws simply for exercising their rights; give urgent consideration to the release of those held in prison on pre-trial detention who have not been convicted of any offense and those who are at particular risk in prison from COVID-19 where their health cannot be guaranteed; ensure that those who cannot be released have access to medical attention and healthcare to the same standards that are available in the community, including when it comes to testing, prevention and treatment of COVID-19; and ensure prison staff and healthcare workers have access to adequate information, equipment, training and support to protect themselves.

The Bangladesh government must drop the case against Emdadul Haque Milon filed under the Digital Security Act, which is a highly repressive law with vague provisions, harsh punishment and violates international human rights law. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Honorable Minister Khan, 
While it is encouraging that Emdadul Haque Milon was granted bail on 26 March 2020, after serving 23 days in prison, it is alarming that he still faces a seven-year prison sentence, if convicted, for a Facebook post criticizing the decision to invite the Indian Prime Minister for a state visit. 
Emdadul Haque Milon could face charges under sections 25(2), 29(1) and 31(2) of the Digital Security Act (DSA). He alleges the case against him was filed by Billal Hossain Sarker, general secretary of the Muktagachha unit of Awami League to stop him from securing a government contract. This is a clear example of a worrying trend of State agencies using draconian laws, like the DSA, to intimidate and muzzle dissent on social media. 
Bangladesh is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Under Article 19 of the ICCPR, Bangladesh has an obligation to ensure that “Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference”, making clear that the case against Emdadul Haque Milon violates international human rights law. 
I therefore call on you to ensure the Bangladesh authorities immediately close the investigation against Emdadul Haque Milon and all those implicated solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression; decriminalize defamation, and treat it as a matter of civil litigation; and promptly amend the Digital Security Act in compliance with international human rights law including ICCPR, to which Bangladesh is a State party.

April 6, 2020  
The world is facing an herculean challenge as coronavirus cases have exceeded one million and the death toll has surpassed 64,000 worldwide.  In responding to the COVID-19 crisis, the U.S. should prioritize human rights for all, with particular attention to people locked up in jails, prisons, and detention facilities.  All governments must uphold international human rights law and standards in responding to COVID-19.  Governments must protect every person’s right to health, economic security, non-discrimination, and access to information. For breaking news on Amnesty’s response to COVID-19 and our policy recommendations, check out our website here.  
While the coronavirus does not discriminate, the President and senior administration officials have called it the “Chinese Virus” and “Wuhan Virus,” in turn encouraging xenophobic attacks and remarks against Asian-Americans.  The U.S. government responses to COVID-19 must not stigmatize any country or population.  Instead of blaming China for the pandemic, the U.S. must cooperate with all nations to produce and disseminate critical health gear and equipment.

1) U.S. – Federal Government Must Uphold Human Rights in Response to COVID-19. Amnesty International USA (“AIUSA”) calls on the President, Vice President and Congress to ensure adequate funding and support, accessibility and affordability of care, protection for healthcare workers, and the mitigation of risks that disproportionately affect marginalized groups. The administration must take immediate action to ensure that every person who requests access to COVID-19 testing can receive it and that adequate and quality personal protective equipment, information, training, and psychosocial support are available to support nurses, doctors, and other response staff on the front lines.  
a) Asylum Seekers – Trump Administration Must Not Use Pandemic to Justify Its Ban on Asylum Seekers.  On March 20 the Trump administration’s rule and accompanying order went into effect allowing officials to turn back asylum seekers and unaccompanied children without affording them any legal process.  The ban on asylum forces asylum seekers into perilous conditions along the border, endangering their lives and jeopardizing public health.  It also dispenses with long-established critical protections passed by a bipartisan Congress providing for trafficking screenings and safeguards for unaccompanied children.  Leaked Border Patrol guidance about the new asylum ban confirms that asylum seekers are given no screening for fear of persecution whatsoever before being summarily pushed back or repatriated, in stark violation of U.S. legal obligations.  Amnesty demands that U.S. border officials continue to allow people to follow the legal process to request asylum, and provide screening and referral to health facilities.  
b) Immigration Detainees – Homeland Security Must Immediately Release Detainees. On March 17 AIUSA called on Homeland Security (“DHS”) to immediately release all detained asylum seekers and immigrants in order to prevent infection, illness and death for detainees and facility staff.  There have already been several confirmed cases of COVID-19 among staff and detainees in detention facilities in four different states; this number is likely under-representative considering inadequate access to testing, particularly in detention facilities. Given that social distancing is impossible in detention and any virus will spread rapidly in the overcrowded facilities, DHS must immediately release immigrants from detention facilities or the number of cases will grow exponentially.  At least 92 percent of asylum seekers have close family and friends whom they could live with in the U.S.  Detainees must be released on humanitarian parole to sponsors including friends, family, and where appropriate, NGO shelters.    
c) Gun Violence – Top 10 Ways COVID-19 Intersects with Gun Violence. After the Trump Administration deemed gun stores to be an essential business, AIUSA explained how the COVID-19 pandemic intersects with gun violence.  COVID-19 will exacerbate the already devastating crisis of gun violence with first-time buyers rushing to buy guns, children at home with unsecured guns, and domestic violence survivors stuck at home with their abusers.  Congress must pass into law: Ethan’s Law (H.R. 2867, S. 193), the Background Check Expansion Act (S.42), Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (S. 2843), the Extreme Risk Protection Act (H.R. 1236, S. 506), the Disarm Hate Act (H.R. 2708, S. 1462), and the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (H.R. 4836, S. 2671).  
d) Privacy – Congress Must Pass Measures to Protect Personal Health Data in COVID-19 Relief Packages. With governments across the world rapidly expanding the use of digital surveillance to combat COVID-19, Amnesty published a list of strict conditions that must be met to safeguard human rights and prevent surveillance overreach.  Congress must ensure that any relief package includes privacy protections for personal health data including protections for new data collection, processing, and sharing, and real consequences for violations of privacy protection laws during a national emergency.  For more information, join Amnesty’s April 7 telephonic briefing “Technology and Surveillance During the Age of COVID-19.” To RSVP, email [email protected]. 
e) Environment – EPA Must Immediately Revoke Suspension of Environmental Protections. On March 27 the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would suspend enforcement of environmental laws indefinitely due to the pandemic.  The enforcement of these laws is necessary to save hundreds of thousands of people from premature death each year and millions more from unnecessary illness.  The Trump administration must not use this crisis to gut environmental regulations. 
  
2) How Is COVID-19 Affecting Vulnerable Populations Around the World?  
a) Refugees – Refugees Have No Nations Fighting for Their Health and Survival Amidst Pandemic.  The World Health Organization and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have made clear that asylum seekers, refugees, and displaced peoples face distinct risks that will only grow worse as the pandemic spreads across the world. 
Bangladesh: For the nearly one million refugees in Cox’s Bazar District (the world’s most populous refugee camp), social distancing is not an option in overcrowded camps with inadequate health care.  On March 24 Bangladesh authorities reported the first case of COVID-19 in Cox’s Bazar District, home to nearly 860,000 Rohingya refugees forced to flee Myanmar, most of them as a result of crimes the United Nations (“UN”) has said likely amount to genocide. In late March 2020 Amnesty interviewed 15 older Rohingya refugees living in refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar. The UN Refugee Agency indicates there are more than 31,500 refugees age 60 or older in the camps.  Information about the illness and measures to prevent its spread is failing to reach many older people, thereby placing older Rohingya refugees in imminent danger. 
Greece:  Amnesty documented in a March 2020 report how thousands of older people, people with chronic diseases, children, pregnant women, new mothers and people with disabilities are trapped in dangerously overcrowded conditions in the Greek Islands.  The population has extremely limited access to water, toilets, and showers, and is forced to wait in line for hours for food.  Anyone who arrived after July 2019 has not been allowed to access public health care. 
Lebanon:  Amnesty documented in April 2020 how Syrian refugees in Lebanon are in dire need of preventative equipment like sanitizer and disinfectant so they can protect themselves from contracting the virus.   
Bosnia and Herzegovina:  In March 2020 local authorities in Una-Sana Canton in Bosnia and Herzegovina forcibly transferred and confined thousands of migrants to an inadequate tent camp in Lipa. This forced people to hastily set up remote tent facilities without adequate access to water and sanitation, spaces to self-isolate, and accessible medical care.   
b. Detainees/Prisoners – Detainees/Prisoners Are at Heightened Risk of Infection.  Amnesty has called on the governments of Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Syria and Turkey to immediately and unconditionally release human rights defenders.  In overcrowded prisons it is impossible to isolate people who may have contracted the virus.  Limited access to health services and hygiene products increase the risks of exposure to infection and hinder recovery.  Authorities should release detainees especially those with underlying medical conditions and the elderly and authorities should also consider releasing those people in pre-trial detention. 
  
3) How Are Governments’ Responses to COVID-19 Affecting Human Rights Around the World?  
a) Latin America and Caribbean – Governments Must Not Use the Pandemic to Violate Human Rights.  Governments in the Americas have begun to impose states of emergencies, travel bans, and quarantines.  Amnesty calls on governments to prevent discrimination, provide adequate resources to at-risk groups, stop the use of repression or excessive force in enforcement of public health measures, and stop limiting of access to information.  States must guarantee workers’ rights and economic security, access to adequate water, sanitation and health care for all, and protect people’s right to privacy.  
  
b) Asia 
Cambodia – Cambodia Must Not Institute Proposed State of Emergency Law. On March 31 a leaked-legislative draft which imposes a state of emergency law in Cambodia with no checks and balances or periodic review was reported. These measures include provisions for conducting surveillance on all telecommunications mediums “using any means necessary,” and the power to ban or restrict the distribution of information that could scare the public and cause unrest.  Other powers include restrictions on freedom of movement and assembly, the seizure of private property, and the power to enforce quarantines. The Cambodian government must not use the COVID-19 crisis to grab unchecked power.   
India – India Must Restore Full Access to Internet in Kashmir.  Amnesty calls on the Indian government to restore full access to the internet in Kashmir.  Despite the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, on March 17 the Indian government ordered continued restrictions on full internet services by restricting speed to 2G in Kashmir.  
  
 Europe – Hungary Leader Must Not Use State of Emergency to Grant Himself Unlimited Powers.  On March 30 the Parliament of Hungary passed the Bill on Protection against the Coronavirus which empowers the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban to rule by decree.  The bill also creates two new crimes that could lead to the imprisonment of government critics for up to five years:  (1) “presenting false or distorted facts that interfere with public safety” and (2) “interfering with the operation of a quarantine.”  These crimes are vaguely defined and provide ample space for abuse. Additionally, the bill includes no sunset clause, potentially allowing Orban to rule indefinitely without checks on his power. Amnesty Hungary has condemned the bill. Amnesty USA urges the U.S. Congress to make known their serious concerns with this measure. 
 Middle East – Qatar Migrant Workers in Labor Camps Are at Grave Risk Amid COVID-19 Crisis. On March 20 Qatari officials locked down the Industrial Area in Doha after hundreds of construction workers became infected with COVID-19.  These camps are home to many migrant workers. Locking them down puts migrant workers at greater risk of exposure to the virus.  Amnesty calls on Qatar to ensure that migrant workers are not further marginalized during this crisis and that they can access health care and sick pay when they are unable to work because of COVID-19. 
  
Above: Migrant workers in Doha, Qatar, are housed in very poor accommodations, sleep in bunk beds in overcrowded rooms, with poor sanitation and sometimes no electricity or running water.

0,Governments Must Halt Dangerous and Discriminatory Detention of Migrants and Asylum Seekers,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/governments-must-halt-dangerous-and-discriminatory-detention-of-migrants-and-asylum-seekers/,"Authorities in a number of countries across the Americas, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Curaçao, and Trinidad and Tobago, among others, are detaining migrants and asylum seekers in a dangerous and discriminatory manner based solely on their migration status, Amnesty International said today. In doing so, they are pushing people into unhygienic and unsafe environments, contrary to international human rights and public health guidelines.","Authorities in a number of countries across the Americas, including Canada, the United States, Mexico, Curaçao, and Trinidad and Tobago, among others, are detaining migrants and asylum seekers in a dangerous and discriminatory manner based solely on their migration status, Amnesty International said today. In doing so, they are pushing people into unhygienic and unsafe environments, contrary to international human rights and public health guidelines. 
“Migration status is irrelevant to every human being’s dignity and their right to live. Instead of putting people’s health at increased risk, governments should be doing everything in their power to protect them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“In order to effectively combat COVID-19 in the Americas and avert thousands of preventable deaths, states should swiftly release people from immigration detention, only detain migrants in extraordinary cases and ensure their access to lifesaving healthcare without discrimination.” 
CANADA 
On March 24, Amnesty International wrote to the Canadian government to express concerns over its inadequate efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among immigrant detainees and recommended swiftly reducing to an absolute minimum the number of people held in immigration detention facilities. 
While the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) only detains a few hundred people in its immigration detention facilities at any given time, the rate of deaths per capita among Canadian immigration detainees is several times higher than that of immigration detainees in the United States. 
The CBSA must detain people only in the most exceptional circumstances and should generally end migration-related detention. In addition to the real risks to the physical health of people in detention during the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological stress is significant for those detained, and for their families. Immigration detainees at the Immigration Holding Centre (IHC) in Laval, Quebec have been so anxious about the risk of contracting COVID-19 in detention that they have gone on hunger strike, as they demand to be released. Psychological impact should be seriously taken into consideration when determining whether it is necessary to detain or maintain detention. 
CURAÇAO 
As of March 30, Curaçao restricted entry to Curaçao to all travelers, including legal residents, until April 12. 
Authorities in Curaçao also often detain Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers and deny them access to international protection. A visit by Refugees International in April 2019concluded: “Not only has the government of Curaçao failed to put in place a protection scheme for this population, it has enforced an ‘active removal strategy’ by arresting, detaining, and deporting Venezuelans with irregular status.” 
As of March 2020, the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform estimated there were 16,500 Venezuelans on the island, but it was unclear how many of those were in migratory detention. During Amnesty International visits in 2018 and 2019, the organization observed appalling conditions including overcrowding, lack of hygiene and inadequate bedding in the areas where people with irregular migration status were detained. 
In May 2018, several cases of ill-treatment upon arrest or in detention were reported to Amnesty International, including those of guards sexually abusing women detainees by asking them for sexual acts in exchange for soap and sanitary towels. In January 2020, asylum lawyers on the island told Amnesty International that several Venezuelans, who had been detained for over eight months already at that time, went on a hunger strike to protest against the conditions in detention. 
Curacao should release and grant access to necessary healthcare and other essential services for all migrants and asylum seekers in migration-related detention. 
MEXICO 
Following the closure of Mexico’s border with Guatemala, and restrictions put in place by other Central American governments, authorities have failed to consider alternatives to detention for migrants who are stuck in detention, instead of being released through deportation by bus to Central America. Although the government announced that detention centres are at 45-percent capacity and are following all sanitary recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19, some detention centres are reportedly overcrowded and even mixing children and teenagers with adult populations due to a lack of space, such as the detention center in Tenosique in the state of Tabasco. 
On March 31, a Guatemalan asylum seeker died after a protest by migrants demanding their release led to a fire in the Tenosique detention center. Amnesty International has received information that could indicate that law enforcement authorities present initially refused to open the gates despite the fire in the premises. To date, Mexican authorities have not made public any information on this death in migration custody, nor regarding over the over ten migrants and asylum seekers that information indicates were wounded in the events. This has not been the only protest in recent days. 
On March 24, hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers protested at Mexico’s largest migration detention center, “Siglo XXI” in Tapachula, Chiapas state, while protests in other detentions centers have also been reported. 
Detainees are still at serious risk of an outbreak and the response from authorities has been insufficient. Furthermore, with no clarity on how long migrants and asylum seekers will remain detained, Mexican authorities could be at risk of breaking their own migration laws and allowing for a regime of indefinite detention, flouting international human rights standards. 
Mexican authorities have the responsibility to work towards finding viable and appropriate alternatives to detention and must start working on doing so right now, especially for groups in a vulnerable situation. The National Migration Institute (INM) confirmed on March 17, that 3,059 irregular migrants remained in detention. 
Mexico should swiftly release as many migrants and asylum seekers as possible from immigrant detention centers, whose right to physical and mental health cannot be upheld in these facilities. 
Due to the dire security situation of migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico, where they are prime targets for violence and exploitation, Mexican authorities must not only release them from detention but also provide them with emergency humanitarian protection to ensure all migrants and asylum seekers have access – free from discrimination – to essential services, care and safety, including adequate food and healthcare. 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO 
On March 18, Trinidad and Tobago responded to COVID-19 by banning entry of all non-nationals for 14 days, and four days later closed its international borders to nationals as well. 
Trinidad and Tobago has no national legislation on refugees. The Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform estimates that some 24,000 Venezuelans live in the country as of March 2020. As of January 2020, 17,391 had applied for asylum with UNHCR, the UN refugee agency mandated to process such claims. Approximately 16,500 of those were also granted temporary visas and work permits in 2019, after the government registered them during a two-week period. 
Nevertheless, the country continues to criminalize and detain migrants and refugees – particularly those fleeing the crisis in Venezuela – who enter irregularly, contrary to international human rights standards. Police said they detained 33 Venezuelans on 17 March, while, as of 23 March, 60 Venezuelan men and women were being detained for irregular entry at the Cedros police station, according to media reports. 
Despite repeated formal requests sent to the Ministry of National Security, Amnesty International has been unable to visit Trinidad’s Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), where in recent years hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers have been held, among other nationalities. Other independent human rights organizations and NGOs are also not permitted access. The precise number of those currently detained at the IDC is unclear, though its capacity is estimated at 150. 
One of the few institutions that has been able to visit the centre – the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights, Equality and Diversity – observed in June 2018 a range of health and sanitation concerns in the detention facilities, which could put detainees at heightened risk of harm during any outbreak of COVID-19. The Committee specifically observed: “the lack of financial resources to construct a designated area for detainees who need to be quarantined due to illness or other considerations.” 
The government of Trinidad and Tobago should release any migrants and asylum seekers held in immigration detention solely for irregular entry or while awaiting their asylum claims and grant them access to necessary healthcare and other essential services, free from discrimination. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
The United States has the largest immigration detention system in the world, with an average daily population of nearly 40,000 immigrants and asylum seekers in over 200 facilities. 
On 24 March, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a US immigration detention facility. Since then, ICE has revealed that 33 of its personnel and employees have contracted the virus, and dozens of detainees have been quarantined as potentially at risk. 
Amnesty International has received disturbing accounts from detainees of dangerous conditions in ICE immigration detention facilities, which puts people with underlying medical conditions at higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. 
Next week Amnesty International will release a report documenting how DHS officials and ICE facilities have failed to adopt adequate measures to ensure public health for everyone, including by supplying soap and sanitizer to those in detention, facilitating social distancing in line with global standards, and providing adequate and responsive health care to those exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.

Like many young people in Belarus, they should not be in prison in the first place. Their health is poor, and with the spread of COVID-19, they and many prisoners face a growing risk.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President, 
Vladislav Sharkovsky and Emil Ostrovko are two of the many young people in Belarus who were arrested as children and have been imprisoned for minor, non-violent drug-related offenses, and whose cases have been a growing matter of concern in the country and internationally. 
Vladislav and Emil have serious health issues. Emil is suffering from chronic asthma. Vladislav was a healthy teenager before his arrest but during his imprisonment his health has deteriorated – he has developed a persistent and recurring cough, flashes and floaters in his vision, and deep vein thrombosis. According to his mother, on 9 March 2020 he complained of a stomach ache in the morning and later that day fainted at mealtime. He was given an injection but the stomach ache persisted, and the prison medical staff did not give him any information about his ailment. 
With the rapid spread of COVID-19, their health and lives, as well as those of numerous other prisoners are at risk. States have a duty to review the need for continued custodial detention and should consider if the current pandemic qualifies prisoners for early or conditional release or other alternative non-custodial measures. The authorities should take into account individual circumstances and the risks posed to groups at risk, such as those with serious medical conditions and those with a weakened immune systems. 
I urge you to consider without delay and approve an early or conditional release for Vladislav and Emil, as they are at heightened risk of becoming severely ill due to COVID-19; implement a process to promptly review the need for continued custodial detention of all prisoners in Belarus who are at heightened risk due to COVID-19, including people with pre-existing medical conditions; and review the country’s anti-drug policy and end the practice of imprisoning children for minor, non-violent drug-related offenses under Article 328, and take measures to release all children and young people who were children at the time of the offense. 
Yours sincerely,

The harassment of Prey Lang’s defenders is a threat not only to the rainforest and the Indigenous peoples who live there, but also the global struggle against climate change.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Prime Minister Hun Sen, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the recent attacks on environmental human rights defenders working to protect the Prey Lang rainforest. It has been brought to my attention that in recent days and weeks, activists working to expose rampant illegal logging in the Prey Lang rainforest have faced a barrage of harassment, including arbitrary detention and physical attacks, by both state authorities and corporate actors. 
On 13 March in Kratie Province, four prominent forest defenders were arrested and detained and one was beaten while investigating allegations of illegal logging. They reportedly remain under investigation as suspects. Just weeks earlier on 22 February, armed rangers deployed by the Ministry of Environment blocked members of the Prey Lang Community Network (PLCN) who were seeking to participate in PLCN’s annual tree blessing ceremony, and the event was arbitrarily shut down. 
Ministry of Environment officials have claimed that PLCN is operating illegally because it has not registered under Cambodia’s widely criticized Law on Associations and Non-Governmental Organizations (LANGO), contradicting multiple prior assurances from the Ministry of Interior that the LANGO does not apply to grassroots and community-based groups. The United Nations’ human rights office has previously stated that LANGO’s mandatory registration regime is inconsistent with Cambodia’s obligations to protect the right to freedom of association, enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution and international human rights law. Grassroots environmental human rights defenders such as PLCN have been at the frontline of the fight against illegal logging in Cambodia for 20 years. Illegal logging has devastated Cambodia’s rainforests and severely impacted Indigenous peoples’ spiritual beliefs and livelihoods. 
I urge you to stop the harassment and intimidation of environmental human rights defenders in Cambodia and ensure they are supported and protected while conducting their vital work; ensure a thorough and impartial investigation into all credible allegations of assault, arbitrary detention, and illegal logging by agribusiness companies operating around Prey Lang; and ensure the repeal of the LANGO, or its review and amendment in order to bring it in line with international human rights law and standards.

I am writing to ask for your urgent intervention to halt the execution of ATM Azharul Islam, which could be carried out within days following a rejection of the review petition, that the defense team will have to file within 15 days of the publication of the judgement to commute his death sentence. 
ATM Azharul Islam, a leader of opposition party Jamaat-e-Islami, was convicted by the International Crimes Tribunal in 2014 of committing murders and genocide during Bangladesh’s War of Independence in 1971. The Appellate Division of Bangladesh Supreme Court upheld the sentence on 31 October 2019. The government sent his death warrant to the jail authority on 16th March 2020. ATM Azharul now faces imminent execution. 
Those responsible for crimes committed during the 1971 Liberation War must be held accountable, but taking another life is not the answer. The death penalty is an act of vengeance; it will not deliver the victims the justice they deserve. 
I call on you to immediately commute the death sentence of ATM Azharul Islam to a term of imprisonment; immediately establish an official moratorium on all executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty in Bangladesh; and respect the most rigorous international standards for a fair trial

 TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I am writing to you concerning the ongoing prosecution of 18 students and one academic from Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara in connection with their alleged participation in the 9th annual LGBTI Pride Parade on the University’s campus on 10 May 2019. 
The METU Pride Parade on 10 May constituted a legitimate exercise of the right of students and academics to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Nevertheless, police officers entered the METU campus on the request of the university management to disperse the gathering and when students did not disperse, broke up the gathering with pepper spray, plastic bullets and tear gas. Several people were injured and at least 22 people were detained, including the 19 people currently facing criminal charges. 
The 19 face charges under Article 32 of the Law No. 2911 on Meetings and Demonstrations and risk prison sentences for “failing to disperse despite being warned”. One of the students is also charged with “insult” under Article 125 of Turkey’s Penal Code, for allegedly “making a hand gesture considered rude” against police officers. Some of the students facing criminal charges have stated that they did not participate in the Pride Parade and were just bystanders. 
I urge you to ensure that charges against the 18 METU students and the academic for their alleged participation in the Pride Parade on 10 May 2019 are dropped, as no one should be prosecuted for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly; and the excessive use of force by the police on campus on 10 May is promptly, independently and impartially investigated and police officers found to have acted unlawfully are brought to justice.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President Xi, 
I am writing to express my concern for Gui Minhai, who has been sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for five years on the charge of “illegally providing intelligence to foreign entities” on 24 February 2020. 
Gui Minhai appears to have been tried and convicted in secret, denying him any chance of a fair trial. Despite the claim that he handed over ‘intelligence’ while in their custody, it appears that his conviction is primarily based on his attempted trip with two Swedish diplomats to Beijing in 2018. 
Without any further information provided, the court notice also stated that Gui Minhai had reapplied for Chinese citizenship in 2018, which would mean he could not rely anymore on his Swedish citizenship. As Gui Minhai has been held in custody since 2015, the true intention of this decision cannot be verified. 
It is also distressing to learn that Gui Minhai has not been able to see his family members and consular officials, or even have access to a lawyer of his own choice since 2018. Given his existing health condition, which requires regular and urgent medical care, Gui Minhai’s family are particularly concerned for his wellbeing. 
I call on you to release Gui Minhai and drop the charges against him unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that he has committed an internationally recognized offense and is granted a fair trial in line with international standards; grant Gui Minhai prompt, regular and unrestricted access to medical care on request or as necessary, lawyer of his choice and his family; and clarify the circumstances of his change of citizenship and, until then, grant Gui Minhai consular access.

c) Russia –Amnesty Testifies on Russian Government’s Targeting of Crimean Tartars. On February 27 Amnesty’s Eurasia Advocacy Director Daniel Balson testified before the Lantos Human Rights Commission at a hearing on Human Rights in Russia. Since the Russian government’s annexation and occupation of Crimea in February 2014, the human rights situation in Crimea has rapidly deteriorated. Russian authorities in Crimea have shuttered independent media, curtailed the right to freedom of expression, and launched a campaign of persecution and harassment against critics. Amnesty International urges Congress to demand full access for international monitors, ensure that U.S. diplomats attend politically motivated trials, and recognize Crimean human rights on May 18, the anniversary of their deportation to remote parts of the USSR by Soviet Authorities.

d) India – President Trump Condones Prime Minister Modi’s Anti-Muslim Policies.During his February 24-25 visit to India, President Trump failed to speak out against the Indian government’s new Citizenship Amendment Act, which grants citizenship to undocumented immigrants of several faiths but excludes Muslims, during his visit with Prime Minister Modi. Amnesty International has called on the Indian government to repeal the bill as it discriminates based on religion, a clear violation of India’s constitution and international human rights la  
e) Syria – Syrian Forces’ Bombings Kill Civilians Including Children in Idlib. On February 25 Russian-backed Syrian government forces targeted and bombed schools, hitting at least 10 schools and dozens of hospitals in the Idlib and Aleppo countryside. Since February 12, aerial and ground bombardment from Russian and Syrian regime forces killed 75 civilians, including 21 children. Between February 12 and 26, 300,000 civilians fled Aleppo, Hama and Idlib. The attacks against the civilian population constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity and have generated a new refugee crisis. One million Syrian civilians have now fled towards the Turkish border. Amnesty International calls on Syrian and Russian forces to stop all direct attacks on civilians, and the White House to re-engage in the Syrian peace process in order to bring an end to the carnage.   
Americas – New Amnesty International Report Reviews Officials’ Violence Responses to Protests and Crackdown on Asylum Seekers Across the Americas. In 2019 the Americas saw millions protest rampant violence, inequality, corruption and impunity. At least 210 people died in protests across the Americas: 83 in Haiti, 47 in Venezuela, 35 in Bolivia, 31 in Chile, eight in Ecuador and six in Honduras. In Venezuela 4.8 million have been forced to flee for safety while Peru, Ecuador and Chile clamped down on the right to seek asylum. Instead of imposing restrictive policies, governments across the Americas must work to protect the rights of all people so they can live in freedom and safety.  
Mid East and North Africa – New Amnesty International Report Reviews Crackdown on Protests Across the Region and Other Human Rights Violations in 2019. The Mid East and North Africa saw mass protests break out in 2019, notably in Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Authorities used excessive force, and in some cases lethal force causing hundreds of deaths in Iran and Iraq, and arbitrary detentions to stop the peaceful protesters. Officials across the region heavily restricted freedom of expression and civil society activities, with some particularly clamping down on those criticizing the authorities on social media, and targeted hundreds of human rights defenders. Governments must protect the right to free expression and uphold human rights across the region.  
2) International Women’s Day March 8, 2020  
For International Women’s Day, Congress should pass four bills vital to upholding women’s rights and recognize prominent women human rights defenders around the world.  
Indigenous Women in the U.S.  
a) Senate Must Pass Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Reauthorization (S. 2843), to Support Indigenous Women. Since 1994, with bipartisan support, VAWA has provided U.S. money and programming to combat and respond to domestic and sexual violence. In 2013 Congress expanded VAWA to include Native American women. Congress has since allowed VAWA to lapse, but the House passed a reauthorization that further closes the legal loophole that has led to high violence against Native women, and expanding tribal jurisdiction over crimes such as rape, child abuse, or assaulting police. The Senate, however, has introduced two different versions of VAWA reauthorization. Amnesty International USA calls on the Senate to pass the version introduced by Senator Feinstein (S.2843), which includes these stronger protections for Native women.  
b) Congress Should Pass Savanna’s Act (S. 227,H.R.2733) to Provide Accountability for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women.More than four in five Native American and Alaska Native Women have experienced violence in their lifetime. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average and are twice as likely to experience sexual crimes. Savanna’s Act (S. 227, H.R. 2733) directs the Justice Department to develop protocols to address missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG). This legislation is necessary to better coordinate law enforcement and build necessary data regarding MMIWG.  
c) Senate Committee on Indian Affairs Should Hold Hearing on Sexual Assault and Lack of Post-Rape Care for Indigenous Women.More than one in three NativeAmerican and Alaska Native women will be raped in their lives, and many do not receive adequate justice for sexual violence. The Indian Health Services does not consistently provide rape kits, ensure someone on site is trained to administer the rape kit, or adequately track data on sexual assault services provided. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs should hold a hearing to investigate the lack of justice for sexual assault survivors, and to ensure that IHS provides adequate medical care for Native women survivors.  
International Women’s Rights  
d)  Congress Should Pass the Safe From the Start Act (H.R. 4092). In humanitarian situations women and girls face an increased risk of rape, child marriage, domestic violence, human trafficking, exploitation by humanitarian personnel, and other forms of gender-based violence (GBV). This legislation would implement the Safe from the Start program, a State Department and USAID initiative, that would ensure context-appropriate services for girls and women who are exposed to GBV during humanitarian crises and establish tools to promote greater efficiency and accountability of response and recovery efforts.  
Women Human Rights Defenders (WHRDs)  
e) Saudi Arabia – Congress Should Call for the Releaseof Saudi WHRDs.In May 2018, Saudi authorities arbitrarily detained thirteen WHRDs for demanding equality and defending human rights. At least 10 of them were tortured, sexually abused, and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment while in prison. Due to international pressure, in March 2019 three of these activists were released, and then another five more were released in May 2019, but all the women still have pending charges against them. Amnesty International urges Members of Congress to sign onto Dear Colleague letters, hold hearings and briefings, and make floor statements calling for the immediately and unconditionally release of the remaining five women, and that charges be dropped against all the WHRDs.   
f) China – Women Document How Harassment of Uyghurs Extends Beyond China.On February 21 Amnesty International published abrief detailing how Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim groups face harassment even outside of China. Rushan Abbas, Executive Director of Campaign for Uyghurs, has not heard from her sister Gulshan since September 2018. She believes that Chinese authorities took her sister, a retired medical doctor just days after Rushan made a speech about the mass detention of Uyghurs on Capitol Hill. Gulruy Asqar, a teacher living in the U.S., has a brother detained in Xinjiang. She started receiving frequent telephone calls from the Chinese consulate in Houston where a staffer pressed her for personal information and faced similar harassment from a Chinese mail delivery company. Amnesty International urges the Senate to pass the Uyghur Human Rights and Policy Act ( 178) to hold Chinese authorities accountable for the detention of Uyghurs.

 TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
On 5 December 2019, police arrested Omar Ben Boudouh, also known as Moul al Hanout (grocery store owner), in Khemisset for posting a live video on his Facebook page where he peacefully expresses critical opinions about the lack of justice and rule of law in Morocco. Ben Boudouh said that he held the King of Morocco responsible for the lack of accountability in Morocco, which is legitimate speech protected by freedom of expression under international law. Amnesty International has reviewed Ben Boudouh’s interrogation report and found that all the charges against him were related solely to his peaceful expression of views and his dissemination of the video. The organization also reviewed his video and found no incitement to violence or hatred. 
On 7 January 2020, a court convicted Ben Boudouh on charges of “offending” public officials and institutions and “incitement to hatred” and sentenced him to three years in prison. On 7 January 2020, Ben Boudouh went on hunger strike to protest the unfairness of his conviction and demand his immediate release. On 14 February 2020, he was transferred to a hospital after his health significantly deteriorated, and his body weakened, according to members of his family. His lawyers appealed the court decision on 12 February 2020, and a verdict is set to be pronounced on 26 February 2020. Omar Ben Boudouh, is the only breadwinner for a family of five kids, the youngest of which is only two years old. 
I therefore ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Omar Ben Boudouh and quash his conviction as he is a prisoner of conscience. Pending his release, I call on you to ensure he has access to qualified health professionals and health care provided in line with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy, and informed consent. Finally, I call on you to stop detaining people for peacefully criticizing the authorities and reform laws that violate the right to freedom of expression. 
Yours sincerely,

Viktar Serhil can now appeal to President Lukashenka for clemency but this is extremely unlikely to be granted. Soon after clemency is refused, Viktar Serhil may be executed.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Ms Chupris, 
I am addressing you in your capacity as the Chairperson of the Clemency Commission and am writing to urge you to take all necessary steps to facilitate the granting of clemency to Viktar Serhil after the Supreme Court upheld his conviction and death sentence on 31 January 2020. 
On 25 October 2019, Brest Regional Court found Viktar Serhil guilty of murdering an eight-month old girl and sentenced him to death. His co-defendant and mother of the child, Natallia Kolb, was sentenced to 25 years’ imprisonment as women cannot be sentenced to death in Belarus. Viktar Serhil is now at imminent risk of execution following the Supreme Court decision. 
Viktar Serhil was convicted of a terrible crime but no state should resort to the death penalty, whatever the crime. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and has no place in any criminal justice system today. Belarus is the only country in Europe and the former Soviet Union which still carries out executions. 
I urge you to take all necessary steps in your capacity as the Chairperson of the Clemency Commission to ensure that Viktar Serhil is granted immediate clemency, and that his execution and that of all those on death row in Belarus is halted; and use your leverage to seek an introduction of a moratorium on all executions in Belarus as a first step towards full abolition of the death penalty

Six members of the group are now serving prison sentences of between two and three years in connection with their peaceful activities; at least three are facing further charges before different courts. All six are prisoners of conscience who should be immediately and unconditionally released. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President U Win Myint, 
I am writing to express my grave concern about the continuing criminal prosecution of members of the Peacock Generation, who have been targeted for their satirical Thangyat performances. Six young performers are imprisoned for nothing other than peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. They are prisoners of conscience, and I urge you to ensure their immediate and unconditional release. 
I am disappointed to learn that three members of the group were convicted on 17 February 2020 of “online defamation” under Section 66(d) of the 2013 Telecommunications Act and each sentenced to six months in prison. These convictions are the latest in a series of jail terms handed down to members of the group for their peaceful performances, some of which were shared on social media. It is highly concerning that six members are now serving between two and three years’ imprisonment, and that some of them face further politically-motivated charges for their peaceful Thangyat performances. 
I am also deeply concerned that peaceful activists and human rights defenders in Myanmar continue to be targeted by a range of repressive laws, including of Section 66(d) of the Telecommunications Act and Section 505(a) of the Penal Code, which arbitrarily restrict the right to freedom of expression. 
I call on you to immediately and unconditionally release all jailed members of the Peacock Generation and quash their convictions; drop further charges against them and all others who are facing imprisonment solely for the peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression;  and repeal or amend laws that arbitrarily restrict the right to freedom of expression, including Section 505(a) of the Penal Code and 66(d) of the 2013 Telecommunications Act, to bring them in line with international human rights law and standards.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I am writing to express my concern about the prosecution of lawyer Kyee Myint, poet Saw Wai and former military captain Nay Myo Zin who are facing charges in connection with their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression and calling for constitutional reforms. Amnesty International believes the prosecution of the activists to be politically motivated, and I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Nay Myo Zin and drop all charges against the three men. 
The Kawthaung Township Court began proceedings on 20 January 2020 against the three activists after a member of the Myanmar military filed a complaint against them for speeches criticizing the military and calling for constitutional reforms at a rally in Kawthaung in April 2019. Kyee Myint, Saw Wai, and Nay Myo Zin are charged with “statements conducing public mischief” under Section 505(a) of Myanmar’s Penal Code. If convicted, they each face up to two years in prison 
While I am pleased that Kyee Myint and Saw Wai have been granted bail, the fact remains that none of the three men should be facing prosecution in the first place. I am concerned that Nay Myo Zin remains in detention in Kawthaung prison, where he is serving a one-year prison sentence for another speech given at peaceful rally in Yangon Region in April. Finally, I remain concerned by the ongoing use of repressive laws, including Section 505(a) of the Penal Code, to arrest, prosecute, and imprison peaceful activists and human rights defenders in Myanmar. These laws arbitrarily and unlawfully restrict the right to freedom of expression. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release Nay Myo Zin, as he is being detained solely for peacefully exercising his right of freedom of expression; drop all charges against Kyee Myint, Saw Wai, and Nay Myo Zin; review and repeal or amend laws that unlawfully restrict the right to freedom of expression, including Section 505(a) of the Penal Code, to bring them in line with international human rights standards.

He is no longer able to walk unattended. He has been detained in dire conditions and in solitary confinement since his arrest on 20 March 2017. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
According to information recently obtained by Amnesty International, the psychological and physical conditions of human rights defender and prisoner of conscience Ahmed Mansoor have deteriorated to the point that he is no longer able to walk unattended. On 7 September 2019, after prison guards beat him, Ahmed Mansoor began a hunger strike to protest his prison conditions. During the first week of his hunger strike, prison guards forced him to eat, but between 14 September 2019 and at least mid-January 2020, Ahmed Mansoor was on continuous hunger strike, ingesting only fluids. 
Ahmed has been held in solitary confinement since the beginning of his detention on 20 March 2017. The UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) prohibits the use of prolonged solitary confinement (for a period of more than 15 days) as punishments that amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 
On 1 January 2020, the official state-run news website, the Emirates News Agency, stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation refuted the claims made by non-governmental organizations related to Ahmed Mansoor’s case, namely that his trial and subsequent conviction were unfair, and calling them “baseless”. Amnesty International believes that Ahmed Mansoor’s trial was unfair as he has been convicted and sentenced solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and association, including through his human rights work. 
I urge you to quash Ahmed Mansoor’s conviction and release him immediately and unconditionally. Pending his release, I call on you to ensure that he is detained in conditions that comply with international standards, that he is not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; and has immediate and regular access to his family and any health care he may require. I also call on the UAE authorities to grant independent international monitors access to Ahmed Mansoor in prison.

1) This Month’s Feature  
U.S. – Congress Must Pass the No Ban Act (H.R. 2214, S. 1123) to Nullify President Trump’s Discriminatory Muslim Ban. On January 31 President Trump announced the expansion the Muslim ban to include Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan, and Tanzania. This announcement came days after the three-year anniversary of Trump’s original Muslim ban. Amnesty International USA strongly opposes this ban and urges Congress to pass the No Ban Act (H.R. 2214, S. 1123) to nullify all versions of the Muslim ban.  
2) Major Human Rights News  
a) Asia 
Rohingya – Bangladesh Government Announces Rohingya Refugee Children Will Get Access to Education. On January 28 the Bangladesh government announced it will offer schooling and skills training to Rohingya refugee children.  Rohingya refugee children will get schooling up to the age of 14, and children older than 14 will get skills training.  The U.S. should continue its support for humanitarian assistance, including education services, and ensure the Bangladesh government fulfills its commitment.  
Rohingya – World Court Orders the Myanmar Government to Protect Rohingya. On January 23 the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Myanmar to take “provisional measures” to “prevent genocidal acts against the Rohingya community.” An estimated 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Myanmar are routinely and systematically denied their most basic rights and face a risk of further persecution and violence. Amnesty International calls on Myanmar to comply with the ICJ’s ruling and take immediate action to cease ongoing human rights violations against the Rohingya.  
Religion – Asian Governments Must End Widespread Religious Persecution. On January 28 Asia Advocacy Manager Francisco Bencosme testified during a joint House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Global Human Rights hearing on religious persecution. In 2019 governments in Asia enacted repressive religious policies. China detained up to one million Turkic Muslims in “re-education camps”; the Indian government imposed a devastating new citizenship law that discriminates against Muslims; anti-Muslim violence erupted in Sri Lanka after the Easter bombings; and the Myanmar military continues waging atrocity crimes against religious and ethnic minorities. Amnesty International calls on Congress to pressure these governments to stop the persecution of religious minorities.  
  
Above: On January 28 Amnesty’s Francisco Bencosme testified at a hearing calling on religious persecution in Asia.  
b) Mid-East 
Israel and Palestine – Proposed “Peace Deal” Would Exacerbate Violence and Enshrine Impunity Between Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories. On January 28 President Trump announced his “peace deal” which was prepared without any input from Palestinian leaders. Trump’s proposal calls for further annexation of Palestinian territory which would violate international humanitarian law. During more than half a century of occupation Israel has imposed a system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians under its rule, denying them basic rights and access to effective remedies for violations. The deal amounts to endorsement of these brutal and unlawful policies. Amnesty International is calling on the international community to reject annexation proposals, which violate international law, and reiterate the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied territory.  
Iraq – Protest Death Toll Surges as Iraqi Security Forces Resume Brutal Repression. Chilling eyewitness testimonies and verified video analysis confirmed that security forces have resumed their campaign of deadly violence against largely peaceful protesters in Baghdad and cities in southern Iraq. The crackdown on renewed protests between January 20 and 22 saw at least 10 people killed, according to the Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights, while activists in Basra reported two additional deaths on January 22. Scores have been injured and arrested, with some subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in custody. Amnesty International calls on Iraqi security forces to immediately stop the use of lethal force.  
Lebanon – New Lebanese Government Must Rein in Security Forces After Latest Protest Violence. On January 18 and 19 Lebanese security forces used excessive force against peaceful protesters, injuring 409 in Beirut. Those protests have been some of the most violent since the protests began in Lebanon in October. Amnesty International calls on the new Lebanese government to prioritize reining in security forces and investigate the unlawful and excessive use of force, beatings, rape threats and arbitrary arrests of protesters.  
  
Above: On January 18 a new wave of violence by security forces against peaceful protesters broke out, injuring 409 in Lebanon.  
c) Americas– Anniversary of President Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” Policy Marks Continuation of Rampant Human Rights Abuses at U.S.-Mexico Border.  January 29 marked the one-year anniversary of the Trump administration’s Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” under which the U.S. government forcibly returns people to Mexico who are seeking asylum in the U.S. Since January 2019 close to 60,000 people who arrived at the S.-Mexico border have been forced to stay in Mexico for months in dangerous conditions while they pursue their asylum claims in the U.S. As of January 23, 2020, there have been 816 public reports of kidnapping, extortion, rape, murder, torture and other violent assaults faced by asylum seekers subject to Remain in Mexico. Amnesty International USA has conducted multiple trips to the U.S.-Mexico border, including one as recently as late January 2020, to document stories of pregnant women, LGBTI people, children, and people with disabilities suffering abuses while they wait in Mexico. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to defund Remain in Mexico and other anti-asylum border policies that violate the right to seek asylum and humanitarian protection.

1) Major International Human Rights Development  
India – Amnesty International Calls on Indian Government to Repeal Anti-Muslim Citizenship Law and to End Crackdown on Protests. In December the Indian Parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, which grants citizenship to undocumented immigrants of several faiths, but excludes Muslims. Amnesty International has called on the Indian government to repeal the bill as it discriminates on the basis of religion, a clear violation of India’s constitution and international human rights law. Massive protests broke out across India. In response, the Indian government imposed an indefinite curfew, suspended mobile and internet services, and deployed security forces in various states. Some state governments have detained those protesting against the Act or imposed prohibitory orders. Security forces beat student protestors at Aligarh Muslim University, injuring more than 100 students, and police blocked ambulances from going inside the university to help the wounded students. The Indian Government and state governments must end excessive use of force by police and uphold the right to peaceful protests.  
  
2) What Must Congress Do in 2020 to Protect Human Rights Across the World?   
Review of 2010s and Looking Ahead to 2020 – Amnesty International reflects on human rights battlegrounds:  from uprisings across the Arab world and the rise of global protest movements, to the resurgence of the politics of hate, and concerns over the misuse of big data and surveillance technology, the 2010s have opened up new frontiers in the fight for our rights. As we move into a new decade, governments must protect us from further human rights abuses, including from corporations, Big Tech and the climate crisis.   
Key Human Rights Legislation (Bipartisan, Bicameral) That Must Get Over the Finish Line in 2020   
Amnesty International has identified eight bipartisan and bicameral bills that Congress can and should pass in early 2020. Many have already passed one chamber and require just a small push to get over the finish line. We urge Congress to act swiftly to uphold human rights at home and abroad.  
a) Asia 
China – Congressional Action to Hold Chinese Government Accountable for Detention Uyghurs Long Overdue. Leaked documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reveal how the Chinese government built the Xinjiang facilities to detain hundreds of thousands of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. The leaks showcase the horrors of the Chinese government’s campaign against the Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic Muslims. In December, AIUSA’s Board of Directors sent a letter to Senate leadership calling for immediate passage of the legislation. The Senate must come to an agreement with the House to pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act (S.178) led by Senators Rubio (R-FL) and Menendez (D-NJ).  

 
Above: Amnesty International is campaigning on behalf of Yiliyasijiang Reheman, a Uyghur who has been missing for over two years and is presumed to be detained in the Xinjiang province.  
  
Kashmir – Indian Government Must End Militaristic Measures and Lift the Internet Blackout in Kashmir. In August 2019, the Indian government decided to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional autonomy and split the two territories under the control of the federal government. Since then, security forces have detained protesters, imposed curfews and travel restrictions and cut off all communication methods, including phone access to the internet. While recently some communication has been lifted, the prolonged internet blackout has impacted students, professionals, journalists, activists and emergency services in the region and prepaid phone service, broadband and mobile internet services still remain blocked. Congress must pass the bipartisan India human resolution (H.Res.745), led by Representatives Jayapal (D-WA-7) and Watkins (R-KS-2), to call on the Indian government to end its restrictions on free religion and information.   
  
Myanmar – Senior Myanmar Officials Must Be Held Accountable for Crimes Against Humanity. In 2019, Gambia asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to rule on provisional measures ‘to protect the rights of the Rohingya group’ and prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide against the community, pending formal hearings on the formal case that Myanmar has breached its obligations under the UN Genocide convention. Amnesty International’s investigations identified 13 senior officials, including Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, as warranting investigation and prosecution for crimes against the Rohingya. In December, Senators Blackburn (R-TN) and Durbin (D-IL) sent a letter calling for Myanmar to cooperate with the ICJ. The Senate must swiftly pass the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act (S. 1186) led by Senators Cardin (D-MD) and Young (R-IN) and the BURMA Act (H.R.3190) led by Representatives Engel (D-NY-16) and Chabot (R-OH-1). 
b) Africa 
Libya – Congress Must Support a Peaceful Diplomatic Solution to the Libyan Conflict. The Libya Stabilization Act (H.R. 4644, S. 2934) strengthens U.S. policy in support of a peaceful diplomatic solution to the Libyan conflict and to deter foreign interference in Libya. Currently the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Russia are supporting the forces of General Haftar in Libya, and more recently Turkey has decided to send troops in support of the UN recognized government in Tripoli. Among the Turkish support are Syrian rebels. The conflict has displaced tens of thousands and forces on all sides have committed war crimes, with civilians paying the heaviest price from the fighting. Amnesty International calls on Congress to pass this bipartisan legislation led by Representatives Deutch (D-FL-22) and Wilson (R-SC-2), and Senators Coons (D-DE) and Graham (R-SC).  
Cameroon – Cameroonian Government and Armed Groups Must Uphold Human Rights and End Violent Conflict. Amnesty International USA urges the Senate to agree to S.Res. 292 to call on the Cameroonian government and armed separatist groups to end all violence and respect the human rights of Cameroonians. The Cameroonian government has repeatedly cracked down on political opposition and restricted freedoms of expression by shutting down the internet and harassing or detaining journalists and political opponents. This resolution, already agreed to in the House, is led by Senators Cardin (D-MD) and Young (R-IN).  
c) Americas 
Venezuela – Senate Vote on Venezuela Temporary Protected Status Act Long Overdue. Over 10 percent of Venezuelans has been forced to flee the massive and widespread human rights crisis in Venezuela, which shows no signs of ceasing. Venezuelans in the U.S. are still exposed to risk of deportation because the U.S. government has failed to act to protect them. The Venezuela TPS Act (S. 636) would allow Venezuelans to qualify for temporary protected status and obtain work permits and travel authorization. The Senate must pass this bipartisan legislation led by Senators Menendez (D-NJ) and Rubio (R-FL), which the House already passed in July.  
  
Above: Since early 2019, Venezuelan security forces has used unlawful lethal force, detained and repressed protesters who have spoken out against the Venezuelan government.  
U.S. – Additional Funding for Research is Needed to Prevent Gun Violence and Empower Communities. On December 16, Amnesty International USA welcomed Congress’s historic decision to fund gun violence prevention research for the first time in 25 years. Congress approved $25 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct research on the gun violence crisis, but more needs to be done. Restrictions on federal legislation have had a substantial negative effect on gun violence research and, for over two decades, researchers, policy makers, and experts have been inadequately resourced to fill huge gaps in knowledge about the causes, consequences, and prevention of gun violence in the U.S. In addition to passing Universal Background Checks (S. 42), the Disarm Hate Act (H.R. 2708, S. 1462) and the Assault Weapons Ban (H.R. 1296, S. 66), Congress should pass the Break the Cycle of Violence Act (S. 2671, H.R. 4836), which would support community-led violence reduction initiatives in communities of color that have high levels of gun violence.  
U.S. – Justice Department Must Provide Accountability for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. On some reservations, native women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average and are twice as likely to experience sexual crimes. Savanna’s Act (S. 227, H.R. 2733) directs the DOJ to develop protocols to address missing and murdered Indigenous women. This legislation is necessary to better investigate cases and train tribal law enforcement agencies as they often lack necessary resources. This bipartisan legislation is led by Senators Murkowski (R-AK) and Cortez Mastro (D-NV), and Representatives Torres (D-CA-35) and Newhouse (R-WA-4).  
d) Mid-East 
Iran – Thousands Arbitrarily Detained and At Risk of Torture in Iranian Authorities’ Crackdown Against Protests. Iran’s authorities are carrying out a vicious crackdown following the outbreak of nationwide protests on November 15, arresting thousands of protesters as well as journalists, human rights defenders and students to stop them from speaking out about Iran’s ruthless repression. Security forces killed at least 304 people and injured thousands between November 15–18 while Iranian authorities refused to announce a figure for those killed. Iranian authorities must end the detention, torture and enforced disappearance of protesters.  
Iraq – Iraqi Authorities Must End the Deliberate Harassment, Intimidation, Abduction and Killing of Protesters. Activists and protesters reported a string of assassination attempts against protesters, especially those on their way home from protest areas since early December. The random targeting of activists and protesters has created an atmosphere of terror. Security forces used lethal force, including firing live ammunition and military-grade tear gas canisters on peaceful protesters, and abductions and enforced disappearances since protests broke out October 1. Amnesty International calls on Iraqi authorities to end the campaign of intimidation against protesters across Iraq since the outbreak of protests in October.   
e) U.S.- Amnesty International USA Urges Congress to Defund the Implementation of Unsafe Third Country Agreements. In November 2019, an interim final rule implemented a series of dangerous asylum agreements with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Amnesty International USA is profoundly concerned about how this rule eviscerates the right to seek asylum in the U.S. and will result in countless wrongful returns of individuals to places where they are at risk of grave harm, in violation of domestic and international law. 
During a November 22 House Foreign Affairs hearing, Amnesty’s Americas Director testified on the humanitarian crisis as the U.S.-Mexico border. DHS and ICE are forcibly returning tens of thousands of individuals to Mexico to await their asylum proceedings under the Remain in Mexico policy. In Mexico, asylum seekers are ripe targets for kidnapping, extortion, and other crime. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to halt the administration’s unlawful policies, which harm asylum seekers and foster unlawful criminal activity, ensure funding for people seeking protection at the border, and pass the Refugee Protection Act (H.R. 5210, S. 2936).  
f) Somalia- Amnesty International USA Demands Congressional Oversight on U.S. Counterterrorism Efforts in Africa.On December 17, Deputy Director for Advocacy and Government Adotei Akweitestified in a House Oversight and Government Reform National Security Subcommittee hearing on U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the Sahel regions and Somalia. Congress should demand credible and transparent investigations into human rights violations by security forces and ensure that those responsible for violations are held accountable. Congress should also press the Executive Branch to work with U.S. African partner governments and civil society to review and reform problematic anti-terrorism legislation and policies, including ending the use of military courts to try civilians.  
g) U.S. – On Five-Year Anniversary of Release of Torture Report Executive Summary, Amnesty International Demands U.S. Government Declassify and Release Full Report. December 9 marked thefive-year anniversary of the release of an executive summary of the Senate report on Central Intelligence Agency torture of people who it had detained, many of whom are still in detention in Guantanamo. Government officials and all others who were involved in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees must be held accountable, and that detainees held indefinitely at Guantanamo should either be released or tried promptly in federal court.

0,Statement on the Impact of US Counter terrorism Efforts in Africa on Human Rights before House Oversight and Reform National Security Subcommittee Dec. 17 2019,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/our-work/government-relations/advocacy/us-counter-terrorism-human-rights-in-africa/,The Impact of US Counter terrorism Efforts in Africa on Human Rights Statement from Adotei Akwei Amnesty International USA for the National Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight … ,"The Impact of US Counter terrorism Efforts in Africa on Human Rights
Statement from Adotei Akwei Amnesty International USA for the
National Security Subcommittee of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform 
December 17, 2019 
Chairman Lynch, Ranking Member Hice and members of the House Subcommittee on National Security, on behalf of the members and supporters of Amnesty International USA, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to present our concerns and recommendations regarding US Counter terrorism (CT) efforts in Africa and their impact on human rights there.
Amnesty International is a global human rights organization, launched in 1961 with 7 million supporters, activists, and volunteers in over 150 countries, including 250,000 here in the United States. We advocate for the rights of all as enumerated by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My comments will focus on the impact of CT efforts on the respect for and protection of human rights by US backed allies and those committed by the US military itself in the Sahel and in Somalia. 
This hearing is urgently needed. Congress must assert its oversight mandate over US CT efforts in Africa. The lack of transparency over the impact of operations by the US and partner forces on civilian populations in the region needs debate, discussion, evaluation and ideally new ideas learned from mistakes and the human rights violations they caused. While there may be closed door Congressional briefings on aspects of the military components of CT operations, all too often, they do not address the worsening contexts and environment and the erosion of human rights and accountability that CT efforts contribute to and therefore do not discuss how to mitigate or reverse those trends or even acknowledge that they should be an issue of concern. The problems with the lack of transparency regarding CT initiatives in Africa from here in the United States are compounded by even more opaque environment on the continent. This is as a result of CT measures and legislation enacted by many African governments restricting media and civil society organizations from even asking questions about CT initiatives or the human rights violations they may cause inadvertently or deliberately. Amnesty International hopes, at the very least, this hearing will serve as a model for similar platforms in countries that are supported by the US in their CT efforts so that their people can be partners in efforts that are wholistic and rights oriented. 
US backed Counter Terrorism efforts in sub Saharan Africa have focused on three regions the Horn of Africa impacted by the activities of the armed group el- Shabab, the Sahel region of West Africa which faces threats from the armed groups Boko Haram and al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and North Africa which also faces attacks from AQIM. In the Horn of Africa, key US allies include Kenya, Ethiopia, and the AMISOM peacekeeping force created under the auspices of the African Union. In the Sahel key partners include Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Mali who constitute the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) led by Nigeria. In North Africa key partners include Algeria, Tunisia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, and Senegal. 
Amnesty International and other international and domestic human rights groups have documented human rights violations by key African partner governments and their security forces -linked to and justified as counter terrorism efforts – as well as by United States forces.
These include
• Anti-Terrorism Legislation and the Erosion of the Rule of Law
• Violations Caused by Partner African Security Forces
• Violations Caused by Operations by US Forces 
Anti-Terrorism Legislation and the Erosion of the Rule of Law
International and regional agreements to coordinate efforts by African governments on Counter Terrorism initiatives have resulted in governments passing sweeping legislation, often accompanied by other laws that end up being used to restrict freedom of expression, association and access to information and to shut down government critics, members of the political opposition, civil society organizations and the media. 
In Kenya, the 2012 Prevention of Terrorism Act, includes a vague definition of terrorism – a term which has not been defined under international law. The Act greatly expands police powers and allows the state to create lists of suspected terrorists and terrorist organizations without due process. In 2015 the Kenyan government used the law to freeze the bank accounts of two civil society organizations in in Mombasa County accusing them of funding terrorism. The state later failed to prove the allegations in court. 
In Ethiopia, the Mass Media and Freedom of Information Proclamation of 2009; the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation of 2009, and the Charities and Societies Proclamation augmented the government’s powers to proscribe activities it deemed unacceptable and allowed it to brand them as terrorism with no recourse for appeal. Over 20,000 people were arrested on false charges, civil society organizations has their assets and bank accounts frozen. 
Nigeria enacted its Terrorism Prevention Act of 2011 in response to increasing attacks by Boko Haram. The Act was amended by the Terrorism Prevention Act of 2013. The Act prohibits terrorist financing and allows for the seizure of funds and property held by individual alleged to be terrorists or terrorist organizations and allows the state to collect funds used to carry out terrorist acts, including property and funds used by such individuals or organization. 
In 2015, outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan signed the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, etc.) Act of 2015 into law. The law includes provisions that violate peoples’ rights to privacy (Section 38, see Surveillance, Privacy, and Anonymity) and freedom of expression. It penalizes “cyberstalking” or messages that are “false, for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred, ill will or needless anxiety to another” with up to three years in prison, a fine, or both. Section 26 penalizes distribution of “racist or xenophobic material to the public through a computer system or network” with up to five years in prison, a fine of up to NGN 10 million (US$50,000), or both. 
Ignoring domestic and international concerns, in 2018 the Nigerian Parliament passed a Digital Rights and Freedom Bill which awaits President Buhari’s signature. The Nigerian Parliament also began to consider a broadly worded hate speech bill human rights groups and media worry could also be used by the government to further silence critics. 
The impact on Nigeria‘s independent media has been alarming in our latest report on Nigeria Endangered Voices, we detailed the cases of journalists, bloggers and independent radio stations who had been targeted by the Nigerian Police and Department of State Services (DSS). The report noted that attacks have continued since 2015 and that between January and September 2019, at least 19 journalists and media were attacked verbally and physically as well facing as arbitrary arrest and detention. These incidents were linked to journalists and media practitioners seeking access to information, sharing information or expressing critical views that could drive public opinion. 
Cameroon’s anti-terrorism legislation, enacted in 2014 generated expressions of concern regarding the severity of sanctions on journalists, who defend terrorism in spoken or written word. Punishment includes 15 to 20 years in prison and/or a fine of 25 million to 50 million CFA francs (28,000 to 76,000 euros). The law also grants military courts exclusive jurisdiction to try civilians allows the minister of defense to appoint and assign military judges, raising concerns of their independence. Civilians should never be tried by military courts. 
The administration of President Paul Biya has enforced the law aggressively: journalists have been brought before military courts and charged with failing to report matters affecting state security to the authorities. In some cases, they could no longer work, had to report to the police every week and were forbidden from talking to the national or international press. Others faced similar harassment: a Radio France Internationale correspondent was detained for two and a half years, the former head of the public radio and a TV broadcaster were detained and others subjected to unfair trials in an effort to stop their coverage of terrorism related issues. 
Amnesty gained firsthand knowledge of the lengths the Cameroonian government will take its anti-terrorism law when we began working on the case of Ivo Feh in 2014. Feh was 27-year-old student facing up to 20 years in prison for sending a text to his friends. In the message he joked that getting a good job in Cameroon was so hard, it was easier to get into the armed group Boko Haram. His message was read by a teacher, and Ivo and two of his friends were swiftly arrested and charged with “trying to organize a rebellion against the state.” Feh remains in jail. 
Violations Caused by Partner African Security Forces
One of the most alarming aspects of Counter Terrorism efforts by US partners has been the erosion of accountability and respect for human rights by national security forces. Security forces in Nigeria and Cameroon form example have been linked to mass executions, arbitrary detention, torture, and destruction of homes and livelihoods. They have also granted themselves near total impunity under the justification of engaging in counter terrorism operations. 
Nigeria
The poor record of the Nigerian military and police on human rights predates its counter insurgency efforts against Boko Haram. Amnesty International documented abuses committed by security forces in the Niger Delta in the 1990s and during the Biafran war in the 1960s. Decades of impunity set the stage for the egregious and systematic abuses in Nigeria’s CT efforts against Boko Haram. 
In 2016 we documented the mass killings of 640 men and boys in the Giwa barracks detention facility that were part of CT initiatives/ Arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment and malnutrition were widespread and systemic.
In 2017 the international community was left stunned after the Nigerian air force bombed a refugee camp in Rann Borno State, leaving over two hundred and thirty dead and a hundred more injured. Numerous eye witnesses said the aircraft made two bombing runs. 
Our 2018 report entitled Willingly Unable, we noted that since June 2015, Nigerian security forces had arbitrarily arrested at least 20,000 people and killed over 1,200. During this period, an estimated 2,018,513 people have been displaced. This year, UN OCHA reported that 7.1 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance in just the three states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. 
As hard to believe as it sounds, persons displaced by Boko Haram attacks or Nigerian military counter insurgency efforts also face violations including those liberated from Boko Haram captivity.
Amnesty is working with a group of 2000 women, who after surviving being kidnapped by Boko Haram faced sexual violence and rape by Nigerian military guards in exchange for food, water and health care. Thousands have died. The Knifar women have collected lists of names of people from their villages who have experienced abuse by the military to demand justice. They have also mobilized to force the Nigerian government to produce and reunited them with their husbands and sons who were separated from them after being liberated and have not been seen since 2017 
Despite this reality, the culture of impunity in Nigeria’s security forces remains unbroken and in place: there have been 20 inquiries – commissions, committees, panels, and other forms of proceedings – that have been set up by different authorities and organs of the Nigerian government to look into allegations of serious crimes and violations committed by Boko Haram, Nigerian security forces and its allied vigilante group, the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) between 2009 and 2018. Not one of them has resulted in accountability or credible security sector reform. The Nigerian Defense Ministry has accused Amnesty of being as Boko Haram supporter, has called for the organization to be shut down and has been linked to paying people to stage demonstrations outside the AI Nigeria offices. 
Cameroon
Cameroon’s security forces, who have been recipients of US military training and support, have also been linked to serious abuses including extrajudicial executions, destruction of villages and arbitrary arrests. 
In 2015 and 2016 Amnesty published reports that found that Cameroon’s authorities and security forces arbitrarily arrested hundreds of individuals accused of supporting Boko Haram, often with little or no evidence, and detained them in inhumane, often life-threatening conditions. AI found that some had died in custody as a result of torture while others have been subjected to enforced disappearance. Our report also documented how, in cases that were actually brought to court, detainee rights were routinely denied, and anti-terrorist legislation and military courts had left them with virtually no procedural guarantees. 
In 2017 Amnesty exposed the cases of 101 people who were held incommunicado, tortured, with some of them being killed by Cameroonian security forces in facilities run by the military and intelligence services. We concluded that the use of torture in Cameroon’s fight against Boko Haram had become widespread, routine and practiced with impunity and that this constituted a violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that amounting to war crimes.
In response to our report the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) initiated an internal investigation to find out what US military trainers, in Cameroon and located at some of the sites where the torture had taken place knew. The findings of the investigation have not been released publicly. In February 2019 the Trump cut some military assistance to Cameroon, citing human rights concerns as one of the reasons for the decision. To the best of our knowledge, the Cameroonian government has not undertaken an investigation in to the allegations. 
• Violations Caused by Operations by US Forces
A final area of concern is the role played by US forces themselves. Their conduct, how they uphold human rights and enforce accountability have a huge impact on the forces they train and work alongside as well as the general population.
Of particular concern are US airstrikes in Somalia aimed at the armed group el-Shabab and the civilian casualties that they cause. In a report released earlier this year, Amnesty found that the US had conducted over 100 strikes using drones and manned aircraft since early 2017, a number that had tripled under the Trump administration and outpaced strikes in Yemen and Libya combined. Despite this level of strikes the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) insisted there had been no civilian casualties as a result of its operations in Somalia.
Our report focused on 14 civilians who were killed and seven injured in five of the more than 100 strikes in the past two years. These five incidents were carried out with Reaper drones and manned aircraft in Lower Shabelle, a region largely under Al-Shabaab control outside the Somali capital Mogadishu. Amnesty believes that the attacks may have violated international humanitarian law, and some of them could constitute war crimes.
Just weeks after the report was released, AFRICOM publicly acknowledged that there had been civilian casualties as a result of some of its air strikes. 
Conclusions
AFRICOM’s belated acknowledgement that US air strikes had caused the death of civilians was a major step toward improved transparency and accountability regarding counter terrorism efforts on the continent, but it was only one step. The 95 + other military strikes must also be thoroughly investigated to confirm whether or not more civilians have been killed in those strikes, and the US must begin the process of reparations for the families of those killed. The failure to do so sends the wrong message to its military partners and to the impacted community.
Equally clear is the need for a new more robust approach to instill professionalism and accountability in the African forces taking on these armed groups. African security forces have historically enjoyed high levels of impunity. The global push to combat terrorism and the prioritization of security-oriented assistance from the United States and other donor countries has solidified this culture of impunity. Without transparent and public accountability, human rights abuses will continue and possibly even get worse with potentially disastrous consequences. If there is no difference between the behavior and abuses of national security forces and the armed groups there is a risk of undercutting support for Ct efforts
It is also clear that governments have taken advantage of the opportunity to impose laws that undermine, if not violate, international and regional human rights treaties to which their countries are party. The result has been the closure of civic space, and the silencing of critics and opposition voices. While this might serve the purposes of the ruling elite, it does not allow for diverse sources of information and analysis to emerge that could actually benefit and improve the human rights impact of CT initiatives. Indeed, in the restrictive environments now in place in the countries I have used as examples, it is nearly impossible to get an accurate assessment of the true level of success of failure of any CT effort or its human rights impact.
A further consequence of the restrictions being imposed by governments is the absence of services provided by non-governmental organizations that in many cases government have not been providing. These are critical interlocutors who can serve as bridges and facilitate dialogue and tolerance between communities and between them and their governments. These are actors that no government can afford to discard.

Congress must help end the false supposition that to ensure security it is necessary to sacrifice human rights. Security and human rights are linked and are dependent on each other. The US prioritization of a militaristic strategy has created a bigger battlefield and a dependency on US arms and support that has been shown to be unsustainable in other parts of the world. Congress has already begun to comprehensive wholistic approaches through legislation like the Global Fragility Act of 2019 (H. R. 2116 and S.727) which focus on addressing drivers of fragility and call for engaging civil society and the Women and Countering Violent Extremism Act of 2019 (H.R.1653) which focuses on supporting and building the capacity of women to build peace and counter violent extremism. This approach has been endorsed by African civil society and help efforts to improve governance across numerous countries which plays a key role in levels of support for armed group 
Prioritize Human Rights 
Congress must demand accountability from their partners this includes credible, transparent investigations in to human rights violations by security forces and ensuring that those responsible for those violations are held accountable.
Congress must also press the Executive Branch to work with US African partner governments and civil society to review and reform problematic anti-terrorism legislation and policies. A priority must be ending the practice of using military courts try civilians. 
Model Best Practices
In addition to pressing its partners to prioritize the respect for and protection of human rights though military and civilian channels, Congress must ensure that US forces themselves model professional behavior and adhere to international and regional human rights standards in terms of security operations. Congress must ensure that there are investigations into all credible allegations of civilian casualties caused by US air strikes, that there is accountability for those responsible for violations and that reparation made to the victims and survivors.",,"December 17, 2019 • Advocacy and GR",False

1) This Month’s Feature  
China – Amnesty International Urges Senate to Pass Uyghur Human Rights and Policy Act (S. 178) in December. On December 3, the House passed legislation that directs the Director of National Intelligence, FBI, Agency for Global Media and State Department to report on the detention of up to one million Uyghurs by Chinese authorities. On December 9, AIUSA’s Board of Directors sent a letter to Senators McConnell and Schumer calling for immediate passage of the Senate legislation.  
  
Above: Amnesty International is campaigning on behalf of Yiliyasijiang Reheman, a Uyghur who has been missing for over two years and is presumed to be detained in the Xinjiang province.   
2) Major Human Rights News – Widespread Protests Break Out as People Around the World Demand That Governments Uphold Individual Rights  
Amnesty International demands that all governments respect peoples’ rights to free expression and assembly, and ensure that police do not use excessive force on protesters.  
1) Asia – Amnesty International Lauds Signing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 1838) and the PROTECT Hong Kong Act (S. 2710). On November 27, President Trump signed the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (S. 1838) and the PROTECT Hong Kong Act (S. 2710), which requires reporting on the human rights situation in Hong Kong and ends the transfer of U.S. crowd control equipment to Hong Kong police. Amnesty International demands that other countries end the transfer of crowd control equipment.   
2) Mid East  
a) Iran – Security Forces Killed at least 208 in Horrific Killing Spree during Nationwide Demonstrations. On November 15, demonstrations broke out across Iran as the people of Iran protested a hike in gas prices, with some protestors also chanting slogans calling for an overhaul of the political system. The Iranian authorities used lethal and excessive force against protestors, and implemented a near-total shutdown of the global internet for over a week, which was deliberately done to prevent people from sharing images and videos of the deadly force being used by security forces. Amnesty International calls include for those responsible for this bloody clampdown on demonstrations to be held accountable for their actions, for anyone detained solely for peacefully taking part in demonstrations to be immediately and unconditionally released. 
b) Iraq – Iraqis Take to the Streets to Demand Basic Needs and to End Corruption. Since October 1, protesters have demonstrated in Baghdad and towns across the mostly Shia south. In response, security forces have killed over 300 protesters. Amnesty International calls on Congress to pressure Iraq to rein in the security forces and launch effective and impartial investigations aimed at ensuring accountability for unlawful killings and other serious violations.  
c) Lebanon – Demonstrations Enter Their Eighth Week as Lebanese Protest Proposed Tax Measures. On October 17, the Lebanese government announced new tax measures. Tens of thousands of peaceful protesters assembled in cities across Lebanon to protest corruption and to call for social and economic reforms. Security forces have arrested and tortured peaceful protesters. Amnesty International calls on Congress to pressure Lebanon to immediately end the use of excessive force, protect peaceful protesters from intimidation or attacks, and investigate the unlawful use of force, torture and ill-treatment. 
3) Americas  
a) Chile – Anger Over Increased Metro Fares Manifests into Nationwide Protests. In mid-October mass protests erupted in Santiago after local authorities announced an increase in metro fare. Over the past month, the protests have broadened to reflect anger over social services and inequality. Security forces have fired rubber bullets and tear gas canisters at protesters, killing five and injuring hundreds. Amnesty International demands that Chilean security forces cease excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, ensure legitimate demands of protesters are attended to so Chilean people can access their economic and social rights, and reform the policing system.  
 
b) Ecuador – State of Emergency Turns Deadly as Police Use Excessive Force to Dispel Protests. On October 3, protests began in multiple cities in response to President Lenín Moreno announcing austerity measures. Hours later, the president declared a state of emergency across Ecuador, thus authorizing the mobilization of the Armed Forces and the National Police to maintain order and prevent violence. Amnesty International demands that police cease unlawful repression of protests and ensure protesters can demonstrate peacefully, and the Ecuadorian government investigate the excessive use of force, torture, ill-treatment, and unlawful detention of protesters including children. 
c) Haiti – Haitians Protest Economic Crisis and Government Corruption. Since mid-September police have used excessive force on protesters and killed at least 35 people. The police injured more than 200, including 8 journalists. Amnesty International demands that police stop using firearms carrying live ammunition during protests and guarantee the safety of journalists covering the political and human rights situation in Haiti. 
4) Africa – Congress Should Demand That the Nigerian Government Hold Security Forces Accountable Under Leahy Law. In November, members of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria protested and demanded the release of their leader Ibrahim Zakzaky from detention. Nigerian security forces beat journalists and fired tear gas on protesters to prevent them from conducting a sit-in. Police shot a secondary school student while attempting to disperse the crowd. Amnesty International condemns the arrest and detention of activists, political leaders and journalists who exercise their rights to free assembly and expression.   
5) U.S. – Google and Facebook’s Surveillance Policies Pose a Major Threat to Human Rights. In a November 20 report, Amnesty International documents how Google and Facebook’s surveillance-based business model threatens rights to privacy, free expression and non-discrimination. Platforms owned by Facebook and Google each have over 245 million monthly active users in the U.S. and have become fundamental to how Americans engage and interact with each other. They have effectively created a new public square at the cost of collecting ever more detailed personal information on hundreds of millions of Americans. To protect our core human values in the digital age – dignity, autonomy, privacy – Big Tech must radically overhaul how it operates and move to an internet that seeks to protect human rights.  
  
Above: In a new report, Amnesty calls on the U.S. government to overhaul tech companies’ surveillance-based business model and to protect people from corporate human rights abuses, including through the enforcement of robust data protection laws and effective regulation.  
3) What Can Congress Do to Commemorate International Human Rights Day?  
In celebration of the anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to:

Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases, without exception, as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President, 
I am writing to express my concern about the fate of Viktar Paulau who was convicted and sentenced to death on 30 July by the Viciebsk Regional Court and whose sentence was upheld by the Supreme Court on 12 November. 
Viktar Paulau was found guilty of the murder of two people in December 2018. According to local human rights defenders, there were irregularities in the court hearing which violated his right to a fair trial. Following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the sentence, Viktar Paulau is now at risk of imminent execution. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and should be abolished. 
Belarus remains the only country in Europe and the former Soviet Union which still carries out executions. 
I urge you to ommediately halt the execution of Viktar Paulau and all those on death row in Belarus; immediately establish an official moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty; commute all death sentences to terms of imprisonment. 
Yours sincerely,

","On 12 November, renowned Turkish author and former newspaper editor Ahmet Altan was detained after a court overturned the decision taken on 4 November to release him from over three years in detention. Ahmet Altan is a prisoner of conscience and must be immediately and unconditionally released.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I am writing to you regarding the re-arrest of novelist Ahmet Altan on 12 November, eight days after he was released from over three years of detention. 
Ahmet Altan was first detained and remanded in prison in September 2016. He was prosecuted for his alleged support for the 2016 attempted coup to overthrow the government solely based on his journalistic work critical of the government and contacts with alleged followers of the religious cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom the government holds responsible for the coup attempt. In February 2018 Ahmet Altan was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for ’attempting to overthrow the constitutional order’, despite an alarming lack of evidence of any internationally recognizable crime. Ahmet Altan appealed the verdict and on 5 July 2019 the Supreme Court of Appeals decided to overturn his conviction and ordered a retrial. On 4 November, the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 26 convicted Ahmet Altan and sentenced him to 10-and-a-half years in prison on the basis of the same evidence that had seen him convicted at the first trial – his writing and comments that are critical of the government. The court ruled that he be released pending his appeal, with an international travel ban. 
The prosecutor appealed the court’s decision to release Ahmet Altan arguing that he poses a flight risk and that he showed no remorse. Although the court’s decision that he would be re-arrested, was leaked to pro-government media, he remained at his home and was detained there, demonstrating he had no intention of ‘fleeing’. He has consistently rejected the charges for which the prosecution has failed to provide any credible evidence. 
I urge you to release Ahmet Altan immediately and unconditionally as he is a prisoner of conscience jailed solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.

Ubai Aboudi has been detained since 13 November 2019, without charge or trial in Ofer prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Major-General Nadav Padan, 
On 13 November at around 3:00am at least 10 Israeli soldiers entered Ubai Aboudi’s home in Kufr Aqab and detained him in front of his wife and children. Ubai Aboudi is meant to take part in the Third International Meeting for Science in Palestine in the USA in January 2020. 
On 18 November, Ubai Aboudi was issued a four-month administrative detention order signed by you. On 28 November 2019, his detention order is meant to be confirmed by an Israeli military judge. Ubai Aboudi is the Director of prominent Palestinian NGO Bisan Center for Research and Development. Administrative detention orders can be renewed indefinitely, and evidence is kept secret, meaning that detainees are not able to effectively challenge their detention and do not know when they will be released. 
Amnesty International is gravely concerned that Israel’s systematic use of administrative detention against Palestinians
violates international human rights law; its use as such results in arbitrary detention, and if prolonged or repeated can amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. 
I urge you to immediately release Ubai Aboudi, and all others who have been placed under administrative detention, unless they are promptly charged with an internationally recognizable crime and tried in proceedings that adhere to international fair trial standards. I urge you to take immediate steps to end the practice of administrative detention.

Groups advocating hatred and discrimination took full advantage of the police’s failure and subjected peaceful marchers to severe abuse,” said Oksana Pokalchuk, Amnesty International Ukraine’s Director. 
“Tomorrow we are calling on the Ukrainian authorities to send a clear message that they will stand up for the LGBTQ+ community. During the most recent Pride marches in Kyiv the police demonstrated that they are able to effectively protect LGBTQ+ events, and we urge them to follow their own example tomorrow. They must create a safe space for transgender rights activists to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.

Yesterday, state authorities announced an investigation into the death, and continuation of the investigation into Arnulfo´s disappearance. These investigations must consider his work as a human rights defender in ensuring a robust enquiry.

1) This Month’s Feature – The Remaking of Northeast Syria in October 2019  
Turkey/Syria – Amnesty International Demands that Turkey Suspend its Military Offensive in Northern Syria. On November 11, Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director published an op-ed in the Washington Post on President Erdogan’s November 13 White House meeting with President Trump. Despite the Turkish government’s insistence that the military operation was necessary to stop terrorism and secure peace, it has devastated civilians. During the offensive in Syria, Turkish military forces and a coalition of Turkey-backed Syrian armed groups committed serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that killed and injured civilians. As of November 11, up to 300,000 people were at risk of displacement. Erdogan has also made clear his intentions to repatriate up to 3.6 million Syrian refugees to the newly created so-called “safe zone” or “buffer zone” in Syria. Amnesty International demands that Turkey not deport Syrian refugees as it violates their human rights and international legal standards. For more information on Syria, contact Philippe Nassif at [email protected].  
Turkish Authorities Arrest Nearly 300 Citizens in Crackdown Against Dissent. Since Turkey’s military offensive in Syria in October, Turkish authorities have detained 267 people and investigated 839 social media accounts for commenting or reporting on the incursion. Turkish authorities have accused journalists, social media users and protesters of “terrorism” and subjected them to criminal investigation, arbitrary detention and travel bans. Amnesty International is calling on Turkish authorities to end the crackdown on dissenters. For more information on Turkey, contact Daniel Balson at [email protected].  
 
Above: On November 13 President Erdogan met with President Trump at the White House following Turkey’s military incursion into northern Syria.  
On October 31, the Helsinki Commission held a hearing on “The Human Toll of Turkey’s Policy at Home and Abroad.” Amnesty International USA submitted a statement highlighting the rapidly deteriorating human rights crisis in Syria and how Turkey’s incursion into Syria constitutes war crimes.  
2) Major Middle East Developments  
a) Israel/Palestine – Secretary Pompeo’s Announcement on Israeli Settlements Violates Geneva Conventions and International Consensus on Illegality of Settlements.Secretary Pompeo’s November 19 announcement places the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank at increased risk by giving Israel the green light to continue with its settlement building and expansion policy which contributes to the human rights crisis in the area. The construction and maintenance of settlements in the Occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, breaches international law and amounts to war crimes. Amnesty International calls on Israel to immediately cease all settlement activity as a first step to dismantling all Israeli settlements and related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (“OPT”) and relocating Israeli civilians living in such settlements outside of the OPT.  
b)Iran – Iranian Security Forces Must Stop Using Excessive Force on Peaceful Protesters.As of November 19, Iranian security forces have killed at least 106 protesters in 21 cities. The death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed. Iranian security forces have committed unlawful killings and used excessive force to crush largely peaceful protests in more than 100 cities across Iran sparked by a hike in fuel prices on November 15. Iranian authorities must immediately end the brutal crackdown and ensure the rights to free assembly and expression are respected by ending the internet shutdown.  
c) Saudi Arabia – Amnesty International Condemns Saudi Arabia’s Announcement Categorizing Feminism, Homosexuality and Atheism as Extremist Ideas.  On November 12, Saudi Arabia’s state security agency announced that feminism, homosexuality, and atheism would be officially categorized as “extremist ideas.” This announcement is extremely dangerous and has serious implications for the rights to free expression. Amnesty International calls on the U.S. to pressure Saudi Arabia to protect free expression and to release jailed human rights defenders.  
d) Iraq – Iraqi Security Forces Must Stop Using Excessive Force on Peaceful Protesters. In late October, Iraqi security forces and anti-riot police opened fire on peaceful protesters with live ammunition and tear gas. As of November 11, violence from the protests killed 319 and injured 15,000 people. The U.S. must press the Iraqi government to investigate these events and ensure all those responsible are held accountable for their actions.  
e) Lebanon – Lebanese Authorities Must Stop Using Excessive Force on Peaceful Protesters. Since October 18, Lebanese security forces have used excessive force to disperse overwhelmingly peaceful protests, including by firing huge amounts of tear gas into crowds, chasing protesters down streets and alleys at gunpoint and beating them. On October 26, the Lebanese army open fired to disperse protests in northern Lebanon, seriously injuring at least two people. The U.S. must pressure the Lebanese government to protect protesters and their right to free expression.  
f) Libya – Congress Should Pass the Libya Stabilization Act. This legislation (H.R. 4644) supports a peaceful diplomatic resolution to the Libyan conflict. In late October, Amnesty International documented evidence of potential war crimes by both the UN-backed Government of National Accord and the Libyan National Army, who have been fighting in and around Tripoli. This legislation will help deter foreign interference in Libya and prevent the continued supply of weapons, which violate the UN arms embargo.   
g) Afghanistan – Congress Should Pass the Afghan Women’s Inclusion in Negotiations Act. On October 23, Amnesty International co-hosted a Capitol Hill briefing to press Congress to affirm support for women and girls in Afghanistan and develop policy solutions that will protect them as U.S. troops leave Afghanistan. Amnesty International USA urges Congress to pass the Afghan Women’s Inclusion in Negotiations Act (H.R. 4097), which mandates the creation of a plan that prioritizes women as part of any reconstruction efforts. After nearly 18 years of U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and hundreds of billions of dollars spent, Congress must ensure that Afghan women are included in the peace process.

a) Congress Must Provide Oversight to Dangerous Migrant Protection Protocols (“MPP”) Policy. In a statement for a November 19 House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing, Amnesty International outlined the human rights violations inherent in the MPP, informally known as “Remain in Mexico.” Since January, nearly 60,000 people have been forcibly returned to Mexico under the program. The program has made a mockery of the right to seek asylum by forcibly returned tens of thousands of individuals to potential grave danger and is operated with a dangerous lack of transparency. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to defund MPP in FY 2020 appropriations, urge DHS and DOJ to allow public access to secretive tent courts, and undertake congressional delegations to areas where MPP is actively in operation.  
b) New Interim Final Rule Seeks to Implement Asylum Cooperative Agreements Between U.S., Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.The President’s new interim final rule could be deadly for people seeking asylum as it would require people to request asylum in the dangerous countries that they pass through en route to the U.S. People should not be forced to seek safety in places that are anything but safe. U.S. policies cannot continue to punish asylum-seekers who have been forced to flee their homes.  
c) Alejandra Barrera Urges Congress to End the Detention of Transgender Immigrants. For almost two years, Amnesty International has campaigned on behalf of Alejandra Barrera, a Salvadoran transgender asylum seeker who was detained for 21 months. In late October, Alejandra met with 11 Members of Congress and spoke at a packed Hill briefing. She urged Congress and DHS to end the detention of trans asylum seekers who are subject to substandard health care, deplorable conditions, and discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity in violation of international legal standards.  
  
Above: On October 21, Alejandra and Amnesty International staff met with Senator Murray regarding Homeland Security’s treatment of transgender immigrants in detention.  
d) Scott Warren Faces 10 Years in Prison for Giving Aid to Migrants at U.S.-Mexico Border. In late October, Dr. Warren visited with Members of Congress to advocate for humanitarian aid for migrants at the border. Warren works for No More Deaths, a humanitarian aid organization, and faced a 20-year prison sentence for providing aid to migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border. The prosecution dropped some of the charges against him, but he still faces 10 years in prison and another trial in November.  
  
4) China – Amnesty International USA Urges the House to Pass Legislation Holding Chinese Government Accountable for Detention of Over One Million Uyghurs. On October 30, the House Foreign Affairs passed the Uyghur Human Rights and Policy Act (S.178). Amnesty International USA calls on the House to follow the Senate and pass this legislation.  
  
Above: In 2018 and 2019 Amnesty International has interviewed over 100 people whose relatives are missing. Chinese authorities have torn apart hundreds of thousands of families and relatives still are desperate to know what has happened to their loved ones.  
  
5) United Kingdom – Migrant Deaths Highlight Increasing Perils for Migrants in Europe. In late October, UK police found 39 bodies inside a tractor trailer. Investigators said the case likely involved human trafficking. By implementing restrictive policies, the European Union has forced migrants and asylum seekers to travel through illegal means, often falling victim to human trafficking.  
6) Jordan – Jordanian Authorities Must End Abusive Male Guardianship System. Over the past several years, the Jordanian government has adopted several important reform measures to address gender-based violence, but they must end the detention and ill-treatment of women simply for disobeying their male guardian or transgressing gender norms. Jordanian women who are accused of leaving home without permission or having sex outside marriage risk detention and humiliating “virginity tests.” Women pregnant outside marriage also face forcible separation from their newborn children.  
7) U.S. – Rather Than Ending Wars, the Trump Administration Has Made Them Far More Deadly for Civilians. In late October, The Daily Beast ran an opinion piece from Amnesty International USA’s Security with Human Rights Director highlighting Amnesty’s findings of a huge spike in civilian casualties from U.S. wars under President Trump, despite his claims to be ending “endless wars.” Furthermore, on November 18 President Trump issued two pardons and reversed disciplinary action in a case involving war crimes, compounding risks for civilians worldwide. Amnesty International has previously documentation how U.S. military operations in Syria and Somalia have caused civilian casualties. Congress must ensure that the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020 includes specific provisions to improve the investigations and reporting of civilian casualties resulting from U.S. lethal operations by any agency.

TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
I am deeply shocked to hear the decision of your government to shut down the Maldivian Democracy Network (MDN), and seriously concerned about the resulting death threats against its members and staff. 
As one of the most prominent NGOs in Maldives, MDN has played a crucial role in promoting human rights in the country including invaluable research on topics such as police reform, torture, threats to human rights defenders and the right to freedom of expression, among others. In fact, I find it very distressing that MDN is currently facing intimidation from the very government whose members, former prisoners of conscience, it campaigned so tirelessly to have released. 
Human rights defenders and activists around the world have been optimistic about the improved situation for civil society in the country following the formation of your government in November 2018, and the promise to put an end to the repressive tactics used by previous governments. However, the decision to shut down MDN, and allow religious hardliners to launch threats of violence, death and rape against human rights defenders and activists, sends a chilling message to local civil society, outside observers as well as many travellers who plan to visit Maldives. 
I urge you to reinstate MDN, ensure the safety and security of all its members and staff, and create an enabling environment for human rights defenders, activists and civil society organizations to freely carry out their activities without threats of violence, prosecution and repression. 
Yours sincerely,

This is an active conflict zone, as evidenced by Turkey’s own recent military action in the north-eastern part of the country in October 2019. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I am writing to express serious concern about the recent treatment of Syrian refugees in Turkey and the potential implementation of longstanding plans to unlawfully relocate people to a so-called “safe zone” in northern Syria. I recognize and appreciate that your country is the world’s largest host of refugees, at around 4 million people. But this admirable generosity does not absolve your government of its obligation to respect international law and protect the rights of the people under its jurisdiction – including refugees from Syria. 
In a comprehensive briefing published on 25 October 2019, Amnesty International showed that in mid-2019 it is likely that hundreds of Syrian refugees across Turkey were apprehended, detained, and deported against their will, usually after being coerced or misled into signing so-called “voluntary return” documents. Those who manage to re-enter Turkey find that their Turkish identification documents have been cancelled. Syrians without valid identification documents are unable to access essential services and are at heightened risk of deportation or re-deportation. I am also deeply concerned about the Turkish authorities’ longstanding plans to relocate large numbers of Syrian refugees to the northern part of Syria, on the false basis that this area is currently safe. Syria remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries. Deporting anyone to Syria violates the international law principle of non-refoulement. 
I urge you to immediately stop deporting Syrian refugees, ensure that those whose identification documents have expired or been cancelled are able to renew them, and investigate all allegations of deportations to Syria. I also urge you to stop any plans to relocate Syrian refugees to a so-called “safe zone.” 
Yours sincerely,

RE: Amnesty International Statement for Hearing on “Examining the Human Rights and Legal Implications of DHS’s ‘Remain in Mexico’ Policy”  
  
On behalf of Amnesty International USA and our members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. Amnesty International is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the United States. A top priority of our organization is the human right to seek asylum at the Mexico/U.S. border. 
  
Amnesty International is alarmed by the human rights violations inherent in the misleadingly named “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP), informally known as “Remain in Mexico.” Since January, nearly 60,000 people have been forcibly returned to Mexico under the program.[1] The program has made a mockery of the right to seek asylum as enshrined in domestic and international law, forcibly returned tens of thousands of individuals to potential grave danger, and operated with a dangerous lack of transparency. 
  
In this statement, we wish to share some of our gravest and most immediate concerns about the policy. We thank the Subcommittee for holding this important hearing and hope it is the first of several oversight efforts by Congress of this dangerous and unlawful program. 
  
MPP Violates the Right to Seek Asylum 
  
The concept of territorial asylum – the ability of people seeking refuge at U.S. borders to request protection here – is a bedrock principle of international and domestic law. Under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, the latter of which the United States has signed and incorporated into domestic law through the 1980 Refugee Act,[2] governments must not forcibly return individuals to a place where they would fear persecution – not just their countries of origin, but any other place where a person would face risk of serious harm. [3] To ensure this obligation is met, the U.S. government has codified in domestic law the right to seek asylum both at and between ports of entry along the U.S. border.[4] 
  
Historically, people seeking asylum at the border were given the opportunity to articulate a “credible fear” of return to their home countries; if they established such a fear, they were placed into removal proceedings and allowed to apply for asylum and related protections from within the United States, based on their fear of return to their countries of origin.[5] 
  
MPP has upended this process by instead forcibly returning people, including asylum-seekers, to dangerous and precarious situations in Mexico for the duration of their asylum proceedings, which can last several months, if not years. Only after these individuals win relief are they allowed to enter United States – and even after they win relief, the government frequently sends them back to Mexico, reportedly by falsifying court documents.[6] 
  
MPP appears designed to discourage individuals from seeking asylum by making it as difficult as possible to do so.[7] Not only are asylum-seekers exposed to grave harm as they await their proceedings in Mexico (as described in greater detail below), but they are also effectively cut off from legal services essential to securing relief. 
  
In one study, asylum-seekers who appeared with attorneys were found to be five times as likely to obtain relief as those who represented themselves.[8] Yet, because MPP maroons asylum-seekers far from legal service providers, only between 1-2% of returnees are represented by counsel.[9] Because of restrictions on who may access new, secretive tent courts built at ports of entry, people subject to MPP are not able to access basic legal orientations and thus lack even minimal information about their proceedings. These hurdles make asylum all but impossible to access. 
  
MPP Returns People Seeking Safety to Harm’s Way 
  
By returning vulnerable individuals to some of the most dangerous places along the Mexico/U.S. border, MPP has directly resulted in grievous harms – including kidnappings, sexual assaults, extortion attempts, and other violent attacks – against people seeking protection. As of October 1, 343 individuals subjected to MPP had reportedly faced violent attacks or threats in Mexico, including on their way to their court dates in the United States.[10] Service providers working with MPP returnees have reported that anywhere from “half”[11] to “over 70%”[12] of individuals they’ve worked with have described facing serious harm in Mexico. These include: 
  
These stories of harm are so commonplace that one attorney who works with returnees in Matamoros commented to Amnesty International that “for people returned under the program, it’s not a question of if they’ll get kidnapped – it’s a question of when.”[15] The Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which abuts south Texas, carries a “Level 4 – Do Not Travel” warning from the U.S. Department of State because of risks of kidnapping and other violent crime by cartels.[16] The forcible return of tens of thousands vulnerable migrants and asylum-seekers to this area has constituted a veritable stimulus package for cartels operating in this region, which routinely kidnap returnees and extort their families for ransom, in some cases preventing them from being able to appear in court.[17] Yet, despite these documented harms, immigration judges have publicly stated that they are pressured to issue in absentia removal orders in every instance in which an MPP returnee does not appear. 
  
Even those returnees who have faced grave harm are typically unable to escape from MPP once they are placed in the program. Though the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has instituted a fear-of-return-to-Mexico screening as part of MPP, called a “non-refoulement interview,” in practice, these screenings are a sham. First, they are available only to those individuals who affirmatively manifest a fear of harm in Mexico, violating a threshold principle of non­-refoulement that all individuals must be screened for fear of harm in a given place before being forcibly sent there. Furthermore, the threshold is exceedingly high – higher than the showing required to win asylum on the merits.[18] Asylum officers have spoken openly about how they are pressured to issue negative determinations, even when they believe returnees will be subject to grave harm in Mexico.[19] Returnees have described how these interviews are cursory, in some cases lasting no more than 10 minutes.[20] Even those few returnees who have lawyers are generally unable to bring those attorneys to these interviews.[21] Returning asylum-seekers to any country without an adequate screening process is a flagrant violation of the U.S. obligation against refoulement.  
Furthermore, returnees subject to MPP routinely face homelessness due to the lack of available shelter space and difficulty accessing work, which further exposes them to risks of violent crime. Returnees have reported having their identity documentation confiscated by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents prior to return[22] and are not provided any identity documentation demonstrating their lawful status in Mexico, potentially exposing them to potential detention and deportation there. Without access to work or steady shelter, many are relegated to living in precarious conditions, often in squalor, in border shelters packed to the brim[23] and in open-air tent camps.[24] 
  
Finally, even individuals whose vulnerabilities should except them from MPP are nevertheless placed in the program – including individuals with disabilities,[25] pregnant and nursing women,[26] and Indigenous language speakers.[27] LGBTI+ identifying individuals are also placed in the program, despite the well-documented risks of harm they face in Mexico.[28] 
  
  
A new and alarming expansion of MPP occurred in September, when the U.S. government opened secretive tent courts at the ports of entry in Laredo and Brownsville, Texas, where proceedings take place entirely via videoconference. DHS announced in August it would raid $155 million of disaster relief funding to build these courts.[29] 
  
The tent courts are due process blackholes in DHS’s complete control: not a single public observer has been permitted to access the tent courts to view proceedings taking place there, even though immigration courts are generally required to be open to the public.[30] Amnesty International has consistently requested access to the courts, including multiple times in person in Laredo and Brownsville in September and October. In September, an Amnesty International delegation was told variously that the tent courts were a “zero access area, by order of the President of the United States,” that attendees would need to be “vetted” by CBP in order to access the courts, and that the organization would be able to access the facilities for a tour “in upcoming weeks.” In October, Amnesty’s formal request for access went unanswered for weeks, until the organization was eventually told that observation of proceedings would not be allowed, but that at some future date, rights groups would be offered a tour. Two months since the courts have opened, and despite repeated requests, neither Amnesty International nor other rights groups have been granted access to the courts. 
  
This lack of transparency is chilling, especially considering that individuals appearing at the tent courts are being sent to some of the most dangerous areas along the Mexico/U.S. border and are likely to be in particular need of immediate assistance. The closed-off nature of these courts also means that asylum-seekers are cut off from any kind of legal orientation or assistance, as only attorneys who have entered appearances in individual cases are permitted in the tent courts. 
  
The tent courts exacerbate and compound existing problems with MPP: returnees appearing in tent courts face even more barriers to the full and fair hearings to which they’re entitled under law, particularly given that judges are appearing via videoconference, sometimes from hundreds of miles away. They are designed to keep asylum-seekers away from vital legal help and MPP proceedings out of the public eye. Unless Congress moves to act, these secretive courts could represent the future of asylum adjudication in the United States. 
  
Recommendations 
  
Given the serious human rights violations occurring as a result of MPP’s continued operation, Amnesty International respectfully requests that Congress:

TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
On 31 October 2019, the National Council for Human Rights (CNDH) announced that detained journalist Rabie Lablak decided to end his hunger strike after 45 days due to the deterioration of his health condition. Lablak began his hunger strike on 6 September 2019 in protest of the alleged torture and ill-treatment he has suffered at the hands of Moroccan security officials since his arrest in 2017. 
In June 2018, Rabie Lablak was sentenced to five years in prison for “spreading false information and the usurpation of the profession of journalism” in what his lawyer alleges was an unfair trial. 
I therefore ask you to immediately and unconditionally release Rabie Lablak and quash his conviction. Pending his release, I call on you to ensure he has access to qualified health professionals and healthcare provided in line with medical ethics, including the principles of confidentiality, autonomy, and informed consent. I finally call on you to investigate the conditions of his detention and the lack of adequate healthcare provided during his hunger strike. 
Yours sincerely,

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister Aryeh Deri, 
On 24 October 2019, Mustafa al-Kharouf was released from arbitrary detention in Givon prison and was finally reunited with his family. Although he is released, he is still at risk of being detained again and deported as he has not been granted legal residency status. Mustafa al-Kharouf had to deposit a 12,000 NIS (approximately 4,000 USD) bail and is required to be home between 10:00 pm and 5:00 am. HaMoked Center for the Defense of the Individual via Attorney Adi Lustigman, Mustafa al-Kharouf’s lawyer, have submitted a preliminary request to grant Mustafa al-Kharouf permanent residency under the family reunification procedure. Mustafa al-Kharouf only knows Jerusalem as his home and for years has been attempting to have his status legalized. 
On 22 January 2019, Palestinian Jerusalemite Mustafa al-Kharouf was arrested after the Israeli Ministry of Interior Affairs denied his request for family unification and ordered his immediate deportation to Jordan. He was arbitrarily detained in Givon prison, in Ramle, for nine months. 
I urge you to allow Mustafa al-Kharouf to remain safely in his home by granting him permanent residency status in East Jerusalem in line with Israel’s obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister Romero, 
On 24 October, journalist Mónica Ximena Galarza Lorca interviewed analyst Edgar Villegas on TVU (University Television). Edgar Villegas made public data that pointed to irregularities in the counting of the electoral results of the presidential election of 20 October. 
Following the interview, Mónica Ximena Galarza Lorca received hundreds of messages on her cell phone from unknown numbers, some threatening to act against her. Edgar Villegas, his family, and Mónica Ximena Galarza told Amnesty International that they were followed by a series of vehicles – both taxis and dark vehicles with tinted windows upon leaving the television studio. Villegas told Amnesty International that during recent days his friends have received phone calls from his cell phone number, even though his telephone has been off since the interview. Strange vehicles and persons have been spotted outside their homes at various times. On 25 October, the website of University Television (TVU) went down for several hours without any explanation, and according to the television station, an alternative website for their channel appeared during this time. 
I urge you to guarantee the safety of Edgar Villegas and Mónica Ximena Galarza Lora, as well as that of their families.

1) This Month’s Feature 
Refugees – Amnesty International USA Protests Trump Administration’s Drastic Cuts to Refugee Admissions Program. In late September the President announced that the U.S. would cut the refugee admissions goal to the lowest number in history when over 1.4 million refugees need access to resettlement. On October 15, Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director Margaret Huang was arrested during a protest at the Capitol while Secretary of State Pompeo met with Congress. In September, over 400 state and local elected leaders from 46 states called on the President to resettle more refugees. 
 
On October 15, Amnesty International USA’s Executive Director joined other human rights leaders to protest the all-time low Presidential Determination for FY 2020. 
2) Major Human Rights News 
a) Turkey/Syria – Turkish Military Offensive Could Pose Devastating Humanitarian Consequences in northern Syria. An estimated 2.2 million people in Northern Syria are at risk as Turkey continues its military operations against YPG/Kurdish forces. Amnesty International has identified attacks by Turkish forces that led to at least 32 civilian deaths, including the killing of a prominent Kurdish women’s rights activist and politician. We are currently investigating reports of serious violations, including possible war crimes, in the current Turkish offensive. In areas that have come under Syrian government control, civilians are at risk of enforced disappearance, torture, forced conscription and arbitrary detention, particularly activists – both Syrian Arabs and Syrian Kurds. Amnesty International urges all states to end the transfer of weapons to combatants that carry a substantial risk of facilitating violations of human rights. Moreover, the government of Turkey must ensure that individuals exercising their freedom of speech to criticize the military operation do not face retaliation through investigations, imprisonment, or violence. For additional, timely updates about the human rights situation in Northern Syria, please contact Philippe Nassif, Amnesty International USA Middle East Advocacy Director, at [email protected]. 
b) Venezuela – Amnesty Venezuela Urges Senate to Pass Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) for Venezuelans. On September 26, Amnesty Venezuela director Marcos Gomez briefed Congressional staff on the deteriorating human rights condition in Venezuela. The need for the U.S. to protect Venezuelans is more urgent than ever: an estimated 200,000 Venezuelans could benefit from TPS, and Venezuelans now make up the largest nationality affirmatively seeking asylum in the U.S. Venezuelans continue to be at risk of deportation and have been subject to Trump’s anti-asylum measures at the SW border. Amnesty urges the Senate to immediately pass the Venezuela TPS Act ( 636). 
c) U.S. – Amnesty International Briefing Examines the Climate Crisis and Displacement of Peoples. On October 8, Amnesty International USA convened an expert panel discuss the effects of the climate crisis on mass displacement throughout the world. The panelists detailed how the climate crisis, environmental degradation, and disasters contribute to displacement, both domestic and international. 
d) Saudi Arabia – Amnesty International Marks One-Year Anniversary of the Brutal Murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Amnesty’s Mid East Advocacy Director Philippe Nassif recently spoke at a Congressional event and called on the U.N. to investigate the killing of Khashoggi. Amnesty International USA also co-hosted a vigil in front of the Saudi Arabia Embassy in Washington, D.C. 
e) U.S. – Amnesty International USA Sponsors National Rally to Demand Congressional Action on Gun Violence. On September 25 Amnesty International USA joined activists from around the country in a rally calling on Congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence. AIUSA is demanding that the Senate mandate universal background checks on all gun sales ( 42) and urges the House to pass the Assault Weapons Ban Act (H.R. 1296), Keep Americans Safe Act (H.R.1186), Extreme Risk Protection Orders Act (H.R. 1236), and Disarm Hate Act (H.R. 2708). 
 
Above: On September 25 AIUSA co-hosted a rally to protest Congressional inaction on gun violence. 
f) U.S.-Mexico Border – Amnesty International Briefs Congress on Dangers Trans Asylum Seekers Face While in Detention. On October 16, Amnesty International USA hosted a Hill briefing featuring Alejandra, an asylum seeker from El Salvador who requested protection at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 and was subsequently detained by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) for nearly two years. Amnesty International has concluded that some trans asylum seekers in DHS custody have suffered substandard health care, deplorable detention conditions, and discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity –constituting ill treatment in violation of international legal standards. 
 
On October 16, Amnesty International hosted a Hill briefing featuring a trans asylum seeker who was detained for nearly two years. 
g) Honduras – Amnesty International USA Condemns Honduras-U.S. Asylum Agreement. On September 25, DHS announced that it had signed an asylum agreement with Honduras. Reporting suggests that Cubans and Nicaraguans who seek safety at the U.S. border could be sent to Honduras to have their claims processed. Honduras has one of the highest homicide rates in the Americas, and according to the State Department, transiting migrants in Honduras are “vulnerable to abuse by criminal organizations.” Amnesty International condemns the agreement, which will endanger the lives of asylum-seekers in search of safety. 
h) Somalia – Amnesty International Demands Recognition of Civilians Killed in Airstrikes by U.S. Military. In September, Amnesty International released new reporting on civilian casualties caused by U.S. air strikes in Somalia. To date, Amnesty International has identified 17 civilians killed and eight injured by just six U.S. air strikes. However, while the U.S. military has acknowledged conducting 131 air strikes since early 2017, it has acknowledged only two civilian deaths as a result. 
i) U.S. – Amnesty International USA Urges Congress to Pass the Solitary Confinement Study and Reform Act. This legislation (H.R. 4488), introduced on September 25, would establish a commission to study solitary confinement, with the goals of implementing more humane national standards informed by best practices and reducing the use of solitary confinement. 
j) U.S. – Amnesty International USA Condemns the President’s National Emergency Declaration. S.J.Res. 54 passed the Senate on September 25 but was vetoed by the President on October 16. The President has used the national emergency declaration to manufacture a crisis for the purpose of militarizing the southern border region and blocking asylum seekers from safety in the U.S.

","Six political activists have been arrested in Jakarta, Indonesia after peacefully campaigning for the right to self-determination of Papua. Charged with “rebellion” (makar), the six Papuan activists are prisoners of conscience and should be immediately and unconditionally released.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear General Idham, 
I write to express my concern regarding the six Papuan activists Dano (Anes) Tabuni, Charles Kosal, Ambrosius Mulait, Isay Wenda, Arina Lokbere, and Surya Anta Ginting, who were all arrested over the days of 30 and 31 August by the Jakarta Regional Police Force. They have all been detained and charged with “rebellion” (makar) under Articles 106 and 110 of the Criminal Code. 
Currently detained at the Police Mobile Brigade Headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, Amnesty International considers the six activists to be prisoners of conscience as they have been detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and assembly by peacefully campaigning for the right to self-determination of Papua. 
While their lawyers could meet the activists, they were not allowed to be present in the room during the police interrogation of their clients. In addition to not being able to hear what was being said, the lawyers have complained that the observation window was heavily tinted which obstructed their view of what was happening inside. 
I urge you to immediately and unconditionally release the six Papuan political activists and drop all the charges against them as they are prisoners of conscience detained solely for expression peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly; and pending their release, ensure that they are protected from torture and other ill-treatment and have regular access to their family members, access of medical care, and lawyers of their choice. They must be assisted by their lawyers in all stages of the legal process, in line with the right to a fair trial. I also urge you to counsel the President to ensure that Article 106 and 110 of the Criminal Code are repealed or amended to ensure they comply fully with Indonesia’s obligations under international human rights law. 
Yours Sincerely,

The authorities must urgently provide the health care he requires and protect him from any form of harassment or reprisals. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Head of Penitentiary Directorate, 
I am concerned about the treatment of Vladislav Sharkovsky who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for a minor, non-violent drug-related offense in Penal Colony Number 22 (‘Volchie Nory’) in Ivatsevichi. 
Vladislav has developed health complications following his arrest and imprisonment, and has been suffering from headaches, worsening cough, blurred vision and stomach pain for the last 14 months. Furthermore, he has developed trauma after discovering the dead body of another teenager inmate who had committed suicide. Despite multiple requests, the prison administration has not provided him with the adequate medical and psychological care he requires. According to his mother, Vladislav was pressured by prison officials to write a note stating that he did not require any medical assistance. He has been threatened by the prison administration that he will face reprisals if his mother continues to complain about his prison conditions. 
Vladislav was 17 years old when he became a courier for an anonymous internet-based company which paid him for collecting and delivering packages. According to his indictment, he was distributing illegal drugs as part of an organized group, for which he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison, under Part 4 of Article 328 of the Criminal Code. This is despite Vladislav not knowing who his anonymous employer was, and despite the employer remaining “unknown” to the prosecution. 
Vladislav’s right to a fair trial and his rights under the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child have been violated. Following his arrest, still a child, he did not have access to his family, nor to a lawyer until a day later, and during this time he was forced to sign a self-incriminating statement dictated by the investigating officer. The current failure to provide Vladislav with adequate health care may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. I urge you to ensure that Vladislav is provided with the health care he requires and protected from any form of harassment or reprisals.

1) This Month’s Feature 
Trump Administration’s Relentless Assault on Asylum Seekers at the U.S. Border Results in Asylum Ban 2.0 and Unsafe Agreement with El Salvador. On September 12, the Supreme Court allowed President Trump’s asylum ban 2.0 to temporarily proceed. This decision could be a death sentence for people seeking safety and protection. In late September an Amnesty International USA delegation traveled to south Texas to visit the secretive port courts that have been built for assembly-line asylum proceedings. 
On September 20, Amnesty International USA condemned the agreement with El Salvador that would require Central American asylum seekers traveling through El Salvador to seek refuge there instead of in the U.S. Amnesty International has declared El Salvador to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women. 
In mid-October, Amnesty International USA will be sending a high-level delegation to south Texas to examine access to asylum at the border. 
  
2) Major Human Rights News 
a) National Defense Authorization Act (“NDAA”) – Amnesty International USA Urges Conferees to Include Human Rights Amendments in Final Bill. NDAA conferees should ensure that human rights amendments and provisions are included in the final NDAA package, including amendments designed to reduce gun violence, to cut off support for the Saudi-Emirati coalition, to end human rights abuses in Myanmar, and to support women in Afghanistan. 
b) Myanmar – Amnesty International USA Urges Senate to Include Burma Act as Part of the NDAA. On September 24, the House passed the Burma Act (R. 3190). Amnesty International USA urges the Senate to pass the Burma Act as part of the NDAA. Myanmar authorities continue to act with impunity against civilians in Rakhine State including arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances – many of which constitute war crimes. 
c) State Department – Amnesty International USA Calls on Senate to Reject Nomination of Marshall Billingslea to Undersecretary for Civilian Security. Amnesty International USA strongly opposes the nomination of Billingslea to the most senior position in the State Department charged with advocating for human rights. Billingslea previously supported the use of torture by the Bush administration. Amnesty International USA joined a coalition of human rights and government organizations urging Senators to oppose the nomination. 
d) Ukraine – Amnesty International USA Briefing Presses for Accountability on Human Rights. On September 18, Amnesty International USA organized a briefing on U.S. foreign policy towards Ukraine. Amnesty International is pressing Ukrainian authorities to end impunity for extremist violence and protect embattled human rights defenders and activists.

Above: Rep. Fitzpatrick (R-PA) was one of three Members of Congress who spoke at AIUSA’s briefing on Ukraine. 
Ukrainian Filmmaker Oleh Sentsov Is Freed. On September 7, Ukrainian authorities released filmmaker Oleh Sentsov and dozens of other detainees. Amnesty International has campaigned for their freedom after they were detained on charges stemming from their opposition to Russia’s occupation of Crimea. Amnesty International USA worked with Representative Marcy Kaptur to advocate for Oleh Sentsov as part of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission’s Defending Freedoms Project. Amnesty International USA calls on all Members of Congress to advocate for Ukrainian human rights defenders including members of the Crimean Tatar community who remain unjustly imprisoned in the Russian Federation. 
e) Gun Violence – Amnesty International USA Calls on Congress to Pass Assault Weapons Ban. In a statement for the September 25 House Judiciary Committee hearing on “Protecting America from Assault Weapons,” Amnesty International USA urged Congress to pass the Assault Weapons Ban Act (R. 1296). The horrific mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton and Odessa highlight the dangers posed by assault weapons and high capacity magazines that can kill dozens of people in a matter of seconds. 
AIUSA also urges the House to swiftly pass the Keep Americans Safe Act (H.R.1186), Extreme Risk Protection Orders Act (H.R. 1236), and Disarm Hate Act (H.R. 2708). 
f) Climate Crisis – Amnesty International Presents Ambassador of Conscience Award to Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future Movement. On September 16, Amnesty International presented its highest honor to Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement to recognize their efforts to raise awareness on the climate crisis. The Ambassador of Conscience award celebrates people who have shown unique leadership and courage in standing up for human rights. On September 20, Amnesty International joined millions of people in 150 countries to participate in climate strikes to demand that governments phase out fossil fuels and get to carbon neutral before 2050. Amnesty International USA also sent a letter to the U.S. delegation to the UN Climate Action Summit held on September 23, urging the Trump administration to acknowledge the climate crisis and put a plan in place to stop it.

g) U.S./Mexico Border – Following Southwest Border Visit, AIUSA Testifies Before Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (“IACHR”). On September 24, Amnesty’s Americas Advocacy Director Charanya Krishnaswami testified at an IACHR hearing about limitations on access to asylum and refugee protection in the U.S. In late September, an Amnesty International delegation visited south Texas to observe “Remain in Mexico” proceedings in secretive new port courts that have been built in Brownsville and Laredo. Amnesty’s statement to the Commission focused on threats to asylum at the border, including a near-total ban on asylum, which the Supreme Court recently greenlighted; safe-third country arrangements with Central American countries; the “Remain in Mexico” program; and metering. 
h) Muslim Ban – AIUSA Calls on Congress to Pass Legislation Countering the Administration’s Discriminatory Policies. On September 24, the House Judiciary and House Foreign Affairs Committees held a joint hearing on oversight of President Trump’s Muslim ban. AIUSA’sstatementdescribes how the administration’s policies targeting refugees from Muslim-majority countries have decimated refugee resettlement. AIUSA urges Congress to push the Administration to commit to resettling 95,000 refugees in the Presidential Determination for FY 2020, and to pass the No Ban Act (R. 2214) and the Guaranteed Refugee Admission Ceiling Enhancement Act (the GRACE Act, H.R. 2146/S. 1088) 
i) Yemen – Following UN Human Rights Report, AIUSA Calls on Congress to Immediately Halt Arms Sales to Saudi-Emirati Coalition. Amnesty’s Mid East Advocacy Director Philippe Nassif and Yemen researcher Rasha Mohammed co-authored an op-ed discussing the recent UN Human Rights Council report on the dire conditions in Yemen. The U.S. has knowingly supplied the Saudi-Emirati coalition with weapons, which the coalition has used to conduct human rights abuses in Yemen in violation of international law. AIUSA urges Congress to immediately halt arms sales to the Saudi-Emirati coalition in order to end the suffering of Yemeni civilians. 
j) Hong Kong – AIUSA Urges House Foreign Affairs Committee to Approve Hong Kong Protect Act (R. 4270). In late September, Amnesty International released a new report on the Hong Kong government’s increased restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. AIUSA urges the House to approve legislation that would suspend the export of crowd control equipment, which Hong Kong police have used with excessive force on peaceful protesters.

His detention is now expected to end on 4 January 2020. Ayman Nasser has been detained since 17 September 2018, without charge or trial in Ofer prison, near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Ayman Nasser is the legal unit coordinator of Palestinian NGO Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. 
 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Major-General Nadav Padan, 
On 8 September 2019, the office of the General Officer Commander (GOC) Central Command issued another four-month administrative detention order against Ayman Nasser, which was approved by the Ofer Military Court, near the city of Ramallah in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) on 11 September. Ayman Nasser is the legal unit coordinator of Palestinian human rights NGO Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. According to Ayman Nasser’s family, he suffers from health issues including inflammation in his colon and severe back pain due to a herniated disk in the lower back. He needs regular medical treatment and checks by specialized doctors, which he has failed to receive. 
Amnesty International is gravely concerned that the system of administrative detention, as practiced by Israel, violates human rights; its use may result in arbitrary detention, and if prolonged or repeated can amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. 
I urge you to immediately release Ayman Nasser, and all others who have been placed under administrative detention unless they are promptly charged with an internationally recognizable crime and tried in proceedings that adhere to international fair trial standards. I urge you to immediately provide Ayman Nasser access to adequate healthcare, including treatment by specialized doctors, and to take immediate steps to end the practice of administrative detention. 
Yours sincerely,

1) This Month’s Feature 
U.S. – In the Wake of Three Mass Shootings in August, Amnesty International USA Demands That Congress Immediately Pass Legislation to Prevent Gun Violence and Save Lives. In the aftermath of the mass shootings in Gilroy, El Paso, Dayton and Odessa, Amnesty International USA called on Congress to convene an August emergency session to pass legislation to reduce gun violence and save lives. 
On August 15, Amnesty wrote to Senate leaders to demand the Senate return to Washington for an emergency session to mandate universal background checks on all gun sales. Amnesty also urged House leaders to return to Washington for an emergency session to pass legislation banning assault weapons and pass extreme risk protection orders. Amnesty submitted a statement of support for the Assault Weapons Ban Act of 2019 (H.R. 1296), the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act of 2019 (H.R.1236) and the Disarm Hate Act of 2019 (H.R. 2708), which will be marked up by the House Judiciary Committee during the week of September 9. 
 
Above: On August 4, Amnesty Student Activist Coordinators convened in Washington, D.C. to demand that Congress mandate universal background checks. 
 
Above: On August 8, Amnesty International, March for Our Lives, and Moms Demand Action protested in Cedar Rapids to demand that Senators Grassley and Ernst support universal background checks. 
  
  
2) Other Human Rights News 
  
a) Venezuela – Amnesty International Urges the Senate to Provide Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) for Venezuelans. On July 25, the House passed the Venezuela TPS Act (R. 549), which allows Venezuelans to qualify for temporary protected status (“TPS”). TPS would prevent the deportation of Venezuelans from the U.S. and would allow them a means of survival, via work authorization, while they are here. Venezuela is undergoing a major human rights crisis that has led to the exodus of four million Venezuelans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that approximately 200,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. could benefit from TPS. The Senate must follow the House’s lead and pass this crucial legislation. 
b) Central American Children – Congress Must Protect the Flores Settlement to Prevent the Indefinite Detention of Children and Families. In August, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services published final regulations as required by the 1997 Flores settlement. The rules permit the indefinite detention of families and children and eviscerate minimal standards of detention for children, in stark contravention of the Flores settlement and human rights principles. Amnesty International filed an amicus brief in support of the challenge to the new regulations, and previously issued comments opposing the draft regulations. Congress should cease funding for family detention which irreparably harms children. 
c) Hong Kong – Amnesty International Calls for a Full Investigation into Unnecessary and Excessive Police Force on Protesters. While Hong Kong’s Chief Executive has announced the official withdraw of the Extradition Law Amendment Bill, Amnesty International is demanding an independent and thorough investigation into the police’s excessive use of force on protesters. The U.S. should push for the suspension of transferring crowd control equipment to Hong Kong. 
d) Honduras – President Hernandez Must Stop Crackdown on Peaceful Protesters. Since April, Hondurans have protested nationwide for the resignation of President Hernandez. In a desperate attempt to silence the dissent, armed forces have used tear gas and rubber bullets on peaceful protesters. Security forces have killed at least six people in these protests. Amnesty International documented how authorities not only used excessive force to repress peaceful protesters, but also arbitrarily detained and held protesters in deplorable conditions for months, denying them their right to due process. Amnesty International wrote a letter to President Hernandez expressing grave concern with the crackdowns and demanding respect for human rights, including the right of free expression. 
e) Afghanistan – Congress Must Cosponsor and Pass the Afghan WIN Act (H.R. 4097). Amnesty International USA urges all members to cosponsor the Afghan “Women’s Inclusion in Negotiations Act” (H.R. 4097). Afghan women and girls have made tremendous strides since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001 and have much to lose as Afghan peace talks advance. Yet since the start of the U.S.-Taliban peace talks, women have largely been barred from the negotiating table. This legislation would facilitate Afghan women’s participation in the U.S.-Taliban talks and mandate the creation of a plan that prioritizes them as part of any reconstruction efforts after U.S. military forces leave the country. 
f) Georgia – Russia Has Instituted Discriminatory Policies During Occupation of Georgian Territory. Since late June, thousands of Georgians have demonstrated against the Russian government’s occupation of the provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. On July 3, Amnesty International released a report exploring how Russia’s decision to erect fixed barriers on the border between South Ossetia/Abkhazia and the rest of Georgian territory has cut farmers off from their livelihoods, denied Georgians access to holy sites, eroded living standards, and instituted discriminatory policies targeting Georgians. Amnesty International USA calls on the U.S. government to diplomatically support efforts by the EU monitoring mission and raise Russia’s human rights violations in Georgia. 
g) Myanmar – Former Child Soldier Aung Ko Htwe Released From Prison. Aunt Ko Htwe was imprisoned after speaking about being abducted and forcibly recruited into the military as a child during his interview with Radio Free Asia. Aung Ko Htwe was charged under Section 505(b) of the Penal Code, which can be used to prosecute anyone who makes, publishes or circulates information that may cause “fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offense against the State or against the public tranquility.” Amnesty demands that on the Myanmar government repeal and reform laws in accordance with international human rights law. 
  
3) What’s Coming Down the Pike? 
Amnesty International USA Congressional Briefing on U.S. Policy in Ukraine. On September 18, the Congressional Ukraine Caucus and Amnesty International USA will co-host a briefing “Ukraine: Where does US Policy go from here?” in Capitol Visitors Center 268 at 4 PM.

Altan was the founding editor in chief of the newspaper Taraf from 2007 to 2012. He was arrested along with his brother, academic Mehmet Altan, on September 10, 2016. The two were accused of sending subliminal messages to the coup plotters during an appearance on a television show the day before the coup attempt. The host of the show, Nazlı Ilıcak, was also arrested. Altan and Ilıcak were just two of the at least 120 journalists arrested and held in pre-trial detention in the months following the coup attempt. During the course of the crackdown, at least 178 media outlets were closed, which put at least 2,500 journalists and other employees out of a job. The press credentials of at least 778 journalists were also revoked, essentially depriving them of the protections normally afforded to members of the media. In the last three years, more than 300,000 books have been removed from schools and libraries inTurkey and destroyed. 
 On February 16, 2018 Ahmet Altan, Mehmet Altan, and Nazlı Ilıcak and three others were given aggravated life sentences after being found guilty of the crime of “attempting to overthrow the constitutional order.” 
 Mehmet Altan was released on June 27, 2018, after a regional court backed two previous rulings by the Constitutional Court, which found that Altan’s rights had been violated. However, the charges against him were not dropped. 
On October 2, 2018 the conviction of the Altan brothers and Nazlı Ilıcak was upheld by an Istanbul Regional Court. 
On March 19, 2018, Ahmet Altan, still imprisoned, was convicted of insulting Turkey’s president in an article he wrote in 2016. He was given a 7000 Lira fine. 
On July 5, 2019, the life sentences given to the Altan brothers and Nazlı Ilıcak were overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeals. Mehmet was acquitted. However, Ahmet Altan and Nazlı Ilıcak remain in prison. The court ruled that they were aware of the coup plot and members of the
Gulen Movement, which the Turkish government claims masterminded the coup. 
Ahmet Altan’s latest novel, published in March 2019, is inspired by his time in prison. Titled I Will Never See the World Again, the book was written by Altan in Turkish, but will be published only in English and German due to current restrictive atmosphere in Turkey.

Detained for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression, Shakthika Sathkumara is a prisoner of conscience and all charges against him should be immediately and unconditionally dropped.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Mr de Livera, 
I am deeply concerned about the charges against award winning Sri Lankan writer Shakthika Sathkumara for simply writing, and sharing, a short story. Under Section 3(1) of ICCPR Act and Art. 291(B) of the Penal Code of Sri Lanka, he faces ten years in prison. 
While it is a relief that Shakthika Sathkumara was granted bail by Kurunegala High Court on 5 August 2019, he is still at risk of indictment until the charges are dropped. A prisoner of conscience, he should have never spent a day in prison solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. 
The misuse of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act to detain and prosecute writers for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression is a clear violation of international law as well as infringement of the right to freedom of thought and expression guaranteed by the constitution of Sri Lanka. The very law that is meant to protect people’s human rights in Sri Lanka, including freedom of expression, is now being misused to violate them. 
I urge you to drop all charges against Shakthika Sathkumara and order his immediate and unconditional release. Also, I appeal the Sri Lankan authorities to stop using ICCPR Act to threaten, harass and prosecute writers and activists for peacefully expressing their opinions. 
Yours sincerely

There is still no information about the charges against her, but it is believed that it may be part of a wider crackdown on Uyghur students who studied abroad. Buzainafu Abudourexiti returned to China in 2015 after studying in Egypt for two years. She is at grave risk of torture and other ill-treatment. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President Xi, 
It is of grave concern that Buzainafu Abudourexiti, an Uyghur woman, remains in incommunicado detention after she was sentenced on 5 June 2017, without any legal representation, to seven years imprisonment. She is currently being held at Urumqi Women’s Prison. 
She was taken away from her parents’ house in Urumqi, on 29 March 2017 and transferred to the city of Akesu, 1,000km away. No official documentation about her case, including what charges she was convicted of, has ever been provided. While Buzainafu Abudourexiti was pregnant at the time of her arrest, her husband later learned from officials in Xinjiang that the child was already dead in her womb when she was detained. Nothing is known about her current health status. 
Buzainafu Abudourexiti went to Egypt to study Islam for two years and returned to Urumqi in early 2015 to work at her father’s company while learning English. Planning to join her new husband Almas Nizamidin in Australia, she then went back to Egypt in September 2015 to collect the documentation for her visa application. After returning to Urumqi in December 2015, she then received the necessary clearance from the Urumqi police department and Almas proceeded to lodge an application for her Australian spousal visa. Buzainafu Abudourexiti was detained shortly after that and their application is still pending. 
I call on you to release Buzainafu Abudourexiti unconditionally and immediately unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that she committed an internationally recognized offense and is granted a fair trial in line with international standards; ensure that she has regular, unrestricted access to family and lawyers of her choice, and is not subjected to torture and other ill-treatment; allow her prompt, regular and unrestricted access to medical care on request or as necessary. 
Yours sincerely,

Human Rights Updates 
1) State Department – Amnesty International USA Denounces Secretary Pompeo’s Commission on Unalienable Rights. On July 8, Secretary Pompeo announced the creation of a Commission on Unalienable Rights at the State Department. Amnesty International joined a letter with 430 other organizations denouncing the creation of the new commission. While the so-called purpose of the commission is to reexamine human rights in the context of foreign policy, this commission is aimed at weakening international human rights frameworks, and stripping away protections for women and LGBTI individuals. 
  
2) U.S.-Mexico Border 
a) Amnesty International USA Executive Director Will Testify on Child Detention at House Appropriations Subcommittee Hearing. On July 24, Executive Director Margaret Huang will testify before a House Appropriations Subcommittee on her recent visits to the child detention facilities in Homestead (FL)and Carrizo Springs (TX).

b) Amnesty International USA Calls for the Immediate Closure of the Homestead Child Detention Facility. On July 18, Amnesty International USA published a new report on the Homestead child detention facility. The U.S. government has detained thousands of children at Homestead even though the vast majority of these children, have families and sponsors willing to take them in. Amnesty is calling for the immediate closure of Homestead and all other mass child detention facilities 
c) DOJ Must Drop Charges Against Humanitarian Aid Worker Scott Warren. On July 2, the same day that Amnesty International published its new report on U.S. authorities’ harassment and targeting of lawyers and advocates at the U.S.-Mexico border, the U.S. government announced it would retry Dr. Scott Warren. Dr. Warren is a humanitarian aid worker who has been criminally prosecuted for providing lifesaving assistance to migrants. Amnesty International USA calls on DOJ to drop all charges against Dr. Warren and on Congress to conduct oversight of U.S. harassment of human rights defenders.

Since July 2018, Lebanese authorities have been returning refugees to Syria, claiming these returns are voluntary. Lebanese authorities are pushing people back to Syria through a combination of restrictive Lebanese government policies and dire humanitarian conditions. Amnesty International analysis has concluded that Lebanon is breaching its obligation not to return refugees to a place where they can be persecuted. 
5) Saudi Arabia – Amnesty International USA Applauds Congressional Action to Block Arms Sales to Saudi-Emirati Coalition Committing Human Rights Atrocities in Yemen. In July, Congress passed resolutions (S.J.Res.36, S.J.Res.37 and S.J.Res.38) to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. On July 12, the House passed (H.Amdt.561) as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R.2500), which would prohibit the sale of air-to-ground munitions used in Yemen to the Saudi-Emirati coalition for one year. 
6) Myanmar  
a) Amnesty International Documents Disproportional Impact of Displacement on the Elderly. A new Amnesty International report documents the effects of the Myanmar military’s operations on older people. The Myanmar military has forced tens of thousands of older people from ethnic minorities to flee their homes. The humanitarian system fails to adequately address their rights and needs. 
Above: Sokhina Khatun, who is around 90 years old, stands in her shelter in Camp #1 East, Bangladesh in February 2019. She has been forced to flee to Bangladesh four times over the course of her life, as a result of persecution by the Myanmar military. 
b) Myanmar Authorities Must End Internet Shutdown. Since June 21, Myanmar authorities have imposed a complete internet shutdown in the Rakhine and Chin states. The Tatmadaw has committed serious violations amounting to war crimes. Authorities have not yet announced when this shutdown will end. Congress must speak out against this injustice and push Myanmar authorities to immediately end the shutdown. Congress must pass the Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (R.2327) to secure the release of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in Burma. Amnesty International USA urges the Senate to pass BURMA Act included in the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R.2500), to limit military cooperation between the U.S. and Myanmar and to apply sanctions to perpetrators of human rights abuses. 
7) Thailand – In Upcoming Visit, Secretary Pompeo Must Press Thai Government to Uphold Free and Fair Elections. Amnesty International urges Secretary Pompeo to press the Thai government to end the ongoing crackdown against political opposition. Since June, there have been threats from the junta leader to stage a coup, and a brutal attack on a pro-democracy leader.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Chairperson, 
I am deeply concerned by the news that on 5 July 2019, the Indonesian Supreme Court rejected the final case review submitted by Baiq Nuril Maknun and upheld its cassation decision to find her guilty of distributing pornographic content. 
While Baiq Nuril Maknun lodged a formal report complaint to the police about the sexual abuse she suffered in mid-November 2018, no police investigation has been launched. In fact, instead of receiving the justice she deserves, she was convicted of distributing pornographic content and sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of IDR 500 million under Article 27 of the Electronic Information and Transaction Law. 
I acknowledge that the Minister of Law and Human Rights, Yasonna Laoly, has pledged to support Baiq Nuril Maknun in seeking an amnesty and will provide the supporting legal arguments for the President’s consideration. Minister Yasonna has boldly said that, supporting Baiq Nuril Maknun’s case would hopefully encourage other victims to report their own experiences. 
I understand that President Joko Widodo sent an official letter on 15 July 2019 to the House of Representatives seeking parliamentary advice on an amnesty for Baiq Nuril Maknun. 
Therefore, I urge you to support the proposal and advise that all charges against Baiq Nuril Maknun are dropped and that any allegations of sexual abuse are immediately and independently investigated.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President Xi, 
It remains a grave concern that, since 2017, up to 30 relatives of Uyghur human rights defender and former prisoner of conscience, Rebiya Kadeer, are still believed to be arbitrarily detained in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). 
Rebiya Kadeer’s son, Ablikim Abdiriyim, is one of those thought to be detained. A former prisoner of conscience, he previously served 12 years in prison where he was repeatedly tortured. It is believed he was sentenced in retaliation to his mother’s human rights advocacy. Among the other family members who are believed to be detained are Kahar Abdiriyim, Kadeer’s eldest son; Ayugul, Kahar’s wife; Aydidar, Kahar’s daughter; Zulpikar, Kahar’s son; Dildar, Kahar’s daughter; Alim Abdiriyim, Kadeer’s youngest son; Xelchem, Kadeer’s sister; Atikem and her son-in-law; Imam, Xelchem’s son; Ahmetjan, Kadeer’s brother; Gheni, Kadeer’s brother. 
Formerly a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Rebiya Kadeer was detained in 1999, and sentenced to eight years in prison for “stealing state secrets”. Rebiya Kadeer is one of the best-known Uyghur human rights advocates and is a leader at the World Uyghur Congress. 
I call on you to release Rebiya Kadeer’s family members unconditionally and immediately unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognized offense and are granted a fair trial in line with international standards; ensure that members of Rebiya Kadeer’s family have regular, unrestricted access to family and lawyers of their choice, and are not subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. 
Yours sincerely,

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Counsellor, 
On 3 July 2019 a judge ordered Ola al-Qaradawi’s release under probation. However instead of releasing her, on 4 July, the Supreme State Security Prosecution decided to charge her with new, similar charges and imprison her again. She was charged with “using her connections in prison to fund terrorist groups”, despite being in solitary confinement the whole time. Ola began a hunger strike against the decision. 
Since 30 June 2017, Ola al-Qaradawi has been held in pre-trial detention, in Al-Qanater Women Prison in Qalyubia governorate, over unfounded charges. Her solitary cell is about 160 cm by 180 cm, without a bed or toilet and without sufficient ventilation and lighting. 
Hossam Khalaf, Ola’s husband, is awaiting his detention extension hearing, which has been postponed until 3 August 2019. The last time that a judge extended his detention was on 17 April 2019 for 45 days. Since then, his extension hearing has been postponed three times. Ola and Hossam have not been allowed to receive any visits from their family or lawyers, since their arrest. According to their relatives and lawyers, their health condition has worsened due to the lack of adequate food and medical care. 
In view of the fact that Ola al-Qaradawi and Hossam Khalaf are detained and charged arbitrarily, in blatant violation of fair trial rights, I urge you to immediately release Ola al-Qaradawi and Hossam Khalaf. I also call on you to ensure that pending their release, Ola al-Qaradawi and Hossam Khalaf are removed from solitary confinement, can receive visits from their families and lawyers and have access to adequate medical care, in compliance with international standards and medical ethics. Furthermore, I urge you to ensure that all prolonged solitary confinement is brought to an end.

","Palestinian refugee from Syria Mohamed Ajlani Younes has been held arbitrarily and in poor conditions since 26 May in the new Istanbul Airport. The Turkish authorities are not processing his asylum application and he is at imminent risk of deportation to Lebanon, where he is in danger of further removal to Syria.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Director, 
Mohamed Ajlani Younes, a Palestinian refugee from Syria, has been held in the transit zone of Istanbul Airport since 26 May. I believe there are at times up to 50 others also held in this area. He is not allowed to enter Turkish territory to seek protection as a refugee and have his case duly assessed. He has been held for over a month in an area that is designed for short stays, with no access to adequate food, natural light or open air, no privacy and limited medical assistance. 
Mohamed Ajlani Younes’s asylum application in Turkey has not been decided and there is no formal deportation decision against him. Despite this, he continues to be detained and there have been two attempts to deport him to Lebanon, the most recent on 21 June, when he was flown to Lebanon but refused entry into the country by the Lebanese authorities and brought back to Istanbul. He remains at risk of return to Lebanon. 
Deporting Mohamed Ajlani Younes to Lebanon would put him in danger of being sent to Syria, a country that is not safe and where he would be at risk of serious human rights violations. This would be in breach of Turkey’s obligations under international law. Furthermore, as a Palestinian refugee from Syria, if returned to Lebanon he would be exposed to dire living conditions which in themselves may violate his rights. 
In light of the above, I urge you to immediately release Mohamed Ajlani Younes from detention and grant him access to the Turkish territory; immediately grant him effective access to protection procedures as a refugee in Turkey and to protect him and others in the transit zone of Istanbul airport from return decisions that may expose them to serious human rights violations.

Human Rights Updates 
1) U.S./Mexico – In FY19 Border Supplemental, Congress Must Ensure Safe and Humane Processing of Asylum Seekers. Amnesty International USA released a statement on the FY2019 Border Supplemental package ahead of the House vote on June 25. Amnesty’s top priority is the protection of asylum seekers at the southern border, and we are deeply concerned about the potential misuse of funding to further criminalize and harm people seeking safety at the U.S. southern border.  Amnesty’s statement provides detailed spending recommendations affecting DHS, DHHS, DOJ, and DOD. 
 
Above: On June 25 Americas Advocacy Director Charanya Krishnaswami spoke on BBC World News about concerns for the safety and freedom of children seeking protection at the U.S. southern border. 
2) Saudi Arabia – Senate Blocks Trump Administration’s Emergency Arms Sales to Saudi-UAE Led Coalition. On June 20 the Senate approved the bipartisan S.J.Res.38 to block $8 billion emergency arms sales to the Saudi-UAE led coalition ordered by the Trump administration. The Saudi-UAE coalition has committed horrific human rights violations in Yemen, some of which amount to war crimes. The supply of arms manufactured in the U.S. have been used in deadly strikes against civilians. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to pass the broader Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act (S.398) to block all future arms sales to the Saudi-UAE led coalition. 
3) Sudan – Congress Must Hold Sudan Accountable for Brutal Crackdown Against Non-Violent Protesters. International criticism has grown as security forces continue to commit human rights violations, and the Sudanese government has ignored demands for reform. On June 21 the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed H.Res. 432 condemning the violence and held hearings on June 25. The Senate introduced S.Res. 188 calling for the government to respect human rights, ensure accountability for abuses and address the crisis in a non-violent manner. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to pass these resolutions and call for a comprehensive arms embargo, the immediate encampment of the Rapid Support Forces and the end of any policing functions by its members. 
4) Myanmar – Congress Must Pass Legislation to Hold Myanmar Military Accountable for Human Rights Abuses. On June 20 the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the bipartisan Burma Political Prisoners Assistance Act (H.R. 2327) and the BURMA Act (H.R. 3190) during committee markup. H.R. 2327 requires the Secretary of State to work with organizations to free prisoners of conscience in Myanmar. Additionally, H.R. 3190 imposes a series of measures to hold the Myanmar military accountable for their abuses by barring U.S. military assistance to Myanmar, creating more reporting requirements, and supporting investigations of war criminals as well as other sanctions. Amnesty International USA urges the House to quickly pass both bills. 
5) Hong Kong – Police Used Unnecessary and Excessive Force Against Protesters. Peaceful protesters took to the streets on June 12 to voice concerns over the extradition law amendments proposed in Hong Kong. In a June 21 report, Amnesty International has verified footage in which police officers used unlawful force against these protesters, including beating of subdued protesters, firing rubber bullets at a protester’s head, firing tear gas against protesters trapped in a confined area and aggressive tactics against journalists. Amnesty International remains concerned about the proposed amendments as they would allow authorities to target journalists, NGO leaders and human rights defenders. 
6) Sri Lanka – Refugees are Under Attack After Easter Bombings. Following the April 21 attacks that killed over 250 people, mobs took to the streets in Negombo and targeted refugees and asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. A new Amnesty International report details how these refugees have been pushed out of their homes. 
7) World Refugee Day – Amnesty International USA Calls on Congress to Pass Legislation Committing to Resettle 95,000 Refugees Per Year. Amnesty International USA Executive Director Margaret Huang spoke at a press conference to mark World Refugee Day hosted by Refugee Council USA. She called on Congress to pass the NO BAN Act (S. 1123 /H.R. 2214), which would prohibit discrimination based on religion, and to pass the GRACE Act (S. 1088 /H.R. 2146), to prevent the President from setting a refugee admissions at a level below 95,000. She also called on Congress to restore critically needed funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. 
On June 17 Amnesty International USA released a report detailing the effects of the U.S.’s discriminatory and restrictive policies on refugees, starting with the Muslim ban signed in January 2017. Since the Muslim ban went into effect, refugees offered resettlement to the U.S. from Muslim-majority countries have ground to a halt. At the end of May 2019 only 347 Syrian refugees had arrived to the U.S. This contrasts with 11,204 Syrian refugees resettled to the U.S. in 2016 from Jordan and Lebanon. Syrians still make up the largest forcibly displaced population in the world.

Congress must pass the GLOBE Act (reintroduction pending), which would support LGBTI communities through U.S. human rights and development programs, and the International Human Rights Defense Act (H.R.1857), which would establish a Special Envoy for Human Rights of LGBTI Peoples in the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Chief Executive: 
On 10 June 2019, lawmaker Tanya Chan was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years, for using a loudspeaker during the Umbrella Movement in 2014 to urge participants to join the protest. While the court handed down a suspended sentence to allow her to continue her medical treatment for a brain tumor, her conviction on criminal charges of “incitement to commit public nuisance” and “incitement to incite public nuisance”, was solely for exercising her human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 
The conviction of the nine Umbrella Movement leaders in 2019 and the imprisonment of Professor Benny Tai Yiu-ting, Professor Chan Kin-man, Raphael Wong Ho-ming and Shiu Ka-chun sets a worrying precedent that the vague and ambiguous “public nuisance” related charges could be used for blanket prosecution and imprisonment of peaceful protesters. In this case, evidence of “incitement” was very broad and included newspaper articles directed to the public at large; press conference statements and media interviews that happened months before the protests; and videos taken by the police of protest leaders using loudspeakers to urge participants to invite others to join the protests. 
The nine have appealed against the convictions and the four imprisoned have sought review on the sentencing. 
I call on you to ensure that the convictions of the nine Umbrella Movement leaders are overturned without delay, and the four imprisoned leaders, who are prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for peacefully advocating for democracy in Hong Kong, are released immediately and unconditionally.

Your Excellency, 
I am concerned about the continued detention of activist Sadat Illiya Dan Malam, who is the Regional Coordinator of the Patriotic Movement for Responsible Citizenship. 
A judge of the Zinder High Court, on 20 May, dismissed the charges of “participation in an insurrectional movement” and “conspiracy against the security of the state” against Sadat. He instead charged him with a lesser charge of “insult against members political party PNDS Tarayya”’ which carries the punishment of a fine. The judge also ordered his immediate release.

Sadat was arrested in Zinder (780 kms from the capital Niamey) on 18 April 2018. He was charged in relation to protests against the Finance Law that had been organized by civil society organizations in different parts of the country. 
I urge you to ensure that the charges against Sadat Illiya Dan Malam are dropped and that he is immediately and unconditionally released; and the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully respected, protected, promoted and fulfilled in Niger.

Here is his response exactly as provided: 
Bernie believes we must stand up for our values as a country of immigrants and accept refugees, asylum-seekers, and families who come to the United States in search of the American Dream. This is how America was built and it has made our country strong.
 
What we need in the United States is humane comprehensive immigration reform, which ends the barbaric treatment of immigrant families. The United States can not be about tearing babies from the arms of their mothers. 
 
Bernie believes that when we look at our border today, we must remember that most of the people coming into the country are seeking asylum from violence, strife and poverty– in the same way his own father was seeking asylum.

Bernie supports an immigration system grounded in civil and human rights. We must not let corporate America pick and choose who they want to come into our country. He believes we must stand up for our values and accept refugees, asylum-seekers, and families who come to the United States in search of the American Dream. That means not holding asylum seekers in detention while their applications are processed. And that means ending the for-profit detention center and prison industrial complex. No one should profit from the incarceration of another person.  
Bernie believes we must provide aid to Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala and strength diplomatic ties. When he is in the White House, our trade policies will be written with the goal of lifting standards of living both in the United States and abroad, and must protect workers in all countries, not large multinational corporations. We must end the destabilizing foreign policy decisions and trade deals that helped contribute to the crises we see in Latin America today. 
The United States under President Trump has not lived up to our values and ideals. Bernie believes we must strengthen and expand our support for refugees fleeing war and violence and do our part in the international community to provide relief. We must also pursue a foreign policy that does not contribute to the destabilization that often drives migration, and mount an aggressive response to climate change to ensure the root causes of global migration both now and in the future are addressed. 
Bernie has long opposed U.S. involvement in misguided foreign interventions, which leave countries in disastrous conditions and their people in humanitarian crises. We must end the destabilizing foreign policy decisions and trade deals that contributed to many of the international crises we see today. 
We will work diplomatically with the international community and with others in the region who share a vision of shared prosperity, security and dignity for all people, to de-escalate the situation. We will provide humanitarian aid and economic reconstruction for those affected by the disastrous wars, and help facilitate the delivery of aid from international partners. 
America has a responsibility to lead the global transition away from fossil fuels to green energy-efficient systems. Trump’s decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement was an abdication of American leadership and an international disgrace. At this moment, when climate change is already causing devastating harm around the world, we have a moral imperative to do our part to preserve this planet for future generations. 
We will: 
Bernie believes we can and will end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We must get money out of politics and take on the NRA to ensure that elected officials act on the desire of voters from both parties for common sense gun reform. 
We need to enact universal instant background checks and end “straw purchases” and the gun show loophole. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines have no place on our streets and must be banned. He supports legislation to ensure we keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and stalkers and “red flag” laws, such as the one in place in Vermont, which allow for temporary removal of firearms from those deemed by a state court a danger to themselves or others. He has also co-sponsored legislation for grants given to states to improve handgun licensing programs and to ban the 3-D printing of firearms and bump stocks. 
  
Bernie believes that violence and brutality of any kind, particularly at the hands of the police meant to protect and serve our communities, is unacceptable and must not be tolerated. We need a societal transformation to make it clear that black lives matter and racism will not be accepted in a civilized country.  When we’re in the White House, we will: 
Bernie believes that the United States, along with our peers in the international community, must firmly condemn and hold abusive governments accountable, which are persecuting, imprisoning, and in some cases killing their citizens for their religious beliefs or ethnicities. And we must ensure our trade agreements protect the human rights of those in our country as well as civilians abroad.  
Bernie believes it should not be a radical idea to guarantee everyone – regardless of sexuality or gender identity – equal protection under the law and  that we must end discrimination in all forms. As President, he will: 
When we are in the White House, Bernie will fight back against the Republican assault on abortion rights across the country and defend a woman’s right to control her own body around the world. 
Under his Medicare for All program, the Hyde Amendment is fully repealed, and reproductive health coverage is provided to all, free at the point of service. He will also oppose all efforts to undermine or overturn Roe v. Wade, and will appoint federal judges who will uphold women’s fundamental rights. Bernie also believes that we must oppose increasing attacks on women’s rights happening at the state and local level. 
When Bernie is in the White House, he will: 
Bernie believes the United States must condemn governments which suppress free speech and ensure their is accountability for human rights violations.  
Like in the atrocious case of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in which the CIA confirmed was an obvious order of the Saudi crown prince. The United States must thoroughly reevaluate our relationship with the brutal Saudi dictatorship, and start by ending support for the catastrophic war in Yemen. 
Over the years, we have seen that the struggle for democracy is bound up with the struggle against authorianism, kleptocracy, and corruption. That is true here in the United States as well as abroad.  
Bernie has long fought for the protection of human rights and the right of people to mobilize.  
When he is in the White House, rather than openly supporting the overthrow of a foreign government, the United States will:  
Bernie has said for years that the prison at Guantanamo Bay must be shut down as soon as possible. We must ensure that torture is never again part of America’s interrogation practices and that all detainees are treated under the rules of the Geneva Conventions. When Bernie is President, he will move to restore our country’s reputation around the world by closing the prison swiftly and ensuring that all detainees are treated humanely and in accordance with international human rights standards. 
The Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the U.N. Arms Trade Treaty is dangerous and irresponsible. We must strengthen these treaties, not end them.  
When Bernie is in the White House, we will work diplomatically with the international community to promote peace and uphold human rights. 
Bernie is proud to have been one of the leading sponsors of the resolution to end U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in the war in Yemen. When we are in the White House, we will ensure the U.S. is not supporting foreign wars, which have done more to create a humanitarian crisis than to establish peace. 
Bernie believes that in order to create a government and economy that works for the many, we will have to take on powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. That means holding large corporations accountable for human rights violations and for contributing to the long history of systemic racism and exploitation of the poor. We will develop a movement that takes on the greed and ideology of the billionaire class and leads us to economic, social, and environmental justice. We will:

Amid the threats against Palabay, on 30 May the Supreme Court directed the government to give access to information of Palabay and other human rights defenders in hope to protect their right to life, liberty and security. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear General Albayalde, 
I am writing to express my concern over death threats received by prominent human rights defender in the Philippines, Cristina Palabay. Cristina is the secretary general of Karapatan, a coalition of several human rights groups and individuals. 
On 6 May, Karapatan, along with women’s rights group Gabriela and religious group Rural Missionaries of the Philippines, filed a petition to seek legal protection from threats to life, liberty, privacy and security. On 30 May, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of these groups and issued a writ of amparo and habeas data – protection and access to information, respectively, and named a Philippine National Police directorate as one of the respondents. The groups noted in their petition that they have been threatened, harassed, and intimidated after government authorities accused them of being “communist fronts.” On 22 April, Cristina Palabay received a text message from an unidentified person sent to her personal number warning her and several other human rights defenders that they are targeted to be killed this year. The threats were all the more alarming as they came just a few hours after another human rights defender, Bernardino Patigas, was gunned down in broad daylight in Escalante City, Negros Occidental province. The killing of Patigas and the threats against Palabay and other human rights defenders come amid what appears to be an increasingly deadlier campaign against human rights defenders and political activists. 
I urge your office to act swiftly to promote and protect the rights of human rights defenders in the country. Specifically, I call on you to open a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial and effective investigation into the allegations of death threats against Cristina Palabay and other human rights defenders in the country, and bring those responsible to justice in fair trials; put in place effective mechanisms to protect human rights defenders at risk in consultation with them, and ensure they are able to carry out their work without fear of reprisals; and launch a thorough, independent, impartial and effective investigation into the allegations of killings of human rights defenders and bring all those responsible to justice in fair trials.

Human Rights Updates 
1) Asia 
a) China Amnesty International USA Co-Sponsors Capitol Hill Rally to Commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Crackdown. The Tiananmen mothers, a group of organized Chinese citizens who lost family members in the crackdown, were honored with the Truman Reagan Freedom Medal. The rally featured speeches from Speaker Pelosi, Rep. Chris Smith, Rep. Levin, Rep. McGovern and Francisco Bencosme of Amnesty USA. Amnesty calls on Congress to pressure the Chinese government to protect human rights. Congress should swiftly pass the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act ( 178), which is necessary to hold the Chinese government accountable for the arbitrary detention of millions of Uyghurs. 
 
Above: On June 4, Francisco Bencosme of Amnesty USA spoke at a Capitol Hill rally to commemorate the 30th Anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
b) Hong Kong – Extradition Law Amendments Are a Dangerous Threat to Human Rights. Amnesty International holds strong concerns over the extradition law amendments proposed in Hong Kong, an issue that mobilized hundreds of thousands of protesters in early June. Because these proposed amendments expand extradition and mutual legal assistance arrangements to include mainland China, it would become legal for Hong Kong to hand over people to the mainland. If passed, authorities would be able to target journalists, NGO leaders, human rights defenders, and others without adequate human rights protections. Amnesty International calls on Congress to urge the Hong Kong government to withdraw these dangerous amendments. 
c) Myanmar – New Amnesty International Report Documents How the Myanmar Military Is Attacking Multiple Ethnic Minority Groups. The May 2019 report documents how the Myanmar military has carried out extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, torture, and enforced disappearances of civilians since January 2019. These attacks extend beyond the Myanmar military’s forced displacement of 900,000 Rohingya. Amnesty International interviewed ethnic Rakhine, Mro, Rohingya and Khami villagers belonging to Buddhist, Christian and Muslim faiths, and estimate an additional 30,000 civilians have been displaced by the ongoing conflict in Rakhine State in 2019. Myanmar authorities have also imposed arbitrary restrictions on the transport of medical supplies and food. Amnesty USA urges Congress to pass the Burma Human Rights and Freedom Act ( 1186) and BURMA Act (H.R. 5819) to pressure the Myanmar military to stop these atrocities. 
  
2) Americas 
a) Venezuela – Congress Must Pass Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”) for Venezuelans. On May 22 the House Judiciary Committee approved the Venezuela TPS Act (R.549). Venezuela is undergoing a massive human rights crisis, and over four million Venezuelans have fled to neighboring countries. Amnesty calls on Congress to swiftly pass TPS for Venezuelans, which would provide lifesaving protections for an estimated 150,000 Venezuelans in the U.S. 
b) Nicaragua –Nicaraguan Government Is Detaining and Torturing Political Dissidents. Amnesty International USA submitted a statement for the June 10 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on “Crushing Dissent: The Ongoing Crisis in Nicaragua.” Amnesty International has documented the widespread use of lethal force, torture and arbitrary detention as forms of punishment for demonstrations and political dissidence. In 2018 a series of reforms to the social security system triggered widespread social protests. In response, the Nicaraguan government adopted a strategy of violent repression. At least 325 people were killed in the protests, primarily by state security forces and pro-government armed groups. More than 2,000 people were injured and hundreds arbitrarily detained. Congress must adopt a resolution condemning the government’s use of extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and torture as reprisal for political dissidence, and support efforts of independent oversight bodies to ensure redress for these actions. 
c) U.S./Mexico – Expansion of Trump Administration’s Remain in Mexico Policy Prevents Asylum Seekers from Accessing Protection. President Trump backed off his threats of tariffs after Mexico agreed to expand “Remain in Mexico” throughout the southwest border. This is a deeply dangerous program which sends asylum seekers back to harm’s way, in likely violation of domestic and international law. Mexico also agreed to send 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico-Guatemalan border, and engaged in mass detention and deportation of 400 asylum seekers and migrants. One week prior, U.S. immigration officials were dispatched to the Guatemala side of the Mexico-Guatemala border to stem the flow of northward migration, and the administration is reportedly close to finalizing a rule that would bar anyone who passed through Mexico or Canada from seeking asylum. Congress must push back against Trump administration measures that erode access to asylum at the border and circumvent U.S. legal obligations to asylum seekers. 
  
3) Mid-East 
a) Saudi Arabia – Saudi Arabia Seeks Death Sentence Against Child Arrested at Age 13. Saudi Arabia is seeking the death penalty in the case of Murtaja Qureiris for offenses, some dating back to when he was just 10 years old. He was arrested at the age of 13 for protesting the Saudi government and has been detained ever since. This case illustrates how Saudi authorities are going to extreme lengths to crack down on dissent, including by resorting to the death penalty for children. Amnesty International calls on Saudi authorities to drop the death sentence against Qureiris. 
b) Saudi Arabia – Amnesty International Calls on Congress to Pass Resolution Condemning Saudi Arabia’s Detention and Abuse of Women Human Rights Defenders (“WHRDs”). On May 22 the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the resolution “Condemning the Government of Saudi Arabia’s continued detention and alleged abuse of women’s rights activists” (Res.129). Since May 2018 the Saudi government has arbitrarily detained 13 prominent WHRDs, at least 10 who were tortured or sexually abused. Amnesty calls on Congress to swiftly pass H.Res.129 to protect Saudi WHRDs from further attacks. 
c) Syria – Amnesty USA Executive Director Visits Raqqa to Document Civilian Casualties Resulting from U.S.-led Coalition’s Air Strikes. More than 80 percent of Raqqa has been destroyed by S. strikes. Amnesty calls for the U.S.-led Coalition to provide assistance to women, children and other community members, with a focus on funding much-needed infrastructure and services. 
  
4) Africa 
a) Sudan – New Evidence of Government-Sponsored War Crimes in Darfur Shows Withdrawal of Peacekeepers Premature and Reckless. Amnesty International has documented disturbing new evidence that Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur. In the past year these have included the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings, and sexual violence. 
b) Botswana – Decriminalization of Consensual Same Sex Relations Should Inspire Other African Countries. On June 11 the High Court in Botswana ruled to decriminalize consensual same sex relations. However, 29 countries in Africa retain laws criminalizing same sex relations, including Kenya, where a law banning gay sex was upheld by the Kenyan High Court in May 2019. Amnesty International called on all African countries to end the practice of criminalizing people on the basis of whom they love.

In April 2019, the Prosecutor pressed new speech-related charges against Ahmad following a TV news report in which his sister and legal consultant were interviewed about Ahmad’s torture and unfair trial.  
TAKE ACTION:  
Your Highness, 
On 11 April 2019, Lebanese prisoner Ahmad Ali Mekkaoui was transferred to incommunicado detention and is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. On the same day, Ahmad Ali Mekkaoui informed his sister over phone that the prosecution filed a new case against him, his sister and his legal consultant in Lebanon, on charges of publishing false information seeking to damage the reputation of the UAE. Ahmad said those were in relation to a TV news report in which his sister and his legal consultant described Ahmad’s torture and prison conditions in the UAE. 
On 31 October 2016, the State Security Chamber at the Federal Supreme Court had sentenced Ahmad Ali Mekkaoui to 15 years in prison on charges including communicating with Lebanese political party and armed group Hezbollah, disclosing classified information and establishing an unauthorized foreign international group in the UAE. Ahmad informed the Public prosecutor that he was subjected to long incommunicado pre-trial detention, torture and ill-treatment including beatings on his face, ripping out his toenails, scalping, and raping him with a steel rod. However, the torture allegations were never investigated, and the court relied on the false “confessions” obtained under torture to convict him. 
I urge you to quash the unreliable conviction and release Ahmad Ali Mekkaoui, unless there is evidence of a recognizable criminal offense in line with international law and standards. In the interim, I call on you to ensure that he is granted immediate and regular access to his lawyer, family, consular assistance, and any medical care he may require. I further call on you to launch an independent and impartial investigation into the claims of torture, as provided by the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and also in line with the Istanbul Protocol on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

They are three of at least 22 individuals who have faced criminal and civil proceedings initiated by this company. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Prime Minister, 
I write to urge your government to oppose the legal actions taken by Thammakaset Co. Ltd against their former employees, human rights activists and journalists in relation to their reporting and comments on labour conditions at the company’s chicken farm, and act to ensure that they do not proceed. In 2016, 14 employees at Thammakaset Co. Ltd reported abusive work conditions to Thai authorities. In response, their former employer has subjected former employees, activists and journalists to apparently retributive criminal and civil proceedings, including criminal defamation and computer crimes. The labor rights abuses raised by these employees – paid less than the minimum wage; failure to pay overtime; failure to provide adequate rest time and holidays and confiscation of identity documents – have previously been confirmed through several orders by Thai courts. 
While the Bangkok Court dismissed the lawsuit filed against the 14 migrant workers, Thammakaset Co. Ltd continues to file new complaints of criminal defamation. Most recently in October 2018 Sutharee Wannasiri and Nan Win, a human rights specialist and former farm worker respectively, were charged under Articles 326 and 328 of the Thai Penal Code. They are scheduled to stand trial on 24 May 2019. 
Amnesty International is concerned that these criminal proceedings threaten the protection of labor rights in Thailand, with a chilling effect on individuals – including those from vulnerable groups such as migrant workers – reporting on labor and other human rights violations for fear of prosecution and imprisonment. Under Thai law, migrant workers – who make up more than 10% of the Thai work force – may not form their own trade unions, and in practice the support of other rights defenders and advocacy groups has played a role in helping report and prevent abusive working conditions. I request that your government act to support human rights defenders’ work to highlight and prevent violations in the workplace, and protect human rights defenders from reprisal, including prosecution for peacefully exercising their rights to publicize violations, including by decriminalizing defamation. 
Yours sincerely,

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Chairman, 
I am writing to express my concern over the charges of criminal defamation by publication recently filed against prominent activists Parit ‘Penguin’ Chiwarak, Sirawith ‘Ja New’ Seritiwat and Phayaw Akkahad for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. The Election Commission accused the three of violating Article 328 of the Thai Criminal Code. They could face up to two years in prison. 
An election commissioner has accused the activists of making defamatory speeches during a public campaign to impeach the commissioners around Victory Monument in Bangkok on 31 March 2019. In their statements, the three had requested that the Commission discloses the full results, from all polling stations, following reports of irregularities during the country’s general elections on 24 March. Summoned to the Phayathai police station on 30 April, the three activists denied all charges. They have been summoned to attend the police station again on 4 June to hear the development of their case. This case is the fourth prosecution initiated by the Commission since the elections. Amnesty International believes that raising criminal complaints against these individuals is a bid to silence public criticism amid public calls for transparency about the election results. 
I urge your office to act swiftly to uphold and protect the right to freedom of expression. Specifically, I urge you to immediately and unconditionally drop all charges against Parit, Sirawith and Phayaw, which appear to be motivated by political interests; end the harassment of critics of the Election Commission and take measures to guarantee their right to freedom of expression.

Dear Secretary Guevarra: 
I am writing to express my dismay at the continuing persecution of Maria Ressa, executive editor of news outlet Rappler, over allegations of cyber libel as well as violations of the Philippine’s Anti-Dummy Law. She was arrested twice in February and March, on what appear to be politically-motivated charges. Tax-related charges were also brought against Maria Ressa and her company, Rappler Holdings Corp., in December 2018. All these charges remain pending in court. 
Rappler has consistently drawn attention to the deadly reality of the ‘war on drugs,’ and the thousands of unlawful killings of poor and marginalized people perpetrated in its name. Its persistence in documenting these abuses has attracted the wrath of the Philippine authorities. Maria Ressa currently faces eight active court cases initiated since January 2018, after the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission tried to shut Rappler down. Rappler, its directors, and staff are facing 11 active court cases in total. 
I urge your office to act swiftly to uphold and protect the freedom of the press.

Amnesty International’s dedicated Nakba website 70+ Years of Suffocation showcases powerful images and testimonies that tell the heartbreaking stories of Palestinian refugees living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), Jordan and Lebanon. To mark Nakba Day, Amnesty International is asking people from around the world to show solidarity with Palestinian refugees and demand that Israel respect their right to return. 
“More than 70 years after the conflict that followed Israel’s creation, the Palestinian refugees who were forced out of their homes and dispossessed of their land as a result continue to face the devastating consequences,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“This weekend almost 200 million people will tune in to watch the Eurovision song contest in Israel, but, behind the glitz and glamour, few will be thinking of Israel’s role in fuelling seven decades of misery for Palestinian refugees. 
“There can be no lasting solution to the Palestinian refugee crisis until Israel respects Palestinian refugees’ right to return. In the meantime, Lebanese and Jordanian authorities must do everything in their power to minimize the suffering of Palestinian refugees by repealing discriminatory laws and removing obstacles blocking refugees’ access to employment and essential services.” 
There are currently more than 5.2 million registered Palestinian refugees. The vast majority live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). Israel has failed to recognize their right under international law to return to homes where they or their families once lived in Israel or the OPT. At the same, they have never received compensation for the loss of their land and property. 
Many have been forced to live their entire lives in overcrowded camps in dire conditions and are denied access to essential services. 
“Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and the Occupied Palestinian Territories are trapped in a cycle of deprivation and systematic discrimination with no end in sight. For many of them life is full of suffocating restrictions and has become a living hell,” said Philip Luther. 
Challenges for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan 
To mark Nakba Day, Amnesty International has gathered new testimony from Palestinian refugees describing the restrictions they face in Lebanon and Jordan. 
Although the majority of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon were born in the country and have lived there all their lives, they cannot acquire Lebanese nationality, and many remain stateless and deprived of access to public services including medical care and education. 
Several Palestinian refugees in Lebanon told Amnesty International how their hopes of pursuing professional careers and building a better future have been shattered as a result of discriminatory laws that bar Palestinians from practising over 30 professions including medicine, dentistry, law, architecture and engineering. Such restrictions have trapped many Palestinian refugees in deprivation and poverty. 
Mohammad, a 21-year-old Palestinian refugee, described how his hopes of becoming a dentist were crushed when he discovered he cannot work as a professional dentist in Lebanon simply because he is Palestinian. He told Amnesty International he hated life in the camp: “I am surrounded by poverty… I want to create a better life for myself, away from all of this misery.” 
Sara Abu Shaker, 14, has chosen to pursue her dream of studying medicine even though as a Palestinian she can never practise as a doctor in Lebanon. 
“Even if I can’t be a doctor here, I could go to Palestine and help those in need, particularly the underprivileged children. I want to save lives…” she said. 
Around 2.1 million Palestinian refugees live in Jordan, some 370,000 of them in camps where conditions are generally sub-standard. Around three quarters of Palestinian refugees in Jordan have been granted Jordanian citizenship, giving them access to health care and education. However, over 600,000, including some 150,000 who fled to Jordan from the Gaza Strip following the 1967 Israeli-Arab conflict, were not naturalized and do not have sufficient access to public services. 
Jundia Awwad, 48, whose family is from what is now southern Israel, was born in Jordan and has lived her entire life in Jerash refugee camp. She described the anguish of living as a refugee in Jordan. 
“I grew up in the hope that tomorrow we will return to Palestine but instead we stayed in houses made of asbestos sheets…. I want to live like other human beings. I want health care, proper education and infrastructure. I want equality,” she said. 
A decision by the US authorities in 2018 to cut funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), which provides essential services, including health care, education, emergency assistance and jobs, to millions of Palestinian refugees has put further strain on their lives. 
“The situation for Palestinian refugees is untenable and grows closer to breaking point with every year that passes. How much longer can Palestinian refugees be expected to be condemned to a life of suffering, deprivation and discrimination simply because of their origin?” said Philip Luther.  
To produce its dedicated Nakba website Amnesty International teamed up with Tanya Habjouqa, an award-winning photographer,  to document the personal stories of a select number of Palestinian refugees in different camps in Jordan, Lebanon and the OPT.  ",,"May 14, 2019 • Press Release",False

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Prosecutor General, 
I would like to express my concern regarding the ongoing criminal proceedings against Jehovah’s Witnesses Artur Severinchik, Sergei Loginov and Yevgeniy Fedin. They are being persecuted solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of religion. While we welcome the release from pre-trial detention of Artur Severinchik on 15 March and Sergei Loginov and Yevgeniy Fedin on 11 April, all three are still under investigation under unfounded charges and subjected to a number of restrictions, including curfew and a prohibition to use phones or the internet. 
Moreover, I am concerned that no effective investigation has been conducted into allegations of torture of several Jehovah’s Witnesses following the raids of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ homes in Surgut on 15 February 2019. At least seven of around 40 people who were arrested during the raids complained of torture and other ill-treatment to which they were subjected by law enforcement officers while in their custody. 
I therefore urge you to terminate the criminal proceedings against Artur Severinchik, Sergei Loginov and Yevgeniy Fedin, and any Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia, under unfounded “counter-extremism” charges; and instigate prompt, effective and impartial investigations of the allegations of torture and other ill-treatment of Sergei Loginov, Artur Severinchik, Yevgeniy Fedin, and other Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the prosecution in fair trial proceedings of anyone found responsible for these crimes. 
Yours sincerely,

Human Rights Updates 
1) May 6 Amnesty International USA Capitol Hill Lobby Day. 140 Amnesty International USA activists will come to Capitol Hill to press Congress to require universal background checks on all gun sales (S. 42), and to end U.S. arms sales to the Saudi-Emirati coalition committing civilian casualties in Yemen (S. 398). For more information on Lobby Day, please contact Meredith Cullen at [email protected]. 
 
2) Sri Lanka – Following Easter Sunday Massacre, Sri Lanka Imposes Ban on Face Veils. On April 29 Sri Lanka’s President instituted emergency regulations imposing a ban on clothing that conceals the face. The new ban will force many Muslim women to stay out of public places, preventing them from going to school, work or accessing basic services. The ban violates their rights to non-discrimination and freedom of expression and religion. On May 1 Amnesty’s Francisco Bencosme spoke at the Congressional Caucus on Ethnic and Religious Freedom on the need for transparency and accountability for human rights in Sri Lanka. 
3) President Trump’s Decision to “Unsign” the Arms Trade Treaty (“ATT”) Will Increase Illegal Sales of Conventional Weapons. On April 26 the President announced that the U.S. will walk away from the 2014 ATT, which was signed by President Obama but never ratified by the Senate. The ATT was the first global instrument to set international standards for the transfer of conventional arms and ammunition with the express purpose of reducing human suffering. Trump’s decision to abandon the ATT will increase the illegal sales of conventional weapons, thereby undermining international peace and security. 
4) Afghanistan – Amnesty International Condemns International Criminal Court (“ICC”)’s Refusal to Authorize Investigation into Crimes Committed in Afghanistan. In April, the U.S. revoked the ICC chief prosecutor’s visa because of an investigation involving crimes committed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Days later, the ICC caved to U.S. threats by announcing it would not investigate these crimes. The ICC’s decision is a devastating setback for Afghani civilians. The court has a moral and legal responsibility to investigate all crimes, regardless of who committed them. 
5) Syria – U.S.-Led Coalition Killed More Than 1,600 Civilians in Raqqa. In April, Amnesty International reported that between June and October 2017, the U.S.-led coalition killed more than 1,600 civilians in Raqqa. The coalition launched thousands of air and artillery strikes in support of the Syrian Democratic Forces, a local Kurdish-led militia fighting the IS in Raqqa. The coalition claimed to have taken all necessary measures to spare civilians, but Amnesty International’s extensive investigations revealed otherwise. Congress must press the Pentagon for transparency and accountability on these strikes. 
  
6) U.S.-Mexico 
a) Amnesty International USA Testifies on Immigration Detention Before U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (“USCCR”). On April 12, Amnesty’s Americas Advocacy Director testified on the increasing use of detention to punish asylum-seekers including the blanket denials of parole. Since the 2015 publication of the USCCR report on immigration detention, the detention population has skyrocketed, with over 50,000 people detained daily. 
b) Amnesty International Visits Florida Detention Facility Housing Thousands of Unaccompanied Youth from Central America. In April, Amnesty International visited the detention facility housing unaccompanied children at Homestead, Florida. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that Homestead will house up to 3,200 children. 
c) Amnesty International Documents Trump Administration’s Attacks on Asylum Seekers.In April, Amnesty International conducted a three-week border mission, documenting the so-called “Migrant Protection Protocols,” informally known as “Remain in Mexico.” Amnesty International attended multiple days of immigration court hearings in San Diego and El Paso, and observed serious problems including lack of access to counsel and lack of adequate notice of hearing times. 
  
7) Amnesty International Death Penalty Report Shows Increase in U.S. Executions. In April, Amnesty International published the annual Global Report on Death Sentences and Executions report. China remains the world’s top executioner, followed by Iran, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and Iraq. The U.S., Belarus, Japan, Singapore, and South Sudan all registered an increase in executions from 2017. In the U.S., people with mental or intellectual disabilities were executed or sentenced to death, which violates international law. Nebraska, South Dakota and Tennessee resumed executions after decades-long hiatuses. 
  
8) Women Human Rights Defenders (“WHRDs”) 
  
a) Saudi Arabia – Amnesty International Urges Congress to Pass Resolutions in Support of Saudi Women Human Rights Defenders. Since May 2018, thirteen WHRDs have been arbitrarily detained in Saudi Arabia. At least 10 of them were tortured, sexually abused, and subjected to other forms of ill-treatment. Due to international pressure in March 2019, three of these activists were released pending trial. Saudi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all these WHRDs and drop all charges against them. 
b) Philippines – Amnesty International Urges Congress to Pass Resolutions that Call for the Immediate Release of Philippine Prisoner of Conscience Senator Leila de Lima. Senator de Lima has been in prison since February 2017, because of her vocal criticism of President Duterte’s deadly “war on drugs,” which has resulted in the extrajudicial executions of thousands. Philippine authorities must immediately and unconditionally release her and drop all charges against her. 
c) Iran – Iranian Authorities Must Release Prominent Human Rights Lawyer Who Faces Outrageous Prison Sentence.Amnesty International condemns the imprisonmentof Nasrin Sotoudeh, a prominent human rights lawyer who has long spoke out against the death penalty and fought for women’s rights. She was sentenced to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes, the harshest sentence documented against a human rights defender in Iran in recent years. Congress should work with their European counterparts to pressure Iranian authorities to release her. 
d) Egypt – Hanan Badr el-Din Finally Released After Almost Two Years in Pre-Trial Detention. El-Din, Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience, was released on April 25 after being detained at Qanatar prison. El-Din co-founded the Association of the Families of the Disappeared after her husband’s disappearance in 2013. Amnesty International USA thanks Senator Menendez and Members of Congress who advocated on behalf of her. 
  
9) Cameroon – Amnesty International Wins Peabody Award for Investigation into Abuses by Cameroonian Security Forces. BBC Africa Eye collaborated with Amnesty International and Bellingcat network on “Anatomy of a Killing,” which sourced a viral video of two women and two young children who were murdered by men in military fatigues in July 2018. Despite the Cameroonian government’s claims that the video was “fake news,” the BBC investigation revealed the men to be Cameroonian army soldiers, who were eventually arrested and held accountable for the murders.

TAKE ACTION:  
Your Excellency, 
I am writing to you on the case of communities living in Apaa, northern Uganda. 
Between 3 January and 27 March, the communities living in the Acholi Ber, Oyobi, Oloyo Kampala villages in Apaa area were subjected to forced evictions by rangers from the Uganda Wildlife Authority. The rangers burnt homes, looted property and beat up villagers despite the presence of Uganda Peoples’ Defence Forces (UPDF) soldiers who were deployed to the area on 2 February to protect the communities. 
Hundreds of people have been rendered homeless and are exposed to a range of human rights violations. Villagers still living in the Apaa area risk being forcibly evicted. 
Forced evictions are in violation of the Ugandan constitution and international human rights law. 
Journalists trying to cover the ongoing evictions and violence in Apaa have been denied access to the area. 
I call on you to ensure that forced evictions in the Apaa area stop immediately; ensure that the Apaa residents who have already been forcibly evicted are provided with access to effective remedies including adequate compensation and alternative housing; ensure that impartial, thorough and transparent investigations are carried out into the actions of the Uganda Wildlife Authority against the communities in the Apaa area as well as the role of the UPDF soldiers deployed in the area for the protection of the villagers and hold those found responsible to account without recourse to the death penalty.

0,Urgent Action Update: Tiananmen “Baijiu” Activist Sentenced to Jail (China: UA 138.16),AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/urgent-actions/urgent-action-update-tiananmen-baijiu-activist-sentenced-to-jail-china-ua-138-16/,Sichuan activist Chen Bing was sentenced to three and a half years after he and three other activists were convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for producing and promoting their own baijiu – Chinese liquor – to commemorate the Tiananmen crackdown.,"Sichuan activist Chen Bing was sentenced to three and a half years after he and three other activists were convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for producing and promoting their own baijiu – Chinese liquor – to commemorate the Tiananmen crackdown. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President Xi, 
Sichuan activist Chen Bing was sentenced to three and a half years on 4 April 2019 after he and three other activists – Fu Hailu, Zhang Junyong and Luo Fuyu – were convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for producing and promoting their own baijiu (a popular Chinese liquor) that commemorated the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown. Fu Hailu, Zhang Junyong and Luo Fuyu were each given suspended sentences on 1-3 April. All of them have been detained for nearly three years. 
According to the indictment, the activists used the labels and the “commemoration wine” (jinian-jiu) to “promote the June 4th incident on the internet”. Chen Bing, Zhang Junyong and Luo Fuyu spent 9000 yuan (US$1300) to buy the wine, bottles and bottle caps in a supermarket in Sichuan and used the labels which translate into “Remember, Eight Liquor June 4” (mingji bajiu liusi) echoing the date of 4 June 1989 and “27-year-old private reserve, not-for-sale”. Between 28 May and 21 June 2016, public security officers detained the four activists and found 900 sets of empty bottles and bottle caps. 
Chen Bing’s friends believe that Chen Bing is the only one among the four activists who was not given a suspended sentence because he did not admit to the offence. However, although Fu Hailu, Zhang Junyong and Lu Fuyu were each sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended for five years and four years respectively, they will be effectively silenced during the suspended sentence period, according to the previous experiences of detained activists. 
Therefore, I call on you to immediately and unconditionally release Chen Bing as he only exercised his right to freedom of expression, which is protected both by international conventions that the Chinese government signed and the PRC Constitution; ensure that Chen Bing is not subjected to any torture or other ill-treatment and has regular and unrestricted access to and is able to communicate with a lawyer of his choice and his family members, without interference unless justified in line with international human rights law.

0,Egypt: Crackdown against peaceful critics set to worsen if constitutional amendments are passed,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/egypt-crackdown-against-peaceful-critics-set-to-worsen-if-constitutional-amendments-are-passed/,"Egypt’s authorities must end their crackdown against critics who oppose amendments to the Egyptian constitution, proposed by members of parliament, that will strengthen impunity for human rights violations. Many of those who have criticized the changes have been arrested or publicly vilified in the media.","Egypt’s authorities must end their crackdown against critics who oppose amendments to the Egyptian constitution, proposed by members of parliament, that will strengthen impunity for human rights violations. Many of those who have criticized the changes have been arrested or publicly vilified in the media. President al-Sisi is due to meet with President Donald Trump during a visit to Washington DC on 9 April. 
The organization is today publishing an analysis of the constitutional amendments which are currently being discussed by the Egyptian parliament. If passed, these measures will undermine the independence of the judiciary, expand military trials for civilians and could allow President Abdel Fattah to stay in power until 2034. 
“If passed, these constitutional amendments would worsen the devastating human rights crisis Egyptians are already facing. They would grant President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and security forces free rein to further abuse their powers and suppress peaceful dissent for years to come,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. 
“The Egyptian parliament has a responsibility towards Egyptians to preserve what remains of the country’s judicial independence and adherence to international law and reject the proposed amendments.” 
A parliamentary vote on the amendments is due in the coming weeks and if passed – the new draft constitution will be put to a public referendum. 
“Since President al-Sisi came to power human rights in Egypt have catastrophically deteriorated. Egypt’s international allies must not stand by silently as the Egyptian authorities push through these amendments while bullying anyone who dares to criticize the changes into silence. In particular, the US authorities should use President al-Sisi’s visit to Washington DC this week to publicly condemn the proposed changes.” 
In its analysis Amnesty International expresses concern that the amendments would strengthen the influence of the Egyptian military over government, remove the requirement for judicial review of draft legislation, as well as expanding notoriously unfair military trials for civilians and granting the President sweeping powers to manage judicial affairs and appoint senior judges. 
Other amendments that have drawn criticism from opponents are the plans to extend the presidential term to six years and introduce a provision allowing President al-Sisi to run for two further presidential terms.  
Crackdown targeting critics 
The amendments have attracted considerable criticism including from a number of public figures, human rights organizations, political parties and the State Council Judges Club. The authorities have responded by intensifying their crackdown on freedom of expression, targeting people who have voiced opposition to the amendments with arbitrary arrest and detention, defamation and even cyber-attacks. 
More than 57 people have been arrested so far in 2019, with Egyptian NGOs citing higher figures, for peacefully expressing their opinions or merely being perceived to do so – at least four of them for expressing their opposition to the constitutional amendments on social media. 
The arrests have followed a pattern repeatedly documented by Amnesty International whereby the victims are arrested without warrants in the early hours of the morning, before being forcibly disappeared for several days. They later reappear before a state security prosecutor who orders their detention pending investigation on charges of “membership in terrorist groups” and “disseminating false information”. 
Several public figures – including some members of parliament –  who have expressed their opposition to the amendments have been widely criticized in public and private media and been subjected to smear campaigns. Some opponents have faced homophobic slurs, as well as calls, including fromfellow members of parliament, for their prosecution for “treason” and for their Egyptian nationality to be revoked. 
Amnesty International has also documented a wave of phishing attacks, that likely originated from government backed bodies, targeting independent media organizations and human rights defenders who reported  on the authorities, including the role of the General Intelligence Service, in pushing for the constitutional amendments. 
Last week, on 28 March, a court prevented activists from the Civil Democratic Movement, an opposition movement, from holding a protest against the constitutional amendments in front of parliament. Egypt’s Minister of Interior filed a request asking the court not to grant permission for the protest on the basis that it could “threaten public peace and security”. The court decision cited concerns that “anti-state elements may infiltrate the protest and assault the protestors, in order to frame security forces as assaulting protestors”. 
“The intimidation and harassment of people who peacefully express their opinions, including those critical of the constitutional amendments, has to end now,” said Magdalena Mughrabi. 
“Instead of stepping up this vicious crackdown against peaceful critics, Egypt’s authorities should scrap these amendments and ensure that any proposed future changes do not violate the country’s human rights obligations under international law.”",,"April 8, 2019 • Press Release",False

Dear Minister Romero, 
On 17 March, police and immigration officers arbitrarily detained 14 Venezuelan refugees at a shelter in La Paz, accusing them of “conspiracy actions and participating in political activities that affect public order in exchange for money”, without due process and judicial guarantees. Then six of them were arbitrarily expelled from Bolivia to Peru. 
According to local organizations and witnesses, many of them were ill-treated and threatened by police and, five of them fled to Peru, fearing further persecution. Both those who were deported and those who fled are currently exposed to abuse and crime at the Peru-Bolivia border. Those released who remain in the country fear further persecution and arbitrary deportation to places where their lives or freedoms could be at risk. 
All people–including irregular migrants, regular migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees–have the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, due process and judicial guarantees, and to not be subjected to ill-treatment, collective expulsion or refoulement. Any state is forbidden from transferring anyone to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations.

I write to express my grave concern regarding the situation of Huỳnh Trương Ca who, despite suffering from several illnesses including diabetes, lung disease and high blood pressure, was moved without warning to Xuân Lộc prison on 7 March.  
The new detention centre is situated 250km away from his home town, making it very difficult for his family to visit him and bring him necessary supplies.  
Huỳnh Trương Ca was arrested on 4 September 2018 while on his way to participate in a peaceful protest in Ho Chi Minh city. Convicted and sentenced to five years and six months in prison solely for peacefully exercising his fundamental rights, he is a prisoner of conscience and should be immediately released.

Human Rights Updates: 
U.S./Mexico 
1) Trump Administration Undermines State Department’s Human Rights Report. In response to the U.S. State Department human rights report released March 13, Amnesty International stated that the report documents alarming shifts around the world that endanger human rights defenders. The gap between the State Department’s official assessment of human rights globally and the Trump administration’s refusal to prioritize the issue in its foreign policy is outrageous. The State Department has also excluded sexual and reproductive rights from its assessments, wrongfully suggesting that these are not human rights and undercutting the serious violations of these rights. 
2) Amnesty International USA Calls on Senate to Pass Resolution Terminating President’s National Emergency. Amnesty International USA supports H.J.Res 46 to terminate the President’s national emergency and urges the Senate to quickly pass the joint resolution. By declaring a national emergency, the President has manufactured a crisis for the purpose of militarizing the southern border region and blocking asylum seekers from safety in the U.S. The emergency declaration enables the President to raid military construction accounts to fund his border wall. This action constitutes an end-run around the Congressional appropriations process and will have a devastating impact on children, asylum seekers, and border residents, including Indigenous communities.

3) DHS Must End the Separation and Detention of Children and Families and Ensure Access to Humanitarian Protection for Asylum Seekers at the U.S.-Mexico Border. In February, Amnesty International USA submitted statements for House Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce hearings on the Trump administration’s family separation policies. The Trump administration’s deliberate and punitive practice of forced family separations in some cases constituted torture and have been leveraged to compel families to abandon their asylum claims. 
Amnesty International USA submitted a statement for the March 6 House Homeland Security Committee oversight hearing on the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”). Amnesty International has concluded that DHS has 1) turned back asylum seekers at ports of entry; 2) separated children from their parents; and 3) detained record numbers of asylum seekers, including children, some who are sexual abused and even die in DHS custody. 
4) Amnesty International USA Calls on Senate to Pass Legislation Requiring Universal Background Checks for All Firearm Purchases to Stem Gun Violence. In February, the House passed the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 (H.R. 8). Amnesty International USA urges the Senate to quickly pass the Background Check Expansion Act (S. 42) which would require universal background checks for firearm sales. Amnesty International USA opposed the measure added last minute to the House bill, which unfairly singles out and punishes immigrants. All gun control legislation must protect the safety of all communities.

5) Venezuela – Amnesty International Calls on Venezuelan Authorities to End Human Rights Violations. In February, Amnesty International submitted statements for House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on the human rights violations in Venezuela. In January 2019, Venezuelan security forces, under the command of Nicolas Maduro, committed six extrajudicial executions, arbitrarily detained 137 people, and used excessive force on protesters, in which 41 people died from gunshot wounds. The Venezuelan government has failed to adequately respond to the socioeconomic crisis, including lack of access to basic health and food and an inflation rate of one million percent. Congress must denounce the human rights abuses and strengthen support for civil society and human rights defenders in Venezuela. 
  
Asia 
6) North Korea – President Trump Disregarded Human Rights Atrocities During February 27-28 Summit with Kim Jong-Un. President Trump was deafeningly silent on Kim Jong-Un’s perpetration of human rights abuses at the summit in Vietnam. North Koreans have endured enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention, forced labor in prison camps, severe restrictions on freedom of expression and movement, and decades of family separation. President Trump needs to appoint a North Korean Human Rights Envoy, a post that has been vacant for two years. 
7) China – Congress Must Pass Legislation to Halt Human Rights Violations of Turkic Muslims. Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to support the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2019 to pressure Chinese authorities to end the detention of Turkic Muslims. Up to one million Uighurs and other ethnic Muslims are being arbitrarily detained in “political education” camps across Xinjiang province. Chinese authorities have detained people for their perceived disloyalty to the government and Chinese Communist Party. Amnesty International has called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution establishing an international fact-finding mission to investigate these atrocities. 
  
Middle East 
8) U.S. Must Stop Weapons Sales to the Saudi Arabia-UAE Led Coalition. In a statement for the March 6 House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, Amnesty International USA documented how the human rights situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate amidst the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis. The U.S. directly assists the Saudi Arabia-UAE led coalition’s campaign that has led to one of the most severe contemporary humanitarian crises of our time. Congress must pass the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019 to suspend weapon sales to Saudi Arabia, pass the Yemen Refueling Prohibition Act to prohibit U.S. refueling of Saudi Coalition Aircraft engaged in the war in Yemen, and hold accountable all actors responsible for war crimes and civilian casualties. 
  
Africa 
9) Cameroon – Amnesty International Applauds U.S. Military Aid Cuts to Security Forces Engaged in Human Rights Abuses. Amnesty International applauds the U.S.’s decision to cut some military aid to Cameroon over growing allegations of human rights abuses by Boko Haram and government security forces. Africa Advocacy Director Adotei Akwei appeared on several news programs urging the U.S. to suspend all security assistance until the Cameroonian government demonstrates it has not committed serious violations of international law. Concerns over human rights violations surfaced after videos showed Cameroon’s security forces firing automatic weapons at unarmed civilians.

Refugees 
10) Amnesty International USA Testifies at House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Hearing on Global Refugee Crisis. At a February 26 House Foreign Affairs hearing, Ryan Mace, Amnesty International USA’s refugee specialist, testified on the global refugee crisis. Amnesty International USA urges Congress to sustain robust humanitarian aid for refugees and displaced persons worldwide, and restore its commitment to resettling refugees.

11) Amnesty International USA Urges DHS to Extend Temporary Protected Status for 10 Designee Countries. In a statement for the March 6 House Judiciary Committee hearing, Amnesty International USA addressed the human rights situation in 10 countries that are currently designated for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”). The Trump administration’s decisions to end TPS for several countries imperil many longtime U.S. residents who are at risk of deportation to countries where they may face violence, persecution, torture, even death. These 10 countries include South Sudan, Nepal, Syria, Honduras, Yemen, Somalia, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan. Amnesty International USA urges DHS to extend TPS for all 10 countries and to designate Venezuela for TPS. 
  
Amnesty International’s Human Rights Priorities 
12) Amnesty International USA Issues 2019 Human Rights Priorities in Asia. In a report published by the National Bureau of Research, Asia Advocacy Manager Francisco Bencosme outlined Amnesty International USA’s top human rights priorities. Amnesty International USA urges Congress to establish a fund protecting Indo-Pacific human rights defenders and journalists, and engage with regional leaders on the human rights crisis in China, North Korean, Myanmar and India. 
13) Amnesty International Documents Increasing Use of Violence to Repress Dissent in Middle East. A February Amnesty International report examines how crackdown of civil society actors and political opponents increased significantly in 2018 throughout the Middle East. Authorities used arbitrary detention, excessive force against protesters, and administrative measures to restrict human rights defenders. The killing of Palestinian protesters by Israeli forces in Gaza and the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate glaringly illustrate the impunity of Middle Eastern states that routinely use lethal violence to repress dissent. 
14) Amnesty International USA Hosts Capitol Hill Briefing on Human Rights Priorities for Congress. On February 12 Amnesty International USA held a Capitol Hill briefing. Executive Director Margaret Huang talked about her recent trip to the southern border to document the effects of the Remain in Mexico deal, which violates international law and endangers thousands of families and children seeking protection. Middle East and North Africa Advocacy Director Philippe Nassif urged Congress to support the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019 to suspend weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Minister, 
I am deeply concerned about the 4 March decision of the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 30 accepting the indictment against Osman Kavala, Yiğit Aksakoğlu and 14 other prominent civil society figures, accusing them of ‘attempting to overthrow the government or prevent it from performing its duties’ during the Gezi Park protests of 2013. 
These protests were peaceful in character and there is no credible evidence linking any of the individuals named in this indictment with acts of violence or public disorder. The indictment is filled with unsubstantiated accusations that attempt to rewrite the history of the Gezi Park protests and silence some of Turkey’s most prominent civil society figures. If found guilty on these baseless charges, those accused could face life imprisonment without parole.  
Osman Kavala has already been remanded in pre-trial detention for over 16 months and Yiğit Aksakoğlu for almost four months based on these spurious claims, an imprisonment that represents an arbitrary deprivation of their liberty. Acceptance of the indictment, given that it should mean the prosecution and the court both believe all relevant evidence has been collected to start the prosecution, further exposes the arbitrariness of Osman Kavala and Yiğit Aksakoğlu’s continued incarceration.  
I therefore urge you to do all in your power to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Osman Kavala and Yiğit Aksakoğlu and that the charges against all 16 individuals are dropped. 
Yours sincerely,

Rep. Brett Guthrie
Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee 
Re: Oversight Hearing on Family Separation Policy 
Dear Chairwoman DeGette, Ranking Member Guthrie, and Members of the Committee: 
On behalf of Amnesty International1 and our more than two million members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. AI is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the U.S. and Mexico. One of Amnesty International’s top global priorities for the past several years has been the protection of the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers. 
Amnesty International welcomes the ongoing oversight efforts by Congress, including efforts to publicly investigate and establish an exhaustive record of family separations by U.S. authorities in 2017 and 2018. We hope these efforts are followed immediately by concrete measures to pass legislation prohibiting the separation and indefinite detention of children and families. 
I. In October 2018, Amnesty International found that DHS separated thousands more families than previously disclosed.
Based on over a year of in-depth research on the US–Mexico border, Amnesty International published a report in October 2018 titled “You Don’t Have Any Rights Here”: Illegal Pushbacks, Arbitrary Detention, and Ill-Treatment of Asylum-Seekers in the United States. This was the first publication to report on how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apparently undercounted by thousands the true number of family separations before, during and after its so-called “zero-tolerance” policy in 2017 and 2018. 
Alongside its October 2018 report, Amnesty International released a Facts & Figures overview of new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics it obtained, which appeared to demonstrate a mass undercounting of family separations. Also in October 2018, Amnesty International responded in an open letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen to false claims by a DHS spokesperson that all family separations had been reported in the government’s submissions in the Ms. L. class action lawsuit in 2018. 
In January 2019, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a report confirming Amnesty International’s earlier findings: HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) apparently took custody of thousands more separated children than previously disclosed, who were never included in the Ms. L. class action lawsuit because they did not meet the definition of the class. 
Amnesty International’s report demonstrated that DHS did not include in its official statistics thousands of additional families separated for reasons of so-called “fraud,” safety, security, or medical considerations. Moreover, DHS appeared to apply arbitrarily and en masse those vague grounds for family separations, including to separate immediate family members who had full documentation of their family relationships and who had requested asylum at official Ports of Entry, even prior to the zero-tolerance policy. 
The Intergovernmental Public Liaison (IPL) in the CBP Commissioner’s office informed Amnesty International that the U.S. Border Patrol had separated at least 6,022 “family units”2 between April 19, 2018 (prior to which it claimed not to have
2 DHS agencies use several conflicting definitions of the term “family units.” Yet even adopting a conservative interpretation that this figure refers to individual family members, CBP still appears to have separated thousands more children from their families than included in the Ms. L. class action been recording family separations) and August 15, 2018. In contrast, CBP informed Amnesty International that it had only separated 36 families at official Ports of Entry from October 2017 through July 2018. 
CBP informed Amnesty International those numbers entirely excluded the apparently thousands of other families separated for fraud or other arbitrary designations –separations which, in a statement issued the day after the June 20 executive order supposedly ending the family separation policy, CBP suggested it would continue to conduct. 3 News media reported in late November 2018 that the frequency of family lawsuit, as was confirmed in HHS’s January 2019 report. For instance, the DHS and HHS draft regulations titled “Apprehension, Processing, Care, and Custody of Alien Minors and Unaccompanied Alien Children” define “family units” as the whole family group: “‘Family unit’ means a group of two or more aliens consisting of a minor or minors accompanied by his/her/their adult parent(s) or legal guardian(s).” Likewise, CBP’s “National Standards on Transport, Escort, Detention, and Search” also define “family units” as whole family groups: “Family Unit: A group of detainees that includes one or more non-United States citizen juvenile(s) accompanied by his/her/their parent(s) or legal guardian(s), whom the agency will evaluate for safety purposes to protect juveniles from sexual abuse and violence.” 
In contrast, CBP uses the term differently in its periodically updated public Southwest Border Migration statistics, in which it defines “family units” as the total number of individuals in families, rather than the whole family group: “Family Unit represents the number of individuals (either a child under 18 years old, parent or legal guardian) apprehended with a family member by the U.S. Border Patrol.” See “Southwest Border Migration FY2019,” available at: https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration.) The use of “family units” to mean each individual arriving in a family, rather than their whole family group, conflicts with the definition of the term under DHS policies, and may be intended to inflate the apparent number of families seeking to cross the US-Mexico border for political purposes. According to Internet Archive, CBP added this definition to its statistics on September 20, 2018 separations by CBP for “fraud” or other reasons has increased dramatically since the termination of the zero-tolerance policy. 
Despite repeated requests, CBP has declined to clarify how many of the “family units” separated were children versus adults, and in what months those separations occurred (including since some appeared to have been separated after President Trump’s executive order). When Amnesty International expressed alarm that the figures provided by CBP appear to conflict with previous numbers that CBP’s Legislative Affairs Office had shared with the Congressional Research Service for its July 2018 report, CBP suggested that its previous statistical accounts were flawed and that its “data team” had updated its statistics considerably. This suggests that the numbers CBP provided previously to the DHS OIG may also have been flawed and have still not been updated. This would be consistent with the OIG’s findings in its damning October 2018 report about family separations that “the data DHS eventually supplied was incomplete and inconsistent, raising questions about its reliability.” 
Despite its supposedly improved data, in August and September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it still did not have accurate numbers of family separations conducted by U.S. authorities. For the period prior to 19 April 2018, CBP claimed it did not yet have “an official count” of family separations. For the period after 19 April 2018, CBP also claimed it had not yet been able “to reconcile a complete and accurate list for separations that may have occurred during the zero-tolerance prosecution period.” In September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it did not have “a full tally” of families it separated for reasons of so-called “fraud” (including non-parental relationships, such as grandparents; or subjective doubts about the validity of the relationship) crossing the border.” 
On October 10, the day before Amnesty International released its report, the chief of staff of CBP’s Intergovernmental Public Liaison informed its author: “Perhaps after your report comes out, we may be able to release additional statistics.” The implication was that more statistics would only be forthcoming if there was adequate public pressure to release them. On November 20, CBP again declined to provide further data, instead stating that any new data would be posted on CBP’s website. 
Until now, DHS has weathered the scandalous fallout of its family separations policy – including irreparable harm caused to thousands of children and their families – without a full accounting, or a proper reckoning of the full scale of abuses under the zero-tolerance policy. 
DHS must reveal to Congress its full statistics on family separations and expose them to public scrutiny to ensure that all those families are reunited and to guarantee this never happens again. 
II. The policy and practice of family separations constituted torture in some cases, imposing extreme anguish on members of separated families –many of whom continue to be detained. 
In 2018, Amnesty International interviewed 15 adults whom DHS agencies separated from their children both before and after the introduction of the so-called zero-tolerance policy. The separations happened in all four U.S. states along the U.S.-Mexico border (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), at the hands of both CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel. In all of those cases, prior to being separated, the families had requested asylum and expressed their fear of return to their countries of origin. According to the adults, in none of these cases did DHS personnel explain to the families the reasons for the separations at the time that they happened or allow them to defend their custodial right to family unity. DHS personnel simply separated the families – in some cases through the use or threat of physical force. 
Based on its research in 2018, Amnesty International found that the Trump administration’s deliberate and punitive practice of forced family separations in some cases constituted torture under both US and international law. To meet the definition of torture, an act must be: (1) intentional; (2) carried out or condoned by a government official; (3) inflicting severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental; and (4) carried out for a specific purpose such as punishment, coercion, intimidation, or for a discriminatory reason. 
The Trump administration’s deliberate policy and practice of forcible family separations satisfies all of these criteria. Based on public statements and internal memoranda by U.S. government officials, the policy and practice of family separations were indisputably intended to deter asylum-seekers from requesting protection in the United States as well as to punish and compel those who did seek protection to give up their asylum claims. Amnesty International researchers witnessed the extreme mental anguish these family separations caused and documented instances of family separation being leveraged to compel a family to abandon their asylum claim. 
In January 2019, an internal DHS memo from December 2017 that was published by a member of Congress showed that DHS deliberately imposed the family separations policy as a means to deter and deport children and their families. Contrary to U.S. and international legal obligations, DHS never considered the best interests of the children in its cruel and unlawful family separation policy. 
More than a year after being forcibly separated by DHS, several families informed Amnesty International that they remain in dire need of psychological support to address the deep and lasting scars and extreme trauma of the forced family separations perpetrated against them. 
• “I believe that because of all of this I’m going through – the fear of going back to Brazil, the fear of being separated from my grandchild, all of this together, I can’t stop thinking about it – that it’s making me really sick,” said Maria (55), who was separated from her grandson with disabilities, Matheus (17), after they requested asylum in New Mexico in August 2017. “I might need to go look for a psychologist. I don’t remember things and can’t sleep . . . I start to talk about something and forget what I was saying. I am crying a lot also because I am still separated from Matheus.” 
The title of the Amnesty International report, “You Don’t Have Any Rights Here,” is a direct quotation of CBP officers speaking to a Salvadoran father in California in November 2017, and to a Brazilian mother in Texas in March 2018, as they summarily separated the two parents from their children. 
Both of those parents had presented themselves lawfully at official ports of entry and were in possession of documentation proving their relationships to their children. In neither case did the CBP officers give the parents any reason for the separations or a chance to defend their custody of their children. Amnesty International visited and interviewed each of the parents in detention about six weeks after they were separated from their respective children. In both interviews, the parents broke down into tears, revealing the extreme aguish and suffering they experienced because of this lawless conduct by DHS authorities. 
Amnesty International interviewed the Brazilian mother, Valquiria, while she was in detention on her 39th birthday on May 10, 2018, three days before Mother’s Day. Nine months later, she remains in detention at the El Paso Processing Center. On March 17, it will be one year since Valquiria was separated from her 8-year-old son, Abel (pseudonym). Abel has stared blankly for months at the door where he lives, waiting for his mother to return. 
• “They told me, ‘you don’t have any rights here, and you don’t have any rights to stay with your son.’” Valquiria described to Amnesty International. “For me I died at that moment. They ripped my heart out of me. . . . For me, it would have been better if I had dropped dead. For me, the world ended at that point . . . .How can a mother not have the right to be with her son?”
Valquiria is one of thousands of parents who were separated from their children by DHS but whose children were released to sponsors prior to the Ms. L class action lawsuit – thereby excluding her from class membership in the case and confining her to indefinite and arbitrary detention in a detention facility. She never would have been detained there in the first place had DHS followed its binding internal policies and maintained her family’s unity. Valquiria’s case is also emblematic of DHS’s use of family separations to penalize individuals seeking asylum: she was one of countless families separated by authorities after they requested asylum at official ports of entry. 
On January 31, 2019, Amnesty International visited Valquiria in detention at the El Paso Processing Center, nearly a year after she was separated from her son. Though she exhibited signs of extreme mental anguish, crying inconsolably during the interview, Valquiria still does not have access to psychological health care in a language she understands. 
Based on government filings in the ongoing multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration for its family separations policy, Amnesty International has also found that some of the children separated from their families by DHS under the zero-tolerance policy turned 18 while in ORR custody and thus “aged out” of children’s shelters; they are now being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. They have yet to be reunited with their families and remain in detention – where they never would have been in the first place had DHS not unlawfully separated their families. 
III. Amnesty International’s policy recommendations
To Congress:
• Pass legislation banning the separation and detention of families with children.
• Demand full and unimpeded access to asylum data held by DHS, HHS, and in any interdepartmental information-sharing platforms to allow scrutiny of the true numbers of family separations prior to, during, and following the zero-tolerance policy in 2018.
• Demand DHS provides exhaustive data (disaggregated by month, and Field Offices and/or sectors) on the numbers of families separated by DHS agencies (including CBP-OFO, Border Patrol, and ICE respectively), and the numbers of
children and parents among those disaggregated and total numbers of separated families.
• Demand DHS provide a full and similar reckoning of the numbers of supposedly “unaccompanied children” (UACs) who were separated from adults with whom they arrived at ports of entry, or who were apprehended between ports of entry, including based on alleged “fraud,” safety, security, and/or medical reasons – as those numbers have not been included in previous official statistics provided by DHS.
• Require DHS to elaborate upon how and in what circumstances officials (1) request and approve the separation of children from the adults with whom they arrive at ports of entry or are apprehended; (2) record such separations; (3) ensure any such family separations are conducted only in the best interests of the child; and (4) facilitate reunifications of those families and accountability for officials, in any cases found to have not been in the best interests of the child. 
To the Department of Homeland Security:
• Immediately account for all asylum seekers whom DHS agencies separated from their family members from January 2017 to present, at a minimum.
• Reunify, unconditionally, as quickly as possible and sparing no costs, any and all children who remain separated from their parents or guardians.
• Release all separated parents and guardians from U.S. immigration detention facilities who have still not yet been reunited with their children, even if the children were released to sponsors or were otherwise not Ms. L class members.
• Halt family separations in all circumstances, except following a rigorous determination of best interests of the child, which DHS officials must articulate to family members, providing them an effective opportunity to contest and recording that contestation in the case files of those affected.
• Strengthen mechanisms and procedures to ensure that the separation of children of asylum-seekers and migrants occurs only when it is in their best interest, including improved safeguards for the determination of those best interests.
• Identify all individuals who were separated from their families as children, but who have since “aged out” of ORR shelters and who are now in the custody of ICE immigration detention facilities.

Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women’s Issues 
Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Transnational Crime, Civilian Security, Democracy, Human Rights, and Global Women’s Issues 
  
RE:     Amnesty International Statement for Hearing on “U.S.-Venezuela Relations and the Path to a Democratic Transition”  
  
Dear Chairman Rubio, Ranking Member Cardin, and Members of the Subcommittee: 
  
On behalf of Amnesty International and our more than two million members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. 
  
Amnesty International is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the U.S. and in Venezuela. Our organization has been monitoring the situation in Venezuela for many years and wishes to share its grave concerns with the Committee regarding the mass violations of human rights in the country, as well as recommendations to improve the the dire situation and alleviate the tremendous human suffering taking place there. 
  
  
The institutional crisis in Venezuela – fueled by deep political polarization and marked social deterioration in the country – has had a devastating impact on human rights. In 2017, Venezuela’s highest judicial authority, the Supreme Court of Justice, took on the powers of the National Assembly (which was, and continues to be, led by the opposition). This led to a wave of protests between April and July 2017 which were violently repressed by the government of Nicolas Maduro. Between April and July 2017, more than 120 people were killed and around 1,958 injured in conjunction with the protests; an additional 5,000 people were detained. 
  
Amnesty International has been steadily reporting on-the-ground from Venezuela and has uncovered disturbing information about the Government’s complicity in violence, arbitrary detentions, and extrajudicial killings over the years. 
  
In the wake of the 2017 protests and their deadly aftermath, Amnesty International published three reports documenting the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. The first, Silenced by Force: Politically Motivated Arbitrary Detentions in Venezuela, relied on interviews with a panoply of current and former detainees and their lawyers to conclude that the government had engaged in the “abusive and arbitrary use of criminal law as a mechanism by which to detain and prosecute people who hold opinions critical of the Venezuelan government’s policies.” The second, Nights of Terror: Attacks and Illegal Raids on Homes in Venezuela, documented a pattern of government security forces engaging in indiscriminate raids of civilian homes, frequently demanding to know the whereabouts of political dissidents and terrorizing individuals into acquiescing to the government’s demands. The third, This is No Way to Live: Public Security and Right to Life in Venezuela, confirmed that the Government of Venezuela has engaged in violations of the right to life both by engaging in extrajudicial executions and adopting military methods to respond to crime as well as by failing to prevent or investigate skyrocketing homicides between private individuals. 
  
Since Amnesty International published these reports, the crackdown on political dissent in the country has further deteriorated. Just over a month ago, on January 22 and 23, 2019, there were numerous mass protests against the government of Nicolas Maduro, particularly in working-class areas where pro-government armed groups (called “colectivos”) are concentrated. In response to the protests, the Venezuelan state responded by deploying armed tactical police, and there have been reports of significant human rights violations against political dissidents. 
  
An Amnesty research team in February 2019 concluded that in January 2019, Venezuelan security forces under the command of Nicolas Maduro engaged in a campaign of extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention, and uses of excessive force. The team documented six extrajudicial executions at the hands of the Venezuelan Special Action Forces; two young men killed and one young man wounded by firearms deployed by the Bolivarian National Guard and the Bolivarian National Police; and the arbitrary detention of over 137 children and adolescents who were called “terrorists” and “guarimberos” (protesters who use violence), exposed to irritant substances, deprived of sleep, and threatened with death. What did all of these individuals have in common? Each had been linked to peaceful protests demanding regime change and a safer, more prosperous Venezuela. 
  
  
The Venezuelan government’s failure to acknowledge the crisis of scarcity, let alone to put in place urgent and appropriate responses to guarantee Venezuelans’ rights to health and food, violates Venezuelans’ basic human rights. The lack of access to these basic rights has been a central issue in the ongoing political protests in the country as well as an impetus for the forced migration of over 3 million Venezuelans. 
  
The skyrocketing rate of inflation – which currently stands at one million percent and is envisioned to increase tenfold by the end of 2019 – has left Venezuelans unable to afford even basic goods. On top of that, Venezuela is experiencing a severe shortage of food products and essential medicines. As a result, Venezuelans are left both starving and sick: as of 2018, the country was missing eighty-five percent of essential medicines, and nearly two-thirds of its population had reported involuntary weight loss. 
  
The Venezuelan government’s refusal to act in the face of this severe lack of medicine and food violates its citizens’ human rights to adequate food and the right to health. The right to adequate food requires that food be available, accessible, and acceptable. The right to the highest attainable standard of health requires not just timely and appropriate health care but also access to the underlying determinants of health, including safe and potable water and adequate sanitation and an adequate supply of safe food and nutrition. In failing to acknowledge the crisis of scarcity in the country, let alone take appropriate action to urgently secure the rights to food and health for its citizens, the Venezuelan government is violating these human rights tenets. The government’s failure to act calls into question its willingness to comply with its obligation to guarantee access to these rights for all, without discrimination of any kind. The great progress Venezuela had made in terms of economic and social rights until 2013 has been emphatically reversed. 
  
In some cases, the grave socioeconomic situation has exacerbated the already deleterious violations of political rights in Venezuela, constituting what advocates have termed a “double discrimination” against political activists in the country. For example, Amnesty International learned of the recent death of a young man named Virgilio, who was detained without cause after participating in a political protest. While in detention, he was presented with rotting food, sometimes filled with worms, and could not access potable water. He soon developed a fever for which he was denied treatment. Though he was eventually evacuated to a hospital in a severely dehydrated state, it was too late: Virgilio, just 20 years old, died of a hemorrhage on February 5, 2019 – a death directly attributable to the combination of his illegitimate detention and authorities’ refusal to provide him with adequate food, water, and medication while he was detained. 
  
III.           The United States Government’s Response to the Venezuela Crisis Must Account for Effects on Venezuelans’ Human Rights. 
  
The United States has taken an active role in responding to the ongoing institutional crisis in Venezuela, including the imposition of sanctions and proposed provision of humanitarian assistance. Amnesty International takes this opportunity to remind the U.S. government of the paramount importance of considering the effect any such measures will have on the human rights of Venezuelans. Amnesty International provides its views as an impartial organization which does not take positions in support of or opposition to any particular political leader or party. 
  
Regarding the petroleum sanctions imposed by the United States on January 28, 2019, Amnesty International reminds the U.S. government that sanctions should be targeted, with specific objectives and a clear timetable, and their effectiveness and humanitarian impact must be monitored. In this case, the sanctions are likely to make life even harder than it already is for the people of Venezuela, given that the Venezuelan economy is heavily dependent on oil exports and that the United States is one of its main trading partners. 
  
Regarding any threats of military intervention, a responsible approach to the current situation would focus on guaranteeing, without delay, the rights of the Venezuelan people, rather than unhelpfully diverting attention towards possible military intervention. The international community has an obligation to prevent escalation of the conflict in Venezuela. In particular, the U.S. government should work in concert with other governments to ameliorate the extreme shortages of food and healthcare that put the lives of millions of Venezuelans at risk. 
  
Regarding humanitarian assistance, states that can provide assistance should do so when necessary, in a manner that comports with human rights, including consulting with civil society and ensuring that resources are distributed without discrimination. However, the widespread suffering of people in Venezuela should not be used as a lever in political negotiations or as a bargaining tool to exert political pressure on the government. Amnesty International opposes all conditions on international assistance and cooperation that result or may result in human rights abuses and encourages the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to carefully examine any conditions on U.S. humanitarian assistance to ensure that compliance with them does not lead to rights abuses. 
  
Finally, regarding the exodus of Venezuelan nationals from the country, which already numbers over three million individuals and is expected to increase to five million by the end of 2019, Amnesty International encourages the United States to assist Venezuelan nationals seeking international protection, including nationals seeking protection within the United States, who now make up the largest group by nationality of individuals seeking asylum affirmatively in the United States. The widespread violations of human rights in Venezuela has put the lives, freedom, and safety of those fleeing the country at great risk. Amnesty is alarmed by recent reports that Venezuelans seeking protection in the United States are still being deported regularly to Venezuela, notwithstanding the U.S. government’s acknowledgment of the depth and seriousness of the crisis taking place there. The United States must immediately extend protections to Venezuelan nationals and should ensure that they are not forced to return to a country where they would face grave harm. 
  
  III.         Amnesty International’s Policy Recommendations to Congress and the Executive Branch 
  
Amnesty International believes that the international community, including the United States, has an obligation to prevent the escalation of the crisis in Venezuela, ensure that its actions do not violate international law or perpetrate futher human suffering, and support national actors in creating conditions that will ensure the lasting enjoyment of human rights in Venezuela. 
  
To that end, Amnesty International calls on Congress to:

Re: Hearing on Protecting Dreamers and TPS Recipients 
Dear Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins and Members of the Committee: 
On behalf of Amnesty International USA and our more than two million supporters nationwide, we hereby submit this statement for the record.  This statement addresses the human rights situation in 10 countries that are currently designated for Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”).  The Trump administration’s decisions to end TPS for several countries imperil many longtime U.S. residents who are at risk of deportation to countries where they may face violence, persecution, torture, even death.  Amnesty International USA’s statement examines the current conditions in the 10 TPS-designated countries. 
Since January 2017 the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has made multiple announcements to end TPS, sometime over the near year: 
South Sudan: TPS designated through May 2, 2019. 
Nepal: TPS to terminate on June 24, 2019. 
Syria: TPS designated through September 30, 2019. 
Honduras:  TPS to terminate on January 5, 2020. 
Yemen:  TPS designated through March 3, 2020. 
Somalia:  TPS designated through March 17, 2020. 
El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan In October 2018 in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) (PDF, 458 KB), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined DHS from implementing and enforcing the decisions to terminate TPS. As long as the preliminary injunction ordered by the court in Ramos, et al v. Nielsen (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) remains in effect, TPS should continue for these four countries. 
 A. South Sudan (TPS designated through May 2, 2019): South Sudan is the first TPS-designated country that will lose its TPS designation, as of May 2, 2019.  South Sudan was designated for TPS for ongoing armed conflict and massive humanitarian crisis, both of which continue to widen and deepen.  In our 2017-2018 Annual State of the World’s Human Rights report Amnesty International highlighted internal armed conflict, sexual violence, lack of humanitarian access, chronic violations of the right to food and the displacement of over 3.9 million persons either as refugees or Internally Displaced Peoples (“IDPs”). Other human rights violations include ethnically-based killings of civilians; extrajudicial killings; and mass forced displacement. 
  
According to Amnesty International’s 2018 report, approximately one third of the South Sudanese population had been displaced since the beginning of the conflict in December 2013; 1.9 million of them were internally displaced, including over 200,000 who lived on United Nations (“UN”) bases under the protection of peacekeepers. More than 640,000 fled war-torn South Sudan, bringing the total number of refugees from South Sudan to over two million. 
  
The crisis in South Sudan led the United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”) to authorize UN peacekeepers and other UN security personnel to protect civilians. The UNSC also unanimously extended the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan until March 15, 2019, demanding that parties end the fighting and signaling its intention to consider all measures including an arms embargo against those obstructing peace. 
  
Although a new peace agreement was signed in 2018, that has not stopped the violence, human suffering and the use of sexual- and gender-based violence as a tool of war in the South Sudan conflict. 
  
Amnesty International’s findings have been echoed by the U.S. State Department (“DOS”) in its 2018 human rights report on South Sudan, noting: 
  
The most significant human rights issues included conflict-related, ethnically based targeted killings of civilians; extrajudicial killings, abuse, and mass forced displacement of approximately four million civilians, displaced internally and as refugees; and intimidation and inhuman treatment of civilians such as arbitrary arrest and detention, abductions and kidnapping, recruitment and use of an estimated 17,000 child soldiers; and widespread sexual violence. Attacks on military and civilian targets often resulted in rape, destruction of villages, theft, looting, and revenge attacks on civilians. Human rights abuses also included torture, intimidation, and unlawful detention of civilians; harassment, intimidation, and violence against journalists, civil society organizations, and human rights defenders; government restriction of freedoms of privacy, speech, press, and association; and abductions related to intercommunal and interethnic conflict. Officials reportedly arrested, detained, and mistreated several persons affiliated with the LGBTI community. Security force abuses occurred throughout the country. Impunity was widespread and remained a major problem. While government offensives during the year were responsible for the majority of the atrocities, resulting displacement, and consequent food insecurity, opposition forces also perpetrated serious human rights abuses. 
  
 B. Nepal (TPS to terminate June 24, 2019): According to Amnesty International’s 2017-2018 report, nearly 70 percent of survivors from the 2015 earthquake, numbering hundreds of thousands, were still living in temporary shelters two years after the earthquake.  The Nepali government stipulated proof of land ownership as a condition for receiving a rebuilding grant. However, because up to 25 percent of the population were considered not to have met this criterion, tens of thousands of earthquake survivors were ineligible for these grants.  The situation primarily affected marginalized and disadvantaged groups, including women, Dalits, and other caste-based and ethnic minorities. 
  
C. Syria (TPS designated through September 30, 2019): The conflict in Syria has continued to support a climate of lethal danger to civilians. The Syrian refugee crisis continues to be the worst the world has seen since World War II, producing over five million refugees.  Mass imprisonment and hangings, forced conscription, and entire swaths of the country in ruins render the country too dangerous and unstable for Syrians to return. 
  
D. Honduras (TPS to terminate on January 5, 2020): Insecurity, impunity, and violence continue to run rampant. Honduras has a homicide rate 800 percent higher than that of the U.S.  In our 2018 report Protest Prohibited: Use of Force and Arbitrary Detentions to Suppress Dissent in Honduras, Amnesty International documented how the government’s crackdown resulted in hundreds of arrests and at least 30 deaths.  Human Rights Watch reported that 20,500 people were held in a prison system designed to hold a maximum of 10,600 inmates. 
  
Women, girls and LGBTI individuals continue to face high levels of gender-related violence.  Gangs consistently exploit children, forcing them to assist in arms trades, drug deals, and even homicide. Sexual exploitation of children is also common.  Human rights defenders continue to be targets of smear campaigns by both state and non-state actors, as well as being subjected to threats and attacks. Land disputes continue to result in violent conflicts, and Indigenous people have had their territories illegally explored and exploited of resources. Additionally, Indigenous people have consistently reported threats and acts of violence against their communities. 
  
E. Yemen (TPS designated through March 3, 2020): The war and humanitarian catastrophe have made conditions too dangerous and unstable for Yemenis to return. Around 14 million people are at risk of famine, and the actions of the Saudi Arabia-UAE led coalition have led to tens of thousands displaced people across Yemen.  The health sector is in ruins, and the basic infrastructure destroyed.  The political process aimed at ending the fighting and lifting a blockade imposed by Saudi Arabia is making little progress. 
  
F. Somalia (TPS designated through March 17, 2020): The most recent designation of Somalia’s TPS was based on ongoing armed conflict and persisting humanitarian crisis.  The ongoing violence and mass humanitarian crisis render Somalia too dangerous and unstable for safe returns. 
  
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia reported 1,228 civilian casualties between January and September 2017 as a result of the conflict.  Due to ongoing conflict, more than 1.5 million people are currently internally displaced in Somalia and nearly 900,000 refugees have fled to neighboring countries.  Over half of Somalia’s 12.4 million people are still in need of emergency humanitarian assistance. According to a report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, flash and river flooding that occurred in April 2018 affected an estimated 772,500 people and displaced more than 229,000. 
  
In our 2017-2018 report on Somalia, Amnesty International highlighted serious concerns over refugee and migrant rights, lack of freedom of expression, widespread  sexual and gender based violence, and food insecurity and malnutrition.  The DOS highlighted similar concerns in its 2017 Country Report on Human Rights Practices on Somalia: 
  
Human rights issues included killings of civilians by security forces, clan militias, and unknown assailants, including by al-Shabaab.  Disappearances; torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; arbitrary and politically motivated arrest and detentions, including of journalists; use of child soldiers; restrictions on freedoms of speech and press, assembly and movement; forced eviction, relocation and sexual abuse of internally displaced persons (IDPs); disruption, diversion, and seizure of humanitarian assistance; trafficking in persons; widespread violence against women and girls with little government action for accountability, including rape and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C); criminalization of same-sex sexual conduct; and forced labor, including by children. 
  
… 
Impunity generally remained the norm. Government authorities took minimal steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed violations, particularly military and police officials accused of committing rape, killings, clan violence, and extortion. Clan militias and al-Shabaab continued to commit grave abuses throughout the country, including extrajudicial and politically motivated killings; disappearances; cruel and unusual punishment; rape; and attacks on employees of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and the United Nations. They also blocked humanitarian assistance, conscripted child soldiers, and restricted freedoms of speech, press, assembly, and movement. AMISOM troops killed civilians. 
  
G. El Salvador: In October 2018 in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) (PDF, 458 KB), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined DHS from implementing and enforcing the decisions to terminate TPS. As long as the preliminary injunction ordered by the court in Ramos, et al v. Nielsen (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) remains in effect, TPS should continue for El Salvador. 
El Salvador remains one of the deadliest countries in the world. As Amnesty International reported in 2018, the murder rate in El Salvador is one of the highest in the world.  In our 2018 report Stuck at the Door: The Urgent Need for Protection of Central American Refugees, Asylum Seekers and Migrants in the Caravans, Amnesty International documented how the high murder rate is largely attributed to the maras, large criminal networks that use violence, extortion, physical and sexual assault, forced recruitment, and death threats.  Not only are security forces unable to control the gangs, but in some cases they are actually complicit in criminal activities. 
  
H. Haiti:In October 2018 in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) (PDF, 458 KB), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined DHS from implementing and enforcing the decisions to terminate TPS. As long as the preliminary injunction ordered by the court in Ramos, et al v. Nielsen (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) remains in effect, TPS should continue for Haiti. 
  
Over eight years after the 2010 earthquake, Haiti continues to experience violence and extreme poverty, remaining the poorest country in the western hemisphere.  Internal displacement following the earthquake continues, with approximately 37,867 people affected, most of whom are living in makeshift camps. Cholera, introduced by UN peacekeepers in 2010, continues to claim lives. 
  
In 2018 Haiti faced the worst civil unrest of recent years, following protests related to the government’s elimination of petroleum subsidies, which resulted in reported fatalities. This, combined with hospitals running out of supplies and people unable to access essential services, has created a hotbed of rights violations. Women and girls are particularly affected by the instability, enduring sexual and gender-based violence. 
  
I. Nicaragua: In October 2018 in Ramos, et al. v. Nielsen, et al., No. 18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) (PDF, 458 KB), the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California enjoined DHS from implementing and enforcing the decisions to terminate TPS. As long as the preliminary injunction ordered by the court in Ramos, et al v. Nielsen (N.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2018) remains in effect, TPS should continue for Nicaragua. 
Following reforms to the social security system in April 2018, Nicaraguans began conducting protests throughout the country. In response, the government of President Ortega brutally cracked down on protesters, resulting in hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries.  In June 2018 Amnesty International concluded that the Ortega government had employed a strategy of indiscriminate repression, intending not only to stanch the protests but to punish those who participated and anyone who attempted to expose the rampant corruption and rights abuses committed by the regime. The government has engaged in escalating attacks on the press, forcing over 60 journalists into exile. 
  
In December 2018 the government cancelled the legal registration of the Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights, a domestic NGO dedicated to educating Nicaraguans about their human rights and providing reporting on Nicaragua’s compliance with its human rights guarantees. In December 2018 the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (“GIEI”) concluded that the Ortega government had committed crimes against humanity in its crackdown on the 2018 protests; that same month, the Nicaraguan government kicked out GIEI as well as the Special Follow-up Mechanism for Nicaragua, in a move the Organization of American States criticized as “further plac[ing] Nicaragua in the terrain of authoritarianism.” Since 2018, many Nicaraguans have been forced to flee to neighboring countries. 
  
J. Sudan: On October 3, 2018, a court temporarily stopped DHS from terminating TPS for four countries including Sudan.  Following the court decision, DHS announced its continued compliance with the preliminary injunction order, thereby extending TPS designation for Sudan, until January 2, 2020. 
  
In our 2017-2018 State of the World’s Human Rights report on Sudan, Amnesty International found: 
  
Security forces targeted opposition party members, human rights defenders, students and political activists for arbitrary arrest, detention and other abuses. The rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly were arbitrarily restricted. The security and humanitarian situation in Darfur, Blue Nile and South Kordofan states remained dire, with widespread violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. 
  
DOS documented many of these same human rights violations in its 2018 report on Sudan: 
  
The most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial killings; torture, beatings, rape, and other cruel or inhuman treatment or punishment of detainees and prisoners; arbitrary detention by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; restrictions on the freedoms of expression, press, assembly, association, religion, and movement; intimidation and closure of human rights and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); lack of accountability in cases involving violence against women, including rape and female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C); the use of child soldiers; trafficking in persons; criminalization of same-sex conduct with severe penalty; denial of workers’ rights to associate with independent trade unions; and child labor. 
  
Government authorities did not investigate human rights violations by the National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS), the military, or any other branch of the security services, with limited exceptions relating to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The government failed to adequately compensate families of victims of shootings during the September 2013 protests, make its investigation results public, or hold security officials accountable. Impunity remained a problem in all branches of the security forces and government institutions. 
  
December 2018 developments:  Since December 19, 2018, conditions have deteriorated in Sudan. Sudan has experienced over three months of sustained protests, with over 300 protests in 15 of Sudan’s 18 states. Thousands of people have marched in dozens of cities. This is the biggest popular revolt that Sudan’s ruling National Congress Party (NCP) has faced since it came to power in the 1989 coup. Protests are mainly led by young people and organized by the Sudanese Professionals Association (trade unions, including teachers, doctors, engineers and journalists) and opposition parties. 
  
In response, Sudanese security services have cracked down on the protestors with brutality. Amnesty International has credible information that over 40 people have been killed, at least 179 injured, and over 1300 arrested since the protests began. Forty-seven students of Darfur origin remain in incommunicado detention after security agents arrested them in raids on their homes in December 2018 in Sinnar and Khartoum states. One student was killed in the raids. In press conferences on December 23 and 28 the government accused the students of infiltration, association with a rebel group, and planning to kill protesters in the ongoing protests. 
  
Without extension of TPS for the 10 designee countries, thousands of longtime U.S. residents will be deported to countries that are too dangerous and violent for safe return, where they would face certain violence and persecution.  The costs for these TPS recipients and their families – and for human rights around the world – would be immense and too high a price to pay.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear President, 
I am deeply concerned about the reports of grave human rights violations being carried out by the authorities in Chechnya, who since the end of December 2018 have launched a new wave of homophobic attacks in Chechnya. Around 40 people believed to be gay or lesbian have been reportedly detained in a government building in the city of Argun, where they have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. At least two individuals are reported to have died after being tortured, but the actual number of victims may be higher. The authorities are also said to be destroying the individuals’ passports, making it difficult for them to flee Chechnya in the future. The Russian authorities’ failure to investigate the 2017 attacks – which involved the abduction and killing of 100 gay men and women- and for which no one has yet been held accountable, has enabled this homophobic crackdown to resume. The Russian Federation has an obligation under international human rights law to prohibit discrimination and to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. 
I urge you to carry out a prompt, effective and thorough investigation into the reports of homophobic detention, torture and killings in Chechnya and to ensure that anyone found guilty or complicit in such crimes is brought to justice. I further urge you to take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of those who may be at risk in Chechnya because of their real or perceived sexual orientation and condemn in the strongest terms possible any homophobic comments made by officials against individuals due to their real or perceived sexual orientation. 
Yours sincerely,

February 12, 2019 
  
RE: Amnesty International Statement for “Venezuela at a Crossroads” Hearing 
  
Dear Chairman Engel, Ranking Member McCaul, and Members of the Committee: 
  
On behalf of Amnesty International and our more than two million members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. 
  
Amnesty International is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the U.S. and in Venezuela. Our organization has been monitoring the situation in Venezuela for many years and wishes to share its grave concerns with the Committee regarding the mass violations of human rights in the country, as well as recommendations to improve the the dire situation and alleviate the tremendous human suffering taking place there. 
  
  
The institutional crisis in Venezuela – fueled by deep political polarization and marked social deterioration in the country – has had a devastating impact on human rights. In 2017, Venezuela’s highest judicial authority, the Supreme Court of Justice, took on the powers of the National Assembly (which was, and continues to be, led by the opposition). This led to a wave of protests between April and July 2017 which were violently repressed by the government of Nicolas Maduro. Between April and July 2017, more than 120 people were killed and around 1,958 injured in conjunction with the protests; an additional 5,000 people were detained. 
  
In the wake of these protests and their deadly aftermath, Amnesty International published two reports documenting the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. The first, Silenced by Force: Politically Motivated Arbitrary Detentions in Venezuela, relied on interviews with a panoply of current and former detainees and their lawyers to conclude that the government had engaged in the “abusive and arbitrary use of criminal law as a mechanism by which to detain and prosecute people who hold opinions critical of the Venezuelan government’s policies.” The second, Nights of Terror: Attacks and Illegal Raids on Homes in Venezuela, documented a pattern of government security forces engaging in indiscriminate raids of civilian homes, frequently demanding to know the whereabouts of political dissidents and terrorizing individuals into acquiescing to the government’s demands. 
  
Since Amnesty International published these reports, the crackdown on political dissent in the country has further deteriorated. Just weeks ago, on January 22 and 23, 2019, there were numerous mass protests against the government of Nicolas Maduro, particularly in working-class areas where pro-government armed groups (called “colectivos”) are concentrated. In response to the protests, the Venezuelan state responded by deploying armed tactical police, and there have been reports of significant human rights violations, which Amnesty International is working to verify. According to the Venezuela-based organization Foro Penal, 988 people were arbitrarily detained in the last ten days of January 2019, 741 of whom were still held as of February 6, 2019. On a single day – January 23 – there were 770 arbitrary detentions. Several Venezuelan civil society organizations have reported that 40 people have died in the context of the January 2019 protests. 
  
Particularly disturbing is the widespread arbitrary detention of children: in just a single week in January, 77 children under the age of 18 were detained in Venezuela, including a 12-year-old girl. Judges are reportedly being pressed to punish children as a means of deterring anyone in Venezuelan civil society from engaging in protest. 
  
In addition, the government has routinely violated the right to freedom of expression. At least 19 media workers – both Venezuelan and foreign nationals – have been arbitrarily detained or expelled from the country. 
  
  
The Venezuelan government’s failure to acknowledge the crisis of scarcity, let alone to put in place urgent and appropriate responses to guarantee Venezuelans’ rights to health and food, violates Venezuelans’ basic human rights. The lack of access to these basic rights has been a central issue in the ongoing political protests in the country as well as an impetus for the forced migration of millions of Venezuelans, as documented by Amnesty International in its “Emergency Exit” campaign. 
  
The skyrocketing rate of inflation – which currently stands at one million percent and is envisioned to increase tenfold by the end of 2019 – has left Venezuelans unable to afford even basic goods. On top of that, Venezuela is experiencing a severe shortage of food products and essential medicines. As a result, Venezuelans are left both starving and sick: as of 2018, the country was missing eighty-five percent of essential medicines, and nearly two-thirds of its population had reported involuntary weight loss. 
  
The Venezuelan government’s refusal to act in the face of this severe lack of medicine and food violates its citizens’ human rights to adequate food and the right to health. The right to adequate food requires that food be available, accessible, and acceptable. The right to the highest attainable standard of health requires not just timely and appropriate health care but also access to the underlying determinants of health, including safe and potable water and adequate sanitation and an adequate supply of safe food and nutrition. In failing to acknowledge the crisis of scarcity in the country, let alone take appropriate action to urgently secure the rights to food and health for its citizens, the Venezuelan government is violating these core human rights tenets. The government’s failure to act calls into question its willingness to comply with its obligation to guarantee access to these rights for all, without discrimination of any kind. 
  
In some cases, the grave socioeconomic situation has exacerbated the already deleterious violations of political rights in Venezuela, constituting what advocates have termed a “double discrimination” against political activists in the country. For example, Amnesty International learned of the death, just days ago, of a young man named Virgilio, who was detained without cause after participating in a political protest. While in detention, he was presented with rotting food, sometimes filled with worms, and could not access potable water. He soon developed a fever for which he was denied treatment. Though he was eventually evacuated to a hospital in a severely dehydrated state, it was too late: Virgilio, just 20 years old, died of a hemorrhage on February 5, 2019 – a death directly attributable to the combination of his illegitimate detention and authorities’ refusal to provide him with adequate food, water, and medication while he was detained. 
  
  
The United States has taken an active role in responding to the ongoing institutional crisis in Venezuela, including the imposition of sanctions and proposed provision of humanitarian assistance. Amnesty International takes this opportunity to remind the U.S. government of the paramount importance of considering the effect any such measures will have on the human rights of Venezuelans. Amnesty International provides its views as an impartial organization which does not take positions in support of or opposition to any particular political leader or party. 
  
Regarding the petroleum sanctions imposed by the United States on January 28, 2019, Amnesty International reminds the U.S. government that it must take full account of the impact any sanctions will have on the enjoyment of human rights, especially among the most vulnerable groups in society. Sanctions should be targeted, with specific objectives and a clear timetable, and their effectiveness and humanitarian impact must be monitored. 
  
Regarding any threats of military intervention, a responsible approach to the current situation would focus on guaranteeing, without delay, the rights of the Venezuelan people, rather than diverting attention towards possible military intervention. The international community has an obligation to prevent escalation of the conflict in Venezuela. In particular, the U.S. government should work in concert with other governments to ameliorate the extreme shortages of food and healthcare that put the lives of millions of Venezuelans at risk. 
  
Regarding humanitarian assistance, states that can provide assistance should do so when necessary, in a manner that comports with human rights, including consulting with civil society and ensuring that resources are distributed without discrimination. However, the widespread suffering of people in Venezuela should not be used as a lever in political negotiations or as a bargaining tool to exert political pressure on the government. Amnesty International opposes all conditions on international assistance and cooperation that result or may result in human rights abuses and encourages the House Foreign Affairs Committee to carefully examine any conditions on U.S. humanitarian assistance to ensure that compliance with them does not lead to rights abuses. 
  
Finally, regarding the exodus of Venezuelan nationals from the country, which already numbers over three million individuals and is expected to increase to five million by the end of 2019, Amnesty International encourages the United States to assist Venezuelan nationals seeking international protection, including nationals seeking protection within the United States, who now make up the largest group by nationality of individuals seeking asylum in the United States. The widespread violations of human rights in Venezuela has put the lives, freedom, and safety of those fleeing the country at great risk. The United States should extend protections to Venezuelan nationals and should ensure that they are not forced to return to a country where they would face grave harm. 
  
  
Amnesty International believes that the international community, including the United States, has an obligation to prevent the escalation of the crisis in Venezuela, ensure that its actions do not violate international law or perpetrate futher human suffering, and support national actors in creating conditions that will ensure the lasting enjoyment of human rights in Venezuela. 
  
To that end, Amnesty International calls on Congress to:

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Counsellor, 
On 9 February 2019, a judge ordered the pre-trial detention of human rights defender and lawyer Ezzat Ghoniem pending investigation in case 441/2018. On 1 March 2018, Ezzat Ghoniem and Azzoz Mahgoub were arrested on charges of “joining a banned group”, “disseminating false news” and “providing international bodies with false information”. Their 15-day detention kept on being renewed until 4 September 2018, when a court ordered their probational release, provided they report to a police station twice a week. They were never released, and on September 14, the National Security Agency officers forcibly disappeared them. As they could not observe their probational terms, an arrest warrant was issued against them on 20 October 2018, by the same judge that issued the latest order against Ghoniem. Ezzat Ghoniem’s whereabouts were unknown until February 9, 2019, when lawyers saw him blindfolded and in a glass cage at the Cairo Criminal Court. Azzoz Mahgoub, remains in custody of the authorities and his fate and whereabouts remain unknown.  
I urge you to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Ezzat Ghoniem and reveal the fate and whereabouts of Azzoz Mahgoub, as they have been detained solely for their peaceful human rights work and the exercise of their right to freedom of expression. I urge you to drop all the charges against them and ensure that, pending their release, Ghoniem and Mahgoub are protected from torture and other ill-treatment and that their conditions of detention are in line with international standards. I urge to ensure that a prompt, independent, effective and impartial investigation is conducted into the circumstances surrounding Ghoniem’s enforced disappearance from 14 September to 9 February, as well as Mahgoub’s ongoing incommunicado detention, make the results public and ensure that all those suspected to be responsible for violating the detainees’ rights are brought to justice in fair trials.

Re: Oversight Hearing on Family Separation Policy 
  
Dear Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and Members of the Committee: 
  
On behalf of Amnesty International[1] and our more than two million members and supporters in the United States, we hereby submit this statement for the record. Amnesty International is an international human rights organization with national and regional offices in more than 70 countries, including in the U.S. and Mexico. One of Amnesty International’s top global priorities for the past several years has been the protection of the human rights of refugees and asylum seekers. 
  
Amnesty International welcomes the ongoing oversight efforts by Congress, including efforts to publicly investigate and establish an exhaustive record of family separations by U.S. authorities in 2017 and 2018. We hope Congress follows these efforts with concrete measures to pass legislation prohibiting the separation and indefinite detention of children and families. 
  
  
Based on over a year of in-depth research on the US-Mexico border, Amnesty International published a report in October 2018 titled “You Don’t Have Any Rights Here”: Illegal Pushbacks, Arbitrary Detention, and Ill-Treatment of Asylum seekers in the United States. This was the first publication to report on how the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) apparently undercounted by thousands the true number of family separations conducted in 2017 and 2018, before, during and after the announcement of its so-called “zero-tolerance” policy. (See id. Chapter 3.4 at 42.) 
  
Alongside its October 2018 report, Amnesty International released a Facts & Figures overview of new U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) statistics it obtained, which appeared to demonstrate a mass undercounting of family separations. Also in October 2018, Amnesty International responded in an open letter to DHS Secretary Nielsen to false claims made by a DHS spokesperson that all family separations had been reported in the government’s submissions in the Ms. L. class action lawsuit in 2018. 
  
In January 2019, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a report confirming Amnesty International’s earlier findings: HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) apparently took custody of thousands more separated children than previously disclosed, who were never included in the Ms. L. class action lawsuit because they did not meet the definition of the class. 
  
Amnesty International’s report demonstrated that DHS did not include in its official statistics thousands of additional families separated for reasons of so-called “fraud,” safety, security, or medical considerations. Moreover, DHS appeared to apply arbitrarily and en masse those vague grounds for family separations, including to separate immediate family members who had full documentation of their family relationships and who had requested asylum at official ports of entry, even prior to the zero-tolerance policy. 
  
The Intergovernmental Public Liaison (IPL) in the CBP Commissioner’s office informed Amnesty International that the U.S. Border Patrol had separated at least 6,022 “family units”[2] between April 19, 2018 (prior to which it claimed not to have been recording family separations) and August 15, 2018. In contrast, CBP informed Amnesty International that it had only separated 36 families at official Ports of Entry from October 2017 through July 2018. 
  
CBP informed Amnesty International those numbers entirely excluded the apparently thousands of other families separated for fraud or other arbitrary designations –separations which, in a statement issued the day after the June 20 executive order supposedly ending the family separation policy, CBP suggested it would continue to conduct.[3] News media reported in late November 2018 that the frequency of family separations by CBP for “fraud” or other reasons has increased dramatically since the termination of the zero-tolerance policy. 
  
Despite repeated requests, CBP has declined to clarify how many of the “family units” separated were children versus adults, and in what months those separations occurred (including since some appeared to have been separated after President Trump’s executive order). When Amnesty International expressed alarm that the figures provided by CBP appear to conflict with previous numbers that CBP’s Legislative Affairs Office had shared with the Congressional Research Service for its July 2018 report, CBP suggested that its previous statistical accounts were flawed and that its “data team” had updated its statistics considerably. 
  
This suggests that the numbers CBP provided previously to the DHS OIG may also have been flawed and have still not been updated. This would be consistent with the OIG’s findings in its damning October 2018 report about family separations that “the data DHS eventually supplied was incomplete and inconsistent, raising questions about its reliability.” 
  
Despite its supposedly improved data, in August and September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it still did not have accurate numbers of family separations conducted by U.S. authorities. For the period prior to 19 April 2018, CBP claimed it did not yet have “an official count” of family separations. For the period after 19 April 2018, CBP also claimed it had not yet been able “to reconcile a complete and accurate list for separations that may have occurred during the zero-tolerance prosecution period.” In September 2018, CBP informed Amnesty International that it did not have “a full tally” of families it separated for reasons of so-called “fraud” (including non-parental relationships, such as grandparents; or subjective doubts about the validity of the relationship). 
  
On October 10, the day before Amnesty International released its report, the chief of staff of CBP’s Intergovernmental Public Liaison informed its author: “Perhaps after your report comes out, we may be able to release additional statistics.” The implication was that more statistics would only be forthcoming if there was adequate public pressure to release them. On November 20, CBP again declined to provide further data, instead stating that any new data would be posted on CBP’s website. 
  
Until now, DHS has weathered the scandalous fallout of its family separations policy – including irreparable harm caused to thousands of children and their families – without a full accounting or a proper reckoning of the full scale of abuses under the zero-tolerance policy. 
  
DHS must reveal to Congress its full statistics on family separations and expose them to public scrutiny to ensure that all those families are reunited and to guarantee this never happens again. 
  
  
In 2018, Amnesty International interviewed 15 adults whom DHS agencies separated from their children both before and after the introduction of the so-called zero-tolerance policy. The separations happened in all four U.S. states along the U.S.-Mexico border (California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas), at the hands of both CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel. In all of those cases, prior to being separated, the families had requested asylum and expressed their fear of return to their countries of origin. According to the adults, in none of these cases did DHS personnel explain to the families the reasons for the separations at the time that they happened or allow them to defend their custodial right to family unity. DHS personnel simply separated the families – in some cases through the use or threat of physical force. 
  
Based on its research in 2018, Amnesty International found that the Trump administration’s deliberate and punitive practice of forced family separations in some cases constituted torture under both US and international law. To meet the definition of torture, an act must be: (1) intentional; (2) carried out or condoned by a government official; (3) inflicting severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental; and (4) carried out for a specific purpose such as punishment, coercion, intimidation, or for a discriminatory reason. 
  
The Trump administration’s deliberate policy and practice of forcible family separations satisfies all of these criteria. Based on public statements and internal memoranda by U.S. government officials, both the policy and practice of family separations were indisputably intended to deter asylum seekers from requesting protection in the United States as well as to punish and compel those who did seek protection to give up their asylum claims. Amnesty International researchers witnessed the extreme mental anguish these family separations caused and documented instances of family separation being leveraged to compel a family to abandon their asylum claim. 
  
In January 2019, an internal DHS memo from December 2017 that was published by a member of Congress showed that DHS deliberately imposed the family separations policy as a means to deter and deport children and their families. Contrary to U.S. and international legal obligations, DHS never considered the best interests of the children in its cruel and unlawful family separation policy. 
  
More than a year after being forcibly separated by DHS, several families informed Amnesty International that they remain in dire need of psychological support to address the deep and lasting scars and extreme trauma of the forced family separations perpetrated against them. 
  
  
The title of the Amnesty International report, “You Don’t Have Any Rights Here,” directly quotes the words of CBP officials as spoken to a Salvadoran father in California in November 2017 and to a Brazilian mother in Texas in March 2018 as they summarily separated the two parents from their children. 
  
Both of those parents had presented themselves lawfully at official ports of entry and were in possession of documentation proving their relationships to their children. In neither case did the CBP officers give the parents any reason for the separations or a chance to defend their custody of their children. Amnesty International visited and interviewed each of the parents in detention about six weeks after they were separated from their respective children. In both interviews, the parents broke down into tears, revealing the extreme aguish and suffering they experienced because of the lawless conduct of DHS authorities. 
  
Amnesty International interviewed the Brazilian mother, Valquiria, while she was in detention on her 39th birthday on May 10, 2018, three days before Mother’s Day. Nine months later, she remains in detention at the El Paso Processing Center. On March 17, it will be one year since Valquiria was separated from her 8-year-old son, Abel (pseudonym). Abel has stared blankly for months at the door where he lives, waiting for his mother to return. 
  
  
Valquiria is one of thousands of parents who were separated from their children by DHS but whose children were released to sponsors prior to the Ms. L class action lawsuit – thereby excluding her from class membership in the case and confining her to indefinite and arbitrary detention in a detention facility. She never would have been detained there in the first place had DHS followed its binding internal policies and maintained her family’s unity. Valquiria’s case is also emblematic of DHS’s use of family separations to penalize individuals seeking asylum: she was one of countless families separated by authorities after requesting asylum at official ports of entry. 
  
On January 31, 2019, Amnesty International visited Valquiria in detention at the El Paso Processing Center, nearly a year after she was separated from her son. Though she exhibited signs of extreme mental anguish, crying inconsolably during the interview, Valquiria still does not have access to psychological health care in a language she understands. 
  
Based on government filings in the ongoing multistate lawsuit against the Trump administration for its family separations policy, Amnesty International has also found that some of the children separated from their families by DHS under the zero-tolerance policy turned 18 while in ORR custody and thus “aged out” of children’s shelters; they are now being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities. They have yet to be reunited with their families and remain in detention – where they never would have been in the first place had DHS not unlawfully separated their families.

Human Rights Updates 
1) Congress Must Not Fund the President’s Border Wall, Increase Border Militarization or Expand Immigration Detention Beds. With the February 15 deadline fast approaching, Amnesty International USA urges Congress to oppose any policies and practices that block asylum seekers from accessing humanitarian protection at the border, including a proposed border wall, an increase in border militarization and an expansion of immigration detention beds. 
State of the Union (SOTU): Instead of offering a way out of gridlock, the President doubled down on his singular obsession with his border wall. In our response to the SOTU, Amnesty International USA made clear “No wall, no military buildup, no expansion of detention facilities, no pushbacks of people legally seeking asylum at the border. It’s time to come back to human rights and work for policies that treat all people and families with dignity.” 
2) Amnesty International Delegation Documents Effects of Remain in Mexico on Asylum Seekers. In late January, Amnesty International sent a delegation to the southern border to document the effects of the Remain in Mexico deal on asylum seekers. The Remain in Mexico deal violates international law and endangers thousands of families and children seeking protection. Instead of entering the U.S., thousands of asylum seekers are being forced to wait in Mexico while their asylum claims are processed. Mexico is not a safe country for all people seeking protection. Many asylum seekers face exploitation, sexual assault, or murder while being forced to wait for extraordinarily long times in northern Mexico. 
The delegation included the directors of Amnesty International USA, Mexico, Canada, Ireland, Norway and Belgium. They accompanied three LGBT minors to present their asylum claims at the San Ysidro port of entry. Upon approaching the San Ysidro port of entry, the delegation was stopped by Mexican and U.S. authorities who refused to allow the children to proceed any further to present their asylum claims. Amnesty International USA Executive Director Margaret Huang was eventually able to accompany the children to present their asylum claims. To provide a fair asylum process, Congress must press the U.S. government to end Remain in Mexico and ensure that asylum seekers are able to promptly and safely request humanitarian protection in the U.S. without unnecessary delay. 
 
Above: On January 30 an Amnesty International delegation traveled to the San Ysidro port of entry and documented how U.S. border officials are actively discouraging asylum seekers from entering the U.S. 
3) Saudi Arabia and Yemen – Congress Must Halt Weapons Sales to the Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. Coalition. On February 5 Amnesty International USA called on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to address the ongoing war and humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen. The human rights situation in the Arabian Peninsula continues to deteriorate amidst continued crackdowns on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, the arbitrary arrest and detention of human rights activists, the institutionalized inequality of women, and the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Congress must pass The Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2018 and halt any future weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.). In addition, Congress must pass the bipartisan Yemen Refueling Act to stop the U.S. from providing in-flight refueling of Saudi aircraft conducting bombing missions in Yemen. 
4) Nigeria – Congress Must Halt Funding for Security Forces That Fired on Unarmed Demonstrators. On January 17 Amnesty International USA urged Congress to press the State Department to apply the Leahy Law to Nigerian security forces. On October 30 Nigerian security forces open fired on unarmed demonstrators and killed 23 people. The Nigerian military then refuted the number of fatalities and attempted to justify the use of force. Congress must implement the Leahy Law to prohibit any funding from being used for training or equipment of security forces that have committed human rights violations. Congress must ensure that no U.S. assistance directly supports such a gross violation of human rights. 
5) Guantanamo Bay – Amnesty International Calls on Congress to End Indefinite Detention Without Justice. On January 11 Amnesty International and the Congressional Progressive Caucus hosted a panel discussion on the 17th anniversary of the opening of the U.S. detention center at the Guantánamo Bay military base. The panel featured former Guantánamo detainee Mohamedou Slahi who spoke about his treatment and experience as a detainee at Guantánamo. Congress must 1) hold hearings on the status of Guantánamo and why no detainees cleared for release have been transferred since President Trump took office; 2) lift current restrictions on transferring Guantánamo detainees to the U.S., even for trial or medical treatment; and 3) refuse to fund expansion of the prison. 
6) Muslim Ban – Amnesty International USA Marks Two-Year Anniversary of Trump Muslim Ban With Capitol Hill Photo Exhibit of Refugees. On January 28 Amnesty International hosted a photo exhibit on Capitol Hill to mark the two-year anniversary of the Muslim Ban. On display were photos of refugees who were denied resettlement in the U.S. as a direct consequence of the Muslim Ban and are still stuck in refugee camps in the Middle East. Only 15 Syrian refugees have arrived to date in Fiscal Year 2019 compared to 841 Syrians in the last full year of the Obama Administration. Amnesty International USA thanks Representative Lofgren (CA-19) for her support in this project and Representative Chu (CA-27) and Representative Garcia (TX-29) for attending. 
 
Above: On January 28 Representative Judy Chu (CA-27) spoke with Ryan Mace, Amnesty International USA Grassroots and Refugee Specialist, about the two-year anniversary of the Muslim Ban. 
7) Amnesty International Legislative Coordinators Urge Congress to Protect Asylum Seekers at the Southern Border and Halt Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. On January 28 Amnesty International Legislative Coordinators met with several dozen Members of Congress. They urged Congress to oppose the Trump policies that block asylum seekers from accessing humanitarian protection at the U.S.-Mexico border. They also lobbied Congress to end U.S. support of the Saudi Arabia and U.A.E.-coalition’s intervention in Yemen.

TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Head of the Investigation Department, 
I am writing to express my grave concern for the detention of Anastasia Shevchenko, a prominent human rights defender in Rostov-on-Don.  
On 21 January, Anastasia Shevchenko, a Coordinator with the Otkrytaya Rossiya (Open Russia) movement- which promotes human rights, rule of law and government accountability- was arrested and accused of “repeated participation in the activities of an undesirable organization” under article 284.1 of the Russian Criminal Code. On 23 January, Rostov-on-Don’s Leninsky court rejected a bail plea and put her under house arrest pending trial. 
By prosecuting Anastasia Shevchenko for the mere fact of her participation in the peaceful activities of a public association, the Russian authorities are in violation of both their obligations under international human rights law as well as the Russian Constitution which guarantees Anastasia Shevchenko’s right to freedom of expression and association. 
I call on you to use your authority to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of Anastasia Shevchenko from house arrest and an end to her criminal prosecution. 
Yours sincerely,

Your excellency, 
On 9 January 2019, Palestinian social justice activist Suha Jbara was released after spending over two months in arbitrary detention. On 13 December 2018, the Palestinian Attorney General’s office that investigated her allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, concluded that there was no wrongdoing. Based on the information available to Amnesty International, we are concerned that the investigation conducted by the Attorney General’s office was not prompt or effective. In fact, the forensic doctor examined Suha Jbara more than five weeks after she first made her torture allegations. We are also concerned that the investigation may not have been impartial or independent. Suha Jbara faces the possibility of being charged based on information obtained under torture as the prosecutor’s office hasn’t provided any credible evidence against her. Suha Jbara’s next court hearing is on 15 May. 
I urge you to act in accordance with Palestine’s international human rights obligations and order a prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigation into Suha Jbara’s allegations of torture and other ill-treatment in Jericho Detention and Interrogation Center; to ensure that any officials identified as responsible are immediately suspended and subjected to disciplinary and criminal proceedings; and to ensure that any proceedings against her adhere fully to international fair trial standards, including the exclusion of evidence extracted under torture and other ill-treatment.

The poll, which was carried out by Ipsos MORI, found that: 
The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots is a growing global coalition of NGOs, including Amnesty International, that is working to ban fully autonomous weapons. 
“This poll shows that the states blocking a ban on killer robots are totally out of step with public opinion. Governments should be protecting people from the myriad risks that killer robots pose, not rushing into a new arms race which could have terrifying consequences,” said Rasha Abdul Rahim, Acting Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech. 
“We still have time to halt the development and proliferation of fully autonomous weapons, but we won’t have that luxury for long. Governments should take note of this poll and urgently begin negotiating a new treaty to prohibit these horrifying weapons. Only this can help ensure respect for international law and address ethical and security concerns regarding delegating the power to make life-and-death decisions to machines.” 
Amnesty International is calling for a total ban on the development, production and use of fully autonomous weapon systems, in light of the serious human rights, humanitarian and security risks they pose. The use of autonomous weapons without meaningful and effective human control would undermine the right to life and other human rights and create an accountability gap if, once deployed, they are able to make their own determinations about the use of lethal force. 
Currently, 28 states support a ban on fully autonomous weapons. Austria, Brazil, and Chile have formally proposed the urgent negotiation of “a legally-binding instrument to ensure meaningful human control over the critical functions” of weapons systems. 
However, a minority of states at the November 2018 annual meeting of the Convention on Conventional Weapons, used consensus rules to thwart meaningful diplomatic progress. Russia, Israel, South Korea, and the USA indicated at the meeting that they would not support negotiations for a new treaty, but the poll results show that more than half of respondents in Russia (59%) and the USA (52%) oppose autonomous weapons. More than half of respondents opposed autonomous weapons in China (60%), South Korea (74%) and the UK (54%), which are among the leading states developing this technology. 
The survey by Ipsos MORI was commissioned by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and conducted in December 2018. The sample size was 500 – 1,000 people in each country.

Dear Secretary Guevarra: 
I am writing to draw your attention to the plight of the hundreds of workers of Japanese-owned Sumitomo Fruit Corp. (Sumifru). Since 27 November 2018, they have been staying at makeshift camps in Manila to protest the working conditions on Sumifru’s plantations. Workers claim that Sumifru has refused to provide government-mandated wages and other benefits as well as security of tenure, despite a court order in their favor.  
Since declaring a strike on 1 October 2018, the workers have experienced threats and attacks. As a result of the violence, one member, Danny Boy Bautista, was killed on 31 October 2018. Further to the violence, the union office and houses of some of their members were burned down on 15 December 2018. The workers continue to experience threats up to now and remain at risk as they carry out their peaceful protests. 
I urge your office to act swiftly to ensure the workers’ safety. Specifically, I urge you to immediately conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the attacks against workers and the murder of a union member, and bring suspected perpetrators to justice according to international fair trial standards; uphold and protect the safety of workers carrying out their strike, by taking measures to guarantee their right to freedom of expression and assembly.

The High Court of Manipur will hear his challenge to his detention under the NSA on 1 February 2019. 
TAKE ACTION:  
Dear Chief Minister,  
Kishorchandra Wangkhem, a journalist based in Manipur, has been held in administrative detention since 27 November 2018 under the National Security Act (NSA). The detention order against him references his Facebook posts criticizing the government and declares that if he were released he would continue to act in a manner “prejudicial to the security of the state and maintenance of public order”.  
This is not the first time Kishorchandra Wangkhem has been detained for his posts on Facebook. He was arrested on 9 August 2018, for Facebook posts two days prior, where he criticized the state government. He was arrested for the alleged offenses of ‘making statements promoting enmity and ill will’ and ‘defamation’; he was subsequently released on bail. On 20 November 2018, he was arrested for the alleged offence of ‘sedition’, in relation to Facebook videos he posted on 19 November that criticized the Chief Minister of Manipur and the Prime Minister of India. He was released on bail on 26 November, as the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Imphal West, noted that he was merely expressing his opinion. However, he was taken into custody under the NSA the following day.  
I am very concerned that Kishorchandra Wangkhem is being targeted using repressive laws for simply exercising his right to freedom of expression. Many of the laws and criminal provisions that he has been arrested under, such as criminal ‘defamation’, ‘sedition’, and the National Security Act do not meet international standards and have been criticized for being vague, overbroad, and repressive.  
I call on you to Immediately and unconditionally release Kishorchandra Wangkhem from administrative detention and ensure that he is given a fair trial for all pending criminal cases, in accordance with international human rights standards. Pending his release, ensure he is not subjected to torture or other ill-treatment; and end the use of administrative detention and desist from using the criminal provisions of defamation and sedition, against journalists and human rights defenders in Manipur.

0,Greece / EU: Move asylum seekers to safety,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/greece-eu-move-asylum-seekers-to-safety/,"The Greek government and its European Union partners should urgently ensure that all asylum seekers on the Aegean islands are transferred to suitable accommodation on the mainland or relocated to other EU countries as winter approaches, 20 human rights and other organizations said today.","The Greek government and its European Union partners should urgently ensure that all asylum seekers on the Aegean islands are transferred to suitable accommodation on the mainland or relocated to other EU countries as winter approaches, 20 human rights and other organizations said today. 
Despite the Greek government’s recent efforts to transfer asylum seekers from the islands to more suitable accommodation in the mainland, as of December 3, 2018, over 12,500 people were still living in tents and containers unsuitable for winter in five EU-sponsored camps known as hotspots on Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Kos, and Leros – almost triple their capacity. In addition to serious overcrowding, asylum seekers continue facing unsanitary and unhygienic conditions and physical violence, including violence based on gender. 
The lack of basic protection measures leaves women and girls, as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) people, particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault, and afraid to use site facilities including bathrooms and showers. Medical care, trauma counselling, and psychosocial – or mental health – are insufficient, as is legal counselling and support during the different stages of the asylum procedure. Mental health among asylum seekers has deteriorated amid harsh living conditions and emotional distress. 
The humanitarian crisis in the hotspots is the result of Greece’s EU-backed policy of containing asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, until their asylum claims are adjudicated or until it is determined that they fall under one of the “vulnerable” categories listed under Greek law. “Vulnerable” asylum seekers are exempted from the border procedures, and they are allowed to move to the mainland. Greek authorities have periodically accelerated the transfer of “vulnerable” asylum seekers to the mainland but as of late November, an estimated 2,200 people identified as eligible for transfer are still waiting because accommodation facilities on the mainland have similarly become overcrowded during past months, amidst the ongoing lack of an EU-wide responsibility sharing mechanism. Others have fallen through the cracks of lengthy and inefficient vulnerability assessments and are confined to the dire conditions on the islands. 
The containment policy was designed and justified as a means to carry out the March 2016 EU-Turkey deal that would return to Turkey asylum seekers who reached the Greek islands by crossing the sea, for their asylum claim to be processed there. The policy imposes unjustified and unnecessary suffering on asylum seekers, while unduly limiting their rights to have their case examined on its merits – as opposed to its “admissibility” – the organizations said. 
Speeding up returns, a measure foreseen under the deal, would not solve the crisis on the islands. Many of those trapped on the islands are protected against return and could not be sent back to Turkey, other third countries, or their countries of origin under EU law. 
Greece and other EU countries should share responsibility to provide an adequate standard of living for asylum seekers, guaranteeing their subsistence and protecting their physical and mental health throughout a fair and efficient asylum procedure. A recent pledge to move 6,000 asylum seekers to the mainland to provide them with an adequate standard of living is a first step, albeit not one that can ensure sustainability in the long-term. 
Greece, with the support of EU institutions and countries, should end its inhumane containment policy and facilitate the transfer of asylum seekers from the Aegean islands. Special care should be given to the needs of children, women survivors of violence, pregnant women and new mothers, and LGBT+ people, among other groups. 
European governments should be ready promptly to relocate asylum seekers from Greece and ensure their access to adequate living conditions while their asylum applications are being processed. Portugal’s recent agreement to transfer 100 asylum seekers and potentially up to 1,000 through 2019 is a positive step that other EU countries should follow. 
EU governments should follow the lead of the European Parliament in reaching an agreement on a functioning and fairer EU asylum system, which supports Member States, including through a mandatory distribution mechanism; protects people in need; and enables families to reunite in the EU.

We seek to highlight accessibility, activism, and advocacy. This includes making the festival as accessible to as many members of our Greater Portland LGBTQ+ community as possible. The wide array of participating organizations and business makes for a veritable resource fair, accompanied by inspiration and entertainment on stage. There will be an area specially catering to families with young children, and the whole park is an alcohol- and tobacco-free environment. Food will be available for purchase, with some seating nearby, along with lawn seating. Bathrooms, including 3 fully accessible ones, will be onsite. Shuttles to off-site parking may also be available.

0,Saudi Arabia: International community cannot afford to remain silent about detained women’s rights activists,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/saudi-arabia-international-community-cannot-afford-to-remain-silent-about-detained-womens-rights-activists/,The international community and allies of the Saudi Arabian government must speak up to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of the women’s rights defenders currently detained in Saudi … ,"The international community and allies of the Saudi Arabian government must speak up to help secure the immediate and unconditional release of the women’s rights defenders currently detained in Saudi Arabia, Amnesty International said today. 
More than two weeks have now passed since a number of prominent women’s rights activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Youssef were arrested, and yet they remain detained without charge and incommunicado with no access to their families or lawyers. 
Yesterday, the European Parliament issued a resolution calling for their unconditional release and that of all human rights defenders. It also called for a more vocal European response. 
“The Saudi Arabian authorities’ endless harassment of women’s rights activists is entirely unjustifiable, and the world must not remain silent on the repression of human rights defenders in the country”, said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Campaigns. 
“The strong message sent by the European Parliament should be a catalyst for the EU’s Diplomatic Chief Federica Mogherini and EU member states to step up pressure on the Saudi Arabian authorities, and should also prompt others to follow suit. 
“Saudi Arabia’s allies – in particular the U.S., UK and France – must push Saudi Arabian authorities to end their targeted repression of human rights activists in the country. 
“European and world leaders must not stay silent in the face of gross and systematic violations of the human rights of activists and human rights defenders.” 
Amnesty International continues to document patterns of systematic repression by the Saudi Arabian authorities in which they have silenced virtually all independent human rights defenders and critics, sentencing most to lengthy prison terms and forcing some to flee the country. 
The country’s 2014 counter-terror law and its follow-up decrees have been used to prosecute human rights defenders and activists on vague and overly broad charges for their peaceful activism. The Specialized Criminal Court, a court set up to deal with security and terrorism-related offences, has sentenced several human rights defenders to up to 15 years in prison in blatantly unfair trials. 
Background 
To date, it is believed that 10 human rights activists have been detained in the recent crackdown. The authorities have not disclosed the whereabouts of the activists and no clear legal charges have been presented to them. Four have so far been released, though the conditions of their release remain unknown. 
Many of the women’s rights defenders detained have campaigned against the long-standing ban on women drivers in Saudi Arabia. The ban is due to be lifted next month, with licenses being issued from 24 June. 
Amnesty International identified six of those detained and called for their release following a chilling smear campaign orchestrated by the government to discredit them as “traitors”. 
Those still in detention include Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Dr. Ibrahim al-Modeimigh, Mohammad al-Rabea and Mohammed al-Bajadi. Two other men also reportedly remain in detention. 
Activists detained in the recent crackdown, but released last week, include Dr. Aisha al-Manea, Dr. Hessa al-Sheikh, Dr. Madeha al-Ajroush and Walaa’ al-Shubbar.",,"June 1, 2018 • Press Release",False

“Do not remain silent”: Survivors of Sexual violence in South Sudan call for justice and reparations, reveals aggravated acts of sexual violence against thousands of people across the country since hostilities began in December 2013. The report is the result of a joint research project between Amnesty International and 10 South Sudanese human rights defenders who cannot be named due to fear of reprisals from the government of South Sudan. 
Perpetrators come from both sides of the conflict, pitting the government forces of President Salva Kiir — a Dinka — against opposition forces of Riek Machar — a Nuer — and their respective allied armed groups. 
“This is pre-meditated sexual violence on a massive scale. Women have been gang-raped, sexually assaulted with sticks and mutilated with knives,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes. 
“These indefensible acts have left the victims with debilitating and life-changing consequences, including physical injuries and psychological distress. Many survivors have also been shunned by their husbands and in-laws and stigmatized by the wider community.” 
Amnesty International’s researchers interviewed 168 victims of sexual violence in cities, towns and villages across four states in South Sudan – Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Upper Nile and Unity – as well as in three refugee settlements in northern Uganda. 
In some cases, the attackers killed the women after they had raped them. In one incident, the assailants mutilated a woman’s vagina with a knife after raping her because she had tried to resist. She died from her injuries four days later. 
Civilian men have also been attacked. Some have been raped, others castrated or had their testicles pierced with needles. In one particularly gruesome case, four government soldiers inserted grass in a young man’s anal passage, set it on fire and watched him burn to death. 
One survivor, Gatluok, who could not escape with others when government soldiers raided his village in Unity State in May 2015 told Amnesty International: 
“Because of my blindness, I couldn’t run with the young men and so I was caught. They told me to choose if I wanted to be raped or be killed. I said I didn’t want to be killed and so they decided to rape me.” 
“Some of the attacks appear designed to terrorize, degrade and shame the victims, and in some cases, to stop men from rival political groups from procreating,” said Wanyeki. 
Unending suffering 
One of the women Amnesty International spoke to is now HIV+. Others are suffering from fistula and bowel incontinence. Some men have been rendered impotent. 
Many victims said they were experiencing nightmares, loss of memory, lack of concentration, and had thought of revenge or suicide – all common symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. 
Jokudu, a 19-year-old woman, was brutally raped by five government soldiers near Yei town in December 2016. She is now unable to control her urine and bleeds frequently. 
Nyabake, 24, was gang-raped by government soldiers at a checkpoint in Juba in July 2016. She said she can no longer sleep for more than three hours a night because of nightmares. She said she always feels the soldiers are coming back. 
Sukeji was gang-raped by three government soldiers in Kajo Keji in August 2016 in front of her two children. She said, “I do not want to remember but sometimes it just comes in my mind and I cry. Sometimes I wonder whether my children have this in their memory. When they grow up, what will they think of their mother?” 
Nyagai, who was gang-raped by government soldiers in Juba in July 2016, lost her religious faith after her assault. She said she stopped going to church after she was raped and does not pray anymore. “Satan went through me the day I was raped,” she said. 
Jacob, whose wife Aluel, was raped in front of him by fighters of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement – In Opposition (SPLM-IO) – in Juba in July 2016, says he has contemplated suicide. 
“The South Sudanese government must take deliberate measures to halt this epidemic of sexual violence, starting by sending a clear message of zero tolerance, immediately ordering an independent and effective investigation into the attacks that have taken place and ensuring that those responsible are held to account in fair trials,” said Wanyeki. 
“It must also deter sexual violence, including through removing suspects from the armed forces until allegations against them are independently verified or dismissed. Victims must be provided with justice, medical care and reparations,” 
“Opposition forces must prohibit sexual violence in their ranks as well, put in place robust mechanisms to monitor the conduct of their fighters, and cooperate with all investigations and prosecutions of their members under international law.” 
Politically and ethnically targeted 
Many of the victims were targeted because of their ethnicity, which is increasingly conflated with political allegiance to either the government or the opposition. 
In most cases Amnesty International documented, Dinka men attacked Nuer women and Nuer men attacked Dinka women. But there are also cases, as in Unity State, where pro-government Nuer men have raped Nuer women they consider pro-opposition. In other cases, government forces have targeted women from non-Nuer communities. 
“They [government soldiers] were telling me that I should blame God for creating me a Nuer,” said 36-year-old Nyachah, who was raped by seven government soldiers in the capital Juba. Her attackers were dressed in Presidential Guard uniforms and spoke Dinka. 
Nyaluit, who was raped by five government soldiers in December 2013 said: “They raped me because I am a Nuer woman… They were talking about what happened in Bor – that Dinka women and girls were raped and killed by Riek Machar’s ethnic group, the Nuer.” 
James, a Dinka, was forced to watch as nine Nuer opposition fighters broke into his home and took turns gang-raping his wife, Acham, before killing her. “Don’t you know that Dinka and Nuer are fighting and that many Nuer were killed by Dinka in Juba?” the attackers told him.

We encourage our diverse community to join us in peacefully opposing the efforts being made by the current administration to persecute and to discriminate against LGBTQ+ individuals. 
We will join the Equality March and sister events across the country to give voice to our concerns, and to support, uplift, and bring attention to those in our communities who are targeted due to
immigration status, ethnicity, religion, skin color, gender, and disability. 
Due to the extremely warm climate in Arizona in June, and for the safety of our community, the rally will be held at 7:00 p.m. at Heritage Square Park. 
Now more than ever we must let our voices be heard as we stand up for inalienable human rights and stand proud with our brothers and sisters!

0,Australian Refugee Processing Centers Aren’t ‘Border Control’ — They’re Torture,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/australian-refugee-processing-centers-arent-border-control-theyre-torture/,Australia is holding refugees and asylum seekers in torture-like conditions in Nauru,"&nbsp; 
 
In the last few months, the tiny pacific island nation of Nauru has exploded back onto the international news circuit. This time, it isn’t for the lucrative strip mining of fossilized bird droppings, it’s news of the Australian Government using the island as a detention center for intercepted refugees and asylum seekers attempting to reach Australia and New Zealand by boat. 
On Monday, Amnesty International released our report, “Island of Despair, Australia’s “Processing” of Refugees on Nauru,” which  highlights the human rights abuses, poor conditions, and abhorrent indignities refugees and asylum seekers are subject to in Australian so-called “Refugee Processing Centers” on Nauru.  Refugees and asylum seekers who journey to Australia by boat have been forcibly transferred, by the Australian government, to the remote country of Nauru or Manus Island in Papua New Guinea.  (In November 2013, Amnesty investigators visited Manus Island.)  The government claims that the policy protects people who might otherwise undertake the hazardous boat crossing to Australia. 
The Australian government has set up the Refugee Processing Centers to deliberately inflict cruelty and abuse on thousands of people in order to deter asylum seekers who are simply looking for a safe place to rebuild their lives.  These centers in no way fulfill the Australian government’s obligations under international law to protect refugees and asylum seekers. This is ironic given the Australian government’s current bid for UN Human Rights Council. 
Many refugees and asylum seekers have been detained for months and even years in these Refugee Processing Centers. This detainment has led to severe mental health issues, suicide, and self-harm. Guards have written discriminatory messages on Facebook about refugees and asylum seekers and physically abused them. They have been arbitrarily denied basic necessities such as hygiene products and underwear. Even those who have actually been granted refugee status have still not been allowed to resettle in Australia. People’s deeply felt hopelessness of their situation, as well as a litany of human rights abuses, has led to severe mental suffering. 
“Edris,” an Iraqi man who is detained in Nauru with his two custodial nephews, told an Amnesty Researcher, “I am so tired; at night, I just start crying. But I am trying to not show weakness to my nephews. I wish I could kill myself, but because of them I cannot. That’s not what I came here for. I cannot go back. But here I am dying a thousand times. In Iraq, you get just one bullet or a bomb, and it’s over, and here I am slowly dying from the pain”. 
While the center is not physically enclosed–detained refugees and asylum seekers are allowed to traverse the 21-square kilometer island–Nauru is incredibly physically isolated. Nauru is a country of 10,000 people, so the 1000+ detained refugees and asylum seekers are 10% of the population, which has inspired tensions between the Nauruans and the detained refugees and asylum seekers. Refugees and asylum seekers risk their lives when they board overcrowded boats and seek out safety on Australia’s shores. Where they thought they would find safety, they are instead detained in these open-air prisons.  
The Australian government is directly responsible for a system that inflicts severe mental suffering, and the fact that the goal of offshore processing is intended to intimidate or coerce others to achieve a specific outcome means that Australia’s offshore “processing” regime fits the definition of torture under international law.  It set up the system of offshore processing, pays for it, forcibly takes people to Nauru, and leaves them there with no future or hope.    
The Australian government largely views the processing centers as a success.  The government rejects assertions that its treatment of refugees and asylum seekers amounts to torture. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in a recent radio interview, “The Australian Government’s commitment [to the camps] is compassionate and strong.” 
Australia must stop the deliberate abuse and intimidation of over 2000 people in Nauru and Manus. Join us in our calls to the Australian Government to: 
-Close their regional processing centers in Nauru and Manus 
-Bring all asylum seekers to Australia immediately 
-Assess the international protection applications of detained refugees and asylum seekers in a fair and timely manner 
-Ensure that all those granted refugee status on Nauru are allowed to resettle in Australia 
We cannot let Australia’s appalling tactics set a precedent for future treatment of refugees and asylum seekers.  We must take action to ensure that people escaping violence and persecution aren’t subjected to more violence and abuses from those who should be reaching out in support.",,"October 24, 2016 • Post",False
0,Why we’re still fighting on September 28th—the Global Day of Action to Decriminalize Abortion,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/why-were-still-fighting-on-september-28th-the-global-day-of-action-to-decriminalize-abortion/,"Three years on, our work on sexual and reproductive rights remains as important as ever. Here’s why we’re still fighting.","&nbsp; 
By Kaitlyn Denzler, Women’s Rights Campaigner  
Over two and a half years ago, Amnesty International launched the My Body, My Rights (MBMR) Campaign, a global effort to end the control and criminalization of sexuality and reproduction, and to help everyone know and claim their sexual and reproductive rights. Three years on, our work on sexual and reproductive rights remains as important as ever.  Here’s why we’re still fighting: 
1) Ireland: Ireland has a near-total abortion ban, which means that abortion is only allowed if the life of the pregnant person is at risk. It also means that people are forced to make very difficult, if not impossible, decisions: leave Ireland—if that’s even an option—to obtain a safe and legal abortion, carry an unwanted or potentially deadly pregnancy to term, or seek out clandestine and often unsafe services and risk breaking the law. 
This law violates human rights standards that demand—at a minimum—that abortion is allowed in cases of rape, incest, if the life or health of the pregnant person is at risk, or when there is severe or fatal fetal impairment. It also violates human rights standards of equal access to rights, as it disproportionately affects poorer women who can’t afford to travel (which they shouldn’t have to do in the first place). 
In Ireland and other cities across the world, communities have been hitting the streets demanding a change to Ireland’s restrictive and harmful abortion laws. Activists have been calling for a referendum to repeal the laws, including the Eighth Amendment that protects the fetus’ right to life on an equal footing with the pregnant person’s. The Prime Minister will hold a citizen’s assembly next month to discuss whether a referendum should take place. During these discussions, it’s crucial that we continue to stand in solidarity with activists in Ireland and across the world, rallying behind #repealtheeighth, and putting pressure on the Irish government.   
2) El Salvador: Many of you have already helped us achieve huge victories on behalf of the “Las 17” (the group of women in prison on pregnancy-related charges), with the release of women like Maria Teresa Rivera, imprisoned for miscarrying. But there are more people still behind bars with similar stories and backgrounds—women who come from poor, marginalized communities without access to strong legal representation. 
Unfortunately, it might get worse. In July, a group of parliamentarians from the opposition party in El Salvador, ARENA, proposed an increase in jail terms to up to 50 years for women accused of having an abortion. In response to the proposal, activists have been protesting and are not backing down. We cannot forget the women who are still in prison, and we must not stop supporting the activists fighting against these draconian, harmful laws. 
3) Poland: The government of Poland is also putting the lives and health of women and girls at risk by restricting abortion access. Last week, Poland’s parliament passed forward a near-total abortion ban, that would also criminalize abortion, making the pregnant person and healthcare professionals liable to a prison term of between three months to five years. Under the bill, inadvertently causing the death of the ‘conceived child’ also carries a prison term for the health professional. 
Just like in Ireland, laws like this create a “chilling effect” which prevent pregnant people from seeking services even if their health is at risk, and it can prevent healthcare professionals from providing life-saving services to their patient. 
In response to these parliamentary discussions and decisions, thousands of people in Poland and other cities across the world have been protesting. Some have been posting selfies wearing black, the color of mourning in Poland, as part of the ‘black protest’ (#CzarnyProtest) online. And more protests are planned for October 1st. 
4) The United States. Here at home we’ve been witness to public figures oscillating on their calls for stricter abortion laws, even calling for a total abortion ban and punitive consequences. We’ve seen states try to close health clinics that offer abortion care.  And we’ve seen the first case in the U.S. where a woman from Indiana was sentenced to 20 years in prison after being convicted of feticide (or illegally inducing her own abortion) and child neglect.[1]  Such proposals and cases defy human rights standards and put the lives of millions of women and girls at risk. 
The realities in Ireland, El Salvador, Poland, and the U.S. are, unfortunately, only a few of many examples across the world where denial of abortion access and increased control over people’s bodies have far-reaching and dire consequences, especially on low-income, marginalized communities. They go against international human rights standards, and they leave people with very stark choices, or no choice at all. This is why we are still working and why we need your support! 
Despite the harsh reality for women and girls, activists all around the world are rallying for their rights— and you can join them, not only by supporting protests in Ireland, Poland, and El Salvador, but by knowing and claiming your rights!  Download our Fall 2016 My Body, My Rights Toolkit, where you’ll learn more about sexual and reproductive rights and how to connect with AIUSA’s Sexual and Reproductive Rights Advocate Trainers—volunteer youth leaders responsible for human rights education activities in their regions.

Omani prisoner of conscience Saeed Jaddad was released from prison on 26 August, having served nine months of a one-year prison sentence under Oman’s cybercrimes law for a blog he wrote in October 2014. 

Saeed Jaddad, an Omani businessman and human rights activist, aged 50, was released on 26 August from Arzat Prison, west of Dhofar province’s capital, Salalah. He had served three quarters of a one-year prison sentence issued following his conviction on charges of “inciting to break national unity and spreading discord within society” in relation to a blog he wrote in October 2014 in which he compared the 2011 protests in Dhofar province to the 2014 protests in Hong Kong. Under Article 76 of the Omani Penal Code a sentence can be suspended if the prisoner is judged to have reformed and has served three quarters of their sentence. 
  
Saeed Jaddad was arrested at his home on 10 December 2014 in relation to the October 2014 blog and officials searched his home and confiscated his phone and computers. He was held and interrogated for at least five days without being allowed to contact his family or a lawyer. His interrogators put pressure on him to sign documents that accused him of crimes including “harming the country and violating its laws” and “contacting foreign bodies”. He refused to do this or answer questions subsequently put to him by a prosecutor without a lawyer present and his detention was extended. He was released on bail on 22 December 2014. The first hearing of this case took place in his absence in Salalah on 27 January 2015. Saeed Jaddad was sentenced on 31 March 2015 to one year in prison and a fine of 1,000 Omani rials (about US$2,600) by a court of first instance in Salalah. The Appeal Court upheld the sentence on 18 November. He was arrested a week later, on 25 November, to serve his sentence and transferred to prison, after a raid on his home at 1am that same day. 
  
Saeed Jaddad had previously been arrested several times. He was arrested on 14 January 2013 and held for six months, including eight days in solitary confinement. He was released at the end of June 2013 but banned from publishing articles in the national media. He refused to sign a statement renouncing pro-reform and human rights activities, after facing pressure from the authorities to do so. In August that year he was charged with “undermining the status and prestige of the state” after he called for political and social reforms and held meetings with members of the European Parliament. He was arrested at his home in Salalah on 21 January 2015 to face trial on these charges. A court of first instance in the capital, Muscat, sentenced him on 8 March to three years in prison and a fine for “undermining the prestige of the state”; one year in prison and a fine for “incitement to protest”; and three years in prison and a fine for “using social media to disseminate information that infringed on the sanctity of public order”. The court ordered that Saeed Jaddad should serve the three sentences concurrently and pay the combined fine of 1,700 Omani rials (US$4,415). He was released on bail on 7 April and his appeal began on 15 April. On 9 September 2015 the Appeal Court in Muscat upheld his sentence of three years in prison, suspended for three years, and a fine. 
  
Information about trials in Oman has been increasingly difficult to obtain since 2015. The authorities have further tightened their grip on freedom of expression and exerted more pressure on activists to give up their work.

One year ago today, the initial arrests were made of a group of activists in Angola’s capital of Luanda. Dubbed the #Angola17, their crime was meeting to read a book and discuss non-violent methods to promote political change, primarily how to urge the government to expand civil and human rights. However, the Angolan government saw this as a threat, prosecuted them and convicted them to prison sentences ranging from 2 to 8 years. 
Amnesty considers the #Angola17 to be Prisoners of Conscience and today, we not only stand with them on the anniversary of their arrest, we stand with all Angolans who are uniting for a movement called Liberation Day. On this day, Angolans are demanding not only the release of the #Angola17, they demand an end to all politicized trials designed to silence activists. They demand respect for freedom of expression and assembly-the right to gather in public and express their ideas without being beaten or even killed by government forces. They demand an end to corruption and human rights abuses committed by the Angolan government. They demand their voices be heard. 
What can YOU do? Join us. Sign our petition demanding freedom for the #Angola17. Post a picture to social media wearing white with the hashtags #Angola17 and #LiberdadeJa. But most importantly, call the Angolan embassy in Washington DC and tell them you stand with all Angolans in demanding the freedom of all political prisoners and an end to corruption and human rights abuses. The embassy can be reached at +1-202-785-1156. People are organizing events all over the world today to stand in solidarity with Angolans demanding freedom and basic rights.

0,Worldwide Activism Brings Justice for Maria Teresa Rivera!,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/worldwide-activism-brings-justice-for-maria-teresa-rivera/,"On Friday, May 20, a Salvadoran Court held a resentencing hearing for Maria Teresa Rivera, a woman who was serving a 40-year prison term for allegedly killing her newborn child.","“Today, we celebrate Teresa’s freedom, her joy, and her tears upon reuniting with her ten-year-old son. This is the result of the actions in solidarity taken by thousands of people and various organizations in El Salvador and other countries.”
–The Citizens’ Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion in El Salvador 
On Friday, May 20, a Salvadoran Court held a resentencing hearing for Maria Teresa Rivera, a woman who was serving a 40-year prison term for allegedly killing her newborn child. Amnesty International, along with many organizations around the world, argued that the evidence against her did not prove that she was guilty and that she had been convicted as the result of the Salvadoran authorities zeal to prosecute women suspected of having an abortion—including poor women who suffered still births or miscarriages. Furthermore, these women did not receive fair trials because of their lack of economic resources. 
That morning, a Salvadoran newspaper reported that the Attorney General of the Republic not only continued to insist on Maria Teresa’s guilt—he was adamantly against any reduction of her sentence.  
In this context, the best outcome that I thought possible was for Maria Teresa’s sentence to be reduced to time served. I was therefore overjoyed to find out that the judge ruled that the evidence in the case did not support her conviction. After five years of hardship for Maria Teresa and her family, justice has finally been served! As the Citizens’ Group stated, this outcome was the result of the actions taken by thousands of people around the world. 
In reaction to the judge’s decision, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International, said that Maria Teresa’s “release must be a catalyst for change in El Salvador, where dozens of women are put in prison because of an utterly ridiculous anti-abortion law which does nothing but put the lives of thousands of women and girls in danger.” 
One such woman is Teodora del Carmen Vásquez, who was a focus case for Amnesty International’s 2015 Write for Rights campaign. After Teodora called for medical help because she felt severe pain, she went into labor and lost consciousness. When she woke up, she was bleeding heavily and her baby was dead and she was arrested for murder. In 2008, she was sentenced to 30 years in prison for “aggravated homicide” following a trial that Amnesty International has determined was unfair. 
Please urge El Salvador’s Minister of Justice to Call on the Minister of Justice to release Teodora, and immediately and impartially review the sentences of all women still in jail for pregnancy-related issues:

President Obama’s historic trip to Cuba in March marked a key turning point in U.S.-Cuba diplomatic relations. The president’s visit follows a series of efforts made by the Clinton and Obama Administrations to remove sanctions against Cuba. Although strides have been made to strengthen diplomatic relations, the economic embargo against Cuba still stands and continues to undermine human rights in Cuba. 
Amnesty International has for decades called on U.S. leaders to lift the U.S. embargo.  The organization has emphasized the negative impact of the trade and financial sanctions on the provision of health care in Cuba. The embargo has undermined human rights in Cuba, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, preventing ordinary Cubans from accessing medicines and other basic commodities. 
Additionally, the Cuban government has used the U.S. sanctions as an excuse to impose severe restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, and movement. Thousands of cases of harassment of government critics, including journalists and human rights activists, and arbitrary arrests and detentions were reported last year. In November 2015 alone, there were over 1,400 politically motivated detentions in Cuba, the highest number in years. 
Amnesty International USA board members recently sent a letter to Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot L. Engel of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs expressing their concern regarding the negative impact of the U.S. embargo, and noting the importance of strengthening ties in order to open the door to greater scrutiny and transparency, so that eventually, independent organizations such as Amnesty International can access the country for human rights monitoring. The letter called on the Members to exercise their leadership to ensure the embargo against Cuba is lifted during this Congressional session. 
There are currently several bipartisan bills in Congress, including H.R.664/S.299 The Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2015. If passed, these bills would help lift the U.S. embargo against Cuba, allow U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba, and help advance respect for human rights in Cuba.

Yet in America, guns kill more than 30,000 men, women and children every single year.

But the U.S. has a patchwork of inconsistent and inadequate federal and state gun control laws and has failed to take all measures necessary to prevent gun violence.

The protection of refugees and migrants and policies that prioritize human rights must be top of the agenda at the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the Bali Process (March 22-23), Amnesty International said. 
“The safety of refugees and migrants must be an absolute priority at this high level meeting of the Bali Process. In 2015 alone hundreds of people died taking dangerous and irregular maritime routes across South East Asian waters. Many of the people on the move in this region are fleeing persecution and it is appalling that they are risking further abuse or death in order to reach safety,” said Champa Patel, Amnesty International’s Interim Director for South East Asia and the Pacific. 
“Last year’s push-back of boats in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea illustrated the disastrous consequences of ignoring the plight of people who resorted to dangerous routes to escape serious threats to their lives. Governments have not lived up to their obligations to respect, promote and protectthe rights of refugees and migrants.” 
The Bali Process is an international forum whose objectives are to facilitate discussion and information sharing about issues relating to people smuggling, human trafficking and related transnational crime. It is co-chaired by Australia and Indonesia. 
In 2015 alone, the UN Refugee Agency estimated that at least 33,600 refugees and migrants travelled through South East Asia in mixed maritime movements. The refugee crisis that erupted in Southeast Asia in May last year saw thousands of people from Myanmar and Bangladesh stranded in rickety boats, pushed back from safety on shore, trafficked into forced labour, or killed at sea. The absence of legal frameworks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand has meant that those who do reach land safely have minimal protection and are frequently subject to arrests and detention. 
“Regional cooperation is vital in addressing these matters and Member States must strengthen the ways they work together, including in developing effective search and rescue operations, and creating safe and legal pathways for refugees and migrants in order to avert further disasters at sea,” said Champa Patel. 
Amnesty International also stressed that without a change in the circumstances that lead to forced and irregular movement, the safety and protection of refugees and migrants cannot be guaranteed. 
Effective regional cooperation requires meeting the temporary needs of refugees and asylum seekers, allocating responsibility, and finding solutions for people who are found to be in need of international protection.

On March 15th, the International Day against Police Brutality will again remind the world of the lives lost and communities changed forever due to the unlawful use of deadly force by police. 
Last year, we released our “Deadly Force” report, highlighting the increasing number of individuals killed by police in the United States. One of the most disturbing findings of the report, noted that all 50 states and Washington, D.C. fail to comply with international law and standards on the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers, and with more than 16,000 police departments across the country, the lack of consistency is evident.  
While the United States lacks a proper method of tracking deaths by police, over the last year a number of media sources have documented hundreds of deaths. 
 
The Guardian created a comprehensive online database of the US police killing, showing that the US police kills more people in just a few days than some countries do in years. 
This is not just a problem in the United States. All around the world, more cases are coming to light of men, women and children killed at of the hands of police. More often than not, these victims represent the most marginalized sections of our society. Amnesty’s recent State of the World Report 2015-2016 lists additional countries who face similar challenges with police use of deadly force, including: 
Under international law, all people have the rights to due process, to equality before the law and to peacefully protest, all of which are in jeopardy because of the continuous lack of recourse by local governments to ensure police are not placing people’s lives in danger. The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials set out strict human rights safeguards for the use of force. These standards provide that law enforcement should only use force as a last resort and that the amount of force used must be proportionate to the threat encountered and designed to minimize damage and injury. 
 
As the death toll continues to grow, there is reason for concern, and the need for all countries to review and revise their use of lethal force statutes to conform with international standards is more urgent than ever. In solidarity we ask you to stand with us, to demand that governments live up to their obligations to ensure that everyone’s human rights are protected, especially and including by those whose mission is to “serve and protect”.",,"March 15, 2016 • Post",False

The organization’s researchers recently visited the grounds of the Comboni Catholic Church where the October 2015 killings took place. They also visited the site, about one kilometer from Leer town, where the bodies were dumped. They found the remains of many broken skeletons still strewn across the ground.The findings are contained in a new briefing South Sudan: ‘Their Voices Stopped’: Mass Killing in a Shipping Container in Leer. 
“The arbitrary arrest, torture, and mass killing of these detainees is just one illustration of the South Sudanese government’s absolute disregard for the laws of war. Unlawful confinement, torture, willfully causing great suffering, and willfully killing are all war crimes,” said Lama Fakih, Senior Crisis Advisor at Amnesty International. 
The researchers interviewed more than 42 witnesses, including 23 people who said they saw the men and boys being forced into a shipping container and later saw their dead bodies either being removed or at a mass burial site. 
According to witnesses, between 20 and 23 October 2015, government soldiers arbitrarily arrested dozens of men and boys in Luale village and Leer town. They then forced them, with their hands tied behind their backs, into one or more shipping containers located at the Comboni Catholic Church. 
Witnesses described hearing the detainees crying and screaming in distress and banging on the wallsof the shipping container, which they said had no windows or other form of ventilation. They said that civilian and military officials had direct knowledge that the detainees were in distress and dying but did nothing to help them. For example, one witness said that she saw the then area commander order soldiers to open the container and remove the bodies of four dead men and then close the container again on the remaining detainees who were still alive inside. 
By the following morning, all but one of the remaining detainees had died. One witness told Amnesty International researchers: 
“We could see the people inside and they were not alive….what we saw was tragic…the container was full of people. They had fallen over one another and on to the floor. There were so many people.” 
Following their death, government soldiers loaded dozens of bodies into a truck and dumped them in two open pits in Kulier, Juong payam, approximately 1km northeast of Leer town. Family members who visited the area in the following days said the bodies, left in the open, had been eaten by animals and had started to decompose. 
Despite evidence of war crimes no steps have been taken to hold perpetrators to account or to provide reparations, including compensation to relatives of the deceased for the loss of their loved ones. 
“Dozens of people suffered a slow and agonizing death at the hands of government forces that should have been protecting them. These unlawful killings must be investigated and all those responsible brought to justice in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty,” said Lama Fakih. 
“In order for effective prosecutions to take place, the African Union Commission should immediately take steps to set up the hybrid criminal court provided for in the August 2015 peace agreement, and ensure that it immediately opens investigations into crimes under international law, including into this atrocity.” 
Background 
In August 2015, after more than 20 months of intermittent negotiations, South Sudan’s warring parties finally agreed to the terms of a peace agreement. The agreement provided a framework for parties to end hostilities and addressed a wide range of issues including: power sharing, security arrangements, humanitarian assistance, economic arrangements, justice and reconciliation and for a process to develop a permanent constitution. 
Despite the peace agreement and commitments by parties to the conflict to a permanent ceasefire, fighting continued in Unity state through mid-December 2015. The power-sharing government has not yet been formed. 
The August 2015 peace agreement provides for the establishment of a Hybrid Court for South Sudan (HCSS) by the African Union Commission, with the mandate to investigate and prosecute genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the conflict. This court has not yet been established. 
The killing of approximately 60 men and boys in a shipping container in Leer was first revealed by the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM), the body responsible for reporting on the implementation of the permanent ceasefire. The CTSAMM report recommended “that some sort of commission of enquiry is established to fully investigate the incident.” 
At the time killings took place, the Comboni Catholic Church compound had been taken over by government forces. 
Relatives of the dead told Amnesty International that the victims were cattle keepers, traders and students, not fighters.

Alagie Abdoulie Ceesay, the managing director of the independent radio station Teranga FM, has been charged with sedition and “publication of false news.”  He has been hospitalized twice since the beginning of 2016. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called on Gambia last week to release Ceesay and drop all charges against him. 
“The use of archaic sedition laws to harass and lock up critics is a serious violation of the right to freedom of expression,” said Stephen Cockburn, Amnesty International deputy regional director for West and Central Africa.  
“Alagie Ceesay’s case is a further example of Gambia’s blatant disregard for freedom of the press, and he should be released immediately and unconditionally.” 
Ceesay was arrested on July 2 by the National Intelligence Agency after he privately shared by phone a picture in which a gun was pointed toward a photograph of President Yahya Jammeh. The image had been circulating on the internet, and Ceesay was not its author. His radio station, Teranga FM, had been closed down several times over the past years. 
During his detention Alagie Ceesay has been held ‘incommunicado’ for two periods by members of the Gambian security forces. Ceesay was held in an unknown location from July 2 to July 13, then released. 
He was rearrested on July 17 and detained at the National Intelligence Agency headquarters, which is not an official place of detention, without access to a lawyer or his family. He was taken before the High Court on August 25 and charged with six counts of sedition under Section 52 of the Gambian Criminal Code and publication of false news with intent to cause fear and alarm among the public. He is currently held at Mile 2 prison on the outskirts of the capital, Banjul. In February this year, he was denied bail for the fourth time. 
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention released an opinion last week, adopted during its last session, in December 2015, that Ceesay had been arbitrarily deprived of liberty. It said he should be released immediately and given an enforceable right to compensation. It also said the government should ensure that freedom of opinion and expression is better protected and called for an investigation into allegations that Ceesay has been tortured. 
Ceesay’s health has been deteriorating since the beginning of 2016. On January 13, he was hospitalized after complaining for over a month about stomach pains and difficulties sleeping. A doctor diagnosed him with an enlarged liver and prescribed pain medication. On February 29, he was readmitted to the same hospital for an asthma attack and returned to prison on March 1. 
“Alhagie Ceesay shouldn’t have been locked up in the first place,” said Corinne Dufka, West Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The deterioration in his health only underscores the urgent need to release him.” 
Gambia should amend several draconian laws that give authorities sweeping powers to arrest and detain critics and violate international and regional standards on the right to freedom of expression, the organizations said. These include the law on seditious publication, the Information and Communication (Amendment) Act 2013 and the Criminal Code (Amendment) Act 2013. 
In April 2015, Gambia rejected 78 of the 171 recommendations at the universal periodic review of human rights conditions in the country by the United Nations. The recommendations it rejected included removing restrictions on freedom of expression. 
Gambia has not implemented the judgments of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice in three cases related to journalists: the enforced disappearance of Ebrima Manneh in 2010; the torture of Musa Saidykhan in 2010; and the unlawful killing of the president of the Gambia Press Union Deyda Hydara,in 2014. 
“Gambia’s catch-all laws on sedition and publication of false news are nothing but an instrument of censorship and should be repealed,” said CPJ Deputy Executive Director Robert Mahoney. “Media freedoms and freedom of expression more broadly have been systematically eroded through repressive legislation, intimidation and the imprisonment of independent journalists. Alagie Abdoulie Ceesay is a victim of this crackdown and must be released from prison immediately.”

The persistent preoccupation with shipping people back to Turkey instead of making unconditional efforts on resettlement and offering other safe and legal ways to Europe shows an alarmingly short-sighted and inhumane attitude to handling this crisis, said Amnesty International after European Council talks with Turkey today. 
Prime Minister of Turkey Ahmet Davutoğlu, President of the European Council Donald Tusk and President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker shared the outline of the plan for a final agreement between the EU and Turkey, in advance of the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 March.  
The proposal that for every Syrian refugee returned to Turkey from Greece, a Syrian will be settled within the EU is wrought with moral and legal flaws. Unsettlingly, this plan would make every resettlement place offered to a Syrian in the EU contingent upon another Syrian risking their life by embarking on the deadly sea route to Greece. 
“EU and Turkish leaders have today sunk to a new low, effectively horse trading away the rights and dignity of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. The idea of bartering refugees for refugees is not only dangerously dehumanizing, but also offers no sustainable long term solution to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,” said Iverna McGowan, Head of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office. 
When questioned on the legality of this proposal under international law, EU leaders responded that this would be possible under EU law once Turkey be designated as a ‘safe country’. 
Amnesty International strongly contests the concept of a ‘safe third country’ in general, as this undermines the individual right to have asylum claims fully and fairly processed and may result in individuals being subsequently deported to their country of origin – in violation of the principle of non-refoulement. In the case of Turkey in particular, there is huge cause for concern given the current situation and treatment of migrants and refugees. 
“Turkey has forcibly returned refugees to Syria and many refugees in the country live in desperate conditions without adequate housing. Hundreds of thousands of refugee children cannot access formal education. By no stretch of imagination can Turkey be considered a ‘safe third country’ that the EU can cozily outsource its obligations to,” she added. 
Although it was claimed that those needing international protection that are not Syrian would not be returned to Turkey, it has not been made clear how those individual rights could be guaranteed in the context of a system of mass returns. The reality is that not all asylum seekers are coming from Syria, and Turkey does not have a fully functioning asylum system. 
The proposal makes a mockery of the EU’s obligation to provide access to asylum at its borders. Any returns system not built on the principle of an individual’s right to access a fair and robust asylum process is deeply problematic. 
“Iraqi and Afghan nationals, along with Syrians, make up around 90 percent of arrivals to Greece. Sending them back to Turkey knowing their strong claim to international protection will most likely never be heard reveals EU claims to respect refugees’ human rights as hollow words,” said Iverna McGowan. 
It was also stated by President Tusk that the Western Balkans route would be closed. Closure of this route would lead to thousands of vulnerable people being left in the cold with no clear plan on how their urgent humanitarian needs and rights to international protection would be dealt with. It is urgent that the European Union and the international community as a whole urgently step up their commitment to solving this crisis, both in terms of humanitarian and other financial assistance and by resettling far greater numbers of refugees.

The sickening discovery of the severed head of a nine-year-old boy with albinism in Malawi shows the grave risk to life and personal security faced by people with albinism and the urgent need for the authorities to provide adequate protection to this vulnerable minority group, said Amnesty International today. 
Police confirmed to Amnesty International today that they found the head of the boy who was abducted from his home at Moto village in Malawi's eastern district of Machinga on Friday 26 February. 
“The discovery of the head of a nine-year-old boy with albinism who was abducted in front of his mother, shows the grave danger faced by people with albinism in Malawi. The Police must urgently and thoroughly investigate the matter and bring to justice anyone suspected to be responsible for this heinous crime,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for Southern Africa. 
“The government must immediately take steps to ensure the safety and security of people with albinism and their families, especially in border districts, and provide much needed protection for this vulnerable group who are increasingly being targeted for their body parts. These ritual killings must stop.” 
Two people with albinism have been killed since January this year, with at least 11 known to have been victims of ritual killings since December 2014. Five others are still missing. 
The lack of adequate police protection has also led to vigilante murders. On Tuesday, a mob burnt to death seven men allegedly found with bones of a person with albinism in Southern Malawi's border district of Nsanje. 
“Vigilante violence targeting suspects of any crime is unacceptable. The government should encourage the public to report anyone they suspect of involvement in criminal acts to the police who should investigate the crime. Justice cannot be achieved by people taking the law into their own hands,” said Deprose Muchena.

ATT States Parties and signatories are among those who continue to supply weapons to Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners for use in Yemen – in brazen violation of the treaty, in particular its human rights provisions. Arms have also been diverted into the hands of Huthi and other armed groups fighting in Yemen. 
“The world has not only turned its back on the people of Yemen; many states have actually contributed to their suffering, supplying the weapons and bombs that have been used to unlawfully kill and injure civilians and destroy homes and infrastructure. This has caused a humanitarian catastrophe,” said Brian Wood, Head of Arms Control and Human Rights at Amnesty International. 
“All states, as well as international organizations such as the European Union and United Nations, should do everything in their power to prevent this terrible humanitarian toll from worsening further. A vital first step would be immediately turning off the taps on the irresponsible and unlawful flow of arms that could be used in the conflict in Yemen.” 
Amnesty International has documented how, since the conflict erupted last March, all sides have committed a string of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, including possible war crimes, with impunity. This has contributed to the deaths of nearly 3,000 civilians, including at least 700 children, has injured more than 5,600 and displaced upwards of 2.5 million people. 
Amnesty International is urging all states to ensure that no party to the conflict in Yemen is supplied – either directly or indirectly – with weapons, munitions, military equipment or technology that would be used in the conflict until they end such serious violations. This also applies to logistical and financial support for such transfers. 
The embargo call goes far beyond existing international sanctions on parties to the conflict in Yemen. UN Security Council Resolution 2216, adopted in April 2015, imposed an arms embargo on Huthi/Saleh loyalist forces only. A non-binding European Parliament resolution adopted on 25 February called for the EU to seek to impose an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia, but not other parties to the conflict. 
Amnesty International is calling for any authorization of arms transfers to any party to the Yemen conflict to include a strict, legally binding guarantee that the end use will be in line with international humanitarian and human rights law, and that such arms transfers will not be used in Yemen. States should explicitly inform the UN Sanctions Committee of the terms of any such transfers and end-use guarantees. 
The organization is not calling for a total ban on coalition members acquiring arms lawfully for legitimate uses outside Yemen – for example, arms used for the protection of humanitarian aid or participation in peacekeeping operations. 
An arms embargo would effectively rule out any arms transfer to any party to the conflict for use in Yemen while there remains a substantial risk the arms would be used to commit or facilitate war crimes or other serious violations. 
States Parties to the ATT – including all EU member states – should already be implementing such end-use guarantees under their treaty obligations. 
It is crucial that the embargo covers not only weapons and munitions used in aerial attacks such as military aircraft, missiles and bombs, but also equipment used in ground attacks by Huthi and coalition-aligned armed groups and militias in Yemen, such as imprecise Grad-type rocket artillery, as well as mortars, small arms and light weapons and other equipment such as armoured vehicles. 
Since the start of the conflict in March 2015, Amnesty International has documented 30 airstrikes across five different governorates (Sana’a, Sa’da, Hajjah, Ta’iz and Lahj) by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition that appear to have violated international humanitarian law, resulting in 366 civilian deaths (more than half of whom were women and children) and 272 civilian injuries. These have included attacks on hospitals, schools, markets and mosques, which may constitute war crimes. 
Amnesty International has also investigated 30 indiscriminate or reckless ground attacks by Huthi/Saleh-loyalist forces in the southern cities of Aden and Ta’iz which killed at least 68 civilians and injured 99 others (most of whom were women and children). Imprecise battlefield weapons are used on a daily basis in residential areas, causing civilian casualties and showing disregard for civilian lives. Such indiscriminate attacks violate the laws of war. 
Amnesty International has also documented the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s use of at least four different types of internationally banned cluster munitions (including US and Brazilian-manufactured models) in at least five attacks in three governorates of Yemen since March 2015. The latest attack documented took place in Sana’a on 6 January, killing a 16-year-old boy and wounding at least six other civilians. Cluster munitions are indiscriminate weapons that pose long-term dangers to civilians and their use is prohibited. 
“The fighting in Yemen has resulted in a catalogue of horrors for the civilian population. The warring parties are directly to blame for flagrantly flouting international humanitarian law and failing to take adequate measures to protect civilians and their human rights,” said Brian Wood. 
“But the international community has also played a significant part in this, by continuing to supply billions of dollars’ worth of arms to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, despite clear evidence of an overriding risk that they would be used to commit serious violations. 
“Stopping the flow of arms to all parties to the Yemen conflict must be accompanied by the establishment of an international inquiry to conduct credible, independent investigations into the serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by all parties.”",,"February 29, 2016 • Press Release",False

Police and security forces in Angola use the courts, dogs, batons, torture, and murder to attack citizens exercising rights guaranteed in their constitution and under international law. Journalist Rafael Marques is witness to nearly all these tactics as he documents corruption and rights violations in the country he calls home. 
In June of this year, 13 young men gathered in a house in Luanda to discuss non-violent means to promote regime change. They were arrested when police stormed the meeting. Over the next few days, two more joined their ranks and another a few weeks later-all accused of plotting a coup. They are the 15+1 activists held in solitary confinement without official charges laid against them in Angola. 
Prior to this, in May, Jose Marcos Mavungo was arrested leaving church. His crime-planning a peaceful protest in Cabinda, a northern oil rich province where a separatist movement provides the authorities an excuse to harshly suppress anyone who raises a voice in opposition to government policies. Two others, one an attorney, Arao Bula Tempo, were also arrested and alleged to be engaged in aspects of the planned protest. Mr. Mavungo, jailed for the past 6 months, was convicted this week and sentenced to 6 years in prison. The government maintains he was involved with explosives but never produced any direct evidence to tie him to the weapons. Mr. Tempo continues to be harassed by the government and denied travel to obtain necessary medical care. 
There is a marked increase in repression of freedom of expression, assembly and association in Angola in the past few years. Protests are violently suppressed, activists disappeared and killed by state security forces, and the legal system used as a weapon to silence through prosecution and imprisonment. 
Rafael Marques is intimately acquainted with his governments tactics. An anti-corruption and human rights journalist, he was convicted and sentenced to a six month suspended sentence in relation to a book he wrote about corruption, torture and murder in the diamond fields in Angola. Mr. Marques is repeatedly harassed by security forces but will not be silenced in his efforts to make his home a more equitable society for all Angolans.

Today, a tapestry in honor of John Lennon was unveiled in the presence of Yoko Ono and Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty at a ceremony on Ellis Island. 
The tapestry was unveiled by U2’s Bono and The Edge, who along with music business impresario Jimmy Iovine, have donated the tapestry to The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation for display at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration. The tapestry will remain on display on Ellis island until August 14th and will be permanently displayed in 2016. 
The tapestry was commissioned by Art for Amnesty founder Bill Shipsey as a thank you to Yoko Ono for giving Amnesty International the rights to record cover versions of John Lennon’s post-Beatles songs in 2004. 
“For many years, Ellis Island has stood as a symbol of the United States’ compassion to those who came to its shores,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. “It is our hope that this beautiful tapestry hanging in this meaningful space will serve as a reminder to extend John Lennon’s message of peace and love to all of those who leave their homes in search of a better life."" 
The presentation included remarks by Yoko Ono, Bono and Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
Yoko Ono said, ""This is a happy day for our family, for our John to be honored by the city he so loved. John said IMAGINE ALL THE PEOPLE LIVING LIFE IN PEACE.

 Woman: Can you help me get this child a birth certificate?
 Marselha: Unfortunately I cannot, but I can tell your story. 
I heard that question some dozen times in the interval of less than three days as I interviewed mothers whose children were born and raised in the Dominican Republic and were refused their birth certificates. 
 
I am in the Dominican Republic as part of an Amnesty International mission as the country faces a human rights crisis. We are here to monitor if stateless individuals are being expelled to Haiti as deportation of undocumented migrants resumed June 18. 
What’s the crisis? 
Tens of thousands of people are at risk of being forced to leave the country, following a 2013 Constitutional Court ruling to retroactively deprive people of foreign descent of their Dominican nationality. This ruling has been applied to those born in the Dominican Republic to undocumented parents between 1929 and 2010, making them stateless. 
DR is making people of Haitian descent legally statelessness in violation of int’l law. But what is statelessness? http://t.co/UVU35MpHy2 
— AJ+ (@ajplus) June 18, 2015 
Amnesty International and human rights bodies, including the Inter-American Commission and Court on Human Rights and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, have voiced serious concerns that this ruling is discriminatory, as it disproportionately affects people of Haitian descent. June 18, 2015 marked the official date in which Dominican authorities could potentially force the thousands of newly stateless Dominicans to leave their home country. Why should you care?  In a nation of immigrants like the United States, unless you are Native American, you, your parents or ancestors came from somewhere else. Imagine giving birth to a child, and the hospital not giving you a piece of paper declaring she was born, because you don’t have an ID card. You don’t have an ID card because your mother was denied your birth certificate. Imagine not being able to get a job because you don’t have any documents. And then, imagine the government of the only country you have ever known to be your home –the country in which you were born and in which your parents were born– says that you need to go back to where your ancestors came from. This is actually happening in the Dominican Republic. 
Far away from the pristine beaches or the busy streets of Santo Domingo is the municipality of Esperanza in Valverde Mao Province. After some four hours driving northwest of the capital, tucked away between rolling hills and lush vegetation, the Amnesty delegation arrives in the forgotten communities of Laguna Salada and Batey Libertad. When we get there, dozens of individuals are waiting for us in the mighty sun that hits the Caribbean at midday. 
Esmeralda, Ludrix, Rosadana, Renande, Susana, Eliane, Junior, Taile, Juna, Manuca, Colo, Angelot, Ismylove, Euns, Stefani, Jennifer, Reginaldo, Roberto, Fania, Janita, Robin, Carolina, Manuel, Ezai. All these children do not have any document as proof that they exist. Some of them are in school, some of them are not, and those in school must dread the arrival of 7th grade, when they won’t be able to show a birth certificate to continue studying. 
A few proud children shoot me a wide grin and present crumbled dirty vaccination records. The hospital in this region refused to give their mothers any certification when their children were born, and so a vaccination record is the only official document they possess. 
Caught in different legal schemes, and a bureaucratic imbroglio marred with racial undertones, these children are condemned to live in abject poverty, without the possibility to finish their education, the possibility to hold a decent paying job, and with an uncertain fate. That they live in places named after freedom (libertad) and hope (esperanza) feels like a cruel irony. 
One hour driving north from the outskirts of Santo Domingo in the rural community of Guanuma, Fifa walks out with her mother, Olga, four of her eight siblings and three of her children. Olga was born in 1971 and arrived in the Dominican Republic in 1984. Her husband, Decima, had arrived in the country in 1971 to work in the sugar cane fields. Olga proudly shows me a worker’s card from the sugar mill her family was attached to in the 1980s. None of Olga and Decima’s nine children and six grandchildren have even been given a birth certificate, despite lifetimes of living and working in this country. Without a birth declaration, a parent cannot register his or her children, so that child won’t have a birth registration, required for school, or an identity card later in life to get a job or register their child. Without these identity documents, one cannot get married, or get a passport. 
 
Now, imagine again if that was happening to you, your parents or your children in the United States… 
Why am I telling you all this? Why now? 
Throughout the almost ten years I have been working on this issue, I have heard hundreds of similar stories and have retold hundreds more, in the halls of Congress, at the U.S. State Department, with foreign diplomats and journalists. 
Many have ignored a decade of slow suffering, but they cannot ignore this active, urgent crisis. As reported in a recent spate of big news stories, tens of thousands individuals are at imminent risk. Despite warnings, recommendations and rulings from international human rights bodies, the Dominican Republic’s so-called solutions to these problems are filled with requirements galore, bureaucratic nightmares, and tarnished with prejudice in implementation.

Last week, over 1,100 human rights activists gathered in Brooklyn, New York. What for? Amnesty International USA’s Annual General Meeting, appropriately themed this year “From Moment to Movement.” Braving rain and snow, people who have been members for decades –perhaps having joined as a result of the Human Rights Concerts of the 1980s—joined with those new to Amnesty– together reflecting on the spark of change that can begin in an instant and reverberate for years. 
So that’s the ‘what’ – but why? What happens when you gather this powerhouse of activism in one place for one weekend? The answers say a lot about what it means to turn a moment into a movement. 
 
What do a thousand activists look like? 
A photo posted by Jamira Burley (@jamiraburley) on Mar 20, 2015 at 12:50pm PDT 
They look young, old and young at heart; male, female, gay, lesbian, bisexual, trans and straight; black, white, Asian, Latino, and many more races, ethnicities and identities. They look like hundreds of yellow ponchos braving rain and snow across the Brooklyn Bridge to raise awareness about three New Yorkers recently killed by police. They look like strangers mingling at ‘action alley’, networking, writing letters to prisoners of conscience, deciding to go to a panel together about organizing against torture in Chicago, or gender-based violence in El Salvador. They look like a ballroom of individuals standing together to re-commit to building bridges for human rights. What do a thousand activists act like? They act like powerful individual change-makers. And together that power is electric. They act like poets at a “SLAMnesty” event and protesters from the Brooklyn Bridge to the ballroom where our conference took place. They act like activists challenging the status quo and allies ‘calling in’ others to push the movement forward. They act like listeners, learners and leaders – organizing in hallways and in panel rooms for how to grow movements from New York to Ferguson to Oakland to Ayotzinapa to Hong Kong to Lagos; from the LGBT movement to black liberation to freeing prisoners of conscience globally, to climate justice. They act like artists and activists, standing with Harry Belafonte, Annie Lennox, Lemon Andersen, Nusrat Durrani, Piper Kerman, Jesse Krimes, Brandan Odums, Laura Poitras, Favianna Rodriguez, Jesse Williams, and Jie-Song Zhang to share and lift up stories of the people behind the statistics, to ensure that their struggles to claim their rights and the abuses they have experienced are brought to light.

They act like doers, makers, marchers, writers, sharers, students, travelers and teachers coming together from all over the world to build the human rights movement through organizing, campaigning, and advocacy — and most of all, through connecting. 
They act like the inspiration to future movements and the bridges between them. 
Ok, so what do a thousand activists sound like? 
We’ll let them speak for themselves: 
“A lot of people from a lot of different places that I wouldn’t have met” ~ Mohamed, activist/attendee

“Informative … a hub for activists from all over the world” ~ Faisal, activist/attendee

“Collaboration” … really powerful… getting that action, that momentum going” ~ Lynn, activist/attendee

“The perfect structure for all that energy to gravitate toward” … “all the support being around all these people who are real activists” ~ Todd, activist/attendee 
Linda Sarsour, activist, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York and the moderator of our “Moment to Movement” plenary put it well: 
“We are in a movement, sisters and brothers, not just here in NYC. Ferguson, Oakland, Mexico, Brazil, Palestine, Hong Kong. We are all connected. Our struggles are connected. Our movements are connected. Our power is connected.” 
Our human rights conference was inspiring and provocative. It reaffirmed our commitment to build bridges that can carry a moment and turn it into a movement. That bridge that we build at Amnesty should be one that is sustainable, that gives passionate activists a home. 
Please join us in building bridges with all those who want to protect people wherever freedom, justice, truth and dignity are denied. Together, we will win.",,"April 3, 2015 • Post",False

The release marks the launch of a worldwide UnfollowMe campaign, a global initiative calling on the leaders of the U.S. and UK – as well as their close allies – to ban indiscriminate mass surveillance and intelligence sharing. 
The poll, which questioned 15,000 people in 13 countries across every continent, found that 71% of respondents are strongly opposed to the United States monitoring their internet use. Meanwhile, nearly two thirds said they wanted tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Yahoo to block governments accessing their data. 
The majority of U.S. citizens (63%) are against their government’s surveillance scheme compared to only 20% in favor. 
“International public opinion clearly supports the scale back of mass surveillance,” said Steven W. Hawkins, Executive Director of Amnesty International USA. 
“If he wanted to, President Obama could halt surveillance programs that are jeopardizing the privacy of tens of millions of people around the world—he has the authority. He mandated limited protections for non-citizens more than a year ago, but they still haven’t come to fruition.  
""Despite the President’s promises of reform, mass surveillance could prove to be a permanent scar on the USA’s human rights record, just like unlawful drone strikes and impunity for CIA torture."" 
In June 2013 whistle-blower Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. National Security Agency was authorized to monitor phone and internet use in 193 countries around the world, collecting 5 billion records of mobile phone location a day and 42 billion internet records – including email and browsing history – a month. 
“We’ve got agencies looking through webcams into people’s bedrooms. And they’re collecting billions of cell phone location records a day,” whistle-blower Edward Snowden said on Amnesty International’s blog today. “They know where you got on the bus, where you went to work, where you slept, and what other cell phones slept with you.”

Like me, you’re also undoubtedly distressed by the violence and simultaneously weary of the struggle to end it. It is overwhelming and daunting to grasp how we can work to effectively end this widespread human rights abuse. 
But we cannot give up on our efforts. With every day that passes, violence continues to devastate the lives of countless more women and girls in every part of the world. We must continue to push for a solution. 
As Amnesty activists, you’ve certainly heard about the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA). Amnesty has been at the forefront of efforts to push this important bill since its inception several years ago. I can understand that you might be tired of advocating for IVAWA, but there is a reason why we keep pushing this bill and asking for your help in doing so: we know that IVAWA is an important part of the solution to ending violence against women and girls around the world. We just need Members of Congress to get the message. 
As we observed International Women’s Day yesterday, a dedicated group of bipartisan lawmakers in the House of Representatives reintroduced IVAWA into the new session of Congress, with reintroduction in the Senate planned for this week. IVAWA will improve existing U.S. efforts to address gender-based violence by ensuring the U.S. has a comprehensive diplomatic and foreign assistance strategy to help secure the safety and rights of women and girls across the world. 
IVAWA’s introduction couldn’t have come soon enough. The U.S. government currently has a strategy in place like the one IVAWA is calling for, however it is set to expire this summer. This could mean a disastrous end to a critical mechanism that has been the lifeline for numerous women and girls around the world… unless Congress acts. 
Your lawmakers need to know just how important and timely IVAWA is. Will you take action with me on IVAWA to keep the clock from running out on these crucial anti-violence efforts?  
In reflecting on International Women’s Day, I wish more than anything that violence against women and girls didn’t affect one out of every three women worldwide, crossing all borders and cultures, impacting the ability of women and girls to access the full spectrum of their human rights. And I really wish Congress would help us do something about it. 
We cannot let the clock run out on the critical initiatives in place to end the global scourge of violence against women. It is more important than ever before to pass IVAWA and ensure continued progress on ending this human rights abuse around the world. ",,"March 9, 2015 • Post",False

Dear Mr. President, 
This State of the Union, will you make women’s rights a priority? 
Women across the world—including here in the U.S.—experience horrific levels of violence. 1 of 3 women globally will be raped, beaten, or otherwise abused in their lifetime, and you, Mr. President, can help end this epidemic. 
 
Improving the US response to sexual violence in Indigenous communities 
Consider Native American and Alaska Native women, who are 2.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted than non-Native women in the USA. The extreme levels of sexual violence against Indigenous women make it critical that Indian Health Services implements standardized, written sexual assault protocols.  These protocols are needed to ensure the timely collection of forensic evidence which is crucial for a successful prosecution, and which also ensure that Native American and Alaska Native women have access to the health care services they need, including unrestricted access to emergency contraception. 
While the Tribal Law and Order Act, which you, Mr. President, signed into law in 2010, required Indian Health Services to develop standardized sexual assault policies and protocols for the facilities of the Service, they are not mandatory and implementation remains a problem.  As a result, treatment of sexual assault survivors has been inconsistent and results in violations of human rights under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, as well as other international standards.   We call on you to ensure that Indian Health Services adopts and enforces standardized sexual assault protocols that include full and equal access to emergency contraception. 
Recommitting to the US Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally

Just as the extreme levels of violence against Indigenous women in the USA demands a response, so to does the scourge of violence against women and girls globally. Violence against women is human rights violation, a public health epidemic and a barrier to solving shared global challenges such as poverty, disease, and conflict. 
Mr. President, you recognized how important it is for the US government to take a stand against this human rights scandal when you promulgated the US Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence (GBV) Globally in August 2012, which seeks to integrate and utilize ongoing foreign assistance efforts aimed at preventing violence from happening in the first place and ensuring proper support for survivors when it does. 
Consider survivors such as the Yezidi women and girls in Iraq who are facing harrowing violence at the hands of the armed group calling itself the Islamic State, including torture, rape, other forms of sexual violence and forced marriage. The US GBV Strategy is meant to help ensure access to the kinds of lifesaving services so essential to the Yezidi survivors of sexual violence. But the Strategy is set to expire in August. What will happen to such critical efforts when it does? To the women and girls who need the support the most? 
Calling for passage of the International Violence Against Women Act  
We must ensure that this important Strategy becomes permanent through passage of the International Violence Against Women Act (IVAWA), a bill which makes addressing GBV a cornerstone of U.S. development and foreign policy. 
 
In the coming weeks, IVAWA will be reintroduced in the 114th Congress, and while Amnesty activists will do our part to push for its passage, we need you to do your part, Mr. President. We need you to support the passage of IVAWA and commit to renewing the US Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally before it expires this summer. 
Will you be a leader for women and girls in your State of the Union address? 
Until everyone, and governments alike, recognizes their responsibility to end violence, the health and safety of women and girls around the world will remain at risk. We call on you to ensure that the United States will continue doing its part by committing to the continued implementation of the GBV Strategy, encouraging Congress to pass IVAWA, and pushing Indian Health Services to take further action to effectively respond to sexual assault. The women and girls of the world cannot afford for you not to.

2. In particular, there was an incident where several of our Amnesty observers were at MoKaBe’s coffee shop, a designated safe house for activists, which was tear gassed by the police. Amnesty staff were inside MoKaBe’s coffeehouse along with several dozen other protesters and community members. The coffee shop was distributing free coffee and hot chocolate to those who needed a quiet and welcoming place to gather or refresh themselves. It was staffed by community volunteers and clergy. There was a small protest taking place in the street outside, but it was peaceful. At approximately 1:00am, a large militarized police vehicle sped around the corner and fired tear gas and undetermined projectiles at the people running from the protests, hitting one in the back. The police then turned to MoKaBe’s and fired on the building. Amnesty International staff inside MoKaBe directly observed the entire interaction.

The police again fired tear gas several minutes later, despite the presence of two Amnesty monitors clearly marked with bright yellow “human rights observer” T-shirts. The patrons, including people who came outside to recover from the initial tear gas and some children, were overcome with gas. There was no evident provocation for this action and no prior warning to disperse. One Amnesty observer was struck with three or four projectiles of unknown composition. Meanwhile, a column of police in riot gear lined up in a column outside, preventing anyone from leaving or entering the coffee shop for approximately 20 minutes.

These observations and the remaining questions are precisely why human rights observation is so critical. While millions watched from afar, Amnesty International USA was on the ground sorting through the gas and the confusion. 
While there are certainly elements of violence and unrest among the protesters, there are countless others who are there to exercise their human rights to peaceful assembly, freedom of expression and freedom of movement. When these rights are threatened for anyone, they are threatened for everyone. 
Now is the time where it as more important as ever to guard against abuses. Join us in urging Missouri officials to be vigilant in making Ferguson a protected space for peaceful protesters. It is time for leaders in Ferguson, throughout the US and across the globe to stand up for human rights – the world is watching.

Nabeel Rajab was detained over tweets he posted that were deemed insulting to the Ministries of Interior and Defence. Today he was released on bail and his trial was set for January. 
“While we welcome that Nabeel Rajab has been released on bail, he should never have been detained in the first place. The Bahraini authorities are merely obfuscating, meanwhile a man’s future hangs in the balance. Rather than this temporary measure,  the authorities must immediately drop the charges,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme. 
“Worryingly, we are seeing a return to old ways. The Bahraini authorities have prosecuted a string of activists in recent months in a crackdown on peaceful dissent, leaving little doubt that they have once again shelved reform despite past promises.” 
Amnesty International is calling for Bahraini authorities to immediately drop charges against all those being tried for freedom of expression issues, including Nabeel Rajab and fellow activist Zainab Al-Khawaja. 
“Prosecuting anyone merely for peacefully expressing their political views is a clear form of repression and a brazen violation of their rights.""

The same day Ban Ki Moon, UN Secretary General, visited the Gaza Strip saying, “a restrictive occupation that has lasted almost half a century, the continued denial of Palestinian rights and the lack of tangible progress in peace negotiations” was the root cause of latest escalation in violence, the UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People hosted a lecture by Noam Chomsky in the UN General Assembly Hall on resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict. 
It couldn’t have happened at a more pivotal time. Significant movement is happening globally and with Secretary of State John Kerry’s announcement that the Quartet (the U.S., the U.N., Russia and European Union) are meeting this Friday in Brussels, it’s time for the international community to finally end the status quo. 
 
Sweden held a historic vote last week recognizing the State of Palestine, and the British House of Commons voted to recommend that the UK recognize Palestine as a state alongside Israel. Debates prior to both votes cited frustration with the deadlock and status quo.  The Spanish parliament recently announced they would vote on recognition of the State of Palestine. 
Direct negotiations between the parties are in disarray after 20+ years of repeated failure under the current framework. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has entered into a national reconciliation government with Hamas, the de facto administration in the Gaza Strip – an important factor for any progress to happen, but there are no direct negotiations between Israel and Hamas. PA President, Mahmoud Abbas had demanded the UN Security Council pass a resolution requiring Israel to withdraw from the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, by November 2016 or he will sign the Rome Statute, giving the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute war crimes involving both Palestinian and Israeli individuals. 
Throughout his talk, Chomsky touched on human rights and international law, but for a sustainable peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians, the entire approach to the issue must be transformed. 
A major flaw of the so-called ‘peace process’ that began with the Oslo Agreement of 1993 was that the final resolution was not based on ensuring respect and protection for human rights. 
Amnesty International, as a human rights organization, takes no position on the final resolution, but has insisted for years that the process and any resolution be based on the respect of human rights for all. 
The failure to uphold people’s basic rights feeds hatred and perpetuates abuses. All those in a position of authority must recognize that the rights to life, physical and mental integrity, freedom from arbitrary detention, freedom of movement, freedom of expression and the rights to food, health, water and education are the inalienable rights of both Israelis and Palestinians. The human rights of one individual cannot be founded on the loss of rights of another individual. 
The Quartet must recognize these developments and adopt this new framework. The Israel/Palestine situation is in flux resulting in instability, fear and inevitably more violence. Civilians on both sides of the conflict continue to bear the brunt of the failure to find a solution. Just this summer, we saw over 1500 civilians, at least 500 of them children, die in horrible circumstances. 
There can be sustainable peace in the region if this zero-sum attitude, that there must be one winner and one loser, is thrown away and we stop repeating the same, failed patterns and start using a human rights framework for talks, including a commitment to, but not limited to:

I’m going to New York this weekend to make history and to make change. And I’m not the only one. 
On Sunday, 100,000+ people are expected to gather in New York for the largest climate march in history.   We are going to New York as heads of state from across the world prepare for the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris in 2015. The Paris meeting is seen by many as the last good opportunity for an international agreement for the next several years. 
We are marching because we can’t afford to wait. Last year, United Nations independent experts came together for a landmark statement: “If we fail our environment, we fail to protect our human rights.” In fact, Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki Moon is marching with us. Talk about historic! 
This is why I’m writing about environmental issues in a human rights blog. Here are just a couple of points that really drive home the connection between human rights and climate change for me: 
 
I could go on. As Greenpeace’s Executive Director, Kumi Naidoo, put it, “There are no human rights on a dead planet.”  It really comes down to people living with dignity, and that’s what Amnesty International is all about. 
In fact, for many years Amnesty International has worked to stop human rights abuses that intersect with environmental issues.  We’ve taken up the cases of environmental activists jailed or otherwise persecuted for their peaceful activism, and we’ve worked alongside communities from Bhopal, India, to the Niger Delta, to the Gulf Coast to confront companies involved in activities that undermine the right to a healthy environment and to demand that governments hold them accountable. Which brings me to this week’s climate march… 
I am asking you to join us in making history this Sunday. Amnesty International USA is a partnering organization in this march and will have its own section in the march. Join our contingent by meeting us at 86th Street and Columbus Avenue or contact us on our event page to learn about out how to meet us in New York.  If you cannot make it to New York, see if one of the 2200 companion events worldwide is happening near you. Or consider organizing your own event. A heartfelt discussion about climate change can change the world by changing minds. 
Governments, corporations and other institutions have failed terribly when it comes to climate change. Scientists have been delivering strong evidence of climate change and its impact for decades now. But even such direct evidence is not enough to motivate the real large scale changes that we need. History has shown that when our institutions fail on such large scale, the only force that can correct them is people raising their voices, taking to the streets, and not letting up until change happens. SO LET’S DO IT!

Ekaterina Khomenko’s throat was slit when a street cleaner found her in a car with the engine still running in St Petersburg earlier this month. 
According to media reports, police initially suggested – somewhat incredibly – that she might have committed suicide. An investigation is now under way into the actual cause of the 29-year-old’s death. The authorities haven’t ruled out the possibility that she may have been attacked on the basis of her sexual orientation: she was openly lesbian and gave tango lessons to same-sex couples. 
In the days before she died, a known extremist had posted hate speech and threats on a social media page she owned, in response to a photo she posted of two women embraced n the sensual Argentine dance in a St Petersburg Metro station. 
Whatever the motive, Ekaterina’s death sent a shock wave through St Petersburg’s small but active network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) organizations. When I met some of them this week, they were visibly shaken. 
Sadly, they are used to homophobia that often boils over into aggression. And they are used to a lackluster official response to violence against LGBT people in Russia. Crimes committed against people because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity are not covered by Russian hate crimes legislation. 
But while LGBT activists reacted to this tragedy with horror and indignation, they are resolute about continuing the struggle to foster a more inclusive climate in St Petersburg, and around Russia. They want to bring about a climate where they are empowered to live, to love, to breathe freely as themselves. 
That’s the motivation behind QueerFest, now a key annual event in St Petersburg, which kicks off today (18 September). In its sixth year, and taking place over 10 days, it will include numerous talks, seminars and performances in two venues in the city center. 
Or at least that’s what the planners are hoping. 
Last year, around 40 different venues declined to take part before the organizers finally settled on locations on the city’s outskirts. Polina Andrianova, director of “Coming Out” – the organization behind the QueerFest – told me that this year she hopes they can retain at least one of the two current venues. While the agenda and speakers have been planned for some time, given the ongoing fear and threats faced by the LGBT community, the actual locations and other details were only announced at the last minute. 
Problems lurk around every turn for the organizers of such events, and trouble often shows up uninvited. 
No fewer than five bomb threats interrupted last November’s “Side by Side” (Bok o Bok), Russia’s largest international LGBT film festival. Organizer Gulya Sultanova told me the authorities would come, sometimes in the middle of a film screening, and evacuate the entire building to search for explosives after some unidentified individual had allegedly called in a complaint. Invariably, no bombs were found, and the films resumed an hour or two after the disruption. 
“After the first time, we knew it was fake,” Gulya said. 
And there were other clear attempts to derail the festival. 
Groups of young people would show up and try to gain entry, an apparent attempt to spark trouble. Participation by minors in LGBT rights-related events was among the things presumed to be outlawed in June 2013, when a “propaganda of homosexuality among minors” bill was adopted by the Duma and subsequently signed into law by President Vladimir Putin. “Presumed” to be, because nobody seems entirely sure how far such “propaganda” extends, and the law has rarely been implemented. 
But its bark has been as bad as its bite. The new law has generated additional fears and pressures for LGBT people across the country. Organizers of events like “Side by Side” and QueerFest face a threat of having to pay stiff fines unless they print “18+” age restrictions on their promotional material and ensure that no minors take part. 
According to Gulya, on one occasion, a group of young people managed to enter a screening during last year’s “Side by Side” festival, despite a passport check at the door. Once inside, they began shouting to journalists attending the screening that they were underage and were shocked by the information they were being exposed to. A vocally homophobic St Petersburg politician who was present chimed in, alleging that the LGBT organizations were forcing the youth to be there. 
The bizarre scene soon dissipated, but some 15 minutes later, police announced a bomb threat had been called in and everyone had to be evacuated from the screening. 
Such disturbances are what “Coming Out” members are hoping to avoid during QueerFest. They are doing their utmost to ensure everything is “suitable” despite increasingly restrictive laws. Festival organizers walk a tightrope between ensuring they don’t break the law, and not wanting to send a message to the LGBTI community that they agree with what it stands for. 
“The gravest result of [the propaganda law] is it justifies a homophobic attitude and gives a green light to homophobic violence,” Polina told me. 
This is a trend she and other LGBT activists are fighting to change. 
“We are in Russia, we love our country and are working to improve it. Defense of human rights and LGBT rights helps to make Russian society better,” she said. 
The goal: a society where a film festival can be screened without bomb threats. A society where anyone is free to talk about themselves, without having it labelled as “propaganda”. A society where anyone can dance a sensual tango, with a partner of their choosing, without the fear of being attacked or killed for it. 
Despite the rapidly shrinking space for freedom of expression, many people in Russia are speaking out. Between 6 and 12 October Amnesty International activists stand with them in solidarity during a week of action to make sure Russia’s leaders know that the rest of the world will not be silent.

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) is blinding investors to the toxic legacy of Bhopal, Amnesty International said ahead of the corporation’s AGM on Thursday. The company has blocked a shareholder resolution asking for a report on the financial, reputational and operational impact of the catastrophe on Dow’s business. 
“Dow’s refusal to talk about the Bhopal disaster ignores the continued suffering of the local community, and is an irresponsible business move,” said Audrey Gaughran, Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International. 
“Dow’s Bhopal problems aren’t about to go away simply by ignoring them.” 
There will be no discussion at the AGM of the consequences of impending criminal and civil court proceedings relating to the 1984 gas leak, which resulted in the deaths of thousands, as well as ongoing damage to the health and environment of local communities. 
Dow has been ordered to appear before Bhopal’s Criminal Court on July 4 to explain why its wholly-owned subsidiary, Union Carbide Corporation (UCC), has repeatedly ignored calls to answer charges of “culpable homicide not amounting to murder.” 
The charges relate to UCC’s responsibility for the leak at the former chemical plant in Bhopal. In addition to the criminal case, the companies are embroiled in two civil suits in India relating to the gas leak and ongoing environmental contamination at the former plant site. 
“Dodging the issue now has serious implications not only for the hundreds of thousands who continue to suffer as a result of gas poisoning and pollution, but also the company and its shareholders further down the line,” said Audrey Gaughran. 
“As long as the company continues to deny its responsibilities, its business will remain tainted by the Bhopal disaster. The only way to make problems like these go away is to fix them.”

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people in Uganda have reported a surge in human rights violations since the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act on December 20, 2013, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. 
In a country where the climate for LGBTI people was already hostile and discriminatory, LGBTI people have faced a notable increase in arbitrary arrests, police abuse and extortion, loss of employment, evictions and homelessness, and scores have fled the country. 
At least one transgender person has been killed since the bill was signed, in an apparent hate crime. Health providers have cut back on essential services for LGBTI people, who also fear harassment or arrest if they seek health care. The passing of this discriminatory law has not only opened the floodgates for a range of human rights violations against LGBTI people in Uganda, but has also ensured that victims of these violations are denied access to effective remedies. 
Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), a Kampala-based organization, stated in a recent report that “the full force of the State, particularly the legislative and executive branches of government, is being used to hunt down, expose, demean and suppress Uganda’s LGBTI people.” 
“The Anti-Homosexuality Act is creating homelessness and joblessness, restricting life-saving HIV work, and bloating the pockets of corrupt police officers who extort money from victims of arrest,” said Neela Ghoshal, senior LGBT rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Repealing this law is imperative to ensure Ugandans can live without fear of violence and harassment.” 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International conducted research in Kampala and other Ugandan towns in April 2014, interviewing 38 individuals directly affected by the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Act, four lawyers and paralegals, and four organizations that provide health services to LGBTI people. Human Rights Watch also interviewed eight LGBTI Ugandans in Nairobi, Kenya, who had fled Uganda between January and March 2014. 
President Yoweri Museveni signed the Anti-Homosexuality Bill into law on February 24, 2014, and it came into force on March 10. 
The law permits sentences of life in prison for some sexual acts between consenting adults. It criminalizes the undefined “promotion” of homosexuality, a provision that threatens human rights advocacy work and prompted a police raid on a joint U.S. government-Makerere University HIV research and intervention program. The law also criminalizes “a person who keeps a house, room, set of rooms, or place of any kind for purposes of homosexuality,” a provision that has been used to justify evicting LGBTI tenants. These new provisions reinforce existing ones in the country’s penal code that criminalize consensual same-sex sexual relationships between men. 
Since the bill passed in December 2013, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are aware of at least 17 people who have been arrested based on allegations of consensual same-sex conduct with other adults or, in some cases, simply on the suspicion of appearing to be LGBTI. 
In contrast, between 2007 and 2011, the Human Rights Promotion and Awareness Forum, a Ugandan group that tracks such cases and provides legal defense, reported that they were aware of 23 arrests on the basis of same-sex conduct, none of which resulted in prosecutions. The increase in arrests affects not only those detained, but the broader LGBTI population, since many live in fear of arrest and avoid any dealings with the authorities. LGBTI people who are victims of violence or discrimination say they fear reporting such cases to the police, concerned that they themselves could be arrested. 
The most evident impact of the law has been significant uprooting of LGBTI people, many of whom have fled the country, and others who are homeless or in hiding within Uganda. Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 LGBTI people who had been evicted by landlords, who appear to be interpreting the Anti-Homosexuality Act to mean that it is illegal to rent to LGBTI people. 
Hanifa Q. (her name and most others have been changed for security reasons), a lesbian in Kampala, showed Human Rights Watch an eviction letter she received from her landlord on March 3. Giving her one month to vacate the property, it reads: 
You have been nice to me and paying very well. But due to the existing situation in the country plus your behavior with your friends, forgive me to suspect you of being indecent, I cannot allow you to rent my house, I cannot fight the government. 
Almost everyone else interviewed had to move to new homes in order to escape threats or scrutiny from neighbors, in some cases after being “outed” by tabloids and on television. At least 100 LGBTI people have fled the country since the beginning of 2014. 
The law has also resulted in reduced access to health services and HIV prevention information for LGBTI people. On April 4, police raided the Makerere University Walter Reed Project, a U.S.-funded HIV research and treatment center that provides health information and services to LGBTI people. The police claimed the center was “recruiting” people into homosexuality. Two community-based organizations that provided HIV testing, condoms, and lubricant to men who have sex with men (MSM) closed their doors after the bill became law. They have reinitiated some services, but no longer receive drop-in clients. TASO, Uganda’s largest HIV/AIDS organization, has suspended its “Moonlight Clinics,” through which it conducted outreach to MSM and other vulnerable groups, offering them HIV testing and education. 
Shortly after the Act was signed, the health minister, Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, publicly pledged that health services would be provided to LGBTI people in a non-discriminatory way. Serious concerns for how this could work in practice remain, given that the Ministry has no control over police actions, said Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. 
Interviews with LGBTI people indicate the risk of health care workers violating patient confidentiality. Jay M., a transgender man, said that when he sought treatment for a fever shortly after the bill was signed into law: 
The doctor asked me, “But are you a woman or a man?” I said, “That doesn’t matter, but what I can tell you is I’m a trans man.” He said, “What’s a trans man? You know we don’t offer services to gay people here. You people are not even supposed to be in our community. I can even call the police and report you…You’re not even supposed to be in the country.” 
In the end, Jay paid the doctor 50,000 Ugandan shillings as a bribe and fled the office. 
“As long as the Anti-Homosexuality Act remains in force, the Ministry of Health cannot make credible assurances that health care will be provided to LGBTI people without discrimination,” said Michelle Kagari, Eastern Africa deputy regional director at Amnesty International. “For many LGBTI people, the risks of seeking service will outweigh the benefits: one ‘bad apple’ within the health care system could send a gay or bisexual client to prison for life.” 
The victims and lawyers interviewed said that most of those arrested since the bill passed have been released without charge. In seven cases that Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented, interviewees reported that police demanded bribes of between 30,000 (about $12) and 1.5 million Ugandan shillings (about $634). Other victims were released with the assistance of lawyers. Three transgender people said that police sexually assaulted them in custody, touching their breasts and genitals. One HIV-positive transgender woman said she was denied access to her antiretroviral treatment (ART). In at least one case, police subjected men arrested on homosexuality charges to forced anal exams – a discredited method of seeking “proof” of homosexual conduct that constitutes a form of torture. 
In a February 4 meeting with the inspector general of police, General Kale Kayihura, Human Rights Watch raised its concern about police surgeons’ use of forced anal exams. Kayihura agreed to look into the matter and circulate guidance to his staff. Despite inquiries, as far as Human Rights Watch has been able to determine, such guidance has not been communicated to police. 
The threat of arrest means that LGBTI people can be attacked with impunity, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. The week after Museveni signed the bill into law, a transgender sex worker in Kampala, known as “Queen,” was brutally attacked and killed by a man she met in a bar. Three friends of the victim interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they were afraid to report the killing to police, out of fear that as transgender women, they could be arrested. In March, three LGBTI people were lured to a house by men they met on social media, who abused them while subjecting them to homophobic insults. Two of the victims fled and filed complaints with the police, but the police responded with homophobic comments and the victims were afraid to pursue the complaints further. 
The Anti-Homosexuality Act also has direct consequences on the livelihoods of LGBTI people. Six people told Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International they had been fired from their jobs since the bill was passed, on the basis of their perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Others who ran small businesses or sold goods in the informal sector said that clients and other business people told them they would not be doing business with them anymore out of fear of being associated with them. 
“Within just five months of the passage of the Anti-Homosexuality Bill through parliament, we are seeing its dramatic effects on the health and well-being of LGBTI people,” Ghoshal said.

NEW YORK – Amnesty International today launched a new campaign against torture and other ill-treatment, from Chicago to Guantanamo to Nigeria and around the world. In its launch report, the organization revealed that more than half of 155 states that ratified the 1984 United Nations convention prohibiting torture are defying it by electrocuting, beating or sexually abusing detainees and accused governments of betraying their promises, often behind a mask of national security. 
""Thirty years after adopting a landmark treaty against torture, the world's governments continue to violate it in practice,"" said Steven W. Hawkins, Amnesty International USA's Executive Director. ""Torture is a crisis not only in Mexico or Nigeria, where torture by security personnel is widespread, but also here at home. The infamous cases of Chicago police torture and the still secret Senate report on CIA torture underscore that safeguards are still needed in our country."" 
Launched today, Amnesty's Stop Torture Campaign includes a detailed, global briefing Torture in 2014: 30 Years of Broken Promises, as well as a new, 21-country Globescan survey that Amnesty International commissioned to gauge worldwide attitudes to torture. The vast majority (82%) of the more than 21,000 individuals interviewed face-to-face or by telephone between December 2013 and the start of April 2014, believe there should be clear laws against torture. However, more than a third (36%) still thought torture could be justified in certain circumstances. 
""Raising awareness about human rights abuses both here at home and around the world is just the first step,"" Hawkins said. ""From the abuses highlighted in the Senate Select Intelligence Committee's report on CIA torture that has yet to be released, to the men and women tortured in Chicago under the direction of former police commander Jon Burge who are still awaiting justice, to the detainees who were tortured and are being held indefinitely without charge at Guantanamo, we're calling on U.S. government and governments everywhere to implement safeguards to prevent and punish torture."" 
New Global Survey
Only two-thirds of Americans polled say they would feel safe from torture if taken into custody in the United States. Moreover, a majority (61%) of survey respondents disagree that torture is sometimes necessary and acceptable to gain information that may protect the public and 77% of people in the United States agree that, ""clear rules against torture are crucial because any use of torture will weaken international human rights."" Finally, nearly half (44%) of respondents globally – from 21 countries across every continent – fear they would be at risk of torture if taken into custody in their country. 
""The results from this new global survey are startling, with nearly half of the people we surveyed feeling fearful and personally vulnerable to torture. The vast majority of people believe that there should be clear rules against torture, although more than a third still think that torture could be justified in certain circumstances. Overall, we can see broad global support amongst the public for action to prevent torture,"" said Caroline Holme, Director at GlobeScan. 
Of the 155 states to have ratified the U.N. convention, Amnesty International researched 142 and observed at least 79 states still torturing in 2014, including the United States. A further 40 U.N. Member States have not adopted the convention, although the global prohibition of on torture binds them too. 
While Amnesty International has reported on torture and other forms of ill treatment in at least 141 countries from every region of the world over the past five years – virtually every country it works in – the actual number of countries that torture is likely to be higher still given the secrecy surrounding the practice. 
Amnesty found that in some countries, torture is routine and systematic. In others, Amnesty International has only documented isolated and exceptional cases. The organization finds even one case of torture or other ill treatment totally unacceptable. 
The briefing details a variety of torture techniques – from stress positions and sleep deprivation to electrocution of the genitals – that states use against criminal suspects, security suspects, dissenting voices, political rivals and others. 
In countries that take their commitments under the U.N. Convention Against Torture seriously, measures such as the criminalization of torture in national legislation, opening detention centers to independent monitors and video recording interrogations have all led to a decrease in the use of torture. 
Amnesty International is calling on governments to implement protective mechanisms to prevent and punish torture, such as proper medical examinations, prompt access to lawyers, independent checks on places of detention, independent and effective investigations of torture allegations, the prosecution of suspects and proper redress for victims. 
In the United States, this call starts at the local level. In April, Amnesty International USA held its annual meeting in Chicago, where hundreds of activists marched and launched a call to action to support survivors of police torture from 1972-1991. Amnesty International believes Chicago authorities should an ordinance that would ensure reparations to survivors of systematic police torture under former Police Commander Jon Burge. 
International Focus Countries in Addition to the United States
The organization's global work against torture continues, but will focus in particular on five countries where torture is rife and Amnesty International believes it can achieve significant impact. Substantive reports with specific recommendations for each will be the backbone of the campaign. 
Detailed Survey Findings
On average, across the 21 countries, the survey finds that a significant majority (84%) agree that clear rules against torture are needed. Overall, over half are in strong agreement (57%) that rules are necessary because any use of torture is immoral and will weaken international human rights. Support is firm in European countries of Greece (80% strongly agree), Germany (72%), Spain (71%) and U.K. (70%), and in Australia (76%), Canada (74%), South Korea (69%) and Chile (69%). Opinion in favor of rules against torture is less pronounced in the U.S. (58% strongly agree) and is weakest in Mexico (27%) and China (33%). 
Despite general agreement on the need for rules against torture, global opinion is much more divided on the use of torture to gain information. A majority of people (61%) across the twenty-one countries disagree that torture is sometimes necessary and acceptable to gain information that may protect that public. This view is strongest in Greece (where 87% disagree that torture can be justified), Spain (81%), Brazil (80%), Germany (78%), Argentina (76%), and Chile (77%). In contrast, a majority in China and India (74% in each) agree that torture can sometimes be justified. 
There are also mixed perspectives of personal safety from torture across the twenty-one countries. Overall, 48% of those surveyed agree that they are confident that they would be safe from torture if they were taken into custody in their country. This compares with 44% that disagree that they would feel safe from torture. The remaining 8% were unable to answer this question. Fear of torture is highest in Latin America – a majority of Brazilians (80%) and Mexicans (64%) are not confident that they would be safe if taken into custody. In contrast, the vast majority in the U.K., Australia and Canada feel safe from torture, with over three quarters confident that would be safe from torture if they were taken into custody (83% in Australia and UK, 77% in Canada). 
A total of 21,221 people across 21 countries were interviewed face-to-face or by telephone between December 2013 and the start of April 2014. Countries polled included: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S. Polling was conducted for Amnesty International by the global research consultancy GlobeScan and its research partners in each country. In four of the countries (Brazil, China, Indonesia, Kenya), the sample was limited to major urban areas. The margin of error per country ranges from +/- 2.1 to 3.7 percent, 19 times out of 20.

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – A grassroots campaign will call for an end to the driving ban for women in Saudi Arabia on Saturday March 29. 
Amnesty International is calling on the Saudi Arabian authorities to respect the right of women to defy the ban by driving this weekend and to end the harassment of supporters of the campaign. 
A number of activists who took part in the Oct. 26 Women Driving campaign last year were detained by the Ministry of Interior. They were then forced to sign pledges not to repeat the ""offence"" before being released. 
Men who supported the campaign were also targeted. Tariq Al-Mubarak, a schoolteacher and activist who was among those detained, was held for more than a week without charge and interrogated about his involvement with the group. 
A few days before Oct. 26, the campaign's website was hacked and the authorities blocked its online petition. 
More than 100 women in Saudi Arabia claim to have defied the ban so far. In January, the authorities seized the car of Tadamur Al Yami a mother of two, who posted a video of herself driving in Jeddah. 
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world in which women are not allowed to drive. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Saudi Authorities to abolish the ban.

0,Death Sentences and Executions 2013,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/death-sentences-and-executions-2013/,"Despite the setbacks in 2013, there has been a steady decline in the number of countries using the death penalty over the last 20 years, and there was progress in all regions last year.","""The right to life precedes everything. The primary aspect of human rights is the right to life. There is no correlation between the death penalty and decreasing crime rate.""
Shakib Qortbawi, former Minister of Justice of Lebanon, 11 October 2013 
2013 was marked by some challenging setbacks on the journey to abolition of the death penalty. Four countries – Indonesia, Kuwait, Nigeria and Viet Nam – resumed executions and there was a significant rise in the number of people executed during the year compared with 2012, driven primarily by increases in Iraq and Iran. 
Executions were recorded in 22 countries during 2013, one more than in the previous year. As in 2012, it could not be confirmed if judicial executions took place in Egypt or Syria. The overall number of reported executions worldwide was 778, an increase of almost 15% compared with 2012. As in previous years, this figure does not include the thousands of people executed in China; with the death penalty treated as a state secret the lack of reliable data does not allow Amnesty International to publish credible minimum figures for China. 
 view larger 
Despite these worrying developments, the overall data demonstrate that the trend is still firmly towards abolition. Excluding China, almost 80% of all known executions worldwide were recorded in only three countries: Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. 
Progress towards abolition was recorded in all regions of the world. Although the USA remained the only country in the Americas to carry out executions in 2013, the number of executions in the country continued to decrease. Maryland became the 18th abolitionist US state in May. No executions were reported in Europe and Central Asia last year. Constitutional and legal review processes in several West African countries created real opportunities for the abolition of capital punishment. For the first time since Amnesty International began keeping records there were no prisoners on death row in Grenada, Guatemala and Saint Lucia. 
Pakistan suspended once again its application of the death penalty, and no death sentences were implemented in Singapore, where six people had their cases commuted following the review of the country's mandatory death penalty laws in 2012. In China, the Supreme People's Court issued legal guidelines aimed at ensuring greater procedural protections in death penalty cases. 
Common to almost all executing countries was again the justification of the use of death penalty as an alleged deterrent against crime. But this position is becoming increasingly untenable and discredited. There is no convincing evidence that capital punishment is a particular deterrent to crime; mounting recognition by political leaders of this fact is reflected in this report. 
Many of those states that retain the death penalty continue to flout international standards and safeguards in relation to its application. Grossly unfair trials and the execution of people who were under the age of 18 at the time they allegedly committed the crime were again reported in 2013. The report also highlights the secrecy that surrounds the use of the death penalty in many countries. Numerous governments continue to ignore international legal standards that require family members and lawyers to be notified about executions in advance. 
 view larger 
This report covers the judicial use of the death penalty for the period January to December 2013. Amnesty International records figures on the use of the death penalty based on the best available information. As in previous years, information is collected from a variety of sources, including official figures; information from individuals sentenced to death, and their families and representatives; reporting by other civil society organizations; and media reports. Amnesty International only reports figures on the use of the death penalty which can safely be inferred from its research. 
In some countries, it is not possible to obtain reliable data because governments do not make figures for death sentences and executions available, while others actively conceal death penalty proceedings. In countries affected by conflict it is often not possible to obtain sufficient information to confirm whether any executions have taken place. 
Since 2009, Amnesty International has stopped publishing estimates on the use of the death penalty in China, where data on the use of the death penalty is considered a state secret. The lack of reliable data does not allow Amnesty International to publish credible minimum figures for the use of the death penalty in the country; however, available information strongly indicates that China carries out more executions than the rest of the world combined. 
The global figures in this report are minimum figures, meaning that the number of executions, new death sentences, and people under sentence of death is likely to be higher. The number of countries carrying out executions and imposing death sentences may also be higher. Where Amnesty International receives and is able to verify new information after publication of this report, the organization updates its figures online at www.amnesty.org/deathpenalty. 
Where ""+"" appears after a figure next to the name of a country – for instance, Yemen (13+) – it means that this is the minimum figure calculated by Amnesty International. Where ""+"" appears after a country name without a figure – for instance, death sentences in Myanmar: (+) – it means that there were executions or death sentences (more than one) in that country but insufficient information to provide a credible minimum figure. When calculating global and regional totals, ""+"" has been counted as 2, including for China. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The organization campaigns for total abolition of capital punishment.

Contact: Natalie Butz, [email protected], (202) 675-8761, @AIUSAmedia 
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – Ahead of his visit to Saudi Arabia on Friday, Amnesty International is calling on President Obama to take a stand for human rights by having a woman Secret Service driver during his visit and seeking a meeting with Saudi Arabian women activists who are defying the ban against women driving. 
""President Obama will arrive in Saudi Arabia just one day before women take to the streets to defy the world's only ban on women drivers,"" said Sunjeev Bery, Middle East North Africa Advocacy Director. ""President Obama should show his support by bringing a female Secret Service driver with him to the country. For too long, the U.S. government has put geopolitics ahead of human rights in its relationship with Saudi Arabia's repressive monarchy."" 
In a letter to the White House, the organization is urging the President to advocate for significant human rights reforms in his meetings with Saudi Arabian officials and take public steps to show U.S. support for human rights in the country. 
A diverse bipartisan group of over 50 Members of Congress has signed a congressional letter to President Obama urging him to seek meetings with Saudi Arabian women activists defying the driving ban and family members of imprisoned peaceful human rights advocates. The congressional letter also calls for President Obama to advocate for significant human rights reforms in his direct meetings with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud and other Saudi Arabian officials. 
The government of Saudi Arabia is extraordinarily repressive. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that forbids women to drive a car, and Saudi Arabian women continue to face many other forms of severe discrimination in both law and practice. The government imposes severe restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. Torture and other ill-treatment during detention and interrogation are common and carried out with impunity. 
As an ally of the United States, Saudi Arabia has been spared the blunt criticisms that U.S. officials make of other governments that commit serious human rights violations. 
Amnesty International is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning grassroots activist organization with more than 3 million supporters, activists and volunteers in more than 150 countries campaigning for human rights worldwide. The organization investigates and exposes abuses, educates and mobilizes the public, and works to protect people wherever justice, freedom, truth and dignity are denied.

Peacekeepers Are Nowhere to Be Found,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/happening-now-horrific-violence-and-u-n-peacekeepers-are-nowhere-to-be-found/,It's a miracle she survived. An 11-year-old girl was the lone survivor of a horrific assault on the village of Bouguere - in a country where sectarian violence has spiraled out of control.,"By Natalia Taylor Bowdoin, Amnesty USA’s Central African Republic Country Specialist 
It’s a miracle she survived. 
Amnesty’s crisis team met an 11-year-old Muslim girl in the Central African Republic this month. She was the lone survivor of a horrific assault on the village of Bouguere – in a country where sectarian violence has spiraled out of control. 
Amnesty came to this region to investigate reports of mass killings and forced evictions of Muslims. Throughout our travels, we found case after case of mayhem and death. 
 
We found a young girl crouching in the corner of an abandoned house. She had been there, alone, without food or water, for four days. The rest of her family had been killed. She was terrified, and so weak she could not even stand. 
To find her, we had just walked down a street littered with bodies, including 3 women and a baby. Small bundles of clothing were found near the bodies – indicating they were slaughtered as they tried to flee. 
Sectarian violence has spiraled out of control in the Central African Republic. Militias are carrying out violent attacks in an effort to ethnically cleanse Muslims from the country while Christian victims of earlier attacks continue to find no justice. 
War crimes are on the rise while the international community drags its feet. Help Amnesty push for a desperately needed increase in peacekeeping operations to protect lives and human rights and restore the rule of law. 
Tell the U.N. and the African Union to act quickly and decisively to protect Muslim men, women and children who remain in the country, restore law and order for Muslims and Christians. 
Peacekeepers could have prevented this massacre, but in too many communities, they are nowhere to be found. They have been reluctant to challenge the anti-balaka militias that are carrying out the barbaric campaign of ethnic cleansing against Muslims. 
Meanwhile, Christian individuals and communities have yet to find any justice or accountability for brutal attacks that ravaged their communities before the anti-balaka militias filled the power vacuum. Members of both communities are at risk. 
Tens of thousands of Muslims have been forced out of their own country. Others can’t leave for lack of funds for transport or fear of being attacked on the roads. Whole neighborhoods have been abandoned. Mosques and property destroyed. 
The anti-balaka militias themselves were formed in response to mass killings by Muslim militias linked to the former government – gripping the country in a cycle of violence and vengeance. 
The international community’s reaction to these human rights atrocities has been shamefully inadequate. We need your help to break through – please take action with Amnesty right now.",,"March 8, 2014 • Post",False
0,Celebrate International Women’s Day – Equality for Women Is Progress for All!,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/celebrate-international-womens-day-equality-for-women-is-progress-for-all/,International Women’s Day is also an occasion for global activists to focus world attention and rally together for the work that still needs to be done to combat gender discrimination.," 
By Rebecca Landy, Women’s Human Rights Coordination Group 
Saturday, March 8 is International Women’s Day – a day marking global recognition of women’s rights. International Women’s Day (IWD) was first celebrated in 1911 in Austria, Denmark,  Germany, and Switzerland as a day of demanding women’s rights to work, hold office, and vote. It wasn’t until 1975 that it was given official U.N. recognition. Every year, the U.N. designates a theme for the day. 
For 2014, the year’s theme is: Equality for Women is Progress for All. 
 
While it is a day to celebrate the successes of the international women’s rights movement, International Women’s Day is also an occasion for global activists to focus world attention and rally together for the work that still needs to be done to combat gender discrimination. This work includes challenging the global epidemic of violence against women and respecting, protecting, and fulfilling women and girl’s sexual and reproductive rights. 
Human rights are universal, but access to these rights is not. Around the world, women and girls are denied these rights because of their gender, including the human right to have control over your own body and health. 
The consequences are devastating. For women like Khumeni Bishwakarma of Nepal, who was 15 when she was forced to marry and developed uterine prolapse, a painful and debilitating condition. The risk factors for this condition are exacerbated by adolescent and repeated pregnancies and heavy lifting before and after pregnancy, which Khumeni had to do after each of her 10 pregnancies. 
[pullquote text=”Around the world, women and girls are denied these rights because of their gender, including the human right to have control over your own body and health. The consequences are devastating.”]Khumeni is not alone. Over 600,000 women in Nepal experience uterine prolapse. 
You can help put pressure on the Nepali government to recognize this urgent human rights issue and develop a plan to prevent uterine prolapse by ending the gender discrimination that puts women at risk of this condition. 
Sexual and reproductive rights do not exist in a vacuum. Critical factors like women’s economic insecurity and gendered powered hierarchies and discriminatory attitudes make violations of these rights more likely to occur. 
These are some reasons why each year the U.N. holds its Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), which takes place during or close to IWD at U.N. Headquarters in New York City. 
This year the 58th Session of CSW will meet from March 10-21, 2014. The CSW is the largest United Nations meeting addressing the situation of women, and brings together several hundred representatives from governments, U.N. entities and civil society (including Amnesty International). 
The timely priority theme to be discussed at this year’s CSW is: Challenges and Achievements in the Implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for Women and Girls. 
Amnesty is calling for strong agreed conclusions at CSW, including in the areas of gender equality, sexual and reproductive health and rights, and elimination of gender-based discrimination and violence. 
There are also other upcoming intergovernmental gatherings to focus on these issues. 
The U.N. Commission on Population and Development, in the context of the 20th review of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD+20), will take place in April. 
A total of 179 states, including the United States, signed the ICPD Program of Action in 1994. Governments agreed to make equality and empowerment of women a global priority and committed to providing sexual and reproductive health services and rights. 20 years later, many of these commitments have fallen short. 
Most of the 1.8 billion young people worldwide still struggle to access sexuality education and the sexual and reproductive health services they need – but you can help make sure these rights are prioritized. 
Now is the time to stand up for the rights of women like Khumeni in Nepal, and for women and girls around the world.

Amnesty International’s Donatella Rovera and Joanne Mariner report on the latest massacre in a town West of Bangui, where they saw the remains of dozens of men and women littering the streets and found an 11-year-old girl who had miraculously survived it all. 
As if the unfolding horror in the Central African Republic could not get any more shocking, the scene we witnessed in a remote town north-west of Bangui, left us stunned. 
We arrived in Bouguere on Feb. 13 to investigate a massacre that had taken place some three weeks earlier. More than 40 people had been killed by anti-balaka militias and most of the town’s Muslim residents had fled. 
 
But on arrival in the town, nothing prepared us for what we found. 
[pullquote text=”And then, we found her. Crouching in the corner of an abandoned house, a girl about 11 years old had survived it all.”]The streets were littered with bodies. We counted 21, including three women and even a baby. Dogs were feeding on some of the corpses. Some of the male victims were partially burned. The feet of one man had been tied together, evidence that that he had been taken prisoner before being executed. The residents said that there were more in the outskirts of the town. 
They had all been killed in an attack by anti-balaka militias on the morning of February 10, just days before we arrived. 
The small bundles of clothing lying where some of the bodies were found meant that people were caught and killed as they tried to flee. 
The Muslim area of Bouguere was eerily empty. Most of the houses and businesses had been ransacked and some burned down. Those who had not been killed had fled. 
And then, we found her. 
Crouching in the corner of an abandoned house, a girl about 11 years old had survived it all. She had been there, alone, without food or water, for four days. She was terrified, could hardly speak and was so weak, she could not even stand. 
She said her father was killed in the attack, and residents said her mother had been killed earlier assault. The girl was the only Muslim survivor and the Christian residents of the town begged us to take her. We took her to a place of safety. 
What happened in Bouguere is was shocking, extremely disturbing, infuriating. 
International peacekeepers were nowhere to be seen, even though the area had already witnessed violent confrontations between anti-balaka militias and Seleka forces resulting in the massacre of civilians three weeks earlier. 
It was one of those places where something tragic was expected to happen but somehow, the international forces, sent to protect civilians were nowhere to be seen. 
Boguere is a mining town, known for its gold and diamond trading, making it particularly attractive to looters. 
But these are revenge attacks. Previously, a notorious Seleka commander had made the town his home base, carrying out widespread human rights abuses against the local population and neighboring villages and towns. 
Christian residents recounted the abuses of the Seleka commander, saying that he once killed an entire family because the father had protected two men whom the commander didn’t like. It was the entire region’s fear and hatred of the commander, they said, that stoked the anger and thirst for revenge that lead to the recent attacks against the town’s Muslim population. 
He is believed to have been killed in the massacre on January 24. 
Sadly, what happened in Bouguere is not an exception. 
The following day, as we drove south to the village of Boboua, we found three bodies lying in front of a mosque. They were the village’s Muslim mayor, Adamou Dewa, his son Abu Bakr and another Muslim resident named Abdou. 
As we left, a frantic group of Muslim residents emerged from their hideouts in the bush and flagged down our vehicle. They told us that anti-balaka fighters had attacked their village three hours earlier and killed the three men. They said that there were only 200 Muslims left and they were under serious threat. 
“We were born here,” one of them exclaimed, “where can we go?” 
It was only then that African Union peacekeepers were arriving to ascertain what had happened. Too late for the dead, and they were not going to stay. With no protection, the remaining Muslim residents will have to leave for their own safety. 
Muslims are being brutally murdered or driven away from most towns and villages. 
In Mbaiki, for example, only one Muslim family remained, out of a previous population of several thousand. 
In Yaloke, once home to an estimated 10,000 Muslims, only 742 remained as of Feb. 13. 
The Muslim community of Boda is being protected from attack by French peacekeeping forces, but only as they prepare to to flee the country. 
The mass killing of civilians, destruction of homes, businesses and mosques are being used by the anti-balaka to “ethnically cleanse” the Central African Republic of its Muslim population. These are crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Massacres are a disturbing, common feature of the crisis in the Central African Republic. Day after day, men, women and children have been killed with guns and machetes, some left to rot in the streets. Many of those horrors are documented in our latest briefing. 
Muslim areas are left empty as the population is forced to flee to neighboring countries. 
The International peacekeeping troops have all too often been absent when and where they are needed most. Their deployment has not kept up with the pace of rapidly changing developments on the ground. And at times, they have been reluctant to challenge anti-balaka militias, and slow to protect the threatened Muslim minority. 
The international peacekeeping force must break the control of anti-balaka militias and station sufficient and well supported troops in towns and villages where Muslims are threatened.",,"February 23, 2014 • Post",False

However, despite the desperate situation, the international community has failed them.","By Donatella Rovera, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International 
The body of a 10-year-old boy, shot dead, whose hand had been cut off with a machete. 
The remains of the sons of a 76-year-old man who narrowly escaped death after anti-balaka fighters shot him three times and left him for dead. 
The lifeless body of a six-month-old baby, brutally murdered alongside 12 of her relatives in front of her cousin, who was forced to witness her father being decapitated. 
“They killed my children heartlessly. They were slaughtered in front of our eyes,” cried a Muslim woman whose four sons were killed by anti-balaka fighters in late January. 
Welcome to life in the Central African Republic. 
 
Over the last few weeks, I’ve been traveling around the country as part of an Amnesty International delegation. We visited the capital, Bangui, and towns in the northwest of the country, investigating case after case of mayhem and death. 
Hundreds of people, mostly Muslims, have been brutally murdered by Christian anti-balaka militias over the last few weeks. 
Their homes and shops have been looted and burned; their mosques have been reduced to rubble. Those still standing are covered with offensive graffiti. 
The situation is now so desperate that tens of thousands have fled their towns. Many formerly Muslim neighborhoods are now empty. 
“Everyone wants to leave,” a neighborhood leader in Bouar told me. “We’re all just waiting for the opportunity.” 
Some flee by car or motorcycle, joining long convoys that are escorted out of the country by Chadian or international troops. 
Others carry what they can in their arms and on their backs, jumping on dangerously overcrowded trucks. Some attempt to escape on foot, knowing that anti-balaka militias could attack at any time. 
On January 16, for example, some 20 civilians, including several children, were shot and hacked to death as they were trying to flee the town of Bohong. In another case, anti-balaka fighters stopped a truck at a checkpoint in the town of Boyali, forced all the Muslims to get off, and killed six members of a single family. 
But even those lucky enough to make it out of the Central African Republic alive face an extremely precarious future. The reception centers in Chad are overcrowded; food and water is a luxury, shelter extremely hard to come by and medical care almost non-existent. 
There’s no question that the exodus of Muslims from the Central African Republic is a tragedy of historic proportions. 
What is shocking, however, is that despite the desperate situation, the international community has failed them. 
The deployment of 5,500 African Union troops and 1,600 French troops in the capital, Bangui, and towns to the north- and south-west is inadequate. Brutal murders and other attacks happen every day. 
The sectarian violence against Muslims in recent weeks was predictable, and Amnesty International was already sounding the alarm last December. 
Yet international peacekeeping forces have failed to stop the ethnic cleansing. Obviously, they could not be expected to be everywhere or to have a soldier in front of every house, but they could and should have done more. For the tens of thousands of Muslims who have already been forced out of the country, it is too late, but others are still in the country and at risk. 
There is a real need for urgent action to protect the Muslim men, women and children who remain in the country. International peacekeeping forces must break the control of anti-balaka militias and station sufficient and well-supported troops in towns where Muslims are threatened. 
They must also be deployed to protect civilians in other parts of the country, notably in areas east of the capital, where the former regime’s Seleka forces are now regrouping and where there is a risk of a renewed outbreak of sectarian violence. 
Anything less will simply be disastrous.

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – ""The Syrian Government is meeting for the first time with representatives from the Syrian Opposition in what will hopefully be the first steps towards a sustainable peace. 
Meanwhile, millions of Syrians are enduring a second winter displaced from their homes. Half of the country is now dependent on humanitarian aid and millions of people still cannot access life saving assistance. In some areas, disease and starvation are rife. The current situation is unacceptable and defies the basic norms of a civilized world. 
Agreeing a negotiated peace is going to be difficult; however, committing to ensuring humanitarian aid reaches all those in need shouldn’t be. 
As a coalition of some of the world’s largest humanitarian and human rights organizations, we call on the international community to stand up for the people of Syria who are enduring the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. 
The reputation of the United Nations and the member states of the Security Council are at risk unless they can show the resolve and responsibility needed to end the crisis and until that time take steps to ensure humanitarian assistance quickly reaches those who need it.""

Notes for Editors: 
The CEOs are co-hosting a private breakfast with political, business and media leaders as well as holding high level meetings with senior representatives of countries with influence over the conflict and will be available for reaction and response to events at Geneva 2 peace talks throughout the week. 
Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: 
""The devastating consequences of the crisis in Syria are mounting on a daily basis. The opportunity presented by the Geneva II peace conference is one that must not be missed, which is why it is more important than ever that the issue of humanitarian access is not allowed to slip off the agenda."" 
Helene D. Gayle, President and CEO, CARE USA, said: 
‘In our work with Syrians affected by the conflict, CARE sees the incredible toll the war is taking on women and girls in particular, depriving them of safety, education, health care, and—in some cases—their lives. We call on all parties to prioritize and permit unhindered access to address the needs of vulnerable women and girls, both inside and outside Syria. We must also do more to support host communities in neighboring countries to better cope with the influx of refugees.” 
Neal Keny-Guyer, CEO, Mercy Corps, said: 
“As we enter the fourth year of war in Syria, we must do more to relieve the intense human suffering of millions of people in the region. We must shore up Syria’s neighbors. The years-long conflict and accompanying humanitarian crisis are destabilizing the entire region, with the potential to leave millions more people without homes and jobs and rob an entire generation of its future.” 
Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director, Oxfam International, said: 
“While negotiations will not resolve the crisis overnight, they should instead deliver a clear timeline and process for doing so. Time will fly this week – and every second in Montreux counts. The litmus test for success is clear. We need to see an immediate halt to the violence, which is tearing Syria apart, and concrete steps for improving the humanitarian situation. Whatever comes out of the talks, strides must be made to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of ordinary Syrians – this cannot be used as a political bargaining chip. All those people in desperate need, including in besieged towns and communities, must be able to access life-saving aid – the government and opposition must agree this as an absolute priority.” 
Jasmine Whitbread, CEO of Save the Children International, said: 
“Children in Syria have suffered immeasurably during this conflict, many of them having suffered torture and violence, or having witnessed it first-hand. We want parties at Geneva II to prioritise the needs of children and civilians in Syria and to ensure as a minimum, that humanitarian access is allowed, so that life-saving aid can reach them. We want to see a commitment to ensuring schools and health facilities are not targeted, and steps taken to end the use of explosive weapons in areas where civilians are likely to be maimed and killed.” 
Kevin Jenkins, President, World Vision, said: 
""The Syrian emergency is among the greatest tests in our generation of leadership and our humanity. We have little time left to do well in either dimension and must urgently unite for the sake of the children of Syria.""

Security Council authorized deployment of an African Union (AU) force.","Contact: Carol Gregory, [email protected], 202-675-8759, @AIUSAmedia  
(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – The international community must give peacekeepers in the Central African Republic all the means necessary to protect civilians or risk an escalation in atrocities that could spill over to neighboring countries, Amnesty International warned as the U.N. Security Council authorized deployment of an African Union (AU) force. 
The U.N. vote – which came just hours after clashes erupted overnight in the capital Bangui – authorizes deployment of AU and French troops to protect civilians, restore law and order and end the spiraling human rights violations and abuses. 
""The lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians hang in the balance, made brutally clear by these attacks on the capital,"" said Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International. ""The international community must do everything in its power to ensure these troops can effectively protect civilians and restore order to the Central African Republic. 
""The African Union and other sub-regional bodies must press countries to contribute troops and equipment. Other international organizations and donors must throw their full weight and resources behind the effort to restore the rule of law and protect human rights. Failure is not an option."" 
On December 19, 2013 up to 3,500 AU troops – some of which are already on the ground – are expected to begin operating as the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African Republic (MISCA). They will be bolstered by up to 1,200 troops being deployed as part of a separate French military intervention as authorized today by the Security Council. 
MISCA's one-year mandate means that a fully-fledged U.N. peacekeeping mission is off the table for now. The Security Council is due to review its performance after six months. 
""Given the extreme urgency of the situation facing the Central African Republic, six months is far too long to wait to assess the mission's progress,"" said Shetty. ""The U.N. should urgently gear up to transform it into a robust U.N. peacekeeping operation, with all the resources needed to turn this dire situation around."" 
Amnesty International has repeatedly voiced concern over how slow progress towards a robust peacekeeping effort has contributed to serious ongoing human rights violations and abuses in Central African Republic. 
The U.N. Secretary-General has said that up to 9,000 peacekeepers could be needed to restore law and order in the country, and has set up a trust fund for donor countries to help to finance MISCA. 
In addition to the deployment of troops, the Security Council resolution calls for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of all armed groups in the Central African Republic. It also urges an end to the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and for any former child soldiers to be reunited with their families. And it imposes a one-year international arms embargo on the country. 
Amnesty International called on all countries to cooperate with these initiatives. 
The organization also called on the U.N. Security Council to ensure that an international commission of inquiry – also established by the resolution – is adequately resourced to conduct its investigations into human rights violations. States are permitted to bring to justice anyone suspected of crimes under international law or gross human rights violations committed in the Central African Republic. 
The AU's Peace and Security Council pushed for an African-led peacekeeping mission in July, as the security situation deteriorated following the ousting of President François Bozizé in March. 
Since then, the violence has displaced upwards of 400,000 people and taken on an inter-religious aspect in some parts of the country. The situation has continued to worsen amid a security vacuum created when the Seleka coalition of armed groups disbanded by order of the transitional authorities. 
""The African Union has voiced its concern over the crisis in Central African Republic in the past. With the country slipping deeper into chaos, now is the time for words to be matched by action,"" said Shetty. ""AU member states from across the continent must urgently and fully commit to the peacekeeping effort in a bid to stop mass atrocities before the violence spreads further."" 
Amnesty International is closely monitoring the ongoing human rights situation in the run-up to the MISCA forces' deployment, with a team currently on the ground.

(WASHINGTON, D.C.) – Revenge killings are being reported across Bangui and other parts of the Central African Republic today in the aftermath of the military clashes that happened in the early hours of the morning, Amnesty International said today. 
""There is a consistent pattern of reprisal attacks after military incursions in the Central African Republic which leaves civilians exposed and in great danger,"" said Christian Mukosa, Amnesty International's Central Africa expert. 
""This underscores the urgent need for a credible and effective international peacekeeping force which can take action to protect those most at risk as crisis engulfs the country."" 
According to credible sources, many of those involved in today's fighting are believed to be child soldiers, some reportedly armed with machetes, iron bars and other basic weaponry. 
Reports have been received that more than 50 bodies have been brought to a mosque in PK5, one of the Muslim areas of Bangui. Many of the deceased had been killed by machetes or similar weapons. 
Dead and wounded people are being brought to hospitals across the city, although a final death toll has yet to be confirmed. 
Amnesty International has spoken to doctors from a number of different hospitals who have talked about the challenges faced and provided details about those who have needed urgent treatment. 
""Bangui is effectively in shutdown,"" says Christian Mukosa, who is currently in Bangui. ""Doctors are telling us that they are desperate to get to the hospitals to reach people in need of life-saving surgery, but they cannot do so, due to the insecurity that has swept the city."" 
The presidential decision to enforce a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. is expected to jeopardize the level of treatment available in hospitals, preventing medical staff from reaching the sick and wounded. 
""Hospital staff are being overwhelmed by the current crisis. One small pediatric hospital I spoke to this afternoon reported the arrival of 18 people injured in today’s events, including 10 children and eight women, all suffering from shrapnel injuries from mortar attacks. Other medical professionals told me about their frustration at not having enough staff or the right expertise to treat the sick and wounded."" 
People in Bangui are also reported to be leaving their homes to seek refuge in locations across the city. Amnesty International has received reports of more than 1,000 people who have fled to the Saint Bernard Catholic Church in Mandaba in Boy Rabbé.

0,Kenya’s Withdrawal From The International Criminal Court and Why It Matters,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/kenyas-withdrawal-from-the-international-criminal-court-and-why-it-matters/,There are several facts that are being ignored or distorted by the champions for Kenya’s withdrawal and these need to be exposed and discredited.,"On September 5, the Kenyan parliament passed a motion to withdraw Kenya from the International Criminal Court. The decision came about days before Vice President Samoei Ruto faced trial at The Hague following his indictment for committing crimes against humanity in the bloody 2007 elections violence. 
Last week, the African Union announced it would hold a special session in early October to discuss whether the AU members should withdraw from the ICC even as they announced plans to request that the hearings be transferred to Nairobi. The case has raised a critical and ongoing challenge to human rights in Africa: 
Can political leaders in Africa be held to account for committing serious human rights abuses? 
 
In 2007, the soul of Kenyan democracy was exposed to harsh realities with the onset of the ethnic violence that erupted after the highly contentious elections which saw President Mwai Kibaki win re-election for another 5 years. 1200 people were killed, some burnt beyond recognition, and others selectively eliminated, based on orders carried out by an army of youth. The silent horrors faced by the victims are etched in scars on the faces of survivors and are forever enshrined in their tent homes. 
The first witness to testify against Ruto was a survivor of the Kiambaa Church attack, where 50 people were burnt in a church where they had gone to seek refuge from an assault orchestrated by a gang of Kalenjin youth. A 37-year-old worker on a flower farm, he told Amnesty how gruesome it was. 
“I am a Luo…I have been a casual worker here in Naivasha for some time…I saw this when I was at the chief’s area. There were about eight of us who went to the chief’s house. While we were seeking refuge, we saw it happening, I saw people being chopped with machetes, and I told the police and they also saw,” Amnesty International reported. 
Sadly, accountability for the Kiamba incident and the rest of the Rift Valley violence remain unfulfilled. Efforts inside Kenya to bring the perpetrators to justice have stalled: The Waki Commission’s call for the creation of a special tribunal has not been answered. [pullquote text= ‘There are several facts that are being ignored or distorted by the champions for Kenya’s withdrawal and these need to be exposed and discredited.’] 
At the international level, the African Union Panel of Eminent African Personalities led by former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan handed over a sealed list of names to the ICC in July 2009 at the request of Judge Phillip Waki who led the Waki commission of inquiry into the violence. This was part of the peace accords that formed the coalition government between president Kibaki and his opponent Raila Odinga and helped end the violence. The ICC gave the Kenyan authorities until 2010 to move forward on creating a special tribunal focused on the Rift Valley violence or it would refer the case to the ICC’s Prosecutor. 
In August 2013, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda opened the case against Vice President Ruto which led to the public repudiation of the ICC by the Kenyan Parliament. 
There are several facts that are being ignored or distorted by the champions for Kenya’s withdrawal and these need to be exposed and discredited. 
First, the ICC has always been meant to complement national justice systems, not replace them. It’s designed to serve as the court of last resort, acting only when national courts are unable or unwilling to act, recognizing that national courts have a responsibility to investigate and prosecute grave crimes committed on their territory. Indeed the narrative around how we got to this situation underscores this fact: it was the Kenyan judge, appointed by the Kenyan government to investigate the violence, who asked Mr. Annan to give the names of potential suspects to the ICC. He did so out of concern that no effective action would be taken in Kenya by the Kenyan authorities. Four years later, the government’s failure to set up a local tribunal has proved Judge Waki tragically prescient. 
The lack of political will and leadership from the executive branch of government and political circus between Members of Parliament who supported establishing a local tribunal and those who chanted for days on end “Don’t be vague! Let’s go to Hague” meant the Kenyan Parliament never seriously took action to create the tribunal. Indeed records of the 10th Parliament Hansard show that neither former President Kibaki nor Prime Minister Raila Odinga tried to rally MP’s in the house to set up a special tribunal to try the suspects of the post-election violence  and as such the vote for a local tribunal fell below the two thirds threshold required. 
There is also the spurious claim that the ICC is anti-African as it now has cases underway against Omar Hassan Ahmad Al-Bashir, current president of Sudan, Lord’s Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and others. This claim is spurious. Firstly, the widespread support of African countries was crucial to the establishment of the ICC. The ICC’s Prosecutor and five of its judges are from African countries. Secondly, five of the investigations involving African countries were referred to the ICC by the African countries themselves, and two were referred to the Court by the U.N. Security Council. Thirdly, the Court has conducted or is conducting preliminary examinations in a number of other situations on different continents, including Colombia, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Venezuela and the Republic of Korea. 
It is also an outrageous claim when the cases against President Kenyatta and Vice President Ruto are on behalf of 1200 Kenyans (who were Africans) slaughtered by fellow Kenyans and allegedly at the behest of political leaders from their own countries. In making this claim, political leaders have both underscored that they alone represent the nation and the continent and that ordinary African citizen do not. This is not novel to Africa and goes back to continent’s emergence from colonialism when liberation fighters and founding fathers were accepted as the embodiment of new fragile political entities. Subsequent political leadership continued to appropriate this status onto themselves and further embedded the understanding that the political leaders continued to be above the law, even at the expense of their own citizens. 
At the start of 2013, Kenya elected Uhuru Kenyatta, the son of Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, president – despite concerns over his possible involvement in the Rift Valley violence dating back to the 2007 election itself. Kenyatta’s election and the vote in parliament send a clear message that the status quo of official impunity remains in place and that justice for the common person in Kenya will be the exception. This must be challenged. 
The ICC case must go forward and it must lead to effective justice and accountability, as well as greater stability in Kenya. It is not one or the other: Kenya and Africa need both.

0,Inside the DRC’s Artisanal Mining Industry,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/inside-the-drcs-artisinal-mining-industry/,"On top of suffering harsh work conditions, many creuseurs - meaning ""diggers,"" as the miners are known locally - are ruthlessly exploited by traders.","By Audrey Gaughran, Director of Global Issues at Amnesty International  
I have just left Katanga in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where my colleague Lisa Tassi and I were following up on Amnesty International’s work on mining and human rights in the region. 
In some ways this is easy to do. Besides mining – mostly of copper and cobalt – little else happens in southern Katanga. But two very different methods are employed to extract these minerals. Industrial mining, involving large multinational companies, is managed from air-conditioned offices and carried out with heavy equipment; small-scale artisanal mining is frequently done in sweltering heat by men (and in some cases boys under the age of 18) working with basic tools. 
[pullquote text=”Because they must survive, they have no choice but to accept these unfair terms of business.”] Artisanal mining can be a desperate business. On top of suffering harsh work conditions, many creuseurs – meaning “diggers,” as the miners are known locally – are ruthlessly exploited by traders who buy from them along a largely opaque supply chain. In theory, the state has some oversight of the system, but the reality is quite different. 
Earlier this year Amnesty International published a report exposing the horrendous conditions at an artisanal mining site in Katanga called Tilwezembe. One of the things we tried to unravel on our return visit is where minerals from sites such as Tilwezembe actually end up. Traders are key to that process. 
But the supply chain to take the minerals mined by creuseurs out of Katanga is complex. It operates with virtually no oversight, and no meaningful paper trail to enable minerals to be tracked from source to export. 
Katanga’s mineral traders include individuals who buy and sell as well as separate trading companies, some of which also process ore. In some cases, creuseurs work at mine sites controlled by these trading companies. The state (or the state mining company, Gécamines) gives these companies control, but seems to impose few safeguards. And so the creuseurs working the site – often through a deal between the trader and an artisanal mining cooperative – are obliged to sell directly to the trading company, with no system in place to ensure they get a fair price. 
Creuseurs, who may work underground for many hours each day, regularly report that they feel cheated by this system where they have to take what they are offered with no way to challenge the traders. Because they must survive, they have no choice but to accept these unfair terms of business. 
There is also very little done to ensure safety at the artisanal mine sites, and every year scores of creuseurs are killed or seriously injured. Although SAESSCAM – the government agency charged with training and assisting artisanal miners – is generally present at these sites, it has insufficient resources and limited power. 
We have been trying this last week to find out what happens to the copper and cobalt that is mined in such terrible conditions. Much of it goes to China, but who buys it and can we talk to them? 
The answer is no, because Katanga’s byzantine trading pipeline makes it almost impossible to track ore as it changes hands from an artisanal mine site to a trader to a processor and on to export, let alone track it to the final destination. 
In Kolwezi, a center for much of the copper and cobalt trade, we visited a depot where dozens of traders (Congolese and foreign) buy from creuseurs who arrive with sacks of minerals on bikes. Some of the creuseurs tell us that no questions are asked here – they bring, they sell; no one who buys from them knows where the ore comes from. They do not, themselves, have any way to measure the concentration of the ore they have mined. And so they accept the price. But they tell us that here, at least, they are free to offer their ore to a range of traders and sell to the highest bidder. 
By contrast, creuseurs working on sites controlled by trading companies face a monopoly. One man we met at the Kolwezi depot told us he worked on a site controlled by a trader and had smuggled out some ore to sell at the depot, as the price on site was too little for the hours of work and he felt he was not getting a fair deal. 
Traders sell to others inside Katanga where the ore is processed (or not) before being sent out of the country, often by the truckload across the Zambian border. Export paperwork gets filled out and filed, but by this stage in the process, the origin of the minerals has already been obscured. 
The life of a creuseur is harsh. The Congolese authorities can – and must – do more to protect people from exploitative and harmful working conditions. 
But those who buy the ore along the supply chain can also make a difference, if they insist on knowing from which sites the ore or minerals come and the conditions on site and the conditions under which it continues to be traded. 
Key questions need to be asked and information verified. However, this kind of due diligence is impossible if there is no proper recording and oversight, and if traders can buy and export without anyone being able to tell if the minerals are extracted in appalling conditions. 
In other parts of the DRC, including the Kivus, Maniema and northern Katanga, a system has been put in place for tracing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, and building documentation. If it can be done in these areas, then why not extend the program to Katanga’s cobalt and copper sector? 
Efforts to ensure fair work conditions for creuseurs have to take account of the fact that there is practically no other livelihood on offer to many Katanga residents. The answer is not to prevent artisanal mining, but to make it a safer and fairer business until longer-term solutions are found.",,"August 16, 2013 • Post",False

By Angela T. Chang, Advocate, Crisis Prevention and Response 
Amnesty International’s new report, ‘We had no time to bury them’ – War crimes in Sudan’s Blue Nile State documents in grave detail what is unmistakably a pattern of systematic, deadly and deliberate attacks against civilian populations in Blue Nile, Sudan, a region that has been locked in crisis and conflict since 2011. 
Since 2011, over 150,000 people from Blue Nile state alone, have fled across the border to languish in refugee camps in Ethiopia and South Sudan, with tens of thousands internally-displaced within Sudan itself. 
 
“My brother couldn’t walk because one of his legs had been broken a long time ago…I was in the mountain when the soldiers came…Mereh could only crawl – he tried to crawl away but the flames caught him and he burned…The bodies of these two old people were left in the village. We had no time to bury them.” – Survivor of attack on Qabanit village 
The Sudanese government claims it is fighting an armed rebellion by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-North (SPLA-N), but sadly, and not shockingly, satellite analysis commissioned by Amnesty International and witness testimony tells a very different story. Imagery collected between 2011 and 2013, corroborating survivor testimony, demonstrates the Sudanese Armed Forces’ (SAF) deliberate targeting of civilians – in the first half of 2012, the Sudanese government executed a scorched earth campaign coupled with denial of humanitarian access and aid, in a concerted effort to completely clear SPLA-N-held areas of Blue Nile of their population – opposition, civilian or otherwise. 
The widespread nature of these attacks is captured in these satellite images; village after village are bombed and attacked, with nearly all homes, mosques and schools are burned and destroyed. Men, women and children are literally forced to run for the hills, those who can’t make it – the young and the old, disproportionately – are burned alive in their homes or shot dead. The SAF’s signature tactic in Blue Nile state (and other armed conflicts in Sudan, including the current conflict in Southern Kordofan state) of conducting indiscriminate aerial bombardments using low-flying Antonov planes carrying unguided bombs that cannot be targeted, has been well documented as a violation of international humanitarian law. 
“When I heard the sound of the Antonov I yelled to my children to lie down on the ground,” said Yusuf Fadil Muhammed [father of Dahia Yusuf Muhammad, age eight]. “[The Antonov] dropped a bomb, and I heard my wife cry out, ‘my child,’ ‘my child,’ ‘my child.’ The plane circled back and dropped two more bombs….” 
These actions constitute war crimes which, given their widespread and systematic natures, may amount to crimes against humanity. 
The resemblance to Darfur cannot be ignored – the use of these very tactics is what led the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC) – where outstanding arrest warrants call for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and others to face charges of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. 
Yet, Omar al-Bashir (and other high-ranking Sudanese officials) not only remains comfortably at large, but continues to receive red-carpet treatment from a number of countries, including Chad, China, Iran, among others. Our coalition partners at BashirWatch have mapped out the countries who have hosted Bashir, along with those who have rescinded their invitations as a result of international outcry and grassroots pressure. The failure to date of justice for the crimes in Darfur are one of the contributing factors to the war crimes and likely crimes against humanity documented in ‘We Had No Time to Bury Them’.

5/30/2013 UPDATE: Success! What does it take for the Israeli military to stop imprisoning Natan Blanc? It takes Amnesty International and other activists making their concerns known and taking action. 
Natan Blanc’s father received a call from his son telling him that he had been informed that he would be released at the end of his current prison term. The decision apparently follows a decision by the Unsuitability (or Compatibility) Committee which – according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – is designed to deal with people with behavioral problems who are deemed unsuitable for army service. It is not a committee which explores whether someone is a genuine conscientious objector or not. In practice, it seems to work as a mechanism for the IDF to rid itself of the problem of conscientious objectors who have been repeatedly imprisoned by declaring their ‘unsuitability’ based on poor mental health or discipline problems. 
Natan is expected to be set free June 6th.  Thank you for taking action.  No further action is required at this time. 
 
Courageous, tenacious, 19 year old Israeli conscientious objector Natan Blanc is back in an Israeli prison for refusing to serve in the Israeli military for reasons of conscience. 
On completion of this current sentence, Natan will have served a total of 178 days in prison for refusing to serve in the army. On May 12th, he was sentenced to 28 days in military prison – his longest sentence to date. 
Amnesty International considers those imprisoned for total or selective objection to military service for reasons of conscience to be prisoners of conscience who should be immediately and unconditionally released. 
The right to object to military service on grounds of conscience is protected under international human rights law and although Israeli law does allow for pacifists to be exempted, the review committee for this process frequently rejects their cases. 
Over the years, many young Israelis have avoided the draft through mental or physical health deferments, or on religious grounds, and every year a handful of Israeli teenagers go to prison every year because they refuse to serve in the country’s army for reasons of conscience. 
What will it take for Israel to stop imprisoning its youth who refuse to serve in the military for reasons of conscience? 
Amnesty believes that the Israeli government should establish a fully independent and impartial body to assess claims of conscientious objection in a fair and transparent manner. 
For now, Amnesty has joined efforts with New Profile, Connection e. V.,War Resisters’ International, Yesh Gvul and Gush Shalom to call on Israel to release Natan Blanc -immediately and unconditionally – with a petition targeting Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon directly. Click here to add your name. 
An open letter addressed to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urging him to call on Israel to release Natan Blanc was drafted by Jewish Voice for Peace just last week and has already garnered several thousand signatures.   Click here to add your name to the letter. 
Kerry’s regular visits to Jerusalem and Ramallah, including his latest trip underway, are opportunities to draw attention to the plight of conscientious objectors in Israel and Natan Blanc’s case in particular.

0,Colorado Gov.: Should We As A State Be Taking Lives?,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/colorado-gov-should-we-as-a-state-be-taking-lives/,"Colorado's Governor granted an indefinite stay for Nathan Dunlap, who was set to be executed in August. In doing so the Gov. questioned the death penalty itself.","Governor John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado did something rather extraordinary on Wednesday, when he prevented (by granting an indefinite reprieve) the execution of Nathan Dunlap. Dunlap was scheduled to be put to death during the week of August 18 for a horrible crime, the 1993 murder of four people – three teenagers and a mother of two – in an Aurora, Colorado, Chuck E. Cheese. 
Hickenlooper’s reprieve was not based on anything having to do with Dunlap’s case, but was based on problems with the death penalty itself. As Hickenlooper writes: 
“It is a legitimate question whether we as a state should be taking lives.” 
 
Oregon’s Governor John Kitzhaber did something similar back in November 2011, when he used the granting of an execution reprieve to impose a blanket moratorium on executions intended to “bring about a long overdue reevaluation of our current policy and our system of capital punishment” – a reevaluation he hoped would put an end to “this compromised and inequitable system.” 
Colorado’s Governor Hickenlooper states that Colorado’s death penalty has also “not been fairly or equitably imposed.” He observes that the realization that capital punishment doesn’t work is becoming more widespread, and that his state is already one of 25 that have either abolished the death penalty or not carried out an execution in 10 years. He mentions that over two thirds of the world’s countries have similarly either not executed for a decade or abolished capital punishment altogether. He points out that most religions do not support the death penalty. And he notes the practical problem (which is really a moral problem) that it is getting harder and harder to procure lethal injection drugs from pharmaceutical companies that don’t want to be involved in state killing of prisoners. 
Colorado has had one execution in the last 45 years, and nearly abolished the death penalty in 2009. Hickenlooper suggests in his order, perhaps with a bit of understatement, that his decision is intended to “continue the intense conversation Coloradans are having about the death penalty.”

0,Escalating Attacks on Religious Minorities in Indonesia,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/escalating-attacks-on-religious-minorities-in-indonesia/,"Despite commitments made in local and international laws, the Indonesian authorities are failing to protect religious minority groups from the increasing attacks they are subject to.","Imagine a mob of 500 people with sickles and stones descending on your neighborhood, setting fire to houses, and driving you away from your jobs and community. This occurred in August 2012 in East Java, Indonesia, leaving one member of a Shi’a community dead and injuring dozens. At this time 168 people, including 51 children, are living in a temporary shelter. In the last two weeks, they have been denied clean drinking water and food supplies.  
Some of the villagers had previously been harassed by local government officials who told them to convert to Sunni Islam if they wanted to return to their homes.  Now, after eight months, the Sampang district administration has agreed to the demands from anti-Shi’a groups to forcibly evict the Shi’a community from their shelter in a sports complex and remove them from Madura Island in East Java. 
 
In the case of an Ahmadiyya congregation in Sukabumi, West Java, the mayor’s office informed the congregation that for “security reasons” they would have to hand over their building to the Indonesian Ulema Council and the Ministry of Religious Affairs or action would be taken against them. One month earlier, hundreds of members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), a radical Islamist group in Indonesia, had gathered outside the building calling for it to be shut down. Should the Sukabumi Ahmadiyya place of worship be closed, it would become the fifth Ahmadiyya place of worship closed in West Java since early April. 
In February 2013, five churches in Makassar, South Sulawesi were the target of arson attacks by unidentified persons using molotov cocktails. To Amnesty International’s knowledge, no one has been brought to justice for these attacks. 
Amnesty International has expressed concern over the increasing attacks on religious minorities in Indonesia in the past few years. Despite commitments made in local and international laws, the Indonesian authorities are failing to protect religious minority groups. 
The right to freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Indonesian Constitution. Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Indonesia is a state party, states that “this right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice” and that “no one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice.” 
As a state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the government has an obligation to ensure the right of everyone to enjoy an adequate standard of living including adequate housing (Article 11.1) and the right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (Article 12).

0,Joseph Kony Was Here,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/joseph-kony-was-here/,New report reveals LRA leadership’s movements over the last three years in the Sudanese controlled Kafia Kingi enclave.,"Now where will the US go on the ICC?
While international justice has seen many milestones over the last months, including the surrender of “The Terminator” Bosco Ntaganda, one of the most well known fugitives from the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains on the loose. Joseph Kony, the Lord Resistance Army’s (LRA) notorious leader, has so far evaded arrest. However, as of today, attempts to locate his whereabouts have gotten a considerable boost. In fact, thanks to satellite imagery, we might know the exact coordinates of his recent location. 
 
We recently provided some support to our colleagues from The Resolve, who today published the most authoritative account to date of the LRA leadership’s movements over the last three years, concluding that the LRA set up an encampment in the Sudanese controlled Kafia Kingi enclave. The report Hidden in Plain Sight: Sudan’s Harboring of the LRA in the Kafia Kingi Enclave, 2009 – 2013, draws on extensive field research, including testimonies from several LRA defectors. Their findings are corroborated by satellite image analysis that tracks in detail the establishment and development of the suspected camp since late 2011. It was abandoned sometime between mid-February and mid-March of this year, likely following an unrelated encounter with a group of LRA fighters that might have revealed the secret LRA location in Kafia Kingi. 
 
Crisis mapping and the LRA
Crisis mapping tools have been used extensively in the context of this conflict, both to track activities of the scattered LRA groups, as well as for geospatial predictive analytics. However, it is the first time we are aware of that commercially available satellite imagery was used to track a suspected war criminal, adding to the growing list of applications of remote sensing for human rights purposes. The analysis was commissioned by our very own Science for Human Rights Program, and conducted by the DigitalGlobe Analytics Center. While this was an exciting proof of concept for someone like me who specializes in utilizing remote sensing for human rights monitoring, there are some important lessons to be drawn. 
First, the identification of the likely camp in satellite images was only possible due to the detailed, traditional research conducted by Resolve investigators. As my colleague Michael Poffenberger from The Resolve put it: “To be credible, satellite imagery analysis usually needs to be paired with other sources of information.” I couldn’t agree more. 
Second, and most importantly, despite all technological progress, satellite images of the likely location of an ICC fugitive do not yield accountability. I am hoping that Joseph Kony and other ICC inductees from the LRA will soon be arrested in accordance with international law and face a fair trial in The Hague. However, eradicating the root causes that led to the emergence and “survival” of the LRA will take a long time. Only strengthening the rule of law and ending impunity for grave human rights abuses, no matter if committed by armed groups or security forces, will lead to much needed structural changes. This argument increases in urgency as the Central African Republic (CAR) continues to descend into lawlessness and insecurity, providing a potential new safe haven for the LRA. 
Will Obama amp up his leadership on international justice?
With likely protracted turmoil in CAR and at a time when countries such as Chad are abrogating their obligations to arrest ICC fugitives, it is crucial that the US reaffirms its commitment to the rule of law and a strong global system for accountability – international justice for the worst crimes under international law goes far beyond Joseph Kony. 
International justice mechanisms such as the ICC kick in when domestic mechanisms are not able or willing to hold perpetrators accountability. More than 120 countries have joined the ICC to date. Countries such as the United States, however, who repeatedly claim their support for bringing Kony and other perpetrators of atrocities to justice, have not. And while I applaud the US government’s recent expansion of their War Crimes Rewards Program to include Kony and others, the ultimate signal of leadership on accountability – the reaffirmation of the US signature to the Rome Statute of the ICC – remained until now as elusive as Kony himself. 
However, as my colleague Scott Edwards eloquently pointed out recently, “All Roads Lead to Rome” for the Obama Administration. We believe that President Obama has a historic opportunity in his second term to cement the United States’ commitment to international justice by reaffirming its signature to the treaty that established the ICC. With the renewed attention on Joseph Kony and the LRA, we hope you’ll join our campaign calling on President Obama to write just one letter for a letter, and signal your support for leadership in bringing fugitives from the ICC to justice.

They did it again. Israeli authorities have put 19 year-old Natan Blanc in prison for the ninth time for courageously putting into practice his conscientiously held beliefs and refusing to serve in the Israeli military. 
We have followed Natan’s on-going struggle through Urgent Actions and a blog posted on April 8, 2013. 
Amnesty International considers those imprisoned for total or selective objection to military service for reasons of conscience to be prisoners of conscience who should be immediately and unconditionally released. 
Natan has served some 130 days in jail already since refusing the military call-up for the first time last November. Every few weeks he is released, then tried and imprisoned again after repeating his refusal to serve in the army. 
 
Over the years, many young Israelis have avoided the draft through mental or physical health deferments, or on religious grounds. In October 2012, 17-year-old Omar Sa’ad, a Druze from the Galilee, refused in an open letter to the Prime Minister and Defense Minister to undergo a medical examination, the usual procedure for anyone once they become eligible for conscription in the Israeli army. In the letter he said: 
“I refuse because I am a man of peace and I hate all forms of violence, and the military institution represents for me the peak of physical and psychological violence.” 
He now could be arrested at any point and be taken to the induction base to undergo the medical examination. 
Noam Gur, 18, went to prison in April 2012, after declaring her refusal “… to join an army that has, since it was established, been engaged in dominating another nation, in plundering and terrorizing a civilian population that is under its control.” 
She served two prison sentences before being granted an exemption from military service. 
These courageous Israeli youth join a long line of ‘refusniks’ who have included those from Yesh Gvul, Breaking the Silence and other youth or ‘Schministim’. 
The right to object to military service on grounds of conscience is protected under international human rights law and although Israeli law does allow for pacifists to be exempted, the review committee for this process frequently rejects their cases. Amnesty believes that the Israeli government should establish a fully independent and impartial body to assess claims of conscientious objection in a fair and transparent manner.

James is just one of at least 200 to have disappeared in the Philippines over the past decade. James has not been seen or heard from since he disappeared from his hometown on September 17, 2008 when he was taken by armed men, claiming to be law enforcers. 
James is a part of the Igorot ethnic group, an indigenous minority from the Cordillera region in the northern Philippines. He is a founding member of the Cordillera People’s Alliance (CPA), a grassroots organization advocating for the rights of indigenous people. The military has vilified the CPA as a communist organization, and labeled James a communist. 
The CPA feels James may have disappeared as a result of the government’s anti-terrorism measures (Operation Plan Bantay Laya or Freedom Watch), which has unfairly targeted legitimate organizations that resulted to a series of extrajudicial killings, torture and disappearances throughout the country. 
 
While he was studying at the University of the Philippines – Baguio, James wrote in and edited the student paper. After graduating, he researched and wrote about the land rights of minorities. A few months before he disappeared, James complained to his family that he was under surveillance by the government. 
In the 4 1/2 years since his disappearance, James’ family has heard nothing from him, nor has the government informed them of his whereabouts. James’ family filed a writ of amparo, a Filipino legal remedy available when someone’s life, liberty or security is violated. A judgment was issued for the writ in 2009, which stated that authorities had to disclose James’ whereabouts. 
Despite a reversal of the granting of said writ to James’ family according to a Supreme Court decision in 2011, Philippine authorities including the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Director General of the Philippine National Police were ordered to continue the investigations and take the necessary steps: 
To celebrate James’ birthday, the Balao family, CPA and Cordillera Human Rights Alliance are calling on friends and supporters to fold a paper crane to call for the surfacing of James Balao. According to tradition, the folding of one thousand paper cranes grants your wish. 
Show your solidarity by posting a photo of your folded crane with a message that says “Amnesty International USA continues to demand from the Philippine government to expedite the investigation and immediately resolve the disappearance of James Balao. Justice and freedom for James Balao!” on your Facebook page and linking it here. You may also write a personal birthday message to James. 
Take action by writing to Philippine authorities to express concern over James Balao’s disappearance and to demand his unconditional release. You may refer to this sample letter: 
(Date) 
Dear ______________________, 
I am deeply concerned that the Philippine government has not produced any significant results in its investigation on the disappearance of Mr. James Balao. 
James turns 52 this year. He has been disappeared since 2008. His parents both passed away in 2011 after their endless search and without the benefit of knowing what happened to their first-born son. 
I understand that each day that James remains missing is a sorrowful experience for his family, friends and community. 
I trust that you will do everything in your power to continue the investigation, find James and bring him back – and bring forth justice – to his family.

0,The Courage of Youth – Israeli Conscientious Objectors,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/the-courage-of-youth-israeli-conscientious-objectors/,Each year a handful of courageous Israeli teenagers are imprisoned for refusing to serve in the Israeli military on grounds of conscience.,"&nbsp; 
Written by Nehal Amer, Social Media Specialist, Middle East Coordination Group 
Each year, a handful of courageous Israeli teenagers are imprisoned for refusing to serve in the military on grounds of conscience. Natan Blanc, 19, from Haifa has been imprisoned eight times in four months for his refusal to serve in the Israeli Defense Force (IDF). Amnesty International considers those imprisoned for total or selective objection to military service for reasons of conscience to be prisoners of conscience. Blanc spoke to Amnesty International about his motivation for objecting to military service in February 2013.  
“In today’s Israel, there is apartheid,” the teenager said. “No one is talking about granting Palestinians equal rights, or even the right to vote. I do not want to take part in this situation … I want to stand behind my actions and not to do things that are against my conscience.” 
Natan has served 116 days in jail since refusing the military call-up for the first time last November. Every few weeks he is released, then tried and imprisoned again after repeating his refusal to serve in the army. 
The IDF’s “Unsuitability” Committee, which can exempt individuals from conscription if deemed unsuitable for service, re-affirmed in March that Natan must serve in the army. He was imprisoned for the eighth time after reporting to the induction base and again refusing to participate. The whole process is expected to be repeated upon his next release scheduled April 15th. 
Over the years, many young Israelis have avoided the draft by seeking mental or physical health deferments, or on religious grounds. Repeated imprisonment of teenagers who refuse to serve in the IDF based on conscientiously held beliefs violates basic rights in many ways. In 2003, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that by repeatedly convicting individuals on the basis of their conscientious objection was effectively punishing them for the same offense over and over again – flouting their rights under international human rights standards which prohibit ‘double jeopardy.’ 
The right to object to military service on grounds of conscience is protected under international human rights law and although Israeli law does allow for pacifists to be exempted, the review committee for this process frequently rejects their cases. Amnesty believes that the Israeli government should establish a fully independent and impartial body to assess claims of conscientious objection in a fair and transparent manner. 
You can help Natan gain his freedom and let him know he’s not alone. Write to the Israeli authorities calling for the immediate and unconditional release Natan Blanc, Military ID 7571369.  Point out that where a state does not entirely exempt Conscientious Objectors from military service, then it must ensure the availability of alternative non-punitive civilian service as an alternative to imprisonment.

0,"The “Terminator,” War Crimes, and the Obama Administration: All Roads Lead to Rome",AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/the-terminator-war-crimes-and-the-obama-administration-all-roads-lead-to-rome/,"With the (hopefully) imminent transfer of “the Terminator” to the ICC, President Obama should strengthen the credibility of the US as a source of hope for those who long for justice by reaffirming the United States’ signature to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.","As news breaks about the surrender of the “Terminator,” Bosco Ntaganda, to the United States embassy in Kigali today, the US State Department was quick to note that it “strongly support[s] the ICC and their investigations on the atrocities committed in the DRC.” Further, Ambassador Stephen Rapp, head of the Office of Global Criminal Justice, tweeted “Bosco #Ntaganda surrenders in #Rwanda and asks to the taken to the #ICC. We are helping to facilitate his transfer.” 
This development, and the U.S. administration’s quick signaling of its intent to adhere to obligations to transfer Ntaganda to the court to answer charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity is welcome, and encouraging. Thus, I will not start with the call that “the US should take all steps to ensure the speedy transfer of Ntaganda to The Hague.” 
 
What Happened? 
Amnesty International, as part of a wide swath of civil society demanding the same, has been campaigning to see the fugitive Ntaganda appear before the ICC for years, as part of its broader effort to demand and secure justice for the Congolese people; it is natural to be curious as to “why now?” 
The story behind his surrender to the US embassy will likely take some time to emerge. With reports of in-fighting among the armed M23 group in the DRC, and reports over the weekend that fighters loyal to Ntaganda had been “routed” by a rival faction, it may be that he simply saw the ICC as a safe alternative to the faction’s deteriorating situation. Maybe he was “encouraged” to surrender. I will note that it was interesting—if not telling—that the news of the surrender was first announced by the Rwandan government…but enough speculation. 
What I am confident in offering is that his surrender is inseparable from the massive surge in pressure to secure justice for the worst of crimes under the law that is the charge of last resort for the ICC. The cumulative effects of the grassroots movement “Kony2012,” the Bashir Watch and justice for Darfur campaigns, the demands and actions taken to address the crimes in Syria, Sri Lanka, and elsewhere , and indeed the sustained call by activists to see fugitives from the ICC brought to justice (to name just a few), are yielding results. 
I am confident that Bosco Ntaganda’s “decision” to surrender for transfer to the Hague wasn’t much of a decision at all; rather, it was the only meaningful option left, given the climate made possible by the strengthened and increasingly global sentiment that the perpetrators of the worst crimes against humanity can no longer enjoy impunity. 
What Next? 
Now, as for what is next: the US should take all steps to ensure the speedy transfer of Ntaganda to The Hague. As of this afternoon, it looks promising that the US will do so. 
While the delivery of Ntaganda to the ICC to face charges for crimes he is accused of committing in the DRC will be yet another step forward for international justice, I needn’t tell this audience that justice for atrocities remains elusive. There are still fugitives from the ICC. There are still unanswered crimes in Sri Lanka, and no justice in sight for tens of thousands of Syrians who face atrocity today. 
Yet, the Obama administration can do more than hand over wanted fugitives. By deed and through action, the administration can continue to repair the credibility of the US on the international stage and—as President Obama offered in his second inaugural address—allow the US to serve as a “source of hope” for those who long for “human dignity and justice”. 
With the (hopefully) imminent transfer of “the Terminator” to the ICC, President Obama should strengthen the credibility of the US as a source of hope for those who long for justice by reaffirming the United States’ signature to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.

Today, nearly 3,000 people will be infected with HIV.  Yet, only 34% of young people in developing countries can answer five basic questions about HIV and how to prevent it. 
Around the world, one woman dies every 90 seconds from complications of pregnancy or childbirth—more than 350,000 women every year.  The vast majority of these deaths are preventable—child marriage, unsafe and unprotected sex, and inadequate care during pregnancy all contribute to this alarming number. 
Complications during pregnancy and childbirth, gender-based violence and AIDS are among the leading causes of mortality for young people. Complications from pregnancy are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls aged 15 to 19 in developing countries. 
 
These alarming statistics are all connected: they are what happen when people’s sexual and reproductive rights not fully respected, protected, or fulfilled. 
Being able to make your own decisions about your body and your life is a basic human right. Yet, according to UN estimates, the vast majority of the 1.8 billion young people globally still struggle to access the information, sexuality education, and sexual and reproductive health services they need for a safe and healthy life. 
Because of discrimination, violence against women, less access to education, and an intersection of additional human right abuses, women and girls are disproportionately affected when sexual and reproductive rights are denied.  Young women, for example, are at a higher risk of HIV infection than young men: there are almost twice as many young women living with HIV globally.  Women suffer high levels of injury and death as a result of unsafe abortion.Women die needlessly in childbirth. 
Everybody has sexual and reproductive rights. You have the right to: 
These human rights, set out in various international human rights laws and treaties, were reaffirmed in 1994 at the UN International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD). Leaders of 179 countries, including the United States, agreed to a Program of Action that would protect and fulfill these rights, yet commitments to these human rights have not been upheld! It’s time these promises were kept!  
You can help ensure everyone has access to the their full sexual and reproductive rights. 
Leaders are once again meeting (ICPD+20), and we’re calling on them to honor the commitments they made 20 years ago to secure these rights for current and future generations

0,UN Alarmed Over Syrian Humanitarian Funding Shortfall,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/un-alarmed-over-syrian-humanitarian-funding-shortfall/,"While the situation in Syria remains extremely volatile, one thing is certain: the prolonged humanitarian emergency will require a sustained commitment by the international community.","Ahead of a crucial donors conference for Syria tomorrow, UN officials are warning of a funding shortfall that severely might affect the response to the spiraling humanitarian crisis. John Ging, the Director of Operations for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), cited “a funding shortfall that is affecting the ability of the UN and its partners to deliver vital assistance, including food, water and medical supplies”, according to the UN News Centre. 
Already last week, Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos, urged more funding ahead of the donors conference: 
We also need more resources. The humanitarian community has requested US$1.5 billion to help displaced people and the communities hosting them in Syria – and in neighbouring countries – for the next six months. 
There is a funding conference on the 30th of this month, in Kuwait, which will be hosted by the Secretary-General of the UN and the Emir of Kuwait. We hope that the conference will yield the resources we need. If we do not receive these funds, we will not be able to reach the poorest and most vulnerable families who so desperately need our help. 
The funding concerns are even more worrisome considering the acute humanitarian situation in the region. As of today, more than 700,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries. Over the last month alone, 30,000 refugees fled to Jordan. Satellite images of the rapidly expanding Zaatari refugee camp are emblematic of the growing displacement crisis. 
While the situation in Syria remains extremely volatile, one thing is certain: the prolonged humanitarian emergency will require a sustained commitment by the international community to support affected Syrians and the neighboring countries that receive refugees. 
Who Is Funding The Syrian Humanitarian Response? 
We have produced a simple map that tracks funding to the various humanitarian appeals, both for the 2012 and the current appeal: In the first half of 2013, the UN seeks $1.5 billion in funding to respond to the humanitarian crisis. Around two-thirds of the requested funding is intended for assistance of refugees seeking shelter in neighboring countries, and is based on a projection of 1 million refugees by mid-2013 (see detailed numbers of Syrians refugees on our tracker). The total funding requests, including for relief inside Syria, “comprise the largest short-term humanitarian appeal ever.” The international community largely failed so far to meaningfully respond to the egregious human rights violations and to ensure accountability by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. Let’s hope countries will at least donate generously to the UN humanitarian appeal. 
Learn more. Watch this short video about Syrian refugees fleeing to Jordan.  
Note on the data of the funding map: The map is based on data provided by the Financial Tracking Service (FTS) of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The map shows funding by individual countries to the Syrian crisis (appeals and other reported funding) as reported to FTS and UNHCR only. Due to a time lag in reporting, it does not include most recent numbers, such as the $155 million in additional funding by the United States announced today.

For the better part of a year, Amnesty International has been documenting and reporting the long catalogue of abuses and outright atrocities committed in the country, by the Malian military and Junta government, and the various armed opposition groups in the North: amputations and other gruesome corporal punishment, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual violence, child soldiering, torture, stoning, disappearances, and arrests and killings based on ethnicity, to name just the most egregious.","(For a helpful cheat sheet of armed groups in the north of Mali, see the end of this post.) 
The notion that Mali faces crisis is not new. For the better part of a year, Amnesty International has been documenting and reporting the long catalogue of abuses and outright atrocities committed in the country, by the Malian military and Junta government, and the various armed opposition groups in the North: amputations and other gruesome corporal punishment, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual violence, child soldiering, torture, stoning, disappearances, and arrests and killings based on ethnicity, to name just the most egregious. 
Indeed, on this very blog, as early as May 2012, the situation in Mali was described as a “forgotten crisis” and by July, an “urgent crisis.” There are many human rights situations that could be called a crisis, to be fair. But with the catalyzed attention as a result of French intervention at the request of the Malian government last week, recognition of the crisis in Mali warrants an urgent appeal to stave off a disastrous worsening of the conditions and abuses faced by Malians, in the north and south, as well as those displaced to neighboring countries. 
International Action 
In the North, long-standing Tuareg and other secular armed opposition groups have been heavily supplanted by Islamist armed opposition in the last year. Cynically, it is the threats that these groups posed to the integrity of the Malian state and to broader regional stability rather than any human rights situation that was the impetus for the UN Security Council (UNSC) to invoke Chapter 7 of the UN Charter and mandate an African-led armed intervention in Mali in December 2012. 
Cynicism aside, UNSC Resolution 2085—authorizing political support, training and military action to restore control over the north of Mali—contains meaningful reference to human rights and civilian protection. Amnesty International voiced concern, however, recognizing that the pattern of abuses committed by state security forces and armed opposition in the past year suggested a likely increase in human rights violations associated with an armed intervention. 
This should be of little surprise—armed intervention and armed conflict in general are associated with increases in human rights abuses. Yet, I was optimistic. The operational timetable put deployment of the African-led intervention force well past summer, which provided not only cushion for securing funding and logistics for military planners, but offered a window to address a few critical human rights protections and compliance needs: 
1.      Human Rights Monitors: An absolute necessity for any intervention is the deployment of human rights monitors to observe the conduct of operations, and Mali is no exception. The presence and unfettered access of monitors is a vital part of ensuring compliance with international law and documenting any violations, and the remoteness of much of Mali requires careful planning and support for effective monitoring. 
2.      Ending Impunity: Particularly troubling is that among the Malian forces—as well as pro-government militia—are individuals who enjoy impunity for egregious human rights violations. As Amnesty has documented, at the outset of the conflict in the north, security forces responded to the uprising “by bombing Tuareg civilians, and arresting, torturing and killing Tuareg people apparently only on ethnic grounds.” Malian soldiers have been responsible for extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances, including the execution of 16 members of a movement of preachers (the Dawa), after being taken from a vehicle in Diabaly. This small Malian town has been the scene of the most recent, all-night bombing. Participation by culpable individuals in the 2085-mandated operations not only threatens any moral credibility of the civilian protection mandate, but would be a clear threat to civilians already at risk by the operations themselves. 
3.      Operational Planning and Training: With the originally-scheduled multi-month run-up to the deployment of the African-led force, there was ample time to develop operational rules to minimize threats to civilians as a result of operations. Most importantly, there was at least some time to train (vetted, non-human rights abusing) Malian forces on international humanitarian law and their obligations under the law, in order to further ensure the civilian protection mandate was achievable. And there was time to ensure that children were demobilized and removed from the ranks of militia and pro-government forces, and removed from the increasingly dangerous battlefield. 
4.      Humanitarian Response: Finally, though maybe too optimistic on my part, the time granted opportunity to gather resources and develop plans to address the humanitarian effects of intervention and concomitant armed conflict, made particularly challenging as a result of recurrent food crises in the north of the country, and the Sahel more broadly. Well before the planned intervention start window, hundreds of thousands were displaced, and many more in urgent need of assistance. Those already displaced or in need of relief would find themselves exceptionally vulnerable as hostilities increased. 
The French Connection 
Of course, the French intervention in Mali has accelerated the timetable for the deployment of the force– by a lot. The mandated 3,000+ force and operation originally planned for September or so must now be quickly assembled. Nigeria, one of the contributing states, says it will deploy troops within the next 24 hours. 
The other trappings of conflict and intervention have also been accelerated. UNHCR says tens of thousands have been displaced following French-Islamist clashes. Training for Malian security force counterparts on human rights law and the Geneva conventions has not taken place. Children are still at checkpoints, and may find themselves in the midst of hostilities, far from demobilized. 
And far from ending the impunity enjoyed by those responsible for reprehensible crimes among the Malian forces, the military ranks remain un-vetted, and we risk soon seeing perpetrators fighting alongside a Chapter 7-mandated force with international support, in the very places and among the very populations of their original victims. 
What Must Happen 
The crisis in Mali continues, and time is not on anyone’s side. 
Who’s Who in the North: 
Azawad National Liberation Movement (MNLA) 
The MNLA was established in October 2011 from the merger of several previous Tuareg groups. In particular, it includes Tuaregs who had fled to Libya and then returned to Mali after the fall of Mouammar Gaddafi. It declares itself to be “a revolutionary movement fighting for the right to have auto-determination for Azawad.” The MNLA asserts that it is a secular movement. 
Ansar Eddin/Ansar Dine 
The group Ansar Eddin (which means “Defenders of the religion” in Arabic) was created in December 2011. Unlike the MNLA, the group Ansar Eddin does not challenge the territorial integrity of Mali and declares its intention to impose the Shari’a across the whole country. 
Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) 
Deriving from the Algerian Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), Al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) was created following its allegiance on September 11, 2006, to Osama Bin Laden. They settled in the North of Mali, encountering no resistance from the Malian government. AQIM has fighters of various nationalities amongst its ranks, in particular Algerian, Mauritanian, Senegalese and Malian. Moreover, reports indicate the presence in the region of Boko Haram combatants (an Islamic group active in Nigeria), which has established links with AQIM. 
The Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) 
MUJAO was created, at the end of 2011, from a defection from the ranks of AQIM. The movement claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, at the end of October 2011, in the Tindouf region (Southwest Algeria) of three humanitarian workers (two Spaniards and one Italian) and then the kidnapping of seven Algerian diplomats on 5 April 2012 in Gao. 
Arab militias 
For years, the Malian government has delegated security tasks to an Arab militia in Timbuktu. In April 2012, a political official of this city told the Amnesty International delegation about the origins of this group: “The Arab militia is ATT’s creation [the Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré] to fight against armed Tuareg groups. It is equipped by the Malian government and trained by members of the Malian army.” 
Songhay militias 
Moreover, there are two Songhay militias (black populations living along the Niger River) called Ganda Koy (“Masters of the earth” in Songhay) and Ganda Izo (“Sons of the country”). The patriotic movement, Ganda Koy, was created by former members of the Malian army during the Tuareg rebellions of the 1990s. After the peaceful settlement of the Tuareg rebellion in the mid-1990s, most members of the Ganda Koy were integrated into the Malian army or administration or returned to civilian life, but members of these groups continue to harass Tuaregs.",,"January 16, 2013 • Post",False
0,Five Reasons That the LGBT Community in Turkey Needs Heroes Like Ali Erol… and How You can Help!,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/five-reasons-that-the-lgbt-community-in-turkey-needs-heroes-like-ali-erol-and-how-you-can-help/,"The LGBT Community in Turkey faces discrimination, violence, and government harassment. Learn how you can help.","Subject to state harassment and widespread discrimination, the Turkish Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender community faces dangers on all sides. 
Amnesty has long campaigned on LGBT issues in Turkey.  However, we can’t forget the heroic work of Turkish activists, who have – despite grave personal risk – worked to protect the human rights of LGBT individuals in Turkey.  Last month, one of these activists, Ali Erol, received the 2013 David Kato Vision & Voice Award in recognition of his work with KAOS-GL, one of the first and most important examples of an increasingly outspoken LGBT activism in Turkey. 
Ali Erol’s work is important, because, as Amnesty has reported, the LGBT community in Turkey faces powerful threats: 
1. Harassment and discrimination of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender individuals is a daily occurrence in Turkey.  In a recent case that received significant media attention in Turkey, Halil İbrahim Dinçdağ, a referee for the Turkish Football Federation was subjected to harassment, disavowed by friends and family, and suspended from his job when he came out as gay.  
Discrimination is reinforced by the government’s attitude.  Turkish officials have described homosexuality as “a disease” and rejected proposals for legal protections for LBGT citizens.  Homophobic comments from prominent government officials are the norm rather than the exception. 
2. Violence.  With horrifying frequency, this culture of discrimination has sparked violent attacks.  In 2010, for example, Ahmet Yıldız was shot and killed by his own father in what has been called an “honor killing.”  Amnesty continues to press for justice in the case.  Transgender Turks, in particular, have been subject to widespread violence.  Complaining to the police can be risky; Turkish police often treat those filing complaints as criminals rather than victims. 
3. Freedom of Expression.  The government has attacked expressions of LGBT identity through public morality laws.  Often these cases can be as absurd as they are tragic.  “Gay” is one of the terms blocked by a government-sponsored internet filter.  The film, Sex and the City II, was banned from Turkish cable television because RTÜK, the Radio and Television Supreme Council, saw its depiction of a same sex wedding as “twisted and immoral.”  
4. Freedom of Association.  Turkish officials have also attacked the rights of LGBT citizens to Freedom of Association.  LGBT groups in Turkey have been subjected to repeated audits and officials have attempted to shut them down under public morality laws. The government reportedly fined one LGBT group, Pembe Hayat, or Pink Life, for submitting required documentation too early! 
Although Turkish courts have upheld the right of association for LGBT groups, the Supreme Court of Appeals has noted that encouraging others to become lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender was not protected by the right of freedom of expression and could lead to closure.  The court’s concern may be absurd, but the result is tragic, providing a path for further legal harassment of Turkish LGBT groups. 
5. The problem of military conscription. Turkey has universal male conscription and, because it treats homosexuality as a disease, precludes gays from serving.  The reality for gays of military age is an ugly one.  Proving one’s qualification for exemption is a shockingly degrading process.  Obtaining the exemption effectively “outs” the individual, opening them to harassment and social sanction.  This exemption also limits later employment opportunities. 
Those who do serve in the military but are later discovered to be gay are treated as criminals, charged with having committed “unnatural intimacy,” and subject to dismissal.

Since June, fits of violence between Buddhist and Muslim Rakhine, and Muslim Rohingya communities have likely left tens of thousands displaced and scores dead. 
In the most recent incident of ethnic clashes, thousands of Rohingya muslim, but also Rakhine Buddhist, homes have reportedly been burned down. Part of the destruction was captured by a satellite image (courtesy of Digital Globe): The image of Kyaukphyu from October 25 shows a cindery scar on the face of the earth where hundreds of homes used to be (see the area before the destruction here). 
It’s one of the most striking satellite images I have ever seen (and remarkable for an area that often provides challenges for remote sensing due to vegetation and regular cloud coverage; for more background, please take a look at a previous Myanmar project done by the American Association for the Advancement of Science). Let’s hope that this disturbing visual evidence will help to garner the necessary attention to this widely ignored human rights crisis in the making. 
Getting access to the affected area through satellite becomes even more important as foreigners are generally not permitted to travel freely in Rakhine state, and despite the enormity of the crisis emerging there, local and international aid agencies do not have unfettered access to those without adequate food, water, and shelter. 
What has to happen 
The situation in Rakhine state remains tense. Recent news reports told of a “mob” of “several thousand” descended upon a Muslim Rakhine village. Another report talks about communities arming themselves, yet another indication of the risk of further violence. In order to address the crisis in the medium and short term, the following steps should be taken:

The Prize winner was announced at a ceremony hosted by the City of Geneva at Victoria Hall.","  
The Jury of the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders (MEA), met in Geneva today and selected the Venerable LUON Sovath as the 2012 Martin Ennals Award winner. The Prize winner was announced at a ceremony hosted by the City of Geneva at Victoria Hall. 
The Venerable Luon Sovath, a Buddhist monk from Siem Reap, Cambodia witnessed his family and fellow villagers being forcibly evicted from their homes in 2009.  Since then he has been a strong advocate against forced evictions, which remove families from their homes, often violently and with little or no compensation. Despite threats to his person, of arrest and disrobing, the Venerable Sovath, a non-violent Buddhist monk, uses videos, poems and songs to defend the right to housing. His advocacy touches powerful economic interests. The threats against the Venerable Sovath are very real. 
Venerable Sovath was selected from among three final Nominees. Also nominated was Nasrin Sotoudeh, an Iranian lawyer serving a six-year prison sentence in Iran for her human rights work. She is known particularly for her work on behalf of women and children’s rights, especially juveniles facing execution. The third nominee is the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, which reports widely on human rights abuses in Bahrain. Many of their key staff are currently imprisoned for their work. 
The New Chair of the Martin Ennals Foundation, Micheline Calmy-Rey, the former Swiss President and Foreign Minister, said: “This year’s  novel  format with three nominees made the jury’s decision particularly difficult. As a Buddhist monk, Venerable Sovath has managed to raise wider attention to the issue of forced evictions in Cambodia.”  
The main award of the human rights movement 
The Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders (MEA) is a unique collaboration among ten of the world’s leading human rights organizations to give protection to human rights defenders worldwide.  The jury is composed of the following NGOs: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, International Federation for Human Rights, World Organisation Against Torture, Front Line, International Commission of Jurists, German Diakonie, International Service for Human Rights and HURIDOCS.

0,Aleppo: Why We Should Be Alarmed,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/aleppo-why-we-should-be-alarmed-2/,"New documentation from Aleppo, including satellite images, shows why the world needs to be alarmed.","News reports coming out of Aleppo paint a grim picture of the confrontation between opposition fighters and the Syrian armed forces, who are describing this as the “decisive battle”. If the past 16 months are any indication, we have to brace ourselves for a new wave of human rights violations, as well as grave breaches of international humanitarian law. As has been extensively documented by Amnesty International and others, the atrocities committed in Syria have steadily continued to climb. 
For example, one of my colleagues who recently returned from Aleppo, documented crimes we believe amount to crimes against humanity. Her reporting from late May describes how government security forces and the notorious government-backed shabiha militias routinely used live fire against peaceful demonstrations in Aleppo, killing and injuring protesters and bystanders, including children, and hunting down the wounded, the medics who treated them, and opposition activists. 
Among those killed was Mo’az Lababidi, a 16-year-old schoolboy who was shot dead in front of the police station in the Bustan al-Qasr district of Aleppo. He attended a funeral procession of one of four demonstrators shot dead at a protest in the same area earlier that day. A mourner who was standing next to him when he was shot told Amnesty International that Mo’az was shot in the chest, collapsed and died immediately. 
With limited access to Syria (the UN announced a few days ago that it is pulling out remaining staff due to the deteriorating security situation), we are also deploying satellites to closely follow developments on the ground and to document any large scale attacks against civilians. The first images we released earlier this week confirm that the world needs to be alarmed. My colleague Scott Edwards, in a conversation with the BBC, explains the significance of the satellite images. 
A forewarning to those involved in the conflict 
By using satellite images to monitor and document ground developments, we are sending a clear message to all parties to the conflict: Any large scale attacks against civilians will be clearly documented so that those responsible can be held accountable. 
We will continue to monitor the violence in Aleppo, including through the use of satellite images, to document human rights abuses – and to ultimately hold the perpetrators of these grave crimes accountable. Satellite imagery is a tool we have used many times before to document violations during armed conflict, for example in Sri Lanka, Darfur and South Ossetia (and in Syria earlier this year). And while the wheels of international justice are arguably slow to turn, recent milestones have shown that even the most powerful people in the world cannot evade justice. Syria will be no exception. 
The body of evidence against the perpetrators of international crimes in Syria is growing. The global inaction in response to these atrocities is reflected in the dire situation of Aleppo today. Our call for justice stands: The UN Security Council must immediately refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.",,"August 10, 2012 • Post",False
0,Abused In Childhood Then Sentenced To Die: 5 Stories,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/abused-in-childhood-then-sentenced-to-die-5-stories/,"Why do people with severe child abuse in their backgrounds keep ending up on death row? Are they really the ""worst of the worst""?","&nbsp; 
Daniel Cook, abused since infancy and now facing execution on August 8 in Arizona, is just the most current example of someone who endured severe childhood abuse only to later face execution. (Cook has a clemency hearing on Aug. 3; the prosecutor opposes his execution and it can still be stopped.) 
There have been plenty of others. 
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. In its 1976 Gregg v. Georgia decision, the US Supreme Court allowed executions to resume but required that juries be guided to restrict death sentences to the worst crimes committed by the worst offenders (aka “the worst of the worst”). The Court also endorsed laws “permitting the jury to dispense mercy on the basis of factors too intangible to write into a statute.” Defendants with mitigating circumstances (like youth, diminished mental capacity, or a history of childhood abuse) were supposed to receive lesser sentences. 
So why do people with severe child abuse in their backgrounds keep ending up on death row?  Are they really among the worst? 
Here are five recent examples that Amnesty International has documented, in sometimes disturbing detail: 
All these men committed serious crimes.  But, as boys, they also suffered horrific childhood abuse, and their death sentences (and in some cases executions) make a mockery of the notion that we “dispense mercy”, or that we are limiting capital punishment to the worst possible offenders.  We are not.  (In fact, we can’t even keep innocent people off of death row.) 
More often, those who end up on death row are not the worst offenders, but those who experienced the worst childhoods, or had the worst (or non-existent) mental health care, or were saddled with the worst lawyers (see, for example, all five cases listed above). 
Recognizing this, three of the Supreme Court Justices who voted for Gregg have since expressed profound regret for that decision. 
One of them, Justice Harry Blackmun, announced his regret 18 years ago in a powerful dissent, writing: “The basic question–does the system accurately and consistently determine which defendants ‘deserve’ to die?–cannot be answered in the affirmative … The path the Court has chosen lessens us all.”",,"July 31, 2012 • Post",False
0,Fact vs Fiction: Arms Trade Treaty and Gun Ownership in the US,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/fact-vs-fiction-arms-trade-treaty-and-gun-ownership-in-the-us/,"As world leaders negotiate the first ever arms trade treaty, the Internet is buzzing with conspiracy theories that it would infringe on Second Amendment rights in the US.","As world leaders meet in New York this month to negotiate the first ever global arms trade treaty, the Internet has been buzzing with conspiracy theories that such a treaty would infringe on Second Amendment rights in the US. 
This is a fallacy, driven at best by misinformation and at worst by a deliberate effort to undermine the treaty. Given the incredibly lucrative arms trade estimated to exceed $60 billion annually (with the US exporting 34% of all weapons) it’s not a surprise that such a misinformation campaign has taken the Internet by storm. 
Here let me break down fact from fiction. 
Will the ATT stop the sale of handguns in the US? 
NO it will not. 
The UN General Assembly resolution starting the process on the Arms Trade Treaty explicitly states that it is “the exclusive right of States to regulate internal transfers of arms and national ownership, including through constitutional protections on private ownership.” 
No ATT can therefore infringe on that exclusive right. To that end, all the papers circulated by the Chair of the UN ATT (Ambassador Roberto García Moritán of Argentina) process clearly reference that right. 
Further, Ambassador Moritán has stated that the definitive goal of the small arms treaty “is to try to have common standards to be applied by all countries when they export or import weapons.” 
Furthermore, about the ATT, the State Department has said: 
“There will be no restrictions on civilian possession or trade of firearms otherwise permitted by law or protected by the U.S. Constitution. There will be no dilution or diminishing of sovereign control over issues involving the private acquisition, ownership, or possession of firearms, which must remain matters of domestic law.” 
What the ATT will do 
It will stop the black market in arms on global level. 
Every minute, someone dies from armed violence. Because of the out-of-control worldwide arms trade thousands more are injured, raped, forced into becoming child soldiers and worse. 
While the international community regulates things like bananas and dinosaur bones, there are virtually no global rules for the trade of products designed to kill and injure. 
There are several factors contributing to the crisis that is being caused by the global trade.  Key among those are: 
These factors contribute to and facilitate the black market as well as the terrible human rights abuses linked to this trade. 
An ATT would improve transparency and accountability, and would establish common standards to regulate the different kinds of transfers that make up the global arms trade. 
A robust ATT will require governments to establish stronger, more rigorous systems to manage and regulate their countries’ export and import of weapons and munitions. 
In short, the ATT will help keep weapons out of the hands of the worst human rights abusers and save countless lives.",,"July 6, 2012 • Post",False
0,The U.S. Finally Rethinking Solitary Confinement,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/the-u-s-finally-rethinking-solitary-confinement/,"A recent Senate hearing appeared to begin the process of rethinking U.S. overuse of solitary confinement which, if prolonged, can amount to torture.","Anthony Graves spent 18 years on death row in Texas, all in solitary confinement. He was the fifth and last witness to speak at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on solitary confinement Tuesday morning. 
Mr. Graves spoke eloquently and powerfully to a packed room and an overflow audience about his experience, the deplorable conditions, and the lasting psychological effects he cannot escape. He was exonerated and released from prison around two years ago, but still carries the scars. He spoke of watching completely sane individuals come to death row, and within three years lose their grip on reality. He described what it was like to live in a very, very small box 23 hours a day, forced to sit like a trained dog when guards delivered food. 
One argument against the death penalty is the danger of executing the innocent. It’s a strong argument – Mr. Grave’s case highlights this – but no one should have to live in the conditions he described. 
[pullquote source=”- Anthony Graves, who spent 18 years in solitary confinement before being exonerated.” text=”Solitary confinement makes our criminal justice system the criminal.”]As Amnesty International has pointed out in recent reports on Arizona and Louisiana, prolonged solitary confinement may amount to torture. The general consensus of Mr. Graves and all but one of the other witnesses at the hearing was that solitary confinement, if used at all, should be done so with more care and that better oversight is needed. 
The one witness in disagreement was the first witness to testify – Charles Samuels, the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. In his statement he stressed the need for solitary to ensure security in prisons, and to protect the safety for those who work there. But at the forefront of the minds of Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL) – chair of the subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights who presided over the hearing – Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Al Franken (D-MN) was how solitary confinement affects the mental health or prisoners. 
Mr. Samuels argued that only around 3% of prisoners suffer from mental health issues. However, Bureau of Justice statistics suggest that as many as 16% of adult inmates suffer from some type of mental illness, and that the number continues to grow. 
According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), placing mentally ill inmates in solitary confinement is one of the worst possible things that could be done. Mr. Samuels assured the Senators that mental health evaluations are conducted, that extensive procedures are in place to ensure that the wrong people don’t end up in solitary, and that the cases are constantly reviewed. 
But Pat Nolan, a former member of the California State Assembly and the current President of Justice Fellowship, painted a different picture. Having  visited super max prisons, he said there is little to no oversight or review process relating to solitary, and often the ones who get put there are not the most dangerous or the “worst of the worst”. 
Professor Craig Haney, a researcher and expert on prison life (who was involved in the Stanford Prison Experiment), and Stuart M. Andrews Jr., a South Carolina lawyer engaged in litigation over a lack of mental health care for inmates, were more in agreement with Mr. Nolan. They disputed Mr. Samuels vision of a prison system in which inmates are not subject to deplorable conditions, are treated fairly, offered programming and treatment, and their mental health is closely monitored. 
The United States has the world’s largest prison population, and has increased its use of solitary confinement since the late 1970s. As this hearing reveled, this has had serious “human rights, fiscal and public safety consequences.”  Even if prison is sometimes necessary, surely we can keep society safe without degrading the mental health of our prisoners, and without killing them.",,"June 21, 2012 • Post",False

0,5 Reasons Congress Shouldn't Gut Violence Against Women Act,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/5-reasons-congress-shouldnt-gut-violence-against-women-act/,"Crucial provisions in the Violence Against Women Act that would help protect Native American women, LGBT people and immigrant women from violence and exploitation are at risk.","The U.S. Senate is poised to vote to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)– a key piece of legislation that, since 1994, aims to protect women in the U.S. from terrible acts of violence and exploitation. 
But critical new protections in the bill – to protect Native American women, LGBT people and immigrant women in particular – are in danger of being left out. For example, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and others have indicated they may introduce an alternative bill that would strip out the amendments in VAWA that protect Native American and Alaska Native women. 
This would be a huge mistake. We need a strong bill that protects ALL women. With VAWA coming to a vote in the near future, here are five reasons (among many!) that the Senate should think twice about before gutting these new key protections: 
1. Native American and Alaskan native women face domestic and sexual violence at epidemic proportions. One in 3 Native women will be raped in her lifetime. Two in five suffer from domestic violence. Nearly 86% of rapes and sexual violence are perpetrated by non-Native men. 
2. Native American and Alaska Native women living in sovereign territory often face complex jurisdictional issues between state, federal, and tribal criminal justice systems, making protection, reporting, and prosecution nearly impossible. New VAWA provisions would improve access to justice for these women. 
3. Immigrant women in the U.S. often face higher rates of sexual harassment and of battering than other women, yet are less able to report these crimes due to their legal status, isolation and other factors. A 2004 study in New York City, for example, found that 51% of intimate partner homicide victims were foreign-born. 
4. Native women and girls are over-represented among trafficking victims in the US. Legal protections and services to victims are limited in general, and even less available to Native women. New VAWA provisions would help protect these women from sex trafficking. 
5. LGBT survivors of domestic violence often face discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender identity when attempting to access services. New VAWA provisions would help protect LGBT people from discrimination when they are in need of help. 
Don’t let Congress kick Native American women, LGBT people and immigrant women to the curb. Tell Congress to protect ALL women by supporting the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act today! 
And if you’re on Twitter, please retweet this message to Senator Hutchison to leave VAWA alone:

The trial of Nabil Karoui, the owner of the Nessma TV channel, is expected to restart on Thursday after it was adjourned in January. 
He faces charges of “violating sacred values” and “disturbing the public order” after his station broadcast the animated film, which has been criticized as blasphemous because of a scene which shows a representation of God. 
If convicted, Nabil Karoui faces up to three years in prison. 
“At a time when we are looking to the Tunisian government to set an example by enshrining full respect for human rights in the country’s new constitution, it is disturbing to see this trial continuing,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director of Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Programme.  
“Prosecuting and convicting people on the basis of the peaceful expression of their views, even if some might find them offensive, is totally unacceptable and not what we would expect from the new Tunisia. It’s reminiscent of the violations of the ousted Ben Ali government and must stop.” 
Nabil Karoui has been charged under Article 48 of the old Press Code and Article 121(3) of the Penal Code relating to spreading information “that can harm public order or good morals.” 
Persepolis, an award-winning film on Iran’s 1979 revolution told from the perspective of a young girl, provoked angry reactions when Nessma TV aired a version translated into Tunisian dialect in October 2011 . 
The home of Nabil Karoui was firebombed on 14 October following a protest outside the Nessma TV offices in central Tunis. Salafist activists are believed to have carried out the attack. He filed a complaint but to date Amnesty International is not aware that anyone has been held to account.

The 58-page Flawed Reforms: Bahrain fails to achieve justice for protesters reveals that piecemeal reforms have failed to provide justice for victims of human rights violations, despite the government’s insistence that it will learn from the events of February and March 2011. 
“With the world’s eyes on Bahrain as it prepares to host the Grand Prix, no-one should be under any illusions that the country’s human rights crisis is over,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director. 
“The authorities are trying to portray the country as being on the road to reform, but we continue to receive reports of torture and use of unnecessary and excessive force against protests. Their reforms have only scratched the surface. 
“The government’s huge financial investment in international experts to help them reform will go to waste unless it shows real political will to take difficult decisions – in particular, holding to account senior members of the security forces accused of violations, releasing prisoners of conscience and addressing the underlying discrimination against the Shi’a majority population.” 
Following the November 2011 report of the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) – sometimes known as the “Bassiouni Commission” – Amnesty International has found that despite some institutional and other reforms, the government’s overall response has been inadequate. 
Lack of accountability 
The government pledged to hold accountable members of the security forces responsible for violations against protesters and created a special office to do so. But Amnesty International said that this office lacks independence and impartiality and noted that only a handful of low-ranking security and police officers have been put on trial. 
No senior members of the security forces, including the National Security Agency and Bahrain Defence Force, have been held to account. A number of security officers accused of being responsible for torture during last year’s protests are believed to still be in their posts without having been investigated. 
Even the eight policemen, including two Bahraini nationals, known to have been charged in connection with deaths during protests have not been suspended and are reported to remain in their roles at the Ministry of Interior while the case proceeds. 
Prisoners of conscience 
Scores of prisoners, tried unfairly in military courts and sentenced to long-term prison sentences, have not been released, even though they were convicted solely for leading and participating in anti-government protests without using or advocating violence. 
The cases achieving most prominence involve the 14 opposition members arrested in March and April 2011. The verdict in their appeal case is expected to be heard on 23 April. Several of the men have reported being tortured following their arrest. 
Charges against the men included “setting up terror groups to topple the royal regime”. Some of the prisoners publicly called for an end to the monarchy and its replacement with a republican system. They have not used or advocated violence. 
One of the men, human rights activist Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, has been on hunger strike for more than two months in protest at his unfair imprisonment. Amnesty International understands his physical condition is critical. 
In December, the Public Prosecutor ordered that all charges related to the right to freedom of expression should be dropped. But very few detainees have benefited from this measure, since the vast majority of people detained were charged with several offences, including “participation in an illegal gathering of more than five people”. 
Continuing violations by police in the midst of reforms 
Following the BICI report, the government has introduced a new code of conduct for members of the security forces, established a new office in the Ministry of the Interior dedicated to investigating complaints against the police and embarked on human rights training for police officers. 
But Amnesty International said that in practice, the security forces remain largely unaffected by these institutional changes. Although they have reduced the use of shotguns since late 2011, security forces continue to face protesters with unnecessary and excessive force – particularly tear gas, which has resulted in several deaths in recent months. At least 60 people have now been killed in connection with protests since February 2011. 
Amnesty International recognizes that the Bahraini security forces sometimes face groups behaving violently, such as by throwing Molotov cocktails at them or their vehicles. But the security forces must respect international human rights law and standards. 
Amnesty International has received reports that, at the same time as police reforms are being introduced with much fanfare, detainees are facing torture and ill-treatment in unofficial detention places, including unused government buildings, police vehicles and in open areas. 
Eighteen year-old student Hassan ‘Oun was arrested by policemen in civilian clothes on 3 January in ‘Arad district and taken to the Samaheej police station where he was interrogated. 
Hassan’s family told Amnesty International that when his lawyer saw him the next day at the Public Prosecutor’s office he saw signs of torture on his body and that his leg was swollen. Hassan ‘Oun told his lawyer that at the police station forced to stand up for about 11 hours and that he was beaten on his feet with a hosepipe and threatened with rape. 
The Public Prosecutor’s Office decided to detain Hassan ‘Oun for 45 days pending investigation and have since charged him with illegal public gathering. He was previously detained in connection with anti-government protests in 2011. 
Calls for change 
Amnesty International is calling on the Bahraini government to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience and to ensure that those suspected of torturing and killing, including those with command responsibility, are held accountable. 
“The establishment of the BICI was a real breakthrough and raised expectations that things would be different in Bahrain,” said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director. “Yet, nearly five months after the report’s publication, real change has not materialized.” 
“It is time for the Bahraini government to match its public pronouncements with genuine actions.”

Justice Minister Toshio Ogawa authorized the executions of three men, hanged in jails in Tokyo, Hiroshima and Fukuoka, explaining that this was his ‘duty’ as Minister. Executions in Japan are by hanging and are usually carried out in secret. Prisoners are typically given little or no warning before they are executed. 
“Today’s hangings are a hugely retrograde step – they bring Japan back into the minority of countries which are still executing,” said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Deputy Director. 
“Justifying acts which violate human rights as a ‘Minister’s duty’ is unacceptable. Rather it is the responsibility of leaders to address crime without resorting to the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.” 
Tomoyuki Furusawa, 46, was executed at Tokyo detention centre; Yasuaki Uwabe, 48, was executed at Hiroshima detention centre; and Yasutoshi Matsuda, 44, was executed in Fukuoka. Uwabe’s lawyers raised concerns that Uwabe suffered from mental illness but the courts ruled he was competent to stand trial.  
Two days ago, Amnesty International published its report on the state of the death penalty worldwide, noting the positive development that Japan had not executed in nearly two years. 
Amnesty International called on Japan to join the more than two-thirds of countries worldwide who have abolished the death penalty in law or practice and declare a moratorium on executions as a first step toward abolition. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

0,Maldives must investigate sexual harassment of detained women protesters,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/maldives-must-investigate-sexual-harassment-of-detained-women-protesters/,"Maldives authorities must immediately investigate allegations that police beat and sexually harassed four women detained during an anti-government rally, Amnesty International said.","Maldives authorities must immediately investigate allegations that police beat and sexually harassed four women detained during an anti-government rally, Amnesty International said. 
According to testimony gathered by Amnesty International, the women, who were arrested on 19 March, were beaten during and after their arrest. 
While in detention they were forced to undergo naked body checks on the spurious suspicion of concealing drugs in their genitals. They were forced to strip and squat several times while in prison. 
“The Maldives has an image as a luxury holiday destination, and over the past few years, it had established a positive track record on human rights. But the fact is at the moment, not only is repression of peaceful political protest an everyday reality, it has taken an appalling new twist with this cruel and degrading treatment,” said Amnesty International’s Maldives researcher Abbas Faiz. 
“The government of Maldives must ensure that these allegations are investigated and that those found to be responsible are brought to justice. 
“The beating and sexual harassment of political detainees under the pretext that they are suspected of possessing drugs must end. None of the four women detainees had been arrested on that suspicion so there was no justification for the searches.” 
The rally on 19 March was organized by the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) to protest about the opening of parliament where the new President, Dr Waheed was to give a speech. 
Protests have continued in the capital Malé and other cities since 7 February in support of former president, Mohamed Nasheed who was ousted after a police and military mutiny. 
There is no indication that the women protesters were involved in any acts of violence during the rally. Their detention therefore was arbitrary. 
Cases of molestation and other humiliating sexual acts against women have been reported in the past, but these latest allegations highlight a new police drive to suppress political activity under the pretext of body searching female detainees for alleged possession of drugs. 
Maldives police has denied the allegations and said those aggrieved should ask Maldives Human Rights Commission (MHRC) to investigate their allegations. 
But the MHRC has told Amnesty International that they have serious limitations in terms of trained investigative staff and dealing with human rights issues in a highly politicized environment is an overwhelming challenge for them. The MHRC has yet to complete investigations into the alleged sexual harassment of female detainees in 2004. 
“By referring cases of police abuse of power to the MHRC, when it is clear that such investigations are beyond its capacity, the government is in effect forfeiting its own responsibility to enforce respect for human rights within the police force,” said Abbas Faiz 
“This is the wrong message to give to the police as it will encourage police officers to violate human rights with impunity. The Maldives government must ensure that the right to freedom of assembly and expression is protected at all times.” 
Case testimonies 
Yusra Hussein, 22, told Amnesty International that four women police officers arrested her around lunch time on 19 March, near the Maldivian Democratic Party offices. She said: “They beat me as they handcuffed me. They beat me on my stomach, which was very painful as I had had a caesarean section in the past. They grabbed my breasts and twisted them.” 
They then took her from the police station to the Dhoonidoo detention centre, on an island about 5km north-west of Malé. “They beat me there with electric cables. I still have marks of their beating on my body. They then forced me to strip naked and made me squat on the floor. They took a urine test and did a body check on me. 
“They forced me to sit in that position for a body check several time. Each time I felt sick but they paid no attention. They just wanted to humiliate me as they were shouting filthy words at me all the while.” 
Aishath Muna, said police arrested her after she had taken another female protester to hospital. Police had pepper sprayed the protester and she had been feeling sick. When Aishath Muna returned to the MDP offices, two policewomen arrested her. She said the handcuffs which they used on her were very tight. She complained but they took no notice. She was then taken to Dhoonidhoo detention centre where she was forced to take off her clothes and undergo a body check. 
Mariyam Waheeda, 44, told Amnesty International that two women police officers who detained her on 19 March beat her and dragged her along the floor. They grabbed her breasts and twisted them while handcuffing her. She said they took her to the police station and only released her after she convinced them she had not taken part in the protest rallies. 
Aishath Aniya said she had been forced to undergo a urine test, was made to take off her T shirt, bra and jeans, and was told to squat three times.

0,George Clooney & Members of Congress Arrested Calling for Human Rights in Sudan,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/george-clooney-members-of-congress-arrested-calling-for-human-rights-in-sudan/,The arrests took place at the Sudanese Embassy in Washington DC on March 16. Activists were to there protesting the escalating humanitarian crisis in the Sudan.,"Just now, in an effort to raise awareness and capture media attention for the critical human rights crisis in Sudan, celebrity actor and activist George Clooney, Representative Jim McGovern (D-MA), Representative Jim Moran (D-VA), Ben Jealous (head of the NAACP), Tom Andrews (President of UEG) and John Prendergast (ENOUGH), and others were arrested for civil disobedience, in protest against the Sudanese governments’ actions against innocent civilians in South Kordofan and Blue Nile. 
Over a hundred activists turned out to join Amnesty International and others — including congressional human rights champions and partner organizations United to End Genocide (UEG), ENOUGH, Humanity United, American Jewish World Service, TransAfrica Forum — to protest the escalating humanitarian crisis in Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile. 
In both states (including the Nuba mountains), Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are conducting a campaign of indiscriminate bombing against civilians. The resulting destruction of livelihoods combined with the blockade of humanitarian aid is putting nearly half a million people on the brink of starvation. 
Amnesty International is urging the Security Council to act on the recommendations made by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights regarding South Kordofan, including: demanding the Government of Sudan grant access to human rights monitors; mandate an independent inquiry into alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law; and expand the current arms embargo to include the whole of Sudan–not just Darfur. 
“Stop the Antonovs!” 
Following an energizing rally at Sheridan Circle in Washington DC, where members of the Sudanese diaspora warmed up the crowd, George Clooney took to the mike to share his recent trip to a village in the Nuba mountains, which was bombed the day before their arrival. Clooney also testified earlier this week before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations at a packed committee hearing on “Sudan and South Sudan – Independence and Insecurity”. 
One of the most powerful observations that Clooney brought with him from Nuba was the activism that the people themselves are taking – under threat of immediate and further bombings, by holding up signs calling on the military to “Stop the Antonovs!” and calling for the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir to be arrested and taken to the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
As many readers may already know, Al-Bashir is a fugitive, wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide in Darfur. Al-Bashir, along with three other senior officials are charged with similar offenses, continues to roam free and the people of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile are paying the price for the ongoing impunity. 
This week’s historic verdict against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo by the ICC shows us that justice for international crimes is possible. While the impetus should be on governments to bring those responsible for offenses to account, the UN has also a critical role to play by providing political, diplomatic, and logistical support for efforts to arrest individuals named in ICC arrest warrants and to protect civilians in countries where the ICC is investigating crimes. 
Take action now to let the perpetrators know we are watching what is happening in Sudan. And we will not sit idly by.

Lubanga’s conviction sets a historic precedent for international justice and accountability for those who commit the most unspeakable of crimes. Crimes like rape. Torture. Enslavement. Crimes common among Lubanda’s Union of Congolese Patriots and its armed wing, the FPLC. 
In 1998, after nearly a decade of mass atrocities in places like Rwanda, Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, and the DRC, the international community came together to establish the ICC as a “court of last resort” to punish perpetrators of these crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide. 
The ICC is a vital mechanism to both insist that national authorities fulfill their domestic responsibilities to investigate and prosecute crimes – and to step in when they fail. 
On March 17, 2006, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was the first person to be arrested on an ICC arrest warrant for the use and abuse of children in armed conflict. While the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict by all sides of the armed conflict in the DRC continues, today’s verdict marks an important milestone that should give pause to those who think they can commit crimes with impunity. 
ICC Fugitives 
Today’s landmark decision, coupled with the recent spotlight on Joseph Kony, underscores the importance of the outstanding ICC arrest warrants for 11 other suspects of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide related to situations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, the Sudan, and Libya. 
Joseph Kony, Bosco Ntaganda, President Omar al-Bashir and other fugitives are often shielded by powerful supporters and states. The ongoing lack of justice means that most of these fugitives are free to commit more crimes, placing civilians in affected areas at great risk, and delaying justice for countless victims. 
Which of the 11 fugitives still at large will be next to appear at the International Criminal Court? The 11 with outstanding ICC arrest warrants are: 
What needs to be done? 
The UN has a critical role to play by providing political, diplomatic, and logistical support for efforts to arrest individuals named in ICC arrest warrants and to protect civilians in countries where the ICC is investigating crimes. However, elements of the UN often fail to play this important role. 
As a notable example, the UN Mission in Sudan went so far as to provide a helicopter ride to Ahmed Haroun, despite his fugitive status from the ICC on charges crimes against humanity and war crimes for rape and murder in Darfur. 
Take action with Amnesty now to ensure that the UN does its part to protect civilians by providing the necessary support in arresting the Lubangas and Konys of the world. The ICC fugitives must be held accountable for their crimes against our fellow men, women, and children.",,"March 14, 2012 • Post",False

Saudi women are responding positively to a royal decree granting them the right to vote, but they insist that they will not settle for partial rights. One of their most pressing targets is a continuing ban on their right to drive. “[Winning the vote] is a good sign, and we have to take advantage of it, but we still need more rights,” stated Maha al-Qahtani, one of the women who recently defied the ban on driving. 
Amnesty International agrees and continues to raise concerns about women’s rights in Saudi Arabia. Two days after King Abdullah granted women the right to vote, Shaima Jastaina was sentenced to 10 lashes for driving. Even though King Abdullah overturned Shaima’s sentence, the judicial action raises warning flags regarding the continuing discrimination Saudi women face. 
Since 1990, Saudi women have been banned from driving, a restriction which severely limits women’s freedom of movement. Women are also not allowed to travel by themselves and are strongly discouraged from using public transportation. The discouragement of women’s mobility is reinforced by severe measures of corporal punishment, including flogging. 
In 2011 Saudi women activists re-launched an internet campaign protesting the ban on women driving and calling on women with international driver’s licences to take to the roads. Scores of women got behind the wheel, and many filmed themselves driving and posted it on YouTube. Some were arrested as a result and were made to sign pledges to desist from driving: at least one woman was tried and sentenced to 10 lashes. The campaign has led to renewed scrutiny of the issue but so far has failed to force an overturn of the ban. 
On Thursday we mark International Women’s Day — another day on which Saudi Arabian women continue to drive to end discrimination. Support their calls for an end to the ban on driving and to the many other forms of discrimination and violence women face in Saudi Arabia.

Contact: Sharon Singh, [email protected], 202-675-8579 
(Washington, DC) — The United States must disclose details of the legal and factual basis for the lethal use of drones in Pakistan, Amnesty International said today, after President Barack Obama confirmed that the CIA is using the unmanned aircraft to target suspected militants in the country's tribal areas. 
President Obama made the rare public acknowledgment on Monday during an hour-long online video chat with users of the social network Google+. Amnesty International also called on the United States to monitor civilian casualties inflicted by drone attacks in Pakistan. 
""President Obama’s confirmation of drone use in Pakistan opens the door for improved transparency and accountability in the U.S. drone program: its scope, legal justification and provisions to safeguard civilians,"" said Tom Parker, Amnesty International USA’s policy director for (counter) terrorism and human rights. 
The President said that the drone strikes were a ""targeted focused effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists."" He asserted that the strikes targeted ""al-Qaeda suspects who are up in very tough terrain along the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan."" 
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will reportedly touch on the U.S. Government’s legal arguments in support of such killings by drone attacks in a speech on national security in the coming weeks. 
""The drone program has been conducted in secrecy for too long,"" said Parker. ""Attorney General Holder needs to bring some clarity to this debate by answering questions on the legal theory underpinning these operations, how targets are chosen and who decides when to pull the trigger."" 
Past justifications offered by U.S. officials have invoked legal justifications based on a ""global war"" between the United States and al-Qaeda, a concept that is not recognized by international humanitarian or human rights law. 
U.S. drone attacks have doubled overall in Pakistan during the Obama administration. Thousands of people have been killed by the strikes – civilians as well as suspected militants. Because of the security situation and difficulty in accessing the terrain, it has been impossible for organizations like Amnesty International to verify the number of civilian casualties caused by drones. 
In its June 2010 report, As If Hell Fell on Me: The Human Rights Crisis in Northwest Pakistan, Amnesty International said the use of drones to target insurgents in northwest Pakistan had generated considerable resentment inside the country. Available evidence shows that the number of strikes decreased during 2011. 
Amnesty International is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning grassroots activist organization with more than 3 million supporters, activists and volunteers in more than 150 countries campaigning for human rights worldwide.

0,"Repressive Regimes Rejoice, Twitter to Censor Content",AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/repressive-regimes-rejoice-twitter-to-censor-content/,Business decisions in the digital world have human rights implications. What will Twitter's decision to censor content mean for activists around the world?,"Twitter dropped quite the shocker last week when it declared its new policy to remove Tweets in certain countries to abide by specific national laws. While a tweet will remain visible to the rest of the world, specific messages will disappear in the target country (e.g., following requests by governments). 
The ensuing backlash saw a lot of people screaming “censorship” (ironically, on Twitter). While the first wave of criticism has quickly calmed down, for a human rights watchdog, the announcement is quite alarming: 
As we continue to grow internationally, we will enter countries that have different ideas about the contours of freedom of expression. …. Until now, the only way we could take account of those countries’ limits was to remove content globally. Starting today, we give ourselves the ability to reactively withhold content from users in a specific country — while keeping it available in the rest of the world. 
A new policy for old-school repression 
Twitter claims that this isn’t a dramatic shift in policy, but rather clarification of existing policy, with a “fix.” Previous removals of content were global, for example, when they removed a tweet, no one could see it anywhere. Now, country-by-country, Twitter can block content specially tailored to that country. In a bizarre logic, the increase in control of information in response to government demands means, according to Twitter—less ‘censorship’. 
One may incredulously respond that country-specific removal would further disadvantage people who saw Twitter as a means of circumventing illegal restrictions on their speech and expression. Further disadvantaging people who’ve turned to the service as a means of empowering themselves through voice, assembly, and access to information. 
Though there has been an outpouring of anger in response, some are quite pleased. Today, Thailand became the first government to publicly endorse Twitter’s decision. China and Iran haven’t made any statements (China’s state-run newspaper did praise the move), but I suspect they’re pleased, as are several other governments that have sought to shut down Twitter at the first sign of dissent. 
As an aside I should note that—as with any attempt to control information (see my post on SOPA/PIPA)—there are already easy ways—5 at last count—to bypass Twitter’s blocks. 
Outrage and tough choices 
I’ve appreciated the outrage, given the importance (not to be confused with value) of Twitter. I have no doubt that information posted on Twitter—and any other large public networking platform—has resulted in all manner of things, from the terrible, to the great. 
We know that information spread via Twitter has saved countless lives, from natural disasters such as in Japan or in humanitarian crises, such as in Cote d’Ivoire.  Twitter has contributed to regime change in repressive places.  It has even helped free a prisoner in Kashmir and has become a valuable network for citizen journalists and concerned citizens, such as in Mexico. It is a medium by which human rights advocates carry forward their work, such as our Eyes on Syria project (look for #EyesonSyria—but maybe not if you are in Syria), or Amnesty’s own twitter account. 
But for all of these goods, information on Twitter has surely created harm. In crisis, it can become a dangerous medium for rumors or misinformation (or “terrorism” charges). Al-Shabab’s recent banning of the International Red Cross (a violation of international law of the highest order) was communicated via Twitter. Indeed, Kenya’s military has been fighting Al-Shabab on the ground, as well as in the twitterverse. 
Importantly, information has no inherent value…it is the effect of the content that lends moral weight. 
Twitter has never had to make difficult decisions about that content, however. Twitter has never had to be responsible for controlling content in the manner its new policy will require of it. And Twitter will be called on by governments around the world to censor. The cat is out of the bag, and the decisions that will need to be made by Twitter lawyers and staff should give them sleepless nights. At some point—somewhere—harm will be done by those choices. Voices will be silenced. Lives will be lost. Twitter will inevitably make mistakes, and the world will be different as a result. It is a power it would have been wise to deny having. 
The stark fact is that—like traditional media, housing, agriculture, or any of the other sectors upon which humanity’s ability to full enjoy their human rights is dependent—profit motivates great innovations in the digital world. Profit also motivates consolidation and control. 
The source of the immense outrage over the policy says more about our collective confusion over digital networking tools than Twitter’s policy.  Twitter is seen as a public good. But it is not. Twitter is a (private) company, one that probably made over $100m in profit in 2011—though its profit potential may be an order of magnitude higher. It is a company like any other, with motives. As with other companies, we—as consumers—have leverage. 
But far from suggesting a boycott, let’s start with the basics. 
#International Law 
I appreciate Twitter’s appeal to the rule of law. Let me make my own. 
We have an international body of law that protects the rights of people, and sets forth the obligations of governments, businesses, and the everyday person. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations spend an exceptional proportion of their resources monitoring compliance with the law, and calling out those who violate human rights law. Not just governments, but businesses as well, from Shell and Dow Chemical, to cell phone manufacturers, mortgage banks, and private security firms. 
Allow me to offer a word of advice to Twitter: Laws often clash. In the US, there were laws on the books in the Southern states that were ruled unconstitutional long before they were finally scrapped. And there are surely domestic laws in countries that will be cited by governments or security elements as a basis for denying speech via Twitter that will clash with international human rights law. They will be illegal domestic ‘laws’ in contravention of established international human rights laws. They will be unjust laws. 
What will Twitter do? 
At some point, Twitter will be pressured by governments to change its Terms of Service so the work around for access to blocked Tweets becomes a use violation…Twitter does in fact know where you are tweeting from, and can deny your ability to change your location to circumvent information blackouts. 
At some point, user information and location will be demanded by a repressive regime with a cheap, and by international standards, meaningless veneer of a court order. They will demand it, and will appeal to domestic ‘law’. 
What is abundantly clear is that human rights monitors and advocates—for the immense power Twitter and other digital networking tools have given them—have an entirely new domain to monitor. As with other sectors, business decisions in the digital world have human rights implications. For the immense value of Twitter, the policy announcement only brings into focus what we’ve known for some time—human rights monitors and advocates have a lot more work to do since the digital revolution. Our collective vigilance is needed more than ever, however we chose to communicate. 
We will be watching you, Twitter. Take it as a measure of your importance.

(Washington, D.C.) — A hard-line group of Asian countries are defying the global trend against the death penalty and putting to death thousands of people after unfair trials every year, the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN) said today in a new report released at a press conference in Taiwan. Fourteen Asian countries, taken together, execute more people than the rest of the world combined. 

When Justice Fails, Thousands executed after unfair trials highlights, through the cases of people on death row, the struggle to secure a fair trial in eight of these countries. 

""Only a small number of countries in Asia are still using the death penalty but their actions cast a shadow over the entire region, with high numbers of people being sentenced after unfair trials, causing innocent people to be executed,"" said Louise Vischer, coordinator of the Anti-Death Penalty Asia Network (ADPAN). 

The report calls for action for eight people facing execution in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Pakistan. In each case a death sentence was delivered after an unfair trial, and in six of the cases conviction relied on confession extracted through torture. 

""The flawed justice systems in many of these countries creates a situation where people are executed after blatantly unfair trials where they have had little or no access to legal advice and may even have been convicted after being tortured into confessing,"" said Catherine Baber, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Asia-Pacific. 

Over half of Asian countries have abolished the death penalty or have not carried out executions in the last 10 years. Taiwan restarted executions in 2010 after a four-year break, despite declaring a policy of gradual abolition in 2000. Thailand resumed executions in 2009, despite committing to abolishing the death penalty in its human rights action plan. 

In January 2011, Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice admitted that Chiang Kuo-ching, a private in the Air Force, had been executed in error in 1997 for a murder he did not commit. The authorities acknowledged that a statement ""confessing"" to the crime had been made as a result of torture. 

""Only abolition of the death penalty can guarantee that no innocent person is executed. Government apologies for execution 'in error' can never be enough,"" said Hsinyi Lin, executive director the Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty (TAEDP). 

Chiou Ho-shun is Taiwan’s longest detained criminal defendant in its longest running criminal case. Sentenced to death for murder in 1989, he has been detained for more than 23 years. His case was described by lawyers as ""a stain on our country’s legal (history)."" Chiou’s case has been re-tried 11 times. He claims he was tortured into making a false confession. Taiwan’s High Court recognized that violence was used against Chiou but excluded from evidence sections of his interrogation tapes where the abuse could be heard. He lost his final appeal to the Supreme Court in August 2011 and could be executed at any time. 

Forced confessions are regularly relied upon as evidence during trials in Afghanistan, China, Japan, India and Indonesia despite laws against the practice. In India, Devender Pal Singh, currently on death row, claimed to the Supreme Court that his interrogators threatened to kill him and ""manhandled"" him to ""sign several blank papers."" 

""That a person can be sentenced to death when there is virtually no evidence against them beyond a 'confession' is the ultimate indictment of a society’s justice system,"" said Maiko Tagusari, secretary-general of the Center for Prisoners' Rights Japan. 

Prisoners facing the death penalty in Asia often have little or no access to lawyers, either before or during trial. 

Japan’s daiyo kangoku system allows the police to detain and interrogate suspects without a lawyer for up to 23 days, on the assumption that a lawyer’s presence would make it hard to 'persuade the suspect to tell the truth.' 

Chinese authorities can make it difficult for lawyers to meet with clients or access case files, and lawyers have been charged for introducing evidence that challenges the prosecution’s case. 

Under international law, the death penalty can only be imposed for intentional crimes with lethal consequences, and mandatory death sentences are prohibited. Yet some Asian countries impose the death penalty for non-lethal crimes, including drug trafficking and theft. Malaysia, Pakistan, Singapore, and North Korea are among Asian countries imposing a mandatory death penalty for possession of a certain amount of drugs. 

There are at least 55 capital offenses in China, 28 in Pakistan, and 57 in Taiwan. 

""All Asian countries must work towards abolition of the death penalty. Only then can they demonstrate their true commitment to fairness and justice,"" said Narendra, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), India.

 Louisiana Case to be Featured in Amnesty International’s Global Write-a-Thon

(Washington, D.C.) — Authorities in the United States must ban the imposition of life without parole sentences against children and review the cases of more than 2,500 prisoners currently serving such sentences to bring the sentences into line with international law, Amnesty International said today in a new report. 

""In the United States, people under 18 cannot vote, buy alcohol or lottery tickets or consent to most forms of medical treatment, but they can be sentenced to die in prison for their actions. This needs to change,” said Natacha Mension, U. S. campaigner at Amnesty International (AI). 

Children as young as 11 at the time of the crime have faced life imprisonment without parole in the United States – the only country in the world to impose this sentence on children. 

Amnesty International’s 34-page report 'This is where I’m going to be when I die': Children facing life imprisonment without the possibility of release in the United States, illustrates the issue through the stories of Christi Cheramie, Jacqueline Montanez and David Young. 

In the United States, life without parole can be imposed on juvenile offenders as a mandatory punishment – without consideration of mitigating factors such as history of abuse or trauma, degree of involvement in the crime, mental health status, or amenability to rehabilitation. 

""We are not excusing crimes committed by children or minimizing their consequences, but the simple reality is that these sentences ignore the special potential for rehabilitation and change that young offenders have,"" said Mension. 

In May 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court said life without parole is ""an especially harsh punishment for a juvenile,"" as the young offender will serve, on average, more years and a greater percentage of his life in prison than an older offender. ""A 16-year-old and a 75-year-old each sentenced to life without parole receive the same punishment in name only,"" the Court said. 

Eighteen months after prohibiting this sentence for non-homicide crimes committed by under-18-year-olds, on November 8, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to consider this issue in relation to crimes involving murder. It will not issue a decision until the second quarter of 2012 at the earliest. 

The U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which entered into force more than two decades ago, expressly prohibits the imposition of life imprisonment without the possibility of release for offenses, however serious, committed by people under 18 years old. All countries except the United States and Somalia have ratified the Convention. 

""It is long past time for the United States to ratify the Convention without reservations or other limiting conditions and to fully implement its prohibition on the use of life imprisonment without release against children, including in relation to the cases of those already sentenced,"" said Mension. 

On November 30, Christi Cheramie, who is serving life without parole in Louisiana, will submit an application for executive clemency with the state Board of Pardons. Christi was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of release in 1994, when she was 16 years old for the killing of her 18-year-old fiancé’s great aunt. 

She pleaded guilty just before her trial in adult court began, fearing she could be sentenced to death if the trial went ahead. Her guilty plea prevents her from directly appealing her conviction or sentence. 

A psychiatrist who saw Christi prior to her trial said that she was a ""depressed, dependent, and insecure"" 16-year-old who ""seems to have been fearful of crossing"" her fiancé, who she maintains committed the crime. Christi’s childhood was marked by sexual abuse. At the age of 13, she was hospitalized in a psychiatric clinic after trying to commit suicide on at least two occasions. 

After spending half of her life in prison, Christi believes she has changed in many ways. She has obtained a high school equivalency diploma, a degree in agricultural studies, and teaches a number of classes at the prison. A warden has stated that she is ""worthy of a second chance."" View a video of Christi’s grandmother and her conversation with Christi here:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AHsW9YbP1A&NR=1 

Christi will be among 15 people for whom Amnesty International activists worldwide will be taking action as part of Write for Rights – the Global Write-a-Thon on December 3 – 11. Hundreds of thousands of people worldwide will be educated about Christi’s case and asked to call on Governor Jindal to help. In the United States, more than 35,000 people are expected to participate in this annual event. http://www.amnestyusa.org/writeathon 

Additionally, on Dec. 3 in New Orleans, Amnesty International USA, the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, the Louisiana Interfaith Conference and Citizens for Second Chances will hold an event from 4 to 7 pm with a candlelight vigil, music and speakers focusing on Christi’s case at St. Anna’s Episcopal Church, 1313 Esplanade Avenue. For more information visit http://www.jjpl.org 

A clemency campaign is also pending for a second person whose case is profiled in AI’s report. Jacqueline Montanez is the only woman in Illinois serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for a crime committed as a child. A victim of child abuse, Jacqueline began abusing drugs and alcohol at the age of nine. Jacqueline’s abuser was her step-father, a gang leader, who also involved her in the drug trade as a very young child and groomed her to be his “little soldier.” After running away from home and joining a rival gang, she and two older women shot and killed two adult male members of her step-father’s gang. 

Because she was 15 at the time of the crime and charged with first degree murder, she was automatically tried in adult criminal court. This denied the court system the opportunity of conducting a transfer hearing to determine whether her case ought to have been tried in juvenile court where factors such as her young age, home environment or amenability to rehabilitation would have been considered. Jacqueline was also automatically sentenced to life without parole due to her conviction; the sentencing court had no discretion to consider her history, her age, the circumstances of the offense or her potential for rehabilitation. 

Now 35 years old, she expresses deep remorse for her actions and believes that she has grown into a very different person. She has obtained a high school equivalency diploma and has become a certified trainer of service dogs for disabled people. She grieves for her victims and the pain that their families have suffered. 

In Illinois, 80 percent of children in prison for life without parole received mandatory sentences; about 82 percent are prisoners of color. That number is even higher in Cook County, where the Montanez case originated. These findings were published by the Illinois Coalition on the Fair Sentencing of Children in its 2008 report Categorically Less Culpable, Children Sentenced to Life Without Parole in Illinois. http://www.law.northwestern.edu/cfjc/jlwop/documents/JLWOP_Report.pdf 

Jacqueline’s petition for executive clemency will be submitted to the Illinois governor and the Prisoner Review Board in January 2012. 

David Young is one of two teenagers arrested and charged for the murder of Charles Welch in 1997. He was automatically charged in adult criminal court as required by North Carolina law for any criminal offense committed by anyone age 16 or older. Young’s co-defendant, who shot the victim, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 19 to 23 years in prison. David was convicted of first-degree felony murder and was sentenced to life without parole. 

Young grew up in a hostile community environment where his parents abused drugs and his stepfather physically abused him and his mother. Now 32 years old, Young obtained his high school equivalency diploma and is in solitary confinement after being stabbed by two prisoners.

0,How Many More Syrians Have To Die Before The UN Acts?,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/how-many-more-syrians-have-to-die-before-the-un-acts/,The UN Security Council has failed Syrians so far. Join us in at the UN headquarters in New York on November 30 for a rally in support of peaceful protesters in Syria.,"Despite ongoing human rights violations, which we believe amount to crimes against humanity, the UN Security Council has shamefully failed the Syrian people so far. Several weeks ago, an already watered down resolution was vetoed by key members of the Security Council. Since this vote, the darkest hour of the Security Council in the context of the MENA uprisings, many more peaceful protesters were killed. 
In recent weeks, we have also seen sporadic armed attacks by army defectors against government forces, raising the specter of a full blown civil war. 
However, the days ahead are likely to bring increased attention and momentum for a stronger international response to the widespread and systematic human rights violations in the country. Within days we are expecting the Commission of Inquiry on Syria to publish its report on the human rights situation in Syria, followed by a potential special session by the Human Rights Council. 
Already over the last weeks, Syria’s neighbors have finally increased their pressure on Syrian authorities. Regional Foreign Ministers will meet again on November 24 to discuss future actions, while the Arab League is expected to reach out to the UN Security Council to secure a broader condemnation of the government crackdown. I am hoping that this new pressure, and the forthcoming human rights report by the UN itself, will force the Security Council to finally act. 
In order to build on this new momentum, we’ll be stepping up our public pressure to urge the UN Security Council to end its shameless silence. We are asking members of the Security Council to stop bickering and will bring the pressure right to the United Nation’s doorstep. 
Rally At The United Nations On November 30 
We ask you to join us at a rally next to the United Nations Headquarters in New York to call on the UN Security Council to end its shameless silence in response to alleged crimes against humanity committed in Syria. Our event will be at 1pm on Wednesday, November 30, at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza. We’ll gather with Syrian activists to call for a referral of the situation to the International Criminal Court, an arms embargo and for an asset freeze on President Bashar al-Assad and others involved in committing serious human rights violations. The action will be the peak of our ongoing Eyes on Syria campaign. 
Part of this action will be the creation of a powerful visual to remind the United Nations of the many civilians that were killed since the beginning of the uprising. 
#eyesonsyria 
Supporters around the world will join online by showing their solidarity with peaceful protesters in Syria through social media. Activists outside New York can follow the action and participate through the hashtag #eyesonsyria on Twitter. 
How can you help: 
Contact us if you have any questions about our upcoming Syria actions. To receive updates on this action and the latest developments in Syria and the UN Security Council, please follow me on Twitter.",,"November 23, 2011 • Post",False

(Washington, D.C.) — The international community must not turn a blind eye to human rights violations in Azerbaijan, Amnesty International said today in a new report released at a Baku press conference cataloging a clampdown on dissent since protests erupted in March. 

""The Spring That Never Blossomed: Freedoms Suppressed in Azerbaijan"" details a wave of intimidation and arrests around protests against corruption and the increasing suppression of independent media, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and opposition parties. 

Since March, youth activists and opposition figures have been jailed on arbitrary or trumped up charges while journalists and human rights defenders have been threatened and harassed. 

Amnesty International considers 17 people convicted around the time of the protests to be prisoners of conscience and asks for their immediate release. 

""The clampdown has sent out a clear and calculated message – that public expression of dissent will not be tolerated, nor will any attempt to galvanize public opinion against the current regime,” said Natalia Nozadze, Amnesty International's Azerbaijan researcher. ""The European Union and other international partners of Azerbaijan must take every opportunity to press for the release of the prisoners of conscience and to put an end to the suppression of peaceful protest, critical opinion and political opposition."" 

Hundreds of people gathered in the streets of the capital Baku in March and April this year demanding democratic reforms and greater respect for human rights. Inspired by mass protests in the Middle East and North Africa, opposition activists used social media to organize and disseminate information. 

The Azerbaijani authorities responded by banning the protests and harassing and arresting bloggers and activists. 

Following the protests 14 activists and members of opposition political parties were convicted of “organizing and participating in public disorder” and sentenced to up to three years in prison. Amnesty International believes that there is no evidence that any of the imprisoned opposition supporters were engaged in anything more than the legitimate exercise of their right to freedom of expression and association in seeking to organize peaceful protests in central Baku. 

The crackdown intensified the already heavy-handed approach of the authorities. 

Criminal and civil defamation charges continue to be used to silence critical media, while foreign media outlets were banned from national airwaves in 2009. Defamation continues to be a criminal offense under Azerbaijani law. 

""The government is tightening the noose on any form of communication by restricting access to information, printing paper and distribution outlets for independent media thus leaving the public in an informational black-out,"" said Ganimat Zahid, the editor of pro-opposition newspaper Azadlig, to Amnesty International. ""Increasingly, we rely on social media to fill the vacuum for informed debate."" 

The government is also currently considering laws that could potentially restrict web users’ access to information and criminalizing ""misinformation,"" further restricting online freedom of expression. Authorities began by targeting bloggers and online activists using online media such as social networking websites as alternative outlets for critical opinion, independent reporting, and the organization of protests. 

In February 2011, history student and opposition activist Jabbar Savalan was arrested after re-posting critical of the government articles on Facebook and using the social media to call for protests inspired by those in the Middle East and North Africa. He was beaten while in police custody to force him to sign a false confession and was sentenced to over two years in prison for the alleged possession of marijuana. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. 

Bakhtiyar Hajiyev, an opposition activist and co-founder of the Facebook group calling for the March 11 virtual protest against government corruption and oppression, was arrested three times starting in November 2010 for evading conscription and failing to register with the police. While in police custody he was punched, strangled and threatened with rape, allegations which have not been investigated. On May 18, 2011, Bakhtiyar was convicted of evading military service and convicted to two years in prison. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. 

""The cumulative effect of these practices, together with the long-standing impunity of the authorities for such actions, has instilled a climate of fear and self-censorship in Azerbaijani society, which is stalling, indeed reversing, the country’s transition to a stable democracy,"" said Nozadze. ""In oil-rich Azerbaijan, 20 years of independence, economic prosperity and relative stability have failed to translate into greater fundamental freedoms for its citizens while the consolidation of authoritarian rule over the last decade has been largely ignored by the outside world. The Azerbaijan authorities must reverse this trend and their international partners must make it clear that they will not do deals with those who carry out human rights violations."" 

Azerbaijan has a history of using trumped-up drug charges to jail those seen as critical of the government. One person, Jabbar Savalan, was convicted to two and half years in prison on May 4, 2011 for supposedly possessing marijuana. Authorities arrested him after he posted a Facebook message calling for protests against the government. A history student in college, Savalan was an active member of an opposition political party. He was convicted despite the blood test taken following his arrest, which showed no traces of drug use. He also did not have access to an attorney, was intimidated and assaulted by the police and forced to sign a conviction. Savalan maintains that he does not use drugs and that the marijuana was planted on him. The human rights organization believes the charges against Savalan were fabricated to silence him and has designated him an Amnesty International prisoner of conscience.

Contact: Suzanne Trimel, 212-633-4150, [email protected]  

(New York) &ndash; Two major oil spills in the Niger Delta, which gushed for weeks before they were stopped, have devastated the lives of tens of thousands of people, destroying livelihoods, undermining access to food and clean water and putting health at risk, Amnesty International and the Centre for Environment, Human Rights and Development (CEHRD) said today in a new report, which demands that Shell oil pay $1 billion to begin to clean up the pollution. 

The 50-page report, “The True Tragedy: Delays and Failures in Tackling Oil Spills in the Niger Delta,&rdquo; examines the widespread pollution and devastation caused by the oil spills in Bodo, Ogoniland, in 2008, neither of which have been cleaned up. 

&quot;Shell&rsquo;s failure to promptly stop and clean up oil spills in Bodo has devastated the lives of tens of thousands of people. Bodo is a disaster that should not have happened, yet it is one that due to Shell&rsquo;s inaction continues to this day. It is time this multi-billion dollar company owns up, cleans up and pays up,&quot; said Aster van Kregten, Amnesty International&rsquo;s researcher for Nigeria. 

The United Nations Environment Program recently found that oil pollution over many years had resulted in such devastation that it would take more than 25 years for Ogoniland to recover. The United Nations recommended setting up an Environmental Restoration Fund with an initial amount of $1 billion (U.S.), with further funding to follow. 

In 2008, two consecutive spills, caused by faults in a pipeline, resulted in thousands of barrels of oil polluting the land and creek surrounding Bodo, a town of some 69,000 people. Both spills continued for weeks before they were stopped. No proper clean up has ever taken place. 

&quot;The situation in Bodo is symptomatic of the wider situation in the Niger Delta oil industry. The [Nigerian] authorities simply do not control the oil companies. Shell and other oil companies have the freedom to act &ndash; or fail to act – without fear of sanction. An independent, robust and well-resourced regulator is long overdue, otherwise even more people will continue to suffer at the hands of the oil companies,&quot; said Patrick Naagbanton, CEHRD&rsquo;s Coordinator. 

Shell, which recently reported profits of $7.2 billion for July-September, initially offered the Bodo community just 50 bags of rice, beans, sugar and tomatoes as relief for the disaster. 

Ongoing damage to fisheries and farmland has resulted in food shortages and higher prices in Bodo. Residents told Amnesty International and CEHRD how they struggle to make a living and have serious health concerns. Alternative jobs are not easy to find. Many young people have been forced to look for work in Port Harcourt, the state capital, 31 miles away. 

One fisherman from Bodo, said: &quot;Before the spill, life was easy. The people could live from the catch of fish&hellip;After the spill, everything was destroyed.&quot; 

The pollution has also affected the drinking water. Before the spill, people drank water from creeks and other waterways, from wells or by collecting rain water. A local fisherman said: &quot;When the rain falls down, people used to collect it for drinking water. But today even the rain water is contaminated. It looks black. You cannot drink the rain.&quot; 

When Amnesty International asked Shell to comment on the failures at Bodo, the company stated that because the Bodo spills were subject to legal proceedings in the United Kingdom, it was unable to respond as directly. Shell said that efforts to address the issues at Bodo are hampered by ongoing sabotage in the area, something strongly challenged by Amnesty International and CEHRD. 

&quot;Shell frequently says that most oil spills are caused by sabotage,&quot; said Amnesty&rsquo;s van Kregten. &quot;This claim has been strongly disputed by the communities and NGOs who point out that the process of collecting data on oil spills is flawed. Even at Bodo, where it is accepted the spills are Shell&rsquo;s fault, the company appears to be using sabotage as an excuse for its failures to comply with Nigerian law and regulations &ndash; which require the company to promptly clean up and pay compensation. This is a completely untenable position.&quot; 

&quot;The facts here are simple,&quot; said Naagbanton. &quot;Two spills, both of them the company&rsquo;s fault, both left to flow for weeks before being stopped, neither cleaned up although three years have passed. There can be no excuses. By any standard, this is a corporate failure.&quot; 

Nigeria&rsquo;s government agencies are also strongly criticized in the report for their failure to enforce regulations. The Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources – which is responsible for ensuring the oil industry complies with regulation – is also charged with promoting the oil industry and ensuring maximum revenues. 

The Nigerian government agency responsible for oils spills – the National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA) – is under-resourced and ineffective. The agency has no independent capacity to identify oil spills and is dependent on being notified by the oil company responsible or by the affected community. 

The recent U.N. Environment Program report noted that in responding to oil spills, &quot;government agencies are at the mercy of oil companies when it comes to conducting site inspections.&quot; 

NOSDRA repeatedly failed to enforce standards in the case of the Bodo spills. 

Background 

On August 28, 2008, a fault in the Trans-Niger pipeline caused a major oil spill in Bodo. The oil poured into the swamp for at least four weeks &ndash; probably for as long as 10 weeks. Shell has recorded that 1,640 barrels of oil spilled; however, an independent estimate suggests that as much as 4,000 barrels a day were leaking from the pipe. The spill was eventually stopped on November 7, 2008. 

On December 7, 2008, a second spill occurred in Bodo, also due to equipment failure. This spill was reported to Shell on December 9, 2008. It took ten weeks until the spill was stopped. 

After trying for years to secure clean up and proper compensation from Shell, the Bodo community took their fight for justice to the U.K. courts earlier this year. The court action is ongoing, but has brought a measure of hope that the situation at Bodo may be resolved. 

Note to editors When asked to comment on the issues raised by the report, NOSDRA also responded with limited information. Nigeria&rsquo;s Department of Petroleum Resources did not respond at all.

They were holding a peaceful demonstration calling on President wa Mutharika to have a referendum for early elections, the resignation of Police Inspector General Peter Mukhita, and an investigation into his alleged involvement in the death of student activist Robert Chasowa. 
Though Malawi rarely receives significant international press coverage for human rights abuses, or much other news for that matter, the government in Malawi has been systematically restricting human rights and taking violent action to suppress criticism. 
This year alone, the British ambassador was expelled from the country for describing President wa Mutharika as autocratic, the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation (CHRR) was attacked, a national peaceful protest was met with violence, and a student activist murdered.  Malawi seems to need a serious refresher course in democratic process and governance. 
Police charged the activists with holding an illegal demonstration under the Police Act alleging that they did not get permission from the police. Amnesty International considers all the detained activists to be prisoners of conscience, arrested solely for exercising their right to peaceful protest, and calls for their immediate and unconditional release. 
Please write now to demand the immediate release of the activists and voice your concern over the state of human rights in Malawi.

Bush has reportedly raked in millions of dollars on the speaking circuit, and tomorrow he heads to British Columbia, Canada for another speaking event.  And, it looks like he will come and go with utter impunity. 
Something about that sounds wrong.  In fact, it is wrong:  Canada, as a party to the UN Convention Against Torture, has a legal responsibility to arrest, investigate and prosecute (or extradite for prosecution to a willing country) anyone suspected of torture.  So, it would seem that a Bush visit north of the border would prompt Canadian authorities to slap the former president with an arrest warrant. 
Bush, after all, authorized the use of “enhanced interrogation techniques,” such as waterboarding, during the CIA’s secret detention program.  He’s even admitted to personally approving the use of torture.  Yet, in all likelihood, the only thing he will get out of this trip will be a six-figure paycheck. 
President Obama is fond of “teachable moments,” but the only lesson to be learned from this episode is that the world continues to turn a blind eye to torture and other grave human rights violations.  More than two years ago, President Obama decided that his administration would not prosecute George W. Bush. 
Since President Obama refuses to bring the former president to justice, it becomes incumbent on other countries to step in.  Articles 5 and 7 of the Convention Against Torture explicitly provide for universal jurisdiction (the principle that all countries have an obligation to investigate torture suspects found on their territory, regardless of where the torture was committed) to ensure that nobody gets away with torture. 
What makes this all the more disappointing is that Canada has been a leader in efforts to strengthen the international justice system.  Embracing George W. Bush with open arms would discredit that legacy, running afoul of accountability, of justice, of right and wrong. 
Canada:  you’ve got a few days left to show the world that no one is above the law.  Please do so, before Bush gets away not only with torture, but also with pockets full of cash. 
Ask Canada to arrest and investigate George W. Bush for his role in torture.",,"October 19, 2011 • Post",False
0,U.S. Public Turning Away From Death Penalty?,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/u-s-public-turning-away-from-death-penalty/,"Public support for the death penalty is at its lowest since 1972, but it will still take a serious commitment to change the laws and abolish the death penalty.","In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned all U.S. death penalty laws, declaring them unconstitutional.  Public support for capital punishment was low back then, but by 1976, the death penalty had made a comeback and, 1,200+ executions later, here we are. 
Yet now public support for the death penalty is as low as it’s been since 1972, and the New York Times this weekend made the case that it may really be on its way out.  The number of death sentences and executions annually has plummeted over the past decade, and 24 of the 50 states have either abolished capital punishment or not carried out an execution in 12 years or more. 
In addition, the execution of Troy Davis was an eye-opener for hundreds of thousands of Americans, and exposed how horrifically and fatally flawed our capital punishment system actually is.  But these changes in public opinion and practice at the state level have not always translated into legislative votes repealing the death penalty.  To prevent future injustices, and to win more abolition victories, will require a serious commitment to get involved locally, and to stay involved until the death penalty in every state is nothing but an embarrassing chapter in our history books.",,"October 17, 2011 • Post",False
0,"In Istanbul, Forced Evictions of City's Most Vulnerable",AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/in-istanbul-forced-evictions-of-citys-most-vulnerable/,Dozens of families in Istanbul are facing forced eviction as a result of an urban regeneration project.,"Besra, a single mother with a small child, returned from visiting her mother in the hospital to find her door broken in.  Officials forced her to vacate her home immediately, throwing her belongings out onto the street. 
Another resident, an unemployed 60-year-old man with a lung condition, told Amnesty International that he had been forced to sign eviction notices that he was not allowed to read. 
According to Andrew Gardner, Amnesty International’s researcher on Turkey, 
“Most of those facing eviction have not been given adequate notice. They have not been consulted, provided with legal remedies, or offered adequate alternative housing or compensation. This is a violation of their human rights. There must also be an investigation into the allegations of harassment by public officials.” 
Other families threatened with eviction include some of Turkey’s most vulnerable populations: Roma, Kurds who settled in the Tarlabaşı district of Beyoğlu after being displaced from south-eastern Turkey in the 1990s, and transgender women, who, as documented in a recent Amnesty report already face considerable prejudice in accessing housing. 
Under international law, evictions may be carried out only as a last resort, once all feasible alternatives have been explored in genuine consultation with the affected communities. 
To ensure that the Beyoğlu authorities live up to their obligations under international law, write the following officials, asking them to suspend all forced evictions immediately and not to proceed until safeguards consistent with international human rights standards are in place, including a genuine consultation with the residents facing eviction, and that no evictions are carried out without adequate notice and remedies:

0,Will Texas Ignore Victim's Rights?,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/will-texas-ignore-victims-rights/,Rais Bhuiyan seeks to stay Mark Stroman's execution in Texas scheduled on July 20 so he can meet face-to-face with the man who shot him and left him for dead. Is that too much to ask?,"Update: Despite the efforts of Rais and Amnesty activists to stay the execution of Mark Stroman, he was executed last night by the state of Texas. But there is more work to be done in the fight against the death penalty. Learn more and take action on our website. 
 
Mark Stroman is set to be executed in Texas on July 20, despite the best of efforts of his one surviving victim to try to spare his life.  As readers of this blog will know, Rais Bhuiyan, a Muslim from Bangladesh, was shot and left for dead during Stroman’s series of attacks on Middle Eastern looking men after September 11, 2001. Bhuiyan’s efforts to halt the execution now include a lawsuit against the Lone Star State alleging that his rights as a victim have been violated. 
Both Bhuiyan and Stroman have spoken with CBS News (see video) and the New York Times about this extraordinary situation, but they have not had the chance to meet face-to-face, which is why Bhuiyan is seeking at least a delay in the execution. 
It will be interesting to see what respect the state of Texas offers for the rights of victims in this case, when it appears none of them want Mark Stroman to be put to death.  As the Dallas Morning News points out, retribution for the victims is one of the main justifications, cited by courts and others, for retaining capital punishment.   But when the victims do not want that retribution, what exactly is the point of proceeding with the execution?",,"July 19, 2011 • Post",False

Hamas is holding him as a 'bargaining chip' and have denied him basic human rights.","Corporal Gilad Shalit was only 19 years old when he was captured on June 25th 2006 by armed Palestinian groups, including Hamas’s military wing. 
He is 24 years old now.  On June 25th, it will be over five years since Aviva and Noam Shalit, Gilad’s parents, have been able to touch their son or speak to him directly – even by mail.  It has been nearly two years since they’ve even seen him on video or received any other proof of life. 
“As the days go by, we begin to despair of the day when we will see our son again. I know neither where he is held nor how he fares … or whether he is even alive.”  (Noam Shalit, Gilad Shalit’s father, addressing the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, July 6, 2009) 
Hamas, the de facto administration in the Gaza Strip, are holding him in a secret location and using him as a hostage to use as leverage when negotiating with Israel.  But, Hamas is required under international humanitarian law to ensure that he is 
Treating Gilad Shalit as a hostage is a flagrant violations of these obligations. 
Amnesty has been working on Gilad Shalit’s behalf since 2006, with different sections of Amnesty (AIUSA, AI-UK, AI-Ireland, and AI-Canada to list a few) undertaking different initiatives including the mobilization of individual members through letter-writing as well as higher level, behind-the-scenes Amnesty meetings that aren’t advertised publicly. 
On this, the end of the 5th year of Gilad’s captivity, Amnesty International is asking activists around the world to sign our petition to Isma’il Haniyeh, Prime Minister of Hamas, urging him to alleviate the suffering of Gilad Shalit and his family by immediately complying with its obligations under international law. 
Gilad Shalit’s family continue to campaign tirelessly for his immediate release or some assurance that he is alive and well.  The Hamas authorities though, say they will not release Gilad Shalit without the release of some of the thousands of Palestinians held in Israel. 
Amnesty, in its work on behalf of Gilad as well as Palestinian prisoners, continues to reiterate that neither Gilad – nor the Palestinian prisoners detained by Israel – should be used as pawns or bargaining chips. Each prisoner – Israeli or Palestinian – is an individual with basic human rights.  Any violation of international law by Israel or Hamas does not justify Hamas’s treatment of Gilad Shalit or Israel’s treatment of Palestinian prisoners that violates their rights. 
Gilad Shalit deserves to be treated as an individual and given his basic human rights as defined under international law.  To act, select to send a letter/email to Hamas through our online action, sign the petition to Isma’il Haniyeh, and/or write a letter to Gilad Shalit himself. Amnesty will deliver these letters of hope and support next fall when they deliver the petition to Hamas authorities.

The Omani authorities must say where and why they are holding some six people arrested during a recent peaceful protest in the capital Muscat, Amnesty International said today, as more than two dozen others faced trial on protest-related charges.  
  
Fifteen people were arrested by Omani security forces on 14 May during a protest in Muscat calling for the release of others detained two days earlier in pro-reform protests. 
  
Prominent female lawyer Basma al-Kiyumi was released on 16 May, and on 17 May some eight other activists were released, among them Muhammad al-Habssi and Ibrahim Sa’id al-Hajri. It is not known where the remaining six – including Nabhan al-Hanashi – are, or if any charges have been brought against them 
  
“The authorities in Oman must immediately provide details on the whereabouts of all protesters being held and either charge them with a recognizable criminal offence or release them,” said Malcolm Smart, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Director.  
  
“If they are being detained solely for participating in a peaceful public protest they should be released immediately and unconditionally.”  
  
“Any charges should be made public, and trials against the accused must conform to international fair trial standards.” 
  
Amnesty International is concerned that those who continue to be held following the protest in Muscat on 14 May are being detained incommunicado and may be at risk of torture or ill-treatment. 
  
Basma al-Kiyumi was charged in connection with participating in an unlawful gathering and released on bail to await trial at future date. It is not clear if other protesters who were released on 17 May were charged or not.  
  
Another group of 27 men who had taken part in protests during March and April appeared before a Muscat court today and were charged with a number of offences including banditry, setting fire to government buildings, and insulting officials. The men pleaded not guilty and the case was adjourned until 23 May. Two of the men, Khaled al-Hantholi, and ‘Ammar al-Hani’i, were not granted bail and remain detained at the Central Prison.

In February and March, Oman’s head of state Sultan Qaboos conceded to some demands, including creating more jobs, increasing unemployment benefits and sacking several ministers in his cabinet.

“Fifty years since the Amnesty candle began to shine a light on repression, the human rights revolution now stands on the threshold of historic change,” said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International Secretary General. 
“People are rejecting fear. Courageous people, led largely by youth, are standing up and speaking out in the face of bullets, beatings, tear gas and tanks. This bravery – combined with new technology that is helping activists to outflank and expose government suppression of free speech and peaceful protest – is sending a signal to repressive governments that their days are numbered. 
“But there is a serious fight-back from the forces of repression. The international community must seize the opportunity for change and ensure that 2011 is not a false dawn for human rights.” 
A critical battle is underway for control of access to information, means of communication and networking technology as social media networks fuel a new activism that governments are struggling to control. As seen in Tunisia and Egypt, government attempts to block internet access or cut mobile phone networks can backfire – but governments are scrambling to regain the initiative or to use this technology against activists. 
The protests that have spread across the Middle East and North Africa as people demand an end to repression and corruption are highlighting their deep desire for freedom from fear and want, and are giving voice to the voiceless. 
In Tunisia and Egypt, success in dethroning dictators riveted the world. Now there are whispers of discontent being heard from Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe. 
Yet despite a new resolve to confront tyranny and despite the theatre of struggle for human rights reaching a new digital frontier, freedom of expression – a right vital for its own sake and for claiming other rights – is under attack across the world. 
Governments in Libya, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen have shown a willingness to beat, maim or kill peaceful protestors to stay in power. Even where dictators have fallen, the institutions that supported them still need to be dismantled and the work of activists is far from over. Repressive governments such as Azerbaijan, China and Iran are trying to pre-empt any similar revolutions in their countries. 
Amnesty International Report 2011 documents specific restrictions on free speech in at least 89 countries, highlights cases of prisoners of conscience in at least 48 countries, documents torture and other ill-treatment in at least 98 countries, and reports on unfair trials in at least 54 countries. 
Iconic moments in 2010 included Daw Aung San Suu Kyi’s release in Myanmar and the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo despite his government’s attempts to sabotage the ceremony. 
Away from the international headlines, thousands of human rights defenders were threatened, imprisoned, tortured and killed, including in Afghanistan, Angola, Brazil, China, Mexico, Russia, Myanmar, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe. 
These activists were often speaking out on human rights issues including poverty, the marginalization of whole communities, women’s rights, corruption, brutality and oppression. Events in all regions highlighted their crucial role, and the need for global solidarity with them. 
Amnesty International’s annual report also highlights: 
•    Deteriorating country situations including a grim picture for activists in Ukraine, Belarus and Kyrgyzstan; spiralling violence in Nigeria; and an escalating crisis posed by Maoist armed insurgencies in central and north-east India.•    Regional trends including growing threats to Indigenous Peoples in the Americas; a worsening legal situation for women who choose to wear a full face veil in Europe; and a growing willingness by European states to send people back to places where they risk persecution.•    Conflicts that have wreaked havoc in the Central African Republic, Chad, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Russia’s North Caucasus, Sri Lanka, Sudan and Somalia, with civilians often targeted by armed groups and government forces.•    Signs of progress, including the steady retreat of the death penalty; some improvements in maternal healthcare including in Indonesia and Sierra Leone; and the bringing to justice of some of those responsible for human rights crimes under past military regimes in Latin America. 
Salil Shetty said that powerful governments, which have underestimated the burning desire of people everywhere for freedom and justice, must now back reform rather than sliding back into cynical political support for repression. The true tests of these governments’ integrity will be to support the rebuilding of states that promote human rights but that may not be allies, and their willingness – as with Libya – to refer the worst perpetrators to the International Criminal Court when all other justice avenues fail. 
The need for a consistent policy of zero-tolerance for crimes against humanity by the UN Security Council has been underlined by the brutal crackdown in Syria that has left hundreds dead since March, and by the lack of any concerted action in response to the repression of peaceful protests in Yemen and Bahrain. 
Governments in the Middle East and North Africa must have the courage to allow reform in a rapidly changing human rights landscape. They should uphold the rights to peaceful expression and association and ensure equality for all, in particular by dismantling obstacles to women’s full participation in society. Secret police and security forces should be reined in, brutality and killings stopped and full accountability for abuses ensured, so that victims get the justice and reparation that have for so long proved elusive. 
Corporations that provide internet access, cellular communications and social networking sites and that support digital media and communications need to respect human rights. They must not become the pawns or accomplices of repressive governments who want to stifle expression and spy on their people.  
“Not since the end of the Cold War have so many repressive governments faced such a challenge to their stranglehold on power. The demand for political and economic rights spreading across the Middle East and North Africa is dramatic proof that all rights are equally important and a universal demand,” said Salil Shetty. 
“In the 50 years since Amnesty International was born to protect the rights of people detained for their peaceful opinions, there has been a human rights revolution. The call for justice, freedom and dignity has evolved into a global demand that grows stronger every day. The genie is out of the bottle and the forces of repression cannot put it back.”

We know that the Sri Lankan government won’t effectively investigate these abuses. 
So Amnesty International has been campaigning for an international war crimes investigation in Sri Lanka.  On March 15, we took to the streets in Chicago to demand justice in Sri Lanka.  In New York City, Amnesty International activists gathered outside the Sri Lankan Mission to the U.N. on April 8 as part of “Get on the Bus – New York.”  On April 15, we demonstrated outside the Sri Lankan Embassy in Washington as part of “Get on the Bus – DC.”  More recently, as shown in the photos above, Amnesty members in other parts of the U.S. have joined in calling on the U.N. to hold an international investigation on war crimes in Sri Lanka. 
It would be a great help if we can get the U.S. government to publicly support our call for an international war crimes investigation in Sri Lanka.  Please write the U.S. government today, so that the victims and their families can finally receive truth and justice.",,"May 16, 2011 • Post",False
0,The U.S. Maternal Health Crisis: 14 Numbers You Need To Know,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/the-u-s-maternal-health-crisis-14-numbers-you-need-to-know/,Fourteen facts about the US maternal health care crisis that may surprise you.,"Mother’s Day is Sunday, May 8. Here at Amnesty, we’re honoring mothers by fighting for maternal health — sending Mother’s Day action cards to U.S. and international decision-makers, hosting events and more (sign up here). 
We’re also launching a one-year update to our groundbreaking report, Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA. From that update, here are 14 numbers you need to know: 
49: The number of countries that have lower maternal mortality ratios than the US.  Women in the US are more likely to die of pregnancy related complications than in 49 other countries, including nearly all European countries, Canada and several countries in Asia and the Middle East. 
4 million: The number of women who give birth each year in the US.  Childbirth related care is the most common reason for hospitalization in the US. 
$98 billion: The total amount spent in the US each year on hospital bills related to childbirth.  The average health care provider fees for maternal care are twice as high as any other country. 
3 to 4x: African-American women are 3 to 4 times as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes as white women. 
60: The number of years that the disparity between African-American women and white women has not improved. 
4x: The maternal mortality ratio for American Indian/Alaska Native women was 4 times higher than the Healthy People 2010 goal (the national target set by the government). 
8x: For African American women, the maternal mortality ratio was 8 times higher than the Healthy People 2010 goal. 
2x: Women living in low-income areas across the US were 2 times as likely to suffer a maternal death as women in high income areas. 
50: The number of women in the US suffering a “near miss” (a pregnancy complication so severe the woman nearly dies) for each woman who dies. 
34,000: The total number of women each year who suffer a “near miss” – one every 15 minutes. 
33%: The percentage of US births that are by cesarean section.  The cesarean rate has risen for 13 consecutive years to reach this all-time high in 2009. The cesarean rate is now more than double the WHO recommended range of 5-15%. 
21%: In states with cesarean rates higher than 33%, the risk of maternal death is 21% higher than in states with cesarean rates lower than 33%. 
29+1: The number of states – plus the District of Columbia – that have no maternal mortality review system in place to ensure that all deaths are analyzed to prevent the same problems from occurring in the future. 
1,000: The number of women around the world who die every day from complications of pregnancy and childbirth. That’s over 350,000 women every year – one woman every 90 seconds.  The vast majority of these deaths are preventable. 
This Mother’s Day, let’s change these numbers for the better. Register to write cards and take action to improve access to good quality care for all women.",,"May 3, 2011 • Post",False
0,UN: Investigate Sri Lanka War Crimes,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/un-investigate-sri-lanka-war-crimes/,A new UN report gives credibility to claims that both sides committed war crimes in Sri Lanka's civil war.,"This past Monday, the U.N. finally released the report of its advisory panel on accountability in Sri Lanka.  Thanks go to everyone who sent an online letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon asking him to release this report. 
The report found credible allegations that tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the final months of Sri Lanka’s civil war in early 2009, and that both the government forces and the opposition Tamil Tigers violated international law, including committing war crimes.  The panel recommended, among other things, that the U.N. establish an international investigation into these allegations. 
Today, Ban’s spokesperson explained that Ban would not initiate an international investigation into these allegations unless the Sri Lankan government consented or he was asked to do so by a U.N body such as the Security Council, the Human Rights Council or the General Assembly. 
Well, the Sri Lankan government isn’t likely to consent.  They’ve rejected the panel’s report, calling it “flawed” and “biased.”  President Rajapaksa has called for mass protests against the report on May 1. 
We’ll need action by U.N. member states to establish an international   investigation.  The U.S. government could play a vital role in this effort.  Please write to Secretary Hillary Clinton and ask her to support the establishment of an international war crimes investigation in Sri Lanka.",,"April 27, 2011 • Post",False
0,Bangladesh: Security forces used excessive force during raid,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/bangladesh-security-forces-used-excessive-force-during-raid-2/,"Bangladeshi security forces used excessive force during a raid on the house of a senior opposition politician on June 27,...","July 1, 2010 
Bangladeshi security forces used excessive force during a raid on the house of a senior opposition politician on June 27, Amnesty International said today. 
The Bangladesh Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) carried out a violent attack on those gathered peacefully inside the house of Mirza Abbas, a leading Bangladesh National Party (BNP) politician and former mayor of Dhaka, according to testimony given to Amnesty International. 
Victims of the raid described sustained and unprovoked beatings of activists and Mirza Abbas’ family members, denial of medical treatment after arrests, and the eliciting of signatures on blank forms as a condition of release, which Amnesty International suspects are for the purpose of falsifying confessions. 
Amnesty International has photographed injuries to male and female victims of the beatings. More than twenty people were injured during the raid, including Mirza Abbas’ wife Afroza Abbas and his 85 year-old mother. BNP supporters had gathered at Mirza Abbas?s house after he been arrested and accused of involvement in violence during a general strike called by the party. 
""The government should immediately investigate the circumstances surrounding this violent raid and ensure that any people hurt by security officials receive justice and appropriate compensation,"" said Abbas Faiz, Amnesty International’s Bangladesh researcher, from Dhaka. 
Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to order security forces to comply with their obligations to exercise restraint and avoid the use of excessive force as the country faces a series of clashes during protests. At least 80 people have been injured over the past two days as police clashed with striking textile workers and protesters contesting the arrest of three top leaders of the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party. 
The main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), called for a national strike on June 27. The strike, which was generally orderly, sparked off clashes between the police and demonstrators in some parts of the country, including in Dhaka. 
Hundreds of people have been arrested on allegations of involvement in violence, including Mirza Abbas. 
""There has been no evidence that the people in Mirza Abbas’ house were violating any law or in any way threatening anyone, so the violent actions of RAB seem totally unjustified,"" said Faiz. ""Given RAB’s history of using of excessive, even lethal, force, this incident demands an immediate and strong reaction from the authorities."" 
The RAB claims that the security forces entered the ground floor office of Mirza Abbas after people had thrown pieces of bricks at them from that direction. 
However, video footage taken by journalists and viewed by Amnesty International shows no sign of people attacking RAB officers in or around the house, but rather, shows RAB personnel attacking people inside the house. 
One woman told Amnesty International that she was in the courtyard fetching water when RAB personnel stormed in and grabbed her: ""They beat me on my back, the back of my thighs, my arms and my shoulders with a baton. I fell on the ground but the RAB people continued beating me."" 
She said four or five men beat her until she lost consciousness, and that she did not go to hospital out of fear of arrest there. 
Another woman said she was handcuffed in front of the house, then was tied up with a rope and dragged into the courtyard where she was beaten. She was detained for eight hours by police, denied medical treatment, and only released on condition that her husband sign a blank piece of paper that they feared would be used to manufacture false evidence. 
A woman who ran to the bathroom to hide from the security forces told Amnesty International that the RAB chased her, forced the bathroom door open, dragged her out and began to beat her. ""I kept asking why they were beating me, but they did not stop and did not answer."" 
A RAB official who spoke to Amnesty International said ""perhaps there should have been more restraint; if there have been excesses, these would be investigated."" 
However, the government has so far ignored calls from BNP politicians and at least one MP of the governing Awami League to address RAB excesses in the raid. 
""The government of Bangladesh must stop praising security forces for carrying out human rights violations, and instead make them accountable to the rule of law,"" said Faiz.

Denial of medical care for Filep Karma 
Indonesia 
 
Filep Karma, a 50-year-old prisoner of conscience, is in need of urgent medical care at Abepura Prison in the Indonesian province of Papua. He has been very ill since August 2009. Amnesty International has received information that he looks pale, has lost a lot of weight and has to lift his legs when he sleeps to ease the pain. A recent medical report recommended that he undergo further treatment in Jakarta. However, the prison authorities have told him they cannot send him for medical treatment, as they have limited funds. 

 
© ELSHAM 
Filep Karma has been in prison since December 2004. He suffered health problems before his arrest, but the conditions at the prison and the refusal of the authorities to provide adequate medical care have exacerbated his problems. Sources in Indonesia have stated that Filep Karma has suffered beatings and ill-treatment by the prison guards. In August 2009, he had complained of intense pain in the lower abdomen, difficulty in urinating and testicular swelling. These conditions may be life- threatening. Further medical tests confirmed that he was suffering from bronchopneumonia, excess fluid in the lungs, urinary tract infection and various other medical problems. It was also recommended in the report that he receive further treatment in Jakarta, but prison authorities refused to send him due to lack of funds. Amnesty International and other human rights advocates have been working to secure him access to treatment in Jakarta but attempts have been unsuccessful. 
Amnesty International calls on the prison authorities to ensure that he receives full and immediate access to medical care consistent with the UN Standard Minimal Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. This standard also provides that prisoners needing treatment not available in the prison hospital, clinic or infirmary should be transferred to an appropriate institution outside the prison for assessment and treatment. Amnesty International is also calling on the prison authorities to cover the costs of such treatment as required by the United Nations Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Principle 24). Furthermore, under the Indonesian Government Regulation No. 32/1999 Article 17(4), on Terms and Procedures on the Implementation of Prisoners’ Rights in Prison, the prison authorities are required to provide adequate access to medical treatment. Amnesty International believes the denial of medical care to Filep Karma may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 

 
Background Information 
West Papua and Papua provinces occupy the western half of the island of New Guinea. Papua province borders the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The arrests and detention of people in Papua are part of a larger crackdown on political activists in areas where there has been a history of separatist movements. The Indonesian authorities have reacted strongly towards individuals who have expressed claims for independence. Amnesty International has documented dozens of arrests in past years of peaceful political activists. Some were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for raising prohibited pro independence ‘Morning Star’ flag in Papua. 
Former civil servant Filep Karma was among approximately 200 people who took part in a peaceful ceremony in Abepura, Papua Province on 1 December 2004. In commemoration of the declaration of Papuan independence in 1962, the Morning Star Flag was raised. Police then advanced on the crowd, firing warning shots and beating people with batons. Filep Karma was arrested, tried and received a 15 year prison sentence. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. 
During Filep Karma’s trial, police responded with extreme force to large demonstrations that took place outside the courthouse on 10 May 2005. Many people were injured. A senior police officer was dismissed as a result, but he did not face criminal charges. There has been no formal inquiry into the events. Filep Karma was convicted of treason and sentenced on 26 May 2005. He is serving a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 October 2005. 
Conditions in Abepura prison are reportedly poor. Despite the heat, bathing is restricted to once or twice a week due to a lack of fresh water. Filep Karma did receive temporary medical leave from the prison in 2007 in order to receive hospital treatment. 
Amnesty International takes no position on the political status of any province of Indonesia, but believes that the right to freedom of expression includes the right to peacefully advocate referendums, independence or other political solutions. 

 
Recommended Action: 

 
Please write to the Indonesia authorities below: 

 
Explaining that you are a health professional concerned about human rights; 
Expressing concern at reports that Filep Karma, currently held in Abepura Prison, Papua, is not receiving adequate medical care; 
Urging the authorities to ensure that Filep Karma receives full and immediate access to medical care, in accordance with the provisions set out in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners; 
Calling for the authorities to allow Filep Karma to travel to Jakarta to receive urgent medical care, as recommended by doctors in the Jayapura hospital in Papua; 
Urging the authorities to cover the cost of such treatment in accordance with the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Principle 24); 
Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Filep Karma as his imprisonment appears to be politically motivated and breaches his right to peaceful demonstration.

Conditions in Abepura prison are reportedly poor. Despite the heat, bathing is restricted to once or twice a week due to a lack of fresh water. Filep Karma did receive temporary medical leave from the prison in 2007 in order to receive hospital treatment. 
Amnesty International takes no position on the political status of any province of Indonesia, but believes that the right to freedom of expression includes the right to peacefully advocate referendums, independence or other political solutions.

URGENT ACTION 
PRISONER OF CONSCIENCE DENIED MEDICAL CARE 
Filep Karma is in need of urgent medical care. He has been seriously ill since August 2009. A recent medical report recommended that he undergo further treatment in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. However, the prison authorities have told him they cannot fund his medical treatment 
Filep Karma, a 50-year-old prisoner of conscience at Abepura Prison in the Indonesian province of Papua, has been in prison since December 2004. He had suffered from health problems before his arrest but the conditions at the prison and the refusal of the authorities to provide adequate medical care have exacerbated his conditions. 
In August 2009, he had complained of intense pain in the lower abdomen, difficulty in urinating and testicular swelling. Further medical tests confirmed that he was suffering from bronchopneumonia, excess fluid in the lungs, urinary tract infection and various other medical problems. In the medical report the doctor recommended that he receive further treatment in Jakarta, but prison authorities have refused to send him due to a lack of funds. If untreated the conditions could be potentially life threatening. 
 
Amnesty International believes the denial of medical care to Filep Karma may amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. 

 
PLEASE WRITE IMMEDIATELY in Indonesian or your own language calling on authorities in Indonesia: 
Expressing concern at reports that Filep Karma is not receiving adequate medical care; 
Urging the authorities to ensure that Filep Karma receives full and immediate access to adequate medical care; 
Urging the authorities to cover the cost of such treatment in accordance with the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment (Principle 24); 
Calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Filep Karma as his imprisonment is related to his right to peaceful demonstration.

URGENT ACTION 
PRISONER OF CONSCIENCE DENIED MEDICAL CARE 
Conditions in Abepura prison are reportedly poor. Bathing for prisoners is restricted to once or twice a week due to a lack of fresh water. Filep Karma did receive temporary medical leave from the prison in 2007 in order to receive hospital treatment. 
Former civil servant Filep Karma was among approximately 200 people who took part in a peaceful ceremony in Abepura, Papua Province on 1 December 2004. In commemoration of the declaration of Papuan independence in 1962, the Morning Star Flag was raised. Police then advanced on the crowd, firing warning shots and beating people with batons. Filep Karma was subsequently arrested. Amnesty International considers him to be a prisoner of conscience. 
During Filep Karma’s trial, police responded with extreme force to large demonstrations that took place outside the courthouse on 10 May 2005. Many people were injured. A senior police officer was dismissed as a result, but he did not face criminal charges. There has been no formal inquiry into the events. Filep Karma was convicted of treason and sentenced on 26 May 2005. He is serving a sentence of 15 years’ imprisonment, which was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 27 October 2005. 
West Papua and Papua provinces occupy the western half of the island of New Guinea. Papua province borders the independent state of Papua New Guinea. The arrests and detention of people in Papua are part of a larger crackdown on political activists in areas where there has been a history of separatist movements including Papua and Maluku. The Indonesian authorities have reacted strongly towards individuals who have called for independence. Amnesty International has documented dozens of arrests in past years of such peaceful political activists. Some were sentenced to terms of imprisonment for raising the prohibited pro independence ‘Morning Star’ flag in Papua. 
Amnesty International takes no position whatsoever on the political status of any province of Indonesia, including calls for independence. However the organization believes that the right to freedom of expression includes the right to peacefully advocate referendums, independence or other political solutions.

Contact: Suzanne Trimel, 212-633-4150, [email protected] 
(New York) – Amnesty International called on President Obama today to quickly establish an Office of Maternal Health to lead government action to reduce soaring pregnancy-related complications and maternal deaths nationwide. The human rights organization said the government must take immediate steps to stop the loss of two to three women every day and reduce the risk of complications that now affect one-third of all pregnant women – 1.7 million women a year. 
With a lifetime risk of maternal deaths that is greater than in 40 other countries, including virtually all of the industrialized countries, the United States has failed to reverse the two-decade upward trend in preventable maternal deaths, despite pledges to do so. Most recently, the government has failed to meet the goals set forth in the 2010 Healthy People initiative, which called for reducing the number of maternal deaths to one- third of current rates. 
""This country’s extraordinary record of medical advancement makes its haphazard approach to maternal care all the more scandalous and disgraceful,” said Larry Cox, executive director of Amnesty International USA. ""Good maternal care should not be considered a luxury available only to those who can access the best hospitals and the best doctors. Women should not die in the richest country on earth from preventable complications and emergencies."" 
Cox said: ""Mothers die not because the United States can’t provide good care, but because it lacks the political will to make sure good care is available to all women."" 
Amnesty International’s new 101-page, national report, Deadly Delivery: The Maternal Health Care Crisis in the USA, reveals the following disturbing findings: 
+ severe pregnancy-related complications that nearly cause death — known as ""near misses"" — are rising at an alarming rate, increasing by 25 percent since 1998; currently nearly 34,000 women annually experience a ""near miss” during delivery; 
+ discrimination is costing lives. Opportunities to save women’s lives and reduce complications are being missed, in large part because women face barriers to care, especially women of color, those living in poverty, Native American and immigrant women and those who speak little or no English. 
Maternal health is a human right for every woman in the United States, regardless of race or income. Yet, the United States lacks a systematic, robust government response to this critical problem. Amnesty International is urging President Obama to work with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to establish, and seek Congressional funding, for a single office responsible for ensuring that all women receive quality maternal health care. (Please visit: www.amnestyusa.orgdeadlydelivery) 
Additionally, Amnesty International calls for vigorous enforcement of federal non-discrimination laws and an increase in support for Federally Qualified Health Centers by 2011 to expand the number of women who can access affordable maternal health care. 
Amnesty International’s analysis shows that health care reform before Congress does not address the crisis of maternal health care. 
""Reform is primarily focused on health care coverage and reducing health care costs, and even optimistic estimates predict that any proposal on the table will still leave millions without access to affordable care,"" said Rachel Ward, one of the authors of the Deadly Delivery report. ""Furthermore, it does not address discrimination, systemic failures and the lack of government accountability documented in Amnesty International’s report."" 
Ward said: ""The barriers preventing women from getting the care that they need go far beyond simply lacking health insurance. Health care reform does not address obstacles to maternal care, recommend nationally standardized protocols for preventing and treating the most common causes of death, eliminate health disparities or ensure that the government takes responsibility for reducing levels of maternal mortality."" 
Rapid and comprehensive federal leadership is required, as the report found numerous systemic failures, including the following: 
As a result, women are more likely to enter into pregnancy in ill health, receive late or inadequate prenatal care, are given inadequate or inappropriate care during childbirth and receive insufficient post-natal care.

PRESS RELEASE
February, 11 2010 

  

Amnesty International today called on President Mugabe and Prime Minister Tsvangirai to fulfill their promise to reform state institutions, in a bid to end human rights violations that have continued in the country since the formation of the unity government one year ago.
 
Torture, harassment and politically motivated prosecutions of human rights defenders and perceived opponents have persisted, while villagers in parts of Zimbabwe have suffered ceaseless intimidation by supporters of former ruling party ZANU-PF.  

""The Attorney General's office, police and army have been left to freely violate human rights in pursuit of a political agenda,"" said Erwin van der Borght, Africa Director at Amnesty International. 

""By delaying reform, the situation in Zimbabwe remains fragile as perpetrators continue to escape justice and are instead effectively given the all clear to continue violating human rights."" 

Amnesty International called on the unity government to end on-going harassment of human rights defenders. Several peaceful protests organized by civic movement Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) were violently broken up by police in 2009. 

Seventeen human rights and political activists who were abducted by state security agents in 2008 continue to face charges that are widely believed to be trumped up. One of them, Jestina Mukoko, director of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, had her prosecution permanently stayed by the Supreme Court in September 2009 because of overwhelming evidence that she had been tortured. 

""The government must end the incessant harassment of human rights activists and take steps to seriously protect rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,"" said Erwin van der Borght. 

The Zimbabwean army and intelligence services, as well as the Attorney General's office, have remained under ZANU-PF control, following an agreement brokered by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) in 2008. The police are co-chaired by ZANU-PF and MDC-T ministers. 

""The onus is on President Mugabe and ZANU-PF to ensure that key institutions under their control are reformed to end the culture of impunity that still threatens stability in the country,"" said Erwin van der Borght.  

Amnesty International's call for reform comes amid reports that villagers in parts of Zimbabwe are being threatened with violence by army backed supporters of ZANU-PF, in an attempt to force them to endorse the heavily criticized Kariba draft constitution.  

The Kariba draft constitution, agreed by unity government parties in September 2007, has been strongly criticized by some civil society organizations as an attempt by the parties to impose a constitution without consultation. 

Villagers in Mutoko, Muzarabani and MT. Darwin are reportedly being warned that they will face beatings unless they support the ZANU-PF position. Similar threats were made and materialised in the run up to the June 2008 presidential elections.. 

""These are early warning signs that the situation could deteriorate if no urgent measures are taken to stop state security agents from carrying out violent political campaigns.""
 
""Past involvement on their part has resulted in gross human rights violations, including deaths and torture of perceived opponents."" 

The government has so far failed to investigate gross human rights violations allegedly carried out by security forces during the run-up to the second round of the 2008 presidential elections, which left at least 200 people dead, over 9,000 injured and tens of thousands displaced. 

""The unity government must investigate past and present allegations of human rights violations by state security agents, including torture and ill treatment of detainees,"" said Erwin van der Borght. 

Gross human rights violations have also been taking place within the army. 

At least two soldiers were tortured to death in October 2009 while being interrogated by intelligence and military police officials in Harare. Another soldier was reported to have committed suicide while in solitary confinement and several others are still receiving medical treatment for injuries caused by torture. 

The victims had been arrested along with at least 95 others, on suspicion of breaking into an armoury at Pomona barracks and stealing 21 guns.
 
""Zimbabwean state bodies are riddled with human rights abusers that in many cases carry out violations with impunity,"" said Erwin van der Borght.  

""Without genuine reform of institutions this abuse is very likely to persist.""

 Major human rights organizations file amici curiae brief along with individual torture survivors and their families, religious groups, and torture survivor support organizations  
February 3, 2010, Cambridge, MA – The U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether former foreign government officials who committed human rights abuses while in office are entitled to immunity in U.S courts. A brief on behalf of more than twenty amici curiae argues that the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA) does not immunize individual former officials from suit in U.S. courts for violations of fundamental human rights such as torture and extrajudicial killing. Amici include Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, Human Rights First, EarthRights International, and Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC), as well as individual torture survivors such as Dolly Filartiga, who brought the first successful case against a torturer under the Alien Tort Statute in 1980. 
""Former officials who committed torture should not be allowed to hide behind the cloak of official immunity,"" said Andrea Prasow, senior counterterrorism counsel with Human Rights Watch. 
The case pending before the Supreme Court, Samantar v. Yousuf, brings claims against Somali General Mohamed Ali Samantar for torture, rape, and mass executions committed against the civilian population of Somalia during the 1980s. Argument is scheduled for March 3, 2010. 
The IHRC drafted the brief in collaboration with some of the leading human rights organizations around the globe. Tyler Giannini, Clinical Director of the IHRC and Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School, served as counsel of record. ""A long line of cases ensures that torture survivors-including American students, relief workers, and U.S. government personnel-can seek justice in U.S. courts against former government officials,"" Giannini said. ""The Supreme Court should not alter this established case law or deny survivors an opportunity for redress,"" he continued. 
The case involves the claims of Bashe Abdi Yousuf as well as other torture survivors. Somali National Security Service agents and military police detained and tortured Yousuf. They subjected him to electrocution, denied him food and water, and forced him into stress positions, including tying his arms and legs tied behind his body and placing a heavy rock on his back. 
Vienna Colucci, Senior Advisor for Policy at Amnesty International USA, which published the groundbreaking USA: Safe Haven for Torturers report, explained, ""Survivors of torture have a legal right to a remedy. U.S. courts must enforce that right."" 
Gabor Rona, International Legal Director of Human Rights First, which was closely involved in the passage of the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) along with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, stressed the importance of protecting torture claims such as Mr. Yousuf’s: ""The United States must provide victims with enforceable remedies against former officials of foreign governments responsible for torture. Congress passed the TVPA in 1991 specifically to ensure that the United States would abide by its international legal obligations under the Convention against Torture."" 
Rick Herz, Litigation Coordinator for EarthRights International, noted, ""Any interpretation of the FSIA that bars such suits would have profound implications for torture survivors, stripping them of the access to justice that Congress explicitly intended."" 
For a complete list of signatories, or for a copy of the brief, go to www.law.harvard.edu/programs/hrp. 
The case against Samantar was filed on behalf of Somali survivors, who were represented initially by the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA).

Gabor Rona, International Legal Director of Human Rights First, which was closely involved in the passage of the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) along with Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, stressed the importance of protecting torture claims such as Mr. Yousuf’s: ""The United States must provide victims with enforceable remedies against former officials of foreign governments responsible for torture. Congress passed the TVPA in 1991 specifically to ensure that the United States would abide by its international legal obligations under the Convention against Torture."" 
Rick Herz, Litigation Coordinator for EarthRights International, noted, ""Any interpretation of the FSIA that bars such suits would have profound implications for torture survivors, stripping them of the access to justice that Congress explicitly intended.""

The case against Samantar was filed on behalf of Somali survivors, who were represented initially by the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA). For the appeal before the Supreme Court, CJA has been joined by Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP; the Stanford Law School Supreme Court Litigation Clinic; Cooley Godward Kronish LLP; and Howe & Russell, PC.

URGENT ACTION 
refugees forcibly returned to laos 
The Thai authorities forcibly returned around 4,500 Lao Hmong, including 158 recognized refugees, to Laos at the end of 2009. The Lao government is refusing to permit UN and other monitors access to them. 
On 28 and 29 December, the Thai military forcibly returned to Laos around 4,500 Lao Hmong, in breach of international law, mostly from a camp in Phetchabun province. Some 158 recognized refugees arbitrarily detained in Nong Khai Immigration Detention Centre, near the Lao border, were also forcibly returned, despite offers from four other countries to accept them for resettlement. The Thai and Lao governments had given assurances that the 158 would be resettled in third countries once they had transited through Laos. However on 10 January, a Lao government spokesperson told journalists that ""all of the Hmong decided to live in their homeland forever,"" and no longer wanted to resettle abroad. At the same time the government is refusing all requests to give UN monitors unfettered access to the refugees, to assess their wellbeing and ensure that their wishes to resettle in third countries are considered. 
The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR had verified that the 158 have a well-founded fear of persecution in Laos, and granted them refugee status. As the Thai government refused UNHCR access to the Phetchabun camp, it is not known how many people there had fled persecution and should therefore have been recognized as refugees. 
Since 2005, forcible returns of Lao Hmong from Thailand have led to enforced disappearances, torture and arbitrary detention. The Lao government have consistently denied this, but have not provided any comprehensive information to support their claims or allowed independent monitors to investigate these reports. 
Around 20 of the 158 refugees have been seen at a designated resettlement village, Phalak, around 70km north of the capital, Vientiane. The whereabouts of the others is not known. However, hundreds of returnees have been seen in what has been described as an army camp north of Paksan town, around 20km east of Vientiane. The returnees, mostly women and children, were not free to come and go from the facility, which was fenced in with razor wire. 
PLEASE WRITE IMMEDIATELY, in English, Lao, French or your own language: 
Calling on the authorities to allow UN monitors unfettered access to the returnees from Thailand immediately, whether or not they have refugee status; 
Calling on the government to honour their agreement to allow any refugees to settle in third countries; 
Urging them to expedite and help with any preparations required for third country resettlement; 
Calling on them to allow those who choose to remain in Laos, rather than be resettled, to participate in decisions about their place of residence and livelihood; 
Calling on them to ensure that none of the around 4,500 returnees are arbitrarily detained, tortured or subjected to enforced disappearance.

URGENT ACTION 
refugees forcibly returned to laos 
Around 5,000 Lao Hmong people, including an unknown number of asylum-seekers, had been living in a camp in Phetchabun, Thailand, since 2004. The vast majority did not have the opportunity to seek asylum. The Thai military returned them under an agreement between the Thai and Lao governments. Many of those who had been returned before this last group were sent to villages designated for people returned from abroad after going through ""re-education"". The Lao authorities have arranged several visits to Phalak resettlement site for diplomats and local journalists, but have refused to allow anyone to approach the returnees unaccompanied. 
The group of 158 refugees forcibly returned to Laos, more than half of them children, had been arbitrarily detained at Nong Khai Immigration Detention Center for more than three years. The governments of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the USA had offered to accept them for resettlement, but the Lao authorities intervened with the Thai authorities to prevent this happening. 
Most Hmong refugees and asylum-seekers in Thailand claim to have some connection to groups living in isolated pockets in the Lao jungles since the Viet Nam war ended in 1975. 
Laos ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on 25 September 2009. This means they are obliged to guarantee all people in Laos the right to be free from torture, to liberty of movement and freedom to choose their residence, and the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. They must also provide safeguards for the treatment of detainees. 
The Lao Hmong asylum-seekers were previously the subject of UA 324/06 (ASA 39/017/2006), 29 November 2006, and follow-ups.

PRESS RELEASE 
 AI Index: AFR 25/005/2006 (Public)
News Service No: 045
22 February 2006 

As international concerns regarding the human rights situation in Ethiopia escalate, Amnesty International called for the immediate and unconditional release of opposition leaders, human rights defenders and journalists who will face trial tomorrow on charges that include treason, violent conspiracy and ""genocide"". 
 ""These people are prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely on account of their non-violent opinions and activities,"" said Kolawole Olaniyan, Director of Amnesty International's Africa Programme. ""It is unacceptable that they are now facing serious criminal charges that could lead to death sentences and possible execution."" 
 ""We demand their immediate and unconditional release and a halt to this attempt by the Ethiopian government to criminalize freedom of expression and prevent legitimate political and human rights activity."" 
 The group of over 80 defendants, which includes ten newly-elected members of parliament and other officials of the opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD) party, is due to appear before the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa tomorrow. 
 The CUD members and journalists are refusing to plead to the charges or mount a defence, on the grounds that they do not expect a fair trial. The court is expected to enter a plea of not guilty on their behalf. 
 Charges filed against them include: high treason, ""outrages against the Constitution"", inciting and organizing armed uprising, and endangering the integrity of the state. Most are also charged with ""genocide"". 
 Among the CUD defendants are Berhanu Negga, a professor of economics, and Yacob Hailemariam, a former prosecutor in the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and a former UN Special Envoy. 
 The group also includes four human rights defenders and 14 independent journalists. Others in the full list of 131 defendants may be tried in their absence, such as five journalists of original Ethiopian nationality who live in the United States and work for the Voice of America radio station. 
 ""We fear the defendants may not be tried in accordance with internationally-recognized standards of fair trial before impartial and independent judges,"" said Kolawole Olaniyan. ""Furthermore, the grounds advanced by the prosecution for the charge of 'genocide' do not even remotely match internationally-recognized definitions of genocide — or the definition set out in the Ethiopian Criminal Code. This absurd charge should be withdrawn immediately."" 
 The prosecution grounds for the genocide charge include allegations of causing fear and harm to an ethnic group, and harming members of the Tigrayan-led ruling party by excluding them from social events and funerals. 
 Most of the defendants are currently held in Kaliti prison on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, with restricted access to their families. In late November, several CUD leaders went on a hunger strike for several weeks in protest at their detentions. Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, who had been very ill before his arrest in November, commenced a second hunger strike on 8 February and is reportedly becoming very weak. Amnesty International expressed concern about the health of the defendants in prison, and called on the Ethiopian authorities to provide them with any required medical treatment immediately. 
 Background 
Prominent human rights defender Professor Mesfin Woldemariam, aged 75, is among the accused – a founder and former chair of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, and a current member of the CUD. Other human rights defenders on trial are civil society activists Daniel Bekelle, a lawyer and policy manager of the ActionAid office in Ethiopia, and Netsanet Demissie, an environmental and human rights lawyer, chair of the Organization for Social Justice in Ethiopia. Both had been involved in Global Call to Action against Poverty (GCAP) activities in Ethiopia, but the authorities refused to allow them to hold a public rally. Kassahun Kebede, an official of the Ethiopian Teachers Association, is also on trial. 
 The defendants are among several thousand suspected government opponents from the CUD and other opposition parties who were detained as a result of anti-government demonstrations in November 2005 in Addis Ababa and other towns. The CUD had called for non-violent protests against alleged fraud in the parliamentary elections of 15 May 2005, in which European Union and other observers expressed concern at serious irregularities. 
 In January, the British government cut off US$88 million equivalent budget support to Ethiopia due to concerns about governance and human rights issues arising from the disputed elections, and other international donors have take similar measures. On a visit to Ethiopia on 16-17 February, the European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid met CUD leaders in prison, and called for a political dialogue between the government and opposition, and for the prisoners to be released on bail. 
 Dozens more CUD members have been arrested in the past few days and accused of being members of a ""clandestine group linked to the CUD"" that police claimed had planned armed attacks on 18-19 February, which had been prevented. CUD lawyer Berhane Moges and Ethiopian Review website reporter Frezer Negash (f), arrested late January, were among 15 people taken to court on 21 February and remanded in custody.

(Washington, DC) — Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) today condemned the killing of Rachel Corrie and called for an independent investigation of her death. The organization also renewed a call for a suspension of US transfers to Israel of military equipment, including bulldozers, which have been used to commit human rights abuses. Amnesty International has consistently condemned violations by all parties to the conflict and called on these parties to take all possible measures to bring to an end the killing and wounding of civilians. 
 ""As Rachel Corrie was an American citizen, the US government has a particular responsibility to ensure a thorough, proper and impartial investigation,"" said Christine Bustany, AIUSA's Advocacy Director for the Middle East. ""US-made bulldozers have been 'weaponized' and their transfer to Israel must be suspended."" 
 Ms. Corrie was a member of a group called International Solidarity Movement. Reports indicate that she was trying to stop the demolition of a Palestinian building in the Rafah refugee camp located in the Gaza Strip, when an Israel army bulldozer ran her over, crushing her to death. 
 In the past two years, the Israeli army has demolished more than 3,000 Palestinian homes in the Occupied Territories, as well as large areas of agricultural land, public and private properties, and water and electricity infrastructure in urban and rural areas. Bulldozers used for demolitions have killed Palestinian civilians, but to date no thorough investigation has taken place. Amnesty International stresses that a thorough, professional, independent and impartial investigation into these deaths is urgently needed. 
 As the main supplier of weapons to Israel, the United States must take measures to guarantee that weapons it supplies are not used in a manner that violates international and US law. Amnesty International and other international, Israeli, and Palestinian human rights groups have reported on Israel's use of disproportionate, excessive, and lethal force without regard to civilian lives, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, extrajudicial executions and unwarranted destruction of civilian property that have resulted in deaths of innocent bystanders. The Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002 confirmed many of these violations and cites helicopters, fighter aircraft, anti-tank missiles, and flechettes as weapons used to commit human rights abuses. Amnesty International urges that such transfers immediately be suspended until Israel is found to be in compliance with the terms of US laws and bilateral defense agreements governing transfers or offers effective and enforceable guarantees that US weapons will not be misused in this fashion.",, • Press Release,False

Human Rights Organization Gives Authorities 101 Documents Detailing Dozens of Cases of Torture, Extrajudicial Executions and More Between 1971 and 1986 
(Port-au-Prince) — Haitian authorities have told Amnesty International they are launching an investigation into crimes against humanity committed during Jean-Claude Duvalier’s rule in the 1970s and 80s. 
Amnesty International Haiti Researcher Gerardo Ducos met yesterday with Haiti Prosecutor Harycidas Auguste and Minister of Justice Paul Denis to discuss the need for an investigation into the abuses committed during Duvalier’s years in power. 
Ducos handed over 101 documents detailing dozens of cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions which took place in Haiti between 1971 and 1986. 
“Investigating Jean Claude Duvalier for the human rights crimes committed during his time in power is a massive step forward,” said Ducos. “What we need to see now is a swift and impartial process, in line with international standards, that truly brings justice for those who have been waiting for too long.”

Human Rights Organization Gives Authorities 101 Documents Detailing Dozens of Cases of Torture, Extrajudicial Executions and More Between 1971 and 1986 
(Port-au-Prince) — Haitian authorities have told Amnesty International they are launching an investigation into crimes against humanity committed during Jean-Claude Duvalier’s rule in the 1970s and 80s. 
Amnesty International Haiti Researcher Gerardo Ducos met yesterday with Haiti Prosecutor Harycidas Auguste and Minister of Justice Paul Denis to discuss the need for an investigation into the abuses committed during Duvalier’s years in power. 
Ducos handed over 101 documents detailing dozens of cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions which took place in Haiti between 1971 and 1986. 
“Investigating Jean Claude Duvalier for the human rights crimes committed during his time in power is a massive step forward,” said Ducos. “What we need to see now is a swift and impartial process, in line with international standards, that truly brings justice for those who have been waiting for too long.” 
Amnesty International also urged the Haitian authorities to ensure that all victims and survivors of abuses committed during Duvalier’s rule – including those living outside Haiti — have an opportunity to provide evidence in the process.  
“We are also calling on the United Nations to offer technical support to the Haitian authorities to ensure the trial against Jean Claude Duvalier meets the expectations of the Haitian people and the international community,” said Ducos.

Amnesty International has urged the Haitian authorities to investigate alleged human rights violations committed by former president Jean-Claude Duvalier, also known as ‘Baby Doc,’ following his detention today in Port-Au-Prince.   
Jean-Claude Duvalier, who has been accused of presiding over numerous human rights violations during his rule from 1971 to 1986, was detained after being questioned by police. It is not yet clear which charges he will face.   
“This landmark arrest is a welcome first step toward bringing to justice a leader whose security apparatus carried out widespread and systematic human rights violations including torture, arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances,"" said Javier Zuñiga, Special Advisor at Amnesty International.  ""Haiti must investigate Jean-Claude Duvalier, and anyone else allegedly responsible for such crimes, some of which amount to crimes against humanity, in a trial that is thorough, independent and fair.""     
Jean-Claude Duvalier returned to Haiti on January 16 after nearly 25 years in exile in France. He fled Haiti in 1986 after a popular uprising that was violently repressed by the former Haitian Armed Forces and a local militia known as the “tonton macoutes.”  Throughout his 15 years in power (1971-1986), systematic torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances were widespread across Haiti and affected hundreds of people, including pro-democracy and human rights activists.  
""A cycle of impunity has prevailed for decades in Haiti, with victims of abuses and their families denied justice for way too long – now the opportunity has come for justice, truth and reparations,"" said Javier Zuniga.

&nbsp; 
(London) &ndash; Amnesty International today urged authorities in the Dominican Republic to immediately halt the mass deportation of Haitian migrants amid claims by the authorities that the move is necessary to prevent the spread of cholera. 
 “Haiti is still recovering from a devastating natural disaster,&quot; said Javier Zu&ntilde;iga, senior advisor at Amnesty International. &quot;Instead of forcing people back to a desperate situation, the Dominican Republic and other countries should be stepping up their efforts to help Haiti and its people.&quot; 
Over 950 Haitians &ndash; many of them living in the Dominican Republic without documentation &ndash; have been deported to Haiti in the past week, according to statements by the local Migration Ministry.   The immigration status of many Haitians in the Dominican Republic is still unclear.   “No one should be deported without individual determination of their immigration status, and any Haitian suspected of cholera should be given adequate medical treatment and not be deported,&rdquo; said Zu&ntilde;iga. “Returning people is condemning them to a situation where their health and security would be at great risk.&rdquo;  After an earthquake struck the impoverished country last January, the Dominican Republic agreed to admit hundreds of Haitian nationals on humanitarian grounds. But authorities now claim that deportations are crucial to prevent the spread of cholera. A recent outbreak of the disease has already killed 3,500 people in Haiti. Around 150 cases have been reported in the Dominican Republic.  According to the United Nations, around 600,000 Haitians lived in the Dominican Republic without documents before the earthquake. Amnesty International yesterday raised concerns regarding the situation of women and girls living in makeshift camps across Haiti and warned of the widespread sexual abuse they suffer.

Saudi Arabia must investigate abuse against Sri Lankan domestic worker 
Amnesty International has urged the Saudi Arabian authorities to investigate without delay allegations by a Sri Lankan woman that she was seriously abused and injured while employed recently as a domestic servant in Saudi Arabia and to bring the perpetrators to justice if the allegations are well founded. 
According to press reports in Sri Lanka and information received by Amnesty International, L P Ariyawathie, a 49-year-old mother of three children, was severely abused by her employers in Saudi Arabia when she complained about her heavy workload. Her employers are alleged to have driven 24 nails and a needle into her hands, legs and forehead, causing severe injuries, which required hours of surgery when she returned home to Sri Lanka in August. Some of the nails are reported to have been up to 5cm long. Doctors who treated her in Sri Lanka said she had been deeply traumatized by her experience. She had reportedly travelled to Saudi Arabia to obtain employment as a domestic servant – as many other Sri Lankan women do to help support their families – in March 2010. She is reported to have told doctors that she was subjected to abuse in July before she left her employment and returned to Sri Lanka. 
In a letter sent last week to Justice Minister Shaikh Dr Mohammed bin ‘Abdul ‘Aziz al-‘Issa, Amnesty International urged the Saudi Arabian authorities to investigate the serious allegations of abuse made by L P Ariyawathie against her employers in Saudi Arabia and to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice in accordance with international fair trial standards and without recourse to corporal punishment, and that she receives reparation for the injury she has suffered. 
The investigation should also examine whether the Saudi Arabian police or other authorities were informed of L P Ariyawathie’s allegations before her return to Sri Lanka and what action, if any, was taken in response. Any police officers or other officials who learnt of the alleged abuse but failed to take action should also be held accountable. 
L P Ariyawathie’s allegations have highlighted the long-standing problems faced by domestic workers – many of them women from developing countries in Asia – in Saudi Arabia. They face the same discriminatory judicial practices as Saudi Arabian women but are more vulnerable as they also face language difficulties and the reality of being alone in a foreign land with no relatives to turn to for help and support. Such domestic workers are especially vulnerable to violence and exploitation by their employers and have little or no recourse against such abuse. 
More needs to be done also by the authorities in the main labour supplier countries such as Sri Lanka to ensure that their nationals are adequately protected from abuses in the states to which they go to work and are afforded access to justice and reparation when they are subject to abuse. Some state authorities have recognized this and identified a need for effective monitoring and protection mechanisms to be established in labour receiving countries – as set out, for example, in Sri Lanka’s National Labour Migration Policy of 2008 – but, as yet, little has been done to put such measures in place.

Sri Lanka: The ACF Case 4 Years On: Sri Lankan Families Still Waiting for Justice 
On World Humanitarian Day (19August) Amnesty International recalls the many humanitarian workers who have fallen victim to human rights violations in Sri Lanka and the families of victims who have been frustrated in their pursuit of justice. Amnesty International calls on the UN to independently investigate violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Sri Lanka as an essential first step to accountability. 
In August 2006, 17 Sri Lankan aid workers with the international humanitarian agency Action Contre La Faim (“Action against Hunger”, or ACF) were gunned down execution style in the town of Mutur in Sri Lanka’s Trincomalee district after a period of intense fighting between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan security forces. 15 men and women were discovered lying face-down in the ACF compound with bullet wounds to the head and neck; the victims had been shot at close range. Two more murdered ACF staff members were found in a vehicle nearby; possibly killed trying to escape. 
It was the worst single attack on aid workers since the 2003 bombing of a UN headquarters in Iraq. Four years later, victims’ families are still waiting for justice. 
No one has been arrested for the ACF murders, let alone convicted. Sri Lankan police bungled the criminal investigation into the murders, failing even to secure the crime scene. Witnesses were threatened and harassed; family members have been forced into hiding or even into exile abroad. 
A Commission of Inquiry appointed in November 2006 by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to investigate this and other “serious violations of human rights” wound up nearly three years later without completing its mandate; it failed to identify the perpetrators in the ACF killings even when presented with substantial, compelling evidence of their identity. According to its Chair, the Commission “ran out of funds” and was hampered by the lack of witness protection. More than anything, the Sri Lankan government, which actively suppresses criticism and opposition, would not allow the Commission to carry out its mandates independently. 
The Commission’s report to President Rajapaksa was never made public, but leaks to the press after its mandate expired in 2009 exonerated state forces and blamed the LTTE. 
The killing of the ACF workers – as befits a crime of such magnitude – received substantial public attention, although in the end it was not enough to convince the Sri Lankan authorities to conduct an effective investigation. Other killings and enforced disappearances of humanitarian workers in Sri Lanka have gone virtually unacknowledged. 
During an August 2007 visit, UN Under-Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief John Holmes described Sri Lanka as ""one of the most dangerous places for aid workers in the world."" 
A study released by the Sri Lankan Law and SocietyTrust in March 2008 concluded that as many as 67 aid workers, most of the Tamils from the north and east, had been killed or forcibly disappeared between January 2006 and December 2007 alone, which amounted to almost one a month during the period. Victims include program, field and administrative staff of humanitarian organizations engaged in demining, development and relief projects; drivers, construction workers and masons; and Catholic and Buddhist clergy engaged in humanitarian service.1 
In June 2007, two volunteers with the Sri Lanka Red Crossattended a workshop in a Colombo suburb were abducted off a crowded railway platform by men claiming to be policemen as they and colleagues awaited a train to take them back to Batticaloa, where they worked. Their bodies, bearing gunshot wounds, were found the next day dumped near Ratnapura, nearly 100 km away. The government arrested a former air force officer, several police and military officers and accused them of political abduction, kidnapping for ransom, and murder.The suspects were released on bail in early 2008; prosecutions did not proceed. 
While the government has publicly condemned acts of violence against humanitarianstaff, there has been little action taken to ensure impartial and effective investigations, which would lead to the prosecution of those responsible. 
Today there are no credible domestic mechanisms to deal with serious human rights violations. The SriLankan Human Rights Commission lacks independence and has itself acknowledged its lack of capacity to deal with investigations into disappearances. 
At the international level, Sri Lanka has 5,749 outstanding cases being reviewed by the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances, several hundred of which have been reported since the beginning of 2006. 
Given Sri Lanka’s consistent failure to prosecute perpetrators of human rights violations,Amnesty International believes the chances of justice being served domestically in the ACF and other cases are very slim. That is why we are reiterating our call to the UN to independently investigate human rights violations in Sri Lanka including attacks on humanitarian workers.

Sri Lanka has a long history of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law and has established a number of ad hoccommissions of inquiry when pressed to account for violations by its forces.

Sri Lanka: The ACF Case 4 Years On: Sri Lankan Families Still Waiting for Justice 
On World Humanitarian Day (19August) Amnesty International recalls the many humanitarian workers who have fallen victim to human rights violations in Sri Lanka and the families of victims who have been frustrated in their pursuit of justice. Amnesty International calls on the UN to independently investigate violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Sri Lanka as an essential first step to accountability. 
In August 2006, 17 Sri Lankan aid workers with the international humanitarian agency Action Contre La Faim (“Action against Hunger”, or ACF) were gunned down execution style in the town of Mutur in Sri Lanka’s Trincomalee district after a period of intense fighting between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan security forces. 15 men and women were discovered lying face-down in the ACF compound with bullet wounds to the head and neck; the victims had been shot at close range. Two more murdered ACF staff members were found in a vehicle nearby; possibly killed trying to escape. 
It was the worst single attack on aid workers since the 2003 bombing of a UN headquarters in Iraq. Four years later, victims’ families are still waiting for justice. 
No one has been arrested for the ACF murders, let alone convicted. Sri Lankan police bungled the criminal investigation into the murders, failing even to secure the crime scene. Witnesses were threatened and harassed; family members have been forced into hiding or even into exile abroad. 
A Commission of Inquiry appointed in November 2006 by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa to investigate this and other “serious violations of human rights” wound up nearly three years later without completing its mandate; it failed to identify the perpetrators in the ACF killings even when presented with substantial, compelling evidence of their identity. According to its Chair, the Commission “ran out of funds” and was hampered by the lack of witness protection. More than anything, the Sri Lankan government, which actively suppresses criticism and opposition, would not allow the Commission to carry out its mandates independently. 
The Commission’s report to President Rajapaksa was never made public, but leaks to the press after its mandate expired in 2009 exonerated state forces and blamed the LTTE. 
The killing of the ACF workers – as befits a crime of such magnitude – received substantial public attention, although in the end it was not enough to convince the Sri Lankan authorities to conduct an effective investigation. Other killings and enforced disappearances of humanitarian workers in Sri Lanka have gone virtually unacknowledged. 
During an August 2007 visit, UN Under-Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief John Holmes described Sri Lanka as ""one of the most dangerous places for aid workers in the world."" 
A study released by the Sri Lankan Law and SocietyTrust in March 2008 concluded that as many as 67 aid workers, most of the Tamils from the north and east, had been killed or forcibly disappeared between January 2006 and December 2007 alone, which amounted to almost one a month during the period.

Laos: Peaceful protesters must be released immediately 

 
Amnesty International calls on the Lao authorities to release, immediately and unconditionally nine peaceful protesters who have gone missing since their arrest on 2 November 2009. Amnesty International considers them prisoners of conscience, arrested solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression. 
As international attention falls on Laos while it hosts the regional Southeast Asia Games beginning on 9 December, the government must ensure that the rights of all people in Laos are respected and protected. 
The nine should never have been arrested in the first place, let alone subjected to enforced disappearance. They are at high risk of torture or other ill-treatment. The Lao authorities must make their whereabouts known immediately and guarantee their safety. 
The Lao government has denied that any arrests or attempted protests have taken place. 
However, according to credible sources, on 2 November 2009, Lao security forces rounded up over 300 farmers and others who were planning to submit petitions to the authorities in the capital, Vientiane. The petitions related to grievances over loss of land, and lack of economic and social support. All but nine of those detained were released after questioning. 
The nine people, reportedly identified by the authorities as “leaders”, were first taken to Samkhe Prison in Vientiane, but according to information provided to Amnesty International, a special unit of the armed forces has since moved them to unknown locations. 
Sources in Laos have reported that family members have not been able to contact them since they were moved from Samkhe prison. They include two women, Kingkeo and Somchit, and seven men, Soubinh, Souane, Sinpasong, Khamsone, Nou, Somkhit and Sourigna. 
Information on the arrests is limited, but sources indicate that one group of petitioners were travelling from Saravan and Savannakhet in southern Laos to the capital. Security forces stopped them in the area of Pakkading, Borikhamsay province some 190 km northeast of Vientiane. Another group had traveled from the vicinity of the Nam Ngum dam, 60 km north of Vientiane. Some members of this group were stopped in Phon Hong, in Vientiane province. Another group of people were arrested in Vientiane itself. 
The Lao authorities should order a prompt, independent, impartial and thorough investigation into this case. Any persons suspected of responsibility for their enforced disappearance, including those who ordered these acts, should be prosecuted, in proceedings which meet international standards of fairness. The victims should be provided with reparations. Steps should be taken on all levels to ensure that no further enforced disappearances take place. 
These recent arrests and disappearances have taken place within days of the 10-year anniversary of the last known attempt to stage a public peaceful protest in Vientiane in October 1999. At least three former students arrested at that time remain imprisoned today, while one died in detention following torture by prison guards. Since then, the Lao authorities have continued to deny its citizens the rights to peaceful protest and assembly guaranteed under international human rights law. 
Background 
This year Laos is host for the Southeast Asian Games, a regional bi-annual sports event. The authorities have carried out meticulous preparations, but the recent arrests and enforced disappearances of peaceful petitioners risks tarnishing the occasion. 
Laos ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 25 September 2009. This core international human rights treaty places obligations on state parties to guarantee, amongst others, the rights to freedom of expression and assembly, as well as to provide safeguards for the treatment, including detention and trial of arrested persons, in accordance with human rights standards. 
Enforced disappearance is a human rights violation and a crime under international law. In addition, it violate a wide range of other human rights: the right to liberty and security of person; the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to be recognized as a person before the law; as well as the rights to fair trial and to family life. Ultimately, it can violate the right to life, as victims of enforced disappearance are often killed. 
Since the first arrests in early November, Amnesty International has received unconfirmed reports about more petitioners taken into custody in Vientiane and other provinces.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
‘Where is the justice for me?&rsquo;
The case of Troy Davis, facing execution in Georgia 
 

Introduction
Troy Anthony Davis has been on death row in Georgia for more than 15 years for the murder of a police officer he maintains he did not commit. Given that all but three of the witnesses who testified against Troy Davis at his trial have since recanted or contradicted their testimony amidst allegations that some of it had been made under police duress, there are serious and as yet unanswered questions surrounding the reliability of his conviction and the state&rsquo;s conduct in obtaining it. As the case currently stands, the government&rsquo;s pursuit of the death penalty contravenes international safeguards which prohibit the execution of anyone whose guilt is not based on &quot;clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts&quot;.(2) 
 Amnesty International does not know if Troy Davis is guilty or innocent of the crime for which he is facing execution. As an abolitionist organization, it opposes his death sentence either way. It nevertheless believes that this is one in a long line of cases in the USA that should give even ardent supporters of the death penalty pause for thought. For it provides further evidence of the danger, inherent in the death penalty, of irrevocable error. As the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court wrote in 1993, &quot;It is an unalterable fact that our judicial system, like the human beings who administer it, is fallible.&quot;(3) Or as a US federal judge said in 2006, &quot;The assessment of the death penalty, however well designed the system for doing so, remains a human endeavour with a consequent risk of error that may not be remediable.&quot;(4) 
 The case of Troy Davis is a reminder of the legal hurdles that death row inmates must overcome in the USA in order to obtain remedies in the appeal courts. In this regard, Amnesty International fears that Troy Davis&rsquo; avenues for judicial relief have been all but closed off. In particular, he is caught in a trap set by US Congress a decade ago when it withdrew funding from post-conviction defender organizations in 1995 and passed the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act in 1996. 
 This report outlines the case of Troy Davis. Executive clemency will be his last hope if the courts prove unwilling or unable to provide a meaningful remedy. Time is running out. 
 The inescapable risk of error 

Thirty years after the USA resumed executions, any notion that the US capital justice system is free from error or inequity should by now have been dispelled.(6) A landmark study published in 2000, for example, concluded that US death sentences are &quot;persistently and systematically fraught with error&quot;.(7) The study revealed that appeal courts had found serious errors &ndash; those requiring a judicial remedy &ndash; in 68 per cent of cases. The most common errors in US capital cases were &quot;(1) egregiously incompetent defense lawyers who didn&rsquo;t even look for – and demonstrably missed – important evidence that the defendant was innocent or did not deserve to die; and (2) police or prosecutors who did discover that kind of evidence but suppressed it, again keeping it from the jury.&quot; The study expressed &quot;grave doubt&quot; as to whether the courts catch all such error. 
 In Troy Davis&rsquo; case, his appeal lawyers have argued that his trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation of the state&rsquo;s evidence, including allegations that some witnesses had been coerced by the police, or to present full and effective witness testimony of their own (the prosecution presented 30 witnesses in total, the defence presented six).(8) They have also claimed that the state presented perjured testimony as well as evidence tainted by a police investigation which had used coercive tactics, including against children taken into custody for questioning. As shown below, alleged police coercion is a common theme that emerges from the affidavits that various witnesses have provided since the trial when recanting earlier statements. 
 Perhaps the starkest indicator of the fallibility of the US capital justice system is the fact that since the US Supreme Court approved new death penalty laws in 1976, more than 100 individuals have been released from death rows around the country on grounds of innocence. The cases of people like Anthony Porter &ndash; who came 48 hours from execution in 1998 after more than 16 years on death row in Illinois before being proved innocent by a group of journalism students who happened to study his case &ndash; stand as an indictment of a flawed system. In April 2002 in Illinois, the 14-member Commission appointed by the governor to examine that state&rsquo;s capital justice system in view of the number of wrongful convictions in capital cases there, reported that it was &quot;unanimous in the belief that no system, given human nature and frailties, could ever be devised or constructed that would work perfectly and guarantee absolutely that no innocent person is ever again sentenced to death&quot;. 
 In similar vein, in January 2007, after a process in which it held five public hearings and took evidence from a wide range of witnesses, a Death Penalty Study Commission established by the New Jersey legislature recommended abolition of the death penalty in that state. The Commission had failed to find any compelling evidence that the death penalty served any legitimate penological purpose, and it concluded that only abolition could eliminate the risk of irreversible arbitrariness and error. New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission Report, January 2007.(9) 
 Yet still some maintain that exonerations of condemned inmates are a sign of the system working. Among those who have perpetuated this myth is US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. Such exonerations, he has contended, demonstrate &quot;not the failure of the system but its success&quot;. Justice Scalia added:
&quot;Like other human institutions, courts and juries are not perfect. One cannot have a system of criminal punishment without accepting the possibility that someone will be punished mistakenly. That is a truism, not a revelation. But with regard to the punishment of death in the current American system, that possibility has been reduced to an insignificant minimum.&quot;(10) 
 It is disturbing that anyone, let alone a Justice of the Supreme Court, should consider as &quot;insignificant&quot; the risk of wrongful convictions in capital cases given what is known about the repeated failures of the system. The risk was not insignificant to the more than 100 individuals sentenced to death since 1976 who spent, on average, more than nine years between conviction and exoneration.(11) Factors that contributed to these wrongful convictions include prosecutorial or police misconduct and inadequate legal representation.
Of particular relevance in Troy Davis&rsquo;s case is the question of the reliability of the witness testimony used by the state to send him to death row. The problem of unreliable witness testimony as a source of error in capital cases has long been recognized. For example, a major study published in 1987 found that:
&quot;By far the most frequent cause of erroneous convictions in our catalogue of 350 cases was error by witnesses; more than half of the cases (193) involved errors of this sort. Sometimes such errors occurred in conjunction with other errors, but often they were the primary or even the sole cause of the wrongful conviction. In one-third of the cases (117), the erroneous witness testimony was in fact perjured.&quot;(12) 
 In addition, &quot;clear injustices perpetrated by the police compose nearly a quarter of the errors&quot; identified in this study. The majority of the error attributable to the police came in the form of coerced statements, with the remainder accounted for by negligence and over-zealous police work. Such misconduct was a major contributor to the wrongful conviction of four Illinois death row inmates, who were pardoned by the state governor in 2003 on the basis that their confessions had been tortured out of them by the police.(13) The final report of the New Jersey Death Penalty Study Commission, released on 2 January 2007, noted the fallibility of eyewitness testimony in reaching the conclusion that &quot;the penological interest in executing a small number of persons guilty of murder is not sufficiently compelling to justify the risk of making an irreversible mistake&quot;. For these and other reasons, the Commission has recommended abolition of the death penalty in New Jersey.(14) 
 The problem of unreliable witness testimony, some of it exacerbated or caused by police misconduct, has been illustrated in a number of the other cases of those released since 1976 from death rows in the USA on the grounds of innocence. For example: 

In addition, a number of prisoners have been executed in the USA since 1977 despite serious doubts about their guilt. In some of these cases, the doubts centred on the reliability of witness testimony. For example: 

Amnesty International has little doubt that sooner or later it will be shown that the USA has executed at least one person since 1976 for a crime he or she did not commit. Such cases are, of course, hard to prove, especially before abolition. The state will tend to resist attempts to uncover the execution of an innocent person, and in any event, once a person has been put to death, the scarce resources of the legal and abolitionist communities will generally be directed toward trying to stop future executions.(20) One such looming execution is that of Troy Davis. 
 Deadly mix: over-zealous police & death-qualified jury? 

On 28 August 1991 Troy Davis was convicted by a jury of the murder of a police officer, 27-year-old Mark Allen McPhail, who had been shot in the car park of a Burger King fast food restaurant in Savannah, a city on the Georgia/South Carolina border, in the early hours of 19 August 1989. According to the autopsy, Officer McPhail had been hit by two bullets, one in the face and one in the body. He had died as a result of blood loss caused by the bullet that had hit him in the side of his chest and pierced his lung. 
 Troy Davis was also convicted of two counts of aggravated assault for the shooting of Michael Cooper that occurred earlier that night as Cooper was leaving a party in the nearby Cloverdale district of Savannah, and an attack on Larry Young, a homeless man, who was accosted and struck across the face with a pistol immediately before Officer McPhail was shot. A ballistics expert testified at the trial that the .38 calibre bullet that killed Officer McPhail could possibly have been fired from the same gun that wounded Michael Cooper, although he admitted that he had &quot;some doubt&quot; about this. He was &quot;confident&quot; that .38 calibre shell casings found at the Cloverdale party matched one allegedly found by a homeless man near the Burger King restaurant. The homeless man did not testify at the trial. 
 The Georgia Supreme Court would later summarize the evidence from the trial as follows:
&quot;At midnight, on August 18, 1989, the victim, a police officer, reported for work as a security guard at the Greyhound Bus Station in Savannah, adjacent to a fast food restaurant. As the restaurant was closing, a fight broke out in which Davis struck a man with a pistol. The victim, wearing his police uniform &ndash; including badge, shoulder patches, gun belt, .30 revolver, and night stick &ndash; ran to the scene of the disturbance. Davis fled. When the victim ordered him to halt, Davis turned around and shot the victim. The victim fell to the ground. Davis, smiling, walked up to the stricken officer and shot him several more times. The officer&rsquo;s gun was still in his holster&hellip; 
 The next afternoon, Davis told a friend that he had been involved in an argument at the restaurant the previous evening and struck someone with a gun. He told the friend that when a police officer ran up, Davis shot him and that he went to the officer and ‘finished the job&rsquo; because he knew the officer got a good look at his face when he shot him the first time. After his arrest, Davis told a cellmate a similar story&quot;.(21) 
 At the trial, Troy Davis denied having shot Michael Cooper at the Cloverdale party, claiming that the first time he had ever seen Cooper was in the courtroom. He admitted that he had been at the scene of the shooting outside the Burger King, but claimed that he had neither assaulted Larry Young nor shot Officer McPhail. 
 Troy Davis further denied having told anyone that he had killed Officer McPhail. In September and October 1989, Kevin McQueen was detained in the same jail as Troy Davis. McQueen told the police that during this time Troy Davis had confessed to shooting Officer McPhail. McQueen testified to this effect at the trial. Another witness, Jeffrey Sapp, also testified that Troy Davis had told him that he had shot the officer, but that it had been in self-defence. 
 The state presented 15 witnesses to testify as to Troy Davis&rsquo; guilt. One of them was Sylvester &quot;Red&quot; Coles. At the trial, Sylvester Coles admitted that he had been carrying a .38 calibre silver chrome handgun, the same calibre used in the shooting, half an hour before Officer McPhail was shot. He said that he had discarded the gun before the incident, and that he had not seen the gun again. Coles had gone to the police with a lawyer soon after the shooting and made a statement exonerating himself and implicating Troy Davis as the gunman. At the trial, Troy Davis&rsquo; defence lawyers argued:
&quot;[F]rom that point on, the entire focus of this investigation was not in deciding and finding the truth of this case as to who actually committed these crimes that the defendant is now on trial for, but it was to find evidence to convict the defendant of these crimes&hellip; They bought Mr Coles&rsquo; story hook, line and sinker. They never considered Mr Coles to be a suspect&hellip; And they went out into this community, and they rounded up witnesses everywhere they could find them, and they paraded them in here&hellip; But what about the quality, the credibility of those witnesses? 
 As already noted, studies of why wrongful convictions in capital cases occur point to a number of contributory factors, including police error or misconduct. A review of this issue published in 1996 pointed out the following:
&quot;We often talk of a miscarriage of justice as an error at trial, but that&rsquo;s a mistake. The error occurs much earlier, in the investigation of a crime, when the police identify the wrong person as the criminal. If they gather enough evidence against this innocent suspect, the error will ripen into a criminal charge; if that charge survives the formal and informal processes of pre-trial screening, it will go to trial and a jury may confirm the mistake by a wrongful conviction&hellip; 
 For the most part, the pressure to solve homicides produces the intended results&hellip; But that same pressure can also produce mistakes. If the murder cannot be readily solved, the police may be tempted to cut corners, to jump to conclusions, and &ndash; if they believe they have the killer &ndash; perhaps to manufacture evidence to clinch the case. The danger that the investigators will go too far is magnified to the extent that the killing is brutal and horrifying, and to the extent that it attracts public attention &ndash; factors which also increase the likelihood that the murder will be treated as a capital case&quot;. (22) 
 This case involves the murder of a police officer, a crime which undoubtedly heightens emotions &ndash; among the authorities seeking to bring the perpetrator to justice, as well as within the community and the media.(23) Seventy-one of the 84 prospective jurors questioned during jury selection for Troy Davis&rsquo; trial indicated that they had heard about the murder from pre-trial publicity and/or had discussed the case with other people. Indeed, 32 of these individuals were rejected during jury selection on the grounds of their bias or prejudice. Nevertheless, only one of the jurors from the pool, who had been living outside of Savannah at the time, said that he had not known anything about the case. Troy Davis&rsquo; lawyers sought a change of venue for the trial away from Chatham County where the crime occurred. This motion was denied by the trial court. 
 When denying relief for death row inmates, it is common for an appeal court or an executive clemency authority to point to the deference to be afforded to the jury&rsquo;s verdict in the original trial. Thus, in addition to the specific concern that the impartiality of Troy Davis&rsquo;s trial may have been tainted by pre-trial publicity on the case, it is worth pausing to consider the more general question of who sits on the jury in a US capital trial. 
 In a state (as opposed to federal) capital trial, 12 citizens from the county in which the trial is held (the county where the crime is committed unless a change of venue is granted) are selected to sit as a &quot;death qualified&quot; jury. At jury selection, the defence and prosecution will question the prospective jurors and have the right to exclude certain people, either for a stated reason (for cause) or without giving a reason (a peremptory challenge). Those citizens who would be &quot;irrevocably committed&quot; to vote against the death penalty can be excluded for cause by the prosecution, under the 1968 US Supreme Court ruling in Witherspoon v. Illinois.(24) In 1985, in Wainwright v. Witt, the Supreme Court relaxed the Witherspoon standard, thereby expanding the class of potential jurors who could be dismissed for cause during jury selection.(25) Under the Witt standard, a juror can be dismissed for cause if his or her feelings about the death penalty would &quot;prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath&quot;. 
 In 1998, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions expressed concern that &quot;while the jury system was intended to represent the community as a whole, the community can hardly be represented when those who oppose the death penalty or have reservations about it seem to be systematically excluded from sitting as jurors&quot;.(26) The problem goes beyond this, however. There is evidence that a &quot;death-qualified&quot; jury is more conviction-prone than its non-death-qualified counterpart. This raises special concerns given the irrevocability of the death penalty. 
 In 1986, the US Supreme Court acknowledged evidence from research that the &quot;death qualification&quot; of juries &quot;produces juries somewhat more ‘conviction-prone&rsquo; than ‘non-death-qualified&rsquo; juries&quot;.(27) The Court had been presented with 15 published studies each finding that death-qualified jurors were more conviction-prone than excludable jurors. Three Justices referred to this &quot;overwhelming evidence that death-qualified juries are substantially more likely to convict or to convict on more serious charges than juries on which unalterable opponents of capital punishment are permitted to serve&quot;, adding that &quot;death-qualified jurors are, for example, more likely to believe that a defendant&rsquo;s failure to testify is indicative of his guilt, more hostile to the insanity defence, more mistrustful of defence attorneys, and less concerned about the danger of erroneous convictions&quot; (emphasis added).(28) 
 The three Justices went on to note that &quot;the true impact of death qualification on the fairness of a trial is likely even more devastating than the studies show&quot;. They noted that the Witherspoon ruling, while limiting the state&rsquo;s &quot;ability to strike scrupled jurors for cause&quot;, had said nothing about the prosecution&rsquo;s use of peremptory challenges to eliminate jurors who had less than absolute opposition to imposing the death penalty. There was &quot;no question&quot;, the Justices added, &quot;that peremptories have indeed been used to this end&quot;. 
 In 1998, a review of the existing research indicated that a &quot;favourable attitude towards the death penalty translates into a 44 per cent increase in the probability of a juror favouring conviction&quot;.(29) Another expert review in 1998 concluded that:
&quot;Death-qualification standards theoretically exist to ensure that capital defendants will be tried by impartial jurors. The research, however, demonstrates that there is a deep chasm between the law&rsquo;s intentions and the result of death qualification in practice. Rather than ensuring impartiality, the result can more accurately be envisioned as a stacked deck against the defendant: death-qualified jurors, regardless of the standard, are more conviction-prone, less concerned with due process, and they are more inclined to believe the prosecution than are excludable jurors.&quot;(30) 
 In Troy Davis&rsquo; trial in 1991, the jury rejected the defence argument that this was a case of mistaken identity and that it was Sylvester Coles and not Davis who had shot Officer McPhail. Instead, the jury accepted the prosecution&rsquo;s theory and convicted Troy Davis on all counts. The trial moved into the sentencing phase. 
 At the time of Troy Davis&rsquo; trial in 1991, support for the death penalty in the USA was far stronger than it is today. Death sentencing rates in the United States were approaching their zenith. Some 268 people were sentenced to death in the country in 1991. Death sentencing would peak in the next few years &ndash; reaching its apex of 317 new death sentences in 1996 &ndash; before beginning to drop off. In 2004 and 2005, for example, there were 138 and 128 new death sentences respectively &ndash; each only about half of the 1991 total. Factors contributing to this reduction in juries passing death sentences are believed to include the number of wrongful convictions in capital cases, a diminished belief in the deterrence value of the death penalty, and the availability of the sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In other words, a greater public awareness of the possibility of irrevocable mistakes, coupled with increased confidence that public security can be ensured by locking up defendants for life rather than killing them, has led to a greater reluctance among capital jurors to pass death sentences.(31) 
 At the time of Troy Davis&rsquo;s trial, jurors in Georgia did not have the option of life imprisonment without parole as an alternative to the death penalty.(32) In addition, by that time there had been &quot;only&quot; 150 executions carried out across the USA since executions resumed in 1977. There have been more than 900 executions since his trial. Indeed, in the late 1980s, it was being suggested that the average capital juror in the USA &quot;may well not believe &ndash; at the time he or she votes for sentence &ndash; that a death sentence is likely to ever be carried out. Indeed, that juror may well believe that a death sentence may result merely in a longer prison term while the protracted appellate process follows its course&quot;.(33) In 1986, Georgia Supreme Court Justice Charles Weltner said: &quot;Everybody believes that a person sentenced to life for murder will be walking the streets in seven years&quot;.(34) 
 Sixty-five per cent of all executions carried out in the USA between 1 January 1977 and 1 January 2007 occurred in the decade from 1995 to 2004. This period was accompanied by numerous revelations about the inequities inherent in the use of capital punishment. By the time of Troy Davis&rsquo;s trial in 1991, for example, fewer than 40 people had been released from death rows since 1977 on the grounds of innocence. In the years since, more than 70 such cases have been uncovered, with the attendant publicity increasing as the total reached and surpassed 100. 
 At the sentencing phase of his trial, Troy Davis maintained his innocence and asked the jury to spare his life. His trial lawyers urged the jurors to consider any &quot;little nagging lingering doubts&quot; that they may have in their minds and not to pass a death sentence. Their appeals fell on deaf ears. On 30 August 1991, the jury backed the prosecution and sentenced Troy Davis to death for the murder of Officer Mark McPhail. 
 With the current state of public knowledge about the risk of errors in capital cases, about the repeated instances of prosecutorial misconduct and inadequate legal representation, and about the unreliability of certain witness testimony, and given the alternative of life imprisonment without parole, would a jury today &ndash; presented with the evidence from the 1991 trial &ndash; sentence Troy Davis to death? 
 The state&rsquo;s evidence is not what it was 15 years ago, however. Therefore another question must also be asked. If the jurors from the original trial were presented with the evidence as it stands today, would they still support a death sentence? 
 The witnesses &ndash; recanted and new testimony 

There was no physical evidence against Troy Davis and the weapon used in the crime was never found. The case against him consisted entirely of witness testimony which contained inconsistencies even at the time of the trial. In state habeas corpus proceedings in 1996, one of his trial lawyers recalled that there had been &quot;a number of witnesses who either saw the actual shooting or saw the incident involving Mr Young, Larry Young. And there were a lot of inconsistencies about the colour of shorts, whether someone had a hat on or didn&rsquo;t have a hat on, about size, about skin colouration.&quot;(35) 
 Nevertheless, the State of Georgia maintains that the conviction and death sentence against Troy Davis are reliable. For example, a legal brief it filed in federal court in 2005 in the case stated: &quot;Red Coles identified petitioner as the perpetrator of Officer McPhail&rsquo;s murder, as did numerous other eyewitnesses, including Harriet Murray, Dorothy Ferrell, Daryl Collins, Antoine Williams, Steven Sanders and Larry Young.&quot;(36) However, in affidavits signed over the years since the trial, all but three of the witnesses whose testimony secured the conviction and death sentence against Troy Davis have recanted or contradicted their trial testimony. At oral arguments in September 2005 in the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (see below) a lawyer from the Georgia Attorney General&rsquo;s office dismissed the recantations, describing them as &quot;rank hearsay.&quot; (37) Yet the state is relying on the testimony from those same individuals to support its bid to kill Troy Davis. 
 All but three of the state&rsquo;s non-police witnesses from the trial have recanted their testimony. One of the three who has not recanted his testimony is Sylvester Coles &ndash; the principle alternative suspect, according to the defence at the trial, and against whom there is new evidence implicating him as the gunman. Another is Steven Sanders. He was one of a number of members of the US Air Force who were in a van at the drive-in section of the Burger King restaurant at the time of the crime. In a statement given to police shortly after the shooting, Stephen Sanders said that he had seen a &quot;black male wearing a white hat and white shirt, black shorts&quot; shoot the officer and then run off with another person who Sanders thought was wearing a &quot;black outfit&quot;. He said that he &quot;wouldn&rsquo;t recognize them again except for their clothes&quot;. However, for the first time, two years later, at the trial, Stephen Sanders identified Troy Davis as the gunman. At the time of writing, Troy Davis&rsquo; lawyers had not been able to contact Steven Sanders. Two of his Air Force colleagues, Daniel Kinsman and Robert Grizzard, who were with Sanders at the time of the crime, have signed affidavits standing by their statements given to the police that they could not identify the gunman (see below). Robert Grizzard has said that, contrary to what he mistakenly testified at the trial, he could not then and still could not recall what the gunman was wearing. For his part, Daniel Kinsman has testified that he remains convinced that the gunman was firing the gun with his left hand. Troy Davis is right-handed. 
 A third witness who has contradicted her trial testimony is Harriet Murray. Murray, who was also homeless at the time, was with her friend Larry Young on the night of the crime. Her various statements given to the police, at the preliminary hearing, at the trial, and in an affidavit signed on 14 October 2002 are inconsistent. According to Troy Davis&rsquo;s federal appeals, Harriet Murray&rsquo;s police statement and her testimony at the preliminary hearing appear to implicate Sylvester Coles. At the subsequent trial she identified Troy Davis as the gunman, but was not asked and did not say whether the man who followed Larry Young, harassed him and attacked him was the same person who shot the police officer. In her 2002 affidavit, she did not identify Troy Davis as the shooter. This was consistent with a statement she gave to police after the crime, in which she simply stated that she had witnessed &quot;a black man&quot; accost Larry Young and hit him on side of the face with his gun. She said she saw the same man subsequently shoot the police officer. She said that she had also seen &quot;two other black men&quot; nearby but they were &quot;not right up with Larry and the other man&quot;. 
 Troy Davis&rsquo; lawyers have argued in appeal briefs filed in federal court that the description contained in Harriet Murray&rsquo;s 2002 affidavit, her 1989 police statement and 1989 preliminary hearing testimony identify Sylvester Coles as the person who shot Officer McPhail in four respects. Firstly, Murray describes the gunman as the man who argued with Larry Young and who had tried &quot;to start something with Larry&quot;. The lawyers state that at the trial, Sylvester Coles admitted to being the only person who had been &quot;picking a fight&quot; with Young. Secondly, in her affidavit, Harriet Murray recalls that the gunman shouted to Young, &quot;You don&rsquo;t know me. I&rsquo;ll shoot you.&quot; The lawyers stated that at the trial, Larry Young testified that the person with whom he argued shouted something like &quot;You don&rsquo;t know me, I&rsquo;ve got a gun, I&rsquo;ll shoot you&quot;. They state that neither Troy Davis nor Darrell Collins (see below) had said anything to Young. Thirdly, Harriet Murray&rsquo;s affidavit recalls that the man who argued with Young had followed the latter up Oglethorpe Avenue.(38) The lawyers state that at the trial, Larry Young and Sylvester Coles had testified that it had been Coles who had followed Young up Oglethorpe Avenue. Finally, the affidavit states that the &quot;two other black men&quot; were walking through the bank drive-in section and were not near Larry Young when he was assaulted. The lawyers state that this was consistent with what Coles, Young and Davis testified at trial. 
 The witnesses in Troy Davis&rsquo; case fall into a number of categories. There are &quot;informants&quot;, who claimed that Troy Davis told them that he had shot Officer McPhail. There are &quot;eyewitnesses&quot;, who were present at or near the scene of the crime. There are &quot;party witnesses&quot; who were present at the Cloverdale party and were used to link Davis to the shooting of Michael Cooper that occurred there prior to the killing of the police officer. Finally, there are a number of people who were not heard at trial, including those whose affidavit statements implicate Sylvester Coles as the gunman. 
 The witnesses are listed below by category and in the chronological order in which their affidavits were signed.(39) 
 1. ‘Informant&rsquo; testimony 
 The Commission on Capital Punishment, set up by Governor Ryan of Illinois after he imposed a moratorium on executions in 2000, examined the question of testimony provided by in-custody informants. The Commission&rsquo;s April 2002 report concluded that, even with stringent safeguards on the use of such evidence, &quot;the potential for testimony of questionable reliability remains high, and imposing the death penalty in such cases appears ill-advised&quot;. The Commission points out that &quot;a number of the Illinois cases in which inmates were ultimately released from death row involved proffers of testimony from in-custody informants, and much of which was of dubious veracity.&quot; It recommended that prosecutors and defence lawyers involved in capital cases should receive periodic training on &quot;the risks of false testimony by in-custody informants&quot;. 
 In 1996, a federal judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit offered the following advice to prosecutors: &quot;The most dangerous informer of all is the jailhouse snitch who claims another prisoner has confessed to him&hellip; The precautionary rule of thumb with a jailhouse confession presented by another inmate is that it is false until the contrary is proved beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;.(40) 
 Kevin McQueen
Affidavit, 5 December 1996
In September and October 1989, Kevin McQueen was detained in the same jail as Troy Davis. McQueen told the police that during this time Troy Davis had confessed to shooting Officer Mark McPhail. In his 1996 affidavit, he retracted this statement, saying that he had given it because he wanted to &quot;get even&quot; with Davis following a confrontation he said the two of them had allegedly had. 
 &quot;The truth is that Troy never confessed to me or talked to me about the shooting of the police officer. I made up the confession from information I had heard on T.V. and from other inmates about the crimes. Troy did not tell me any of this&hellip; I have now realized what I did to Troy so I have decided to tell the truth&hellip; I need to set the record straight&quot;. 
 Monty Holmes
Affidavit, 17 August 2001
Monty Holmes testified against Troy Davis in a preliminary pre-trial hearing, but did not testify at the trial, as he explains in an affidavit signed in August 2001:
&quot;In August of 1989, the police came to talk to me about the officer who was killed in Savannah. They wanted to know if Troy Davis was involved in the shooting and whether he had said anything to me about being involved with the shooting&hellip; By the way the police were talking, I thought I was going to be in trouble. I told them I didn&rsquo;t know anything about who shot the officer, but they kept questioning me. I was real young at that time and here they were questioning me about the murder of a police officer like I was in trouble or something. I was scared&hellip; [I]t seemed like they wouldn&rsquo;t stop questioning me until I told them what they wanted to hear. So I did. I signed a statement saying that Troy told me that he shot the cop.&quot; 
 When I had to go to court that first time, I felt like I had to say what was in that statement or I&rsquo;d be in trouble, so that&rsquo;s what I did. When it came to the trial though, I didn&rsquo;t want to go because I knew that the truth was that Troy never told me anything about shooting [the police officer]. I heard the police were coming by to give me a subpoena for trial. I dodged the subpoena but they still left it with my mother. I still didn&rsquo;t feel like I could walk in a court and say those things so I didn&rsquo;t go to the trial&quot;. 
 Monty Holmes&rsquo; pre-trial testimony was admitted at the trial without cross-examination possible due to his absence. Article 14.3(e) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that any criminal defendant must be allowed, &quot;in full equality&quot;, to be able &quot;to examine, or have examined, the witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him&quot;. While Monty Holmes knowingly avoided testifying at the trial, if his pre-trial testimony and his absence from the trial were influenced by coercive tactics allegedly employed by the police, the state played a role in undermining the right of Troy Davis to a fair trial. 
 Jeffrey Sapp
Affidavit, 9 February 2003
Jeffrey Sapp testified that Troy Davis had told him that he had shot the officer in self-defence. In his affidavit, he stated:
&quot;I remember when the officer got shot down at Burger King&hellip; The police came and talked to me and put a lot of pressure on me to say, ‘Troy said this&rsquo; or ‘Troy said that&rsquo;. They wanted me to tell them that Troy confessed to me about killing that officer. The thing is, Troy never told me anything about it. I got tired of them harassing me, and they made it clear that the only way they would leave me alone is if I told them what they wanted to hear. I told them that Troy told me he did it, but it wasn&rsquo;t true. Troy never said that or anything like it. When it came time for Troy&rsquo;s trial, the police made it clear to me that I needed to stick to my original statement; that is, what they wanted me to say. I didn&rsquo;t want to have any more problems with the cops, so I testified against Troy&quot;. 
 2. ‘Eyewitness&rsquo; testimony 
 Dorothy Ferrell
Affidavit, 29 November 2000
At the trial, Dorothy Ferrell, who was staying at a hotel near the Burger King at the time of the crime, identified Troy Davis as the person who had shot Officer McPhail, emphasising &quot;I&rsquo;m real sure, that that is him and, you know, it&rsquo;s not a mistaken identity&quot;. 
 After the guilt/innocence phase of the trial had ended, the wife of Troy Davis&rsquo; defence lawyer received a telephone call from a woman who identified herself as Dorothy Ferrell, and stated that she had lied on the witness stand. The prosecution then revealed that Dorothy Ferrell had written a letter to District Attorney Spencer Lawton requesting &quot;a favour&quot; and his &quot;help&quot; with her own difficulties with the law. She was on parole at the time. She wrote in the letter: &quot;Mr Lawton if you would please help me, I promise you, you won&rsquo;t be making a mistake&quot; [emphasis in original]. 
 After this revelation, Dorothy Ferrell was recalled to the witness stand, outside of the presence of the jury. She denied having made the telephone call, but admitted to having written the letter. The judge then offered the defence the opportunity to cross-examine Dorothy Ferrell in the presence of the jury, but they did not do so, instead calling for a mistrial on the grounds that the prosecution had withheld information from the defence. The trial judge denied their motion for a new trial. 
 In her affidavit signed in November 2000, Dorothy Ferrell recalled that she had been staying in a hotel opposite the Burger King restaurant on the night of the shooting. She said that she heard a woman scream and gunshots. In her affidavit, she recalls seeing &quot;more than two guys running away&quot;, but states that she did not see who the gunman was. After the crime, she was asked to go down to the police station, where she was made to wait until she gave a statement. The affidavit continues:
&quot;I was real tired because it was the middle of the night and I was pregnant too&hellip; I was scared that if I didn&rsquo;t do what the police wanted me to do, then they would try to lock me up again. I was on parole at the time and I had just gotten home from being locked up earlier that year. 
 When the police were talking to me, it was like they wanted me to say I saw the shooting and to sign a statement. I wanted to be able to leave and so I just said what they wanted me to say. I thought that would be the end of it, but it turned out not to be the end.&quot; 
 Some time later, a police detective visited Dorothy Ferrell and showed her a photograph of Troy Davis, and told her that other witnesses had identified him as the gunman:
&quot;From the way the officer was talking, he gave me the impression that I should say that Troy Davis was the one who shot the officer like the other witness [sic] had&hellip; I felt like I was just following the rest of the witnesses. I also felt like I had to cooperate with the officer because of my being on parole&hellip;I told the detective that Troy Davis was the shooter, even though the truth was that I didn&rsquo;t see who shot the officer.&quot; 
 In her affidavit, Dorothy Ferrell recalls her fear that if she did not repeat her statement at the trial, she would be charged with perjury and &quot;sent back to jail&quot;. She says that she spoke to two lawyers who said that she could be so charged and could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison. 
 &quot;I had four children at that time, and I was taking care of them myself. I couldn&rsquo;t go back to jail. I felt like I didn&rsquo;t have any choice but to get up there and testify to what I said in my earlier statements. So that&rsquo;s what I did.&quot; 
 On the question of the telephone call made to Troy Davis&rsquo; defence counsel at the time of the trial, Dorothy Ferrell&rsquo;s affidavit adds that:
&quot;I didn&rsquo;t make that call to the house of the attorney but my friend made the call after she and I had talked. I told my friend about how I had testified to things that weren&rsquo;t the truth and I was feeling bad about it. That&rsquo;s why she made the call.&quot; 
 Darrell &quot;D.D.&quot; Collins
Affidavit, 11 July 2002
Darrell Collins was a friend of Troy Davis who was with him on the night of the crime. At the time, he was 16 years old. In his affidavit he said that the day after the shooting, 15 or 20 police officers came to his house, &quot;a lot of them had their guns drawn&quot;. They took him in for questioning, and the affidavit continues:
&quot;When I got to the barracks, the police put me in a small room and some detectives came in and started yelling at me, telling me that I knew that Troy Davis&hellip;killed that officer by the Burger King. I told them that&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t see Troy do nothing. They got real mad when I said this and started getting in my face. They were telling me that I was an accessory to murder and that I would pay like Troy was gonna pay if I didn&rsquo;t tell them what they wanted to hear. They told me that I would go to jail for a long time and I would be lucky if I ever got out, especially because a police officer got killed&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t want to go to jail because I didn&rsquo;t do nothing wrong. I was only sixteen and was so scared of going to jail. They kept saying that&hellip;[Troy] had messed with that man up at Burger King and killed that officer. I told them that it was Red and not Troy who was messing with that man, but they didn&rsquo;t want to hear that&hellip; 
 After a couple of hours of the detectives yelling at me and threatening me, I finally broke down and told them what they wanted to hear. They would tell me things that they said had happened and I would repeat whatever they said.&quot; 
 Darrell Collins said that he signed a typed statement without reading it, and was then allowed to go home. According to his affidavit, he was questioned again about a week later by the police who gave him another typed statement to sign. He said he again signed the statement without reading it. The affidavit continues:
&quot;I testified against Troy at his trial. I remember that I told the jury that Troy hit the man that Red was arguing with. That is not true. I never saw Troy do anything to the man. I said this at the trial because I was still scared that the police would throw me in jail for being an accessory to murder if I told the truth about what happened&hellip; 
 It is time that I told the truth about what happened that night, and what is written here is the truth. I am not proud for lying at Troy&rsquo;s trial, but the police had me so messed up that I felt that&rsquo;s all I could do or else I would go to jail.&quot; 
 Larry Young
Affidavit, 11 October 2002
Larry Young was the homeless man who was accosted and then struck in the face, and whose shouts drew the attention of Officer McPhail. At the trial, he implicated Troy Davis as the man who had assaulted him, but only identifying him by his clothing. His affidavit, signed in 2002, offers further evidence of a coercive police investigation into the murder of their fellow officer, and states that he &quot;couldn&rsquo;t honestly remember what anyone looked like or what different people were wearing&quot;. 
 &quot;After I was assaulted that night, I went into the bathroom at the bus station and tried to wash the blood off my face. I had a big gash on my face and there was blood everywhere. I was in a lot of pain. When I left the bathroom, some police officers grabbed me and threw me down on the hood of the police car and handcuffed me. They treated me like a criminal, like I was the one who killed the officer. Even though I was homeless at that time and drinking and drugging, I didn&rsquo;t have nothing to do with killing the officer. I told the officers that, but they just locked me in the back of the police car for the next hour or so. I kept yelling that I needed to be treated but they didn&rsquo;t pay me no mind. They then took me to the police station and interrogated me for three hours. I kept asking them to treat my head, but they wouldn&rsquo;t. 
 They kept asking me what had happened at the bus station, and I kept telling them that I didn&rsquo;t know. Everything happened so fast down there. I couldn&rsquo;t honestly remember what anyone looked like or what different people were wearing. Plus, I had been drinking that day, so I just couldn&rsquo;t tell who did what. The cops didn&rsquo;t want to hear that and kept pressing me to give them answers. They made it clear that we weren&rsquo;t leaving until I told them what they wanted to hear. They suggested answers and I would give them what they wanted. They put typed papers in my face and told me to sign them. I did sign them without reading them. 
 I never have been able to make sense of what happened that night. It&rsquo;s as much a blur now as it was then.&quot; 
 Antoine Williams
Affidavit, 12 October 2002
Antoine Williams, an employee of Burger King, had just driven into the restaurant&rsquo;s car park at the time the shooting occurred. At the trial, he identified Troy Davis as the person who had shot Officer McPhail. In 2002 he stated that this was false, and that he had signed a statement for the police which he could not and did not read. 
 &quot;I couldn&rsquo;t really tell what was going on because I had the darkest shades of tint you could possibly have on my windows of my car. As soon as I heard the shot and saw the officer go down, I ducked down under the dash of my car. I was scared for my life and I didn&rsquo;t want to get shot myself&hellip; 
 Later that night, some cops asked me what had happened. I told them what is written here [in the affidavit]. They asked me to describe the shooter and what he looked like and what he was wearing. I kept telling them that I didn&rsquo;t know. It was dark, my windows were tinted, and I was scared. It all happened so fast. Even today, I know that I could not honestly identify with any certainty who shot the officer that night. I couldn&rsquo;t then either. After the officers talked to me, they gave me a statement and told me to sign it. I signed it. I did not read it because I cannot read.(41) 
 At Troy Davis&rsquo; trial, I identified him as the person who shot the officer. Even when I said that, I was totally unsure whether he was the person who shot the officer. I felt pressured to point at him because he was the one who was sitting in the courtroom. I have no idea what the person who shot the officer looks like.&quot; 
 Daniel Kinsman
Affidavit, 15 October 2002
Daniel Kinsman was with other Air Force personnel in a van in the Burger King car park at the time of the crime. He was interviewed by police. He describes himself as having been &quot;relatively close to the scene&quot; of the shooting, but remains confident that he would &quot;not have been able to make any identification of the shooter due to the poor lighting and the chaotic nature of the scene&quot;. In the affidavit, Daniel Kinsman recalls &quot;two things that stand out to this day about what I witnessed at the Burger King&quot;. First, as he told the police, &quot;there was and is no doubt in my mind that the person who shot the officer had the gun in and was shooting with his left hand.&quot; Second, the gun had a &quot;shiny finish&hellip; not dull in any sense of the term.&quot; Troy Davis is right-handed. 
 Robert Grizzard
Affidavit, 23 March 2003
In 1989, Robert Grizzard was a Sergeant in the US Air Force, and was in Savannah for a training exercise. He was in a van in the Burger King car park at the time of the shooting of Officer McPhail. In his affidavit, Robert Grizzard stated:
&quot;I have reviewed the transcript of my testimony from the trial of Troy Davis&hellip; During my testimony I said that the person who shot the officer was wearing a light coloured shirt. The truth is that I don&rsquo;t recall now and I didn&rsquo;t recall then what the shooter was wearing, as I said in my initial statement [to the police]. My testimony to the contrary was an honest mistake on my part&hellip; As I said in my statement given on that night, I do not and did not remember what the shooter was wearing.&quot; 
 3. ‘Party&rsquo; testimony 
 In the hours before the shooting of Officer McPhail there was a party in the nearby neighbourhood of Cloverdale, Savannah. As Michael Cooper and a group of friends were leaving the party in their car, shots were fired, wounding Cooper. Troy Davis was convicted of aggravated assault for the shooting. 
 At the trial, Darrell Collins repudiated his initial statement to the police that Troy Davis had shot at the car. He testified that he had not seen Troy Davis with a gun on the night of the shooting. Michael Cooper testified that he had not seen who shot him. In a 2002 affidavit (below), he repudiates a statement he allegedly gave to police implicating Troy Davis. Benjamin Gordon testified that he had not seen who shot Cooper, contrary to a statement he gave to police after the crime. In a 2003 affidavit (below) he states that the statement he gave to police (when he was 15) had been coerced. Craig Young testified at trial that a statement he gave to police in which he stated that Troy Davis had threatened some guests at the Cloverdale party and that Davis had told him that he had fought with another guest were false and coerced by the police. 
 In a 1995 affidavit, April Hester (below) stated that Sylvester Coles was at the Cloverdale party. 
 Joseph Blige 
Affidavit, 1 December 1995
Joseph Blige, who was 15 years old at the time of the crime, went to the Cloverdale party. He was in the car that was shot at, and in which Michael Cooper was wounded. His affidavit stated that neither he nor anyone he was with at the party &quot;had any words or any problem with Troy Davis&quot;. 
 &quot;As we drove off Michael yelled something out the window and shooting started. Our car was hit at least six times. I heard more than six shots. I head more than one weapon being fired. At least one of the weapons being fired was an automatic. It could not have been a revolver because the shots came too fast. 
We drove Michael to the hospital. The police talked to us there in the hospital parking lot. A sergeant picked up a bullet from behind the panelling in the door of the car. There was [sic] different size bullet holes in the car. The sergeant saw all the bullet holes. He saw the blood in the car. I do not know what he did with the bullet he picked up. The police did not want to keep the car for evidence. We left in the car. 
 The next morning the police got me from Yamacraw and asked me lots of questions about the shooting of the police officer that happened at the bus station. They even tried telling me they knew I shot the officer.&quot; 
 Michael Cooper
Affidavit, 10 February 2002
Michael Cooper was shot and wounded on leaving the Cloverdale party. Troy Davis was convicted of the shooting at his trial for the murder of Officer McPhail which happened later the same night. In his affidavit, Michael Cooper states that:
&quot;I have had a chance to review a statement which I supposedly gave to police officers on June 25, 1991. I remember that they asked a lot of questions and typed up a statement which they told me to sign. I did not read the statement before I signed. In fact, I have not seen it before today. In that statement, the police said that I told them that Mark [Wilds] told me that Troy shot me. I never told the police that. Mark never said that to me. What is written in that statement is a lie. I do not know who shot me that night. I do not know it now, and I did not know it then.&quot; 
 Benjamin Gordon
Affidavit, 10 February 2003
Benjamin Gordon, who was 15 years old at the time of the crime, had been at the party in Cloverdale and was leaving in the car with Michael Cooper when the latter was shot and wounded. In his affidavit, he states that &quot;the shooting came from the shadows next to the street&quot;, and that &quot;I never saw who did the shooting&quot;. The affidavit continues:
&quot;Later that night, police officers came and dragged me from my house in Yamacraw. There were police officers everywhere after the police officer was killed and it seemed like they were taking everyone in Yamacraw to the police barracks for questioning. I was handcuffed and they put a nightstick under my neck. I had just turned sixteen and was scared as hell. The police officers took me to the barracks and put me in a small room. Over the next couple of hours, three or so officers questioned me &ndash; at first, they called me a motherfucker and told me that I had shot the officer. They told me that I was going to the electric chair. They got in my face and yelled at me a lot. The cops then told me that I did the shooting over in Cloverdale. I just kept telling them that I didn&rsquo;t do anything, but they weren&rsquo;t hearing that. After four or five hours, they told me to sign some papers. I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I didn&rsquo;t read what they told me to sign and they didn&rsquo;t ask me to. 
 When it came time for trial, I was in jail, and the sheriff&rsquo;s office transported me to the courthouse. A person in a suit told me to say to the court what I had told the police. I believe that person was with the District Attorney&rsquo;s office. 
 No one working on Troy&rsquo;s case even came to speak to me before trial. If they would have, I would have talked to them and told them what is contained in this affidavit.&quot; 
 4. Testimony implicating Sylvester Coles 
 Affidavits have been signed by a number of people who knew Sylvester Coles or saw him at or after the shooting. 
 Joseph Washington
Affidavit, 6 December 1996
Joseph Washington, who was 16 years old at the time of the crime, was at the party in Cloverdale. In his affidavit, he has stated that:
&quot;Very soon after the shooting at the Cloverdale party I went to Fahm street right near the Burger King. This is where I saw Sylvester Coles &ndash; I know him by the name Red &ndash; shoot the police officer. I am positive that it was Red who shot the police officer&hellip; Red was wearing a white shirt with a Batman print on the front of it. 
 This is the first time I have been asked about the shirt Red was wearing. I would have testified to this but I was not asked by the state or by Troy&rsquo;s lawyers. At the time of the shooting and the trial I was very young. I did not want to testify because I knew my testimony was going to be on television. I had no idea that the shirt Red was wearing at that time was important because no one ever asked me. 
 I was very nervous when I testified&hellip; I got confused by [the] questions.&quot; 
 Tonya Johnson
Affidavit, 6 December 1996
Tonya Johnson was living not far from the Burger King where Officer McPhail was shot. In her affidavit, she stated that she heard the shots and saw:
&quot;Sylvester Coles &ndash; we all called him Red &ndash; and a guy named Terry coming down the street from the Burger King. When I saw Red and Terry they were both in a panic and very nervous. Red and Terry each had a gun with them at that time. Red asked me to hold the guns for him, which I refused to do. Red then took both guns next door to an empty house and put them inside the screen door and shut the door&hellip; I have known Red all of my life. He used to live next door to me&hellip; For most of my life I have been scared to death of him. In fact, he threatened me after this happened. He told me that he wanted to make sure that I did not tell the police about the guns he hid in the screen door that morning. This is why I did not testify about the guns at Troy&rsquo;s trial because I was afraid of what Red would do to me if I did. I have not told anyone about this until now because I was still scared&hellip; But I have decided that I must tell the truth.&quot; 
 Anthony Hargrove
Affidavit, 8 August 2001
&quot;I know a guy named Red, from Savannah. His real name is Sylvester Coles. I&rsquo;ve known Red for years and we used to hang out together. Red once told me that he shot a police officer and that a guy named Davis took the fall for it. He told me this about a year or so after the officer was killed&hellip; We were smoking weed and talking. Red told me that he&rsquo;d had a close one once. I asked him what he meant. Red told me he&rsquo;d killed someone and another guy took the fall for it. I asked Red who he killed. Red said he killed a policeman and a guy named Troy took the fall for it&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t real surprised to hear that Red killed an officer&hellip; Red was known to always carry a gun and he would use it.&quot; 
 Gary Hargrove
Affidavit, 17 August 2001
Gary Hargrove did not testify at the trial. His affidavit stated that he was at the Burger King at the time of the crime. In the affidavit, he recalled:
&quot;The guy who was running away looked like Troy Davis but I can&rsquo;t say for sure that it was him because he had his back to me as he was running away. They guy who was still standing there after the first shot was fired and when I heard the second shot was a guy whose nickname is Red&hellip; I am sure that Red was facing in the officer&rsquo;s direction when I heard the shooting. The guy who was running away had his back to where the officer was as the shots were going off. 
 I was never talked to by the police or any attorneys or investigators representing Troy Davis before his trial. I didn&rsquo;t go up to talk to the police that night because I was on parole at the time and was out past my curfew so I didn&rsquo;t want my parole officer to find out about that.&quot; 
 Shirley Riley
Affidavit, 18 August 2001
Shirley Riley was a friend of Sylvester Coles.
&quot;People on the streets were talking about Sylvester Coles being involved with killing the police officer so one day I asked him if he was involved&hellip; Sylvester told me he did shoot the officer&hellip;&quot; 
 Darold Taylor
Affidavit, 20 August 2001
&quot;In the mid-90s, I met a guy named Red in Yamacraw Village&hellip;Red and I ended up becoming drinking kind of friends over the years&hellip;I had heard from a lot of people in Yamacraw Village about an officer getting shot and killed at a Burger King back in 1989. Everybody who talked about that shooting in the Yamacraw area said that Red did the shooting and Red killed the officer. I remember reading in the paper once about how a guy named Troy Davis got sentenced to the electric chair&hellip; One day when I was in the parking lot of Yamacraw drinking beers with Red. I told him about how I&rsquo;d heard that he was the one who killed the officer. Red told me to stay out of his business. I asked him again if he killed the officer and Red admitted to me that he was the one who killed the officer, but then Red told me again to stay out of his business.&quot; 
 April Hester Hutchinson
Affidavit, 9 July 2002
April Hester Hutchinson (formerly April Hester), who was 18 years old at the time, and her cousins had given the party in Cloverdale which preceded the shooting of Officer McPhail and at which Michael Cooper had been shot. She had previously signed an affidavit on 30 November 1995. In this earlier affidavit, she recalled that Sylvester &quot;Red&quot; Coles had been at the party. After the shooting at the party the police had arrived. While they were there, the news came through on their radios that an officer had been shot. The police left. April and her cousins drove to Yamacraw &quot;to find out what happened&quot;: &quot;I saw Red walking fast up the street at Yamacraw. He acted very nervous and upset.&quot; 
 In her subsequent July 2002 affidavit, she stated that her earlier affidavit had been correct but had not contained everything. 
 &quot;As I walked back to my house, I saw my cousin Tonya [Johnson] talking to Red. I walked up to them. It was clear to me that Red was real nervous and was sweating profusely. He was fidgeting with his hands and could not keep still&hellip; Red turned to me and asked me if I would walk with him up to the Burger King so ‘they won&rsquo;t think that I had nothing to do with it&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s exactly what he said&hellip; 
 I told [the police] that I saw Red talking to my cousin Tonya and that Red was real nervous. I did not tell them about what Red had said to me because I was scared he would hurt me. I was thinking that if he did that to a police officer, what would he do to me? I didn&rsquo;t want to die like that officer, so I kept my mouth shut.&quot; 
 Anita Saddler
Affidavit, 10 July 2002
Anita Saddler was with Tonya Johnson (see above) on the night of the shooting.
&quot;When I saw Red and Terry, they were jumpy and couldn&rsquo;t stand still. Their eyes were shifting around and they were looking everywhere. They walked up to us and Red asked us to go up to Burger King and see what happened. Like I said, they were real nervous and fidgety. Red had a gun which was stuck into his shorts. I saw the outline of his gun through his white shirt. I had seen him with a gun many times before.&quot;&hellip;. 
 Peggie Grant
Affidavit, 11 July 2002
Peggie Grant is the mother of April Hester Hutchinson. She says that on the night of the shooting, she saw her daughter April with Red Coles, who was wearing a white T-shirt. She had shouted across to her daughter because &quot;I knew Red from the neighbourhood and knew him to act crazy and violent, especially when he was drinking. I didn&rsquo;t want April hanging out with him&quot;. The affidavit recalls:
&quot;A few hours later, April called me on the phone. She said she was back in Cloverdale. April didn&rsquo;t sound right &ndash; she was nervous and scared. I could tell that by the sound of her voice. April told me she had been down at the old police barracks and that the police had questioned her about a shooting in Cloverdale and the police officer&rsquo;s shooting. She told me that she had had a conversation with Red where he asked her to walk up with him to where the officer was shot so that the police would think that he was with her and not think he did anything. April also told me that after I had yelled at her, Red had given her a mean look and told her not to say anything to anyone about what he had said. She said she didn&rsquo;t know what to do and was scared about what Red might do to her if she told anybody.&quot; 
 Caught in a trap: Federal appeals denied 

Once a person is convicted, he or she bears the burden of showing that the conviction or sentence was tainted by error that requires a judicial remedy. It is an uphill task, and one that faces many legal and technical hurdles. 
 In 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed Troy Davis&rsquo; conviction and death sentence. In 1994, Troy Davis filed a habeas corpus petition in state court, claiming that he was the victim of miscarriage of justice and that the wrong man had been convicted of the murder. The appeal claimed that witnesses had been placed under improper pressure by police and law enforcement personnel. After an evidentiary hearing, the state habeas court denied the petition in September 1997. The court stated that the claim of coercive or suggestive law enforcement techniques had been procedurally defaulted, that is, that it could and should have been raised earlier. The court acknowledged that the failure of the defence &quot;to discover, admit or effectively argue&quot; evidence undermining the credibility of witness testimony at the trial &quot;would appear to place this case in the category of a case of ‘mistaken identity&rsquo;&quot;. However it ruled that the jury decision should stand as such evidence had been presented at the trial:
&quot;[M]any pieces of evidence supporting a finding that Coles was the shooter or highlighting inconsistencies in the testimony of witnesses who identified Davis as the shooter were indeed presented to the jury during Davis&rsquo; trial. The jury, in its rightful role as finder of fact during the trial, was responsible for evaluating the credibility of the witnesses and determining whether the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Davis shot and killed Officer McPhail. This court&hellip;cannot supplant the role of the jury and find based on its own review of the record that the jury should have concluded that the state did not carry its burden at Davis&rsquo; trial. The core purpose of the writ of habeas corpus would not be served by such a presumptuous usurpation of the jury&rsquo;s deliberative process. This court is limited to evaluating whether Davis&rsquo; rights were properly protected in the context of his jury trial.&quot; 
 The state court&rsquo;s denial of habeas corpus relief for Troy Davis was affirmed in November 2000 by the Georgia Supreme Court. The case then moved into the federal courts. Placed before them would be evidence that much of the witness testimony from the trial had been recanted, as well as additional testimony tending to support Troy Davis&rsquo; claim that he did not shoot Officer Mark McPhail. His federal habeas corpus petition was brought under a law passed in 1996, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). 
 President Bill Clinton signed the AEDPA into law on 24 April 1996. &quot;I have long sought to streamline federal appeals for convicted criminals sentenced to the death penalty&quot;, he said at the signing; &quot;For too long, and in too many cases, endless death row appeals have stood in the way of justice being served.&quot;(43) He added that &quot;from now on, criminals sentenced to death for their vicious crimes will no longer be able to use endless appeals to delay their sentences.&quot;(44) 
 The Act placed new, unprecedented restrictions on prisoners raising claims of constitutional violations. It imposed severe time limits on the raising of constitutional claims, restricted the federal courts&rsquo; ability to review state court decisions, placed limits on federal courts granting and conducting evidentiary hearings, and prohibited &quot;successive&quot; appeals except in very narrow circumstances. As one leading US lawyer has said:
&quot;The provisions of the Anti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 restricting the power of federal courts to correct constitutional error in criminal cases represent a decision that results are more important than process, that finality is more important than fairness, and that proceeding with executions is more important than determining whether convictions and sentences were obtained fairly and reliably.&quot;(45) 
 Under the AEDPA, once Troy Davis&rsquo; conviction and death sentence had been upheld by the Georgia courts, the possibility of relief in the federal courts was curtailed. Federal relief was only permissible if the decision of a state court had &quot;resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved in an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States&quot;. This deferential &quot;reasonableness&quot; standard represented &quot;a remarkable departure from the traditional role of federal courts&hellip;to declare what the law is&quot;.(46) 
 Even without the AEDPA, the Supreme Court had already curtailed the ability of death row inmates to obtain habeas corpus relief in the federal courts. Fairness was being jeopardized in the name of finality. On the question of innocence, the US Supreme Court set a high hurdle for a condemned inmate seeking to have his or her conviction and death sentence overturned on such grounds. In Herrera v. Collins in 1993, the Court said that even if, for the sake of argument, &quot;a truly persuasive post-trial demonstration of ‘actual innocence&rsquo; would render a defendant&rsquo;s execution unconstitutional and warrant federal habeas relief&quot;, the threshold to trigger such relief &quot;would necessarily be extraordinarily high because of the very disruptive effect that entertaining such claims would have on the need for finality in capital cases and the enormous burden that having to retry cases based on often stale evidence would place on the States&quot;.(47) 
 Under the 1995 Supreme Court ruling Schlup v. Delo, a condemned prisoner can obtain judicial review of otherwise barred claims if he or she produces reliable new evidence of actual innocence not available at trial, which demonstrates that it is more likely than not that with this new evidence no reasonable juror would have voted to convict.(48) This opens the Schlup &quot;gateway&quot;. The Supreme Court emphasised that the Schlup rule would apply only to the &quot;extremely rare&quot; cases in which there is a &quot;substantial claim that constitutional error has caused the conviction of an innocent person&quot;, adding that the &quot;quintessential miscarriage of justice is the execution of an innocent person.&quot; 
 In support of the claim that the police had improperly pressured witnesses into implicating Troy Davis as the gunman, the affidavits of Antoine Williams, Larry Young, Darrell Collins and Monty Holmes (see above) were introduced for the first time before federal District Court Judge John F. Nangle. The State of Georgia argued that this claim had been procedurally defaulted and could therefore not be considered by the federal judge. Judge Nangle agreed, and continued that because he was satisfied that no constitutional error had occurred, &quot;the ‘actual innocence&rsquo; gateway [under Schlup] need not be accessed&quot; to overcome the procedural default:
&quot;The Court finds that because the submitted affidavits are insufficient to raise doubts as to the constitutionality of the result at trial, there is no danger of a miscarriage of justice in declining to consider the claim.&quot;(49) 
 In his ruling in May 2004, Judge Nangle rejected other claims concerning such issues as ineffective assistance of counsel, unfair jury selection, prosecutorial misconduct, and the use of inflammatory evidence at the trial. His ruling meant that Troy Davis would not receive a hearing on the new evidence contained in the affidavits. Under the AEDPA, a federal evidentiary hearing cannot be held on claims that the prisoner could have developed in state court.(50) 
 In 1995, during the time Troy Davis was in state habeas corpus proceedings, the US Congress voted to eliminate federal funding for the post-conviction defender organizations (PCDOs) which it had established in 1988 to provide legal assistance to indigent death row prisoners. One such PCDO, the Georgia Resource Center, which was representing Troy Davis, had its budget cut by some two thirds and the number of lawyers on its staff cut from eight to two. Their case load was some 80 death row cases.(51) A lawyer working on Troy Davis&rsquo; case stated in an affidavit that &quot;I desperately tried to represent Mr Davis during this period, but the lack of adequate resources and the numerous intervening crises made that impossible&hellip; We were simply trying to avert total disaster rather than provide any kind of active or effective representation&quot;.(52) In his report on the USA in 1998, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions expressed concern that &quot;the absence of PCDOs creates a grave difficulty for defendants at the post-conviction level&quot;.(53) 
 After Judge Nangle denied Troy Davis&rsquo; appeal, the case moved to the next level of federal review, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. At oral arguments in front of a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit on 7 September 2005, Judge Rosemary Barkett expressed concern that Troy Davis had not been granted a federal hearing to present the new evidence. She asked, &quot;If these people say, ‘I was coerced by the police,&rsquo; how could [Judge Nangle] reject that without a hearing?&quot;(54) Judge Barkett reportedly suggested that without the testimony of the various trial witnesses who had now recanted, the state appeared to have no case. 
 However, on 26 September 2006, the 11th Circuit panel upheld Judge Nangle&rsquo;s ruling, finding that &quot;we cannot say that the district court erred in concluding that Davis has not borne his burden to establish a viable claim that his trial was constitutionally unfair&quot;. The Schlup gateway remained firmly closed to Troy Davis, and AEDPA-backed finality was a step closer. In December 2006, Troy Davis&rsquo; appeal for a rehearing in front of the full 11th Circuit court was rejected. His last hope for judicial intervention in the regular appeals process at that point was the US Supreme Court, which takes only a tiny percentage of the cases brought before it. 
 Clemency: recognizing the possibility of human error 
 

On 15 April 2006, President Arroyo of the Philippines ordered the commutation of all death sentences in her country &ndash; more than 1,000 &ndash; in what is believed to be the largest such act of clemency in modern times. Announcing her move, she said: &quot;I wish to announce that we are changing our policy on those who have been imposed the death penalty. We are reducing their penalty to life imprisonment. Anyone who falls and makes mistakes has a chance to stand up and correct the wrong he has committed.&quot; 
 President Arroyo&rsquo;s statement can be read two ways. Firstly, removing the death penalty reinstates the possibility of rehabilitation and reform on the part of an offender.(56) But removing the threat of execution also opens up the possibility that any mistakes committed by the state in its prosecution of the individual can be remedied while the prisoner is still alive. Thus clemency is justified whether Troy Davis is guilty or innocent of the murder of Officer Mark Allen McPhail. 
 The power of executive clemency exists as a failsafe against error and to allow consideration of evidence that the courts were unable or unwilling to reach. Clemency has been granted in a number of death penalty cases over the years in the USA, and has become more frequent as evidence of problems with the capital justice system has increased. In several cases, clemency was granted on the grounds of possible innocence.(57) In some cases, executive clemency has proven to be &quot;the decisive step that averts a terrible miscarriage of justice&quot;.(58) In 1994, for example, the governor of Virginia commuted Earl Washington&rsquo;s death sentence to life imprisonment. Six years later, DNA evidence proved his innocence and Washington was pardoned. 
 Support for clemency can come from many quarters, and can involve late changes in mind on the parts of officials previously involved in the case. One such case recently emerged in California. Appointed as a county-level judge by the then Governor of California Ronald Reagan in 1974, Judge Charles McGrath presided over the 1983 trial of Michael Morales at which the defendant was sentenced to death. Twenty-three years later, in January 2006, Judge McGrath wrote to state Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to appeal for clemency for Morales. A key witness at the trial &ndash; a jailhouse informant &ndash; had testified that Morales had confessed the crime to him in jail. At the time of the trial, Judge McGrath had found the informant&rsquo;s testimony to be credible, but in his letter in 2006 to the Governor, the judge wrote that &quot;new information has emerged to show the evidence upon which I relied in sentencing Mr Morales to death &ndash; [the jailhouse informant&rsquo;s] testimony &ndash; is false&quot;. Judge McGrath expressed his concern that Michael Morales had not received an evidentiary hearing in federal court.(59) 
 Numerous witnesses, including a jailhouse informant, whose testimony was used against Troy Davis at his trial, have since recanted or contradicted their trial testimony. Troy Davis has never had an evidentiary hearing in federal court on the issue. Justice surely demands that clemency be granted. 
 Indeed, the risk of error surely demands a rethink on the death penalty. In January 2007, Andrew Gossett, who was serving a 50-year prison sentence in Texas for sexual assault, was freed after DNA evidence confirmed his innocence. The case prompted the Dallas Morning News to speak out against executions:
&quot;That juries and judges are fallible is not a revelation. Human error is an inherent part of the system. Thank goodness that in the case of Mr. Gossett a terrible wrong has been corrected&hellip; For the condemned, evidence of an error could come too late. Lethal injections don&rsquo;t allow those second chances&hellip;Even the remote possibility of a mistake is unacceptable in death penalty cases. 
 Lawmakers have dismissed our calls for a death penalty moratorium. But the frailties in the justice system that have been exposed suggest that it&rsquo;s time to revisit this issue. When Mr. Gossett was set free last week, newly elected District Attorney Craig Watkins was in the courtroom. He thought it was important to tell Mr. Gossett, ‘We&rsquo;re sorry.&rsquo;  
 State officials won&rsquo;t have that opportunity if capital punishment is meted out incorrectly.&quot;(60) 
 Where is the Justice for me? A plea from Troy Davis
Where is the Justice for me? In 1989 I surrendered myself to the police for crimes I knew I was innocent of in an effort to seek justice through the court system in Savannah, Georgia USA. But like so many death penalty cases, that was not my fate and I have been denied justice. During my imprisonment I have lost more than my freedom, I lost my father and my family has suffered terribly, many times being treated as less than human and even as criminals. In the past I have had lawyers who refused my input, and would not represent me in the manner that I wanted to be represented. I have had witnesses against me threatened into making false statements to seal my death sentence and witnesses who wanted to tell the truth were vilified in court. 
 For the entire two years I was in jail awaiting trial I wore a handmade cross around my neck, it gave me peace and when a news reporter made a statement in the local news, &quot;Cop-killer wears cross to court,&quot; the cross was immediately taken as if I was unworthy to believe in God or him in me. The only time my family was allowed to enter the courtroom on my behalf was during the sentencing phase where my mother and sister had to beg for my life and the prosecutor simply said, &quot;I was only fit for killing.&quot; Where is the Justice for me, when the courts have refused to allow me relief when multiple witnesses have recanted their testimonies that they lied against me? 
 Because of the Anti-Terrorism Bill, the blatant racism and bias in the U.S. Court System, I remain on death row in spite of a compelling case of my innocence. Finally I have a private law firm trying to help save my life in the court system, but it is like no one wants to admit the system made another grave mistake. Am I to be made an example of to save face? Does anyone care about my family who has been victimized by this death sentence for over 16 years? Does anyone care that my family has the fate of knowing the time and manner by which I may be killed by the state of Georgia? 
 I truly understand a life has been lost and I have prayed for that family just as I pray for mine, but I am Innocent and all I ask for is a True Day in a Just Court. If I am so guilty why do the courts deny me that? The truth is that they have no real case; the truth is I am Innocent. Where is the Justice for me?  

The Invisible Victims, by Martina Correia
My name is Martina Correia and I am on Death Row in Georgia. No I have not murdered anybody, never even been on trial; I am on death row because that is where my brother lives. Death Row has been for me and my family a living nightmare. As the eldest of five children I have always been responsible for protecting my siblings, and I keep wondering what I could have done to go back in time or change past history. 
 My father died of pure depression and grief, my mother prays and prays and prays and cries and cries and cries. Late night phone calls terrify us, prison visits elate us, and death is always upon us. They say we are on the side of the murderer; we have been treated at times like criminals. 
 We temporarily lost our place of worship, we lost friends, we lost jobs but we never lost faith or the unconditional love of Troy, my brother. We became the invisible victims, the tormented, the shamed; we became the enemy of the state. I once believed in Justice, I don&rsquo;t anymore. My life is a constant battle, I fight to save my brother, I fight to save myself from cancer, I fight to protect and educate my son and I fight to see my mother smile. It is a terrible thing to know someone you love will be killed, the day, the hour, with years of constant torment and fear. On death row you see the other families awaiting execution and you don&rsquo;t know what to say: you wonder if their pain and suffering will be over or just added to. 
 My greatest fear is that in the judicial system no one really cares and my brother will be killed by the State of Georgia. I look at my son who is old enough to ask the question, &quot;Why do they want to kill my Uncle Troy?&quot; I don&rsquo;t have a good answer. I feel at times, it would be better to die of cancer than to live and see my brother executed for a crime he did not commit. I live day to day thinking of death and dying, I think to myself, &quot;What can I do to save Troy?&quot; or even, &quot;Will I be alive to see him walk free?&quot; 
 My name is Martina and I am on Death Row. 
 

Please appeal for clemency for Troy Davis 
 In Georgia, the clemency authority is the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. In its annual report of 2005, the Board describes its task thus: 
 &quot;The Parole Board has the sole constitutional authority to reduce capital punishment cases to a sentence of life or life without parole. Once a death row inmate exhausts his judicial appeals an execution date is set. At that time, the condemned inmate can request an appointment before the Board to ask for executive clemency. Prior to the appointment, the Board staff compiles an exhaustive set of reports about the circumstances of the offense, criminal history and life of the condemned inmate. Each Board member reviews the file and the appointment is scheduled to allow those in favour of clemency to appear before the entire Board. Usually the appointment is attended by the inmate&rsquo;s attorneys, family or friends. The condemned inmate does not attend the appointment. At the conclusion of the appointment, Board members each cast a confidential vote on the request to commute the death sentence. A majority of three affirmative votes is required to commute a death sentence.&quot;(61) 
 Since executions resumed in the USA in January 1977, 39 prisoners have been put to death in Georgia (by 1 February 2007). In the same period, six prisoners have been granted clemency.(62) 
 Recommendations for appeals 
 Using the information in this report, please write to the Georgia parole board, in your own words, to seek clemency for Troy Davis. If possible, write a separate appeal to each of the individual Board members. If you can only write one appeal, please send it to the Chairperson. Please write in English. We recommend that your appeals be no more than two pages in length. The following is a guide only: 
 &Oslash; explaining that you are not seeking to condone the murder of Officer Mark Allen McPhail, or to downplay the seriousness of the crime or the suffering caused;
&Oslash; explaining that you are writing to seek clemency for Troy Anthony Davis, whose judicial appeals are almost exhausted;
&Oslash; noting that almost all of the witnesses who testimony was used against Troy Davis at his trial have since recanted or contradicted their trial testimony;
&Oslash; noting the large number of wrongful convictions in capital cases that have been uncovered in the USA since 1976;
&Oslash; noting that unreliability of witness testimony has been one of the contributing factors in numerous of these cases;
&Oslash; expressing concern that Troy Davis has not had a hearing in federal court on the reliability of the witness testimony used against him at trial;
&Oslash; noting that the power of clemency in capital cases exists as a failsafe against irreversible error that the courts have been unable or unwilling to remedy;
&Oslash; noting that numerous death row inmates whose judicial appeals have been exhausted have received clemency since 1977 in the USA on the grounds of doubts about their guilt (see footnote 57);
&Oslash; calling on the Board to commute the death sentence of Troy Davis.

This was the lowest percentage in two decades. 63 per cent of respondents said that they believed that an innocent person had been executed in the previous five years. 64 per cent disagreed with the notion that the death penalty deters murder.

0,Uganda: Child “Night Commuters”,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/uganda-child-night-commuters/,"Girl aged 14, walks a kilometre, along with her four siblings, to the safety of a shelter in Lacor, five kilometres out of...","
UGANDA:
Child ""Night Commuters"" 
  ""We come to the shelter because I fear being abducted again. I was eight years old then. I do not want my brothers and sisters to be abducted as I was. We walk fast in the night to be here."" 
 

Girl aged 14, walks a kilometre, along with her four siblings, to the safety of a shelter in Lacor, five kilometres out of Gulu Town. 
 In northern Uganda an estimated 30,000 child ""night commuters"" flee their homes at night and go to urban areas and to the centre of larger camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). The ""night commuting"" phenomenon started in 2003. A main reason for this movement is to escape attacks and the risk of abduction by the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), and a general climate of insecurity. Most of the children commute without the protection of adult family members and ""face the threat of physical abuse, sexual exploitation and gender-based violence, including rape."" (1) ""Night commuting"" is symptomatic of the broader issues relating to the protection of civilians in northern Uganda and illustrates how these can impact on family and community life. 
 After almost two decades of conflict in northern Uganda, there are still reports of continuing violations of international humanitarian law and human rights, including killings, mutilations, torture, abductions, rape and sexual violence. The human rights of children are violated on a daily basis. 
 Since 1986, northern Uganda has been shaken by insurgencies and Joseph Kony’s armed group, the LRA, has operated in the area since around 1987. The LRA has targeted the civilian population. His group has abducted civilians, burnt villages, attacked schools and hospitals and ambushed vehicles across northern Uganda. The LRA has mutilated and maimed civilians, cutting off lips, ears and noses and chopping off hands. 
 Children have suffered disproportionately in this conflict. As many as 25,000 children have been abducted by the LRA since the conflict began, for use as soldiers, sex slaves and porters. 7,500 are girls with 1,000 having conceived children during captivity.(2) An unknown number have been killed. 
 Walking several kilometres each way, many children sleep at specially established centres in towns and their outskirts. These centres, run by non-governmental organizations, provide a safe and clean place to sleep, clean water and sanitation, basic health care and counselling. Scores of children also sleep at temporary shelters, hospital compounds, verandas and other public places. 
 The Concluding Observations of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (the body of independent experts mandated to monitor the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by states parties) on Uganda’s second periodic report were published on 30 September. These observations contain a number of recommendations that relate to ""night commuters"". In particular, paragraph 70 in the section Children in Armed Conflict and Child Abduction reads: 
 

Uganda ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict  in 2002. 
 As the international community prepares to mark Universal Children’s Day on 20 November, the date on which the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in 1988, Amnesty International calls upon the government of Uganda to protect and promote the human rights of children in northern Uganda. 
 ""The idea of childhood as a protected time of healthy growth has been effectively obliterated in northern Uganda.""(3)

 ACT NOW! 
 WRITE TO THE UGANDA GOVERNMENT CALLING ON IT TO: 
 – Uphold Uganda’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and   implement without delay the recommendations made to the government of Uganda by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child;
– support the work of night commuter shelters and the development of community-orientated support services;
– develop and support measures in northern Uganda to prevent the abduction of children; rescue those who are still abducted and rehabilitate those who have been abducted, as well as their families and communities;
– facilitate and support the work of national and international organizations providing humanitarian assistance in the conflict-affected areas of northern Uganda.

0,Government attempts to silence the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/government-attempts-to-silence-the-turkmenistan-helsinki-foundation/,Amnesty International (AI) is seriously concerned at attempts by the authorities to stop the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF) from carrying out its human rights work.,"
Amnesty International (AI) is seriously concerned at attempts by the authorities to stop the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF) from carrying out its human rights work. Some of these attempts are believed to be part of a government policy to prevent information about human rights violations from leaving the virtually closed country, and so reaching the attention of the international community. The targeting of the THF is part of a larger pattern of intimidation by the authorities of civil society activists and their relatives and, more generally, of the clampdown on dissent. 
 Seventy-nine -year-old Sazak Begmedov still in internal exile 
 Exactly two years ago, on 31 August 2003, Sazak Begmedov, the father of the THF director Tadzhigul Begmedova, was stopped by four police officers near his home in the capital Ashgabat and forcibly resettled to Dashoguz near the border with Uzbekistan. AI believes that Sazak Begmedov was targeted in connection with his daughter’s human rights work. Shortly before the forced resettlement, Tadzhigul Begmedova had announced the formation of the THF, and had publicly alleged that two men imprisoned in connection with the alleged assassination attempt on the President in November 2002 had died in prison as a result of torture. The officers reportedly beat and kicked Sazak Begmedov on their way to the airport, where they forced him onto a plane to Dashoguz. Police accompanied him on the flight and confiscated his passport. He was instructed to regularly report to the police in Dashoguz. The head of the local police department reportedly refused to give an explanation as to why he was being resettled. The police refused to register his complaint about the beatings although Sazak Begmedov showed a medical certificate documenting injuries to his body, concussion and injuries to the kidneys. Shortly afterwards, in the night of 3 to 4 September, Sazak Begmedov had a heart attack and had to be hospitalized for more than two weeks. He was unable to receive his pension payments for several months as he was told that he could only receive the money at his permanent place of residence in Ashgabat. In February 2005, the house where Sazak Begmedov lives in Dashoguz was reportedly put under surveillance for two weeks and his telephone was cut off for about a month following a phone call on 25 February from a representative of a European embassy who wanted to arrange a meeting between Sazak Begmedov and diplomats. Sazak Begmedov is believed to be in poor health and suffers from tuberculosis. 
 Further examples of harassment and intimidation 
 The TNF director Tadzhigul Begmedova, who now lives in exile, told AI that since announcing the formation of the THF in August 2003 she has received numerous emails threatening her with repercussions including causing harm to her children, who also live outside Turkmenistan, if she continued criticizing the human rights situation in Turkmenistan. Reportedly, several of her contacts in Turkmenistan who passed on information about the human rights situation in the country are under close surveillance; they have been called to the police many times who threatened them with dismissal from their workplace and with pressure on their children or elderly relatives if they did not end their work for the THF. Their phone lines are also frequently cut off. 
 In May 2004 several officers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and one officer from the Procurator’s office reportedly tried to obtain information about Tadzhigul Begmedova and the work of the THF from her sister Akchagul Kakaeva. Akchagul Kakaeva is serving a prison term of eight years in Dashoguz women’s colony in a case not related to the human rights work of the THF. One official also reportedly mentioned to her that Tadzhigul Begmedova had given interviews to the Turkmen Service of the US-funded Radio Liberty. This Prague-based radio station is one of the very few remaining sources of alternative information available to people inside Turkmenistan and has been highly critical of the regime and its human rights record. Akchagul Kakaeva was reportedly interrogated in the open air in extreme heat several times in the course of the day. Other prisoners were also interrogated. However, they were reportedly able to return to their wards after their interrogations while Akchagul Kakaeva was forced to stand in the direct sun between her interrogations and up until the officers finished their work for the day. By the end of the day Akchagul Kakaeva reportedly suffered from bleeding in her right eye. She was so exhausted that she was unable to move or even raise her head without assistance and had to be guided back into her ward by prison guards. 
 In April 2005 the Ministry of National Security summoned several of Tadzhigul Begmedova’s former colleagues, acquaintances from university and fellow students of her relatives for questioning. They were asked for information about Tadzhigul Begmedova, the THF’s work and the names of Tadzhigul Begmedova’s sources of information in Turkmenistan. 
 Turkmenistan: background information 
 AI is seriously concerned about widespread abuses of civil, political, social, economic and cultural rights in Turkmenistan. The authorities have engaged in a clampdown on dissent and religious freedom for many years. 
 They have in many cases targeted relatives of dissidents to put pressure on the dissidents. AI has documented cases where family members of dissidents including dissidents in exile have been summoned to the Ministry of National Security, dismissed from their work or threatened with confiscation of their flats. 
 Despite Turkmenistan’s obligations under international human rights law, the authorities of Turkmenistan have made it impossible for independent civil society activists to operate openly. Civil society activists have been frequent targets of interrogation and harassment by the authorities, and have in some cases been arbitrarily detained or imprisoned. Several have been forced into exile in recent years. Most of them were political dissidents and their relatives. 
 In addition to the pressure on the THF, another human rights group the authorities have tried to silence is the Turkmen Initiative for Human Rights (TI). In March 2005, for example, Ruslan Tukhbatullin, the brother of Farid Tukhbatullin, a former prisoner of conscience and the founder of the TI in exile, was forced to hand in his resignation from his post in the military because of his family relationship with Farid Tukhbatullin (See AI Index EUR 61/004/2005 for further information).
The authorities have in many instances prevented civil society activists from meeting representatives of foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations such as the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe on their visits to Turkmenistan. They have been threatened by the Ministry of National Security with serious repercussions if they attend such meetings or address any issues that may shed a negative light on the authorities. In addition, in many cases the telephones of activists were apparently disconnected throughout the time of the visit of a foreign delegation. 
 Please send politely worded appeals to the authorities of Turkmenistan to arrive as quickly as possible, in Turkmen, Russian, English or your own language: 
 – Express concern about the ongoing clampdown on dissent in Turkmenistan as a result of which many civil society activists, political dissidents, members of religious minority groups and their families have been subjected to human rights violations including harassment, arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, and imprisonment after unfair trials. 
 – Express particular concern at reports that the authorities have taken steps aimed at stopping the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation (THF) from carrying out its human rights work. This has included the summoning, interrogation and intimidation of relatives, acquaintances and former fellow students and colleagues of the THF’s director Tadzhigul Begmedova. 
 – Express concern at reports that Tadzhigul Begmedova’s father Sazak Begmedov was forcibly resettled to Dashoguz on 31 August 2003 and ill-treated by the policemen who detained him. Urge the authorities to promptly lift the restrictions on Sazak Begmedov’s movement and to open a thorough and independent investigation into the allegations that he was ill-treated with those found responsible brought to justice. 
 – Urge them to ensure respect for the human rights of human rights defenders and ensure that they are able to carry out their peaceful activities free from harassment and without threat of detention and imprisonment and other human rights violations.

Dear Governor Palin, 
I understand that you will be travelling to India to deliver a speech to the India Today Conclave.  This conclave is a a group of extremely wealthy and self-declared important people in India, talking about how awesome India is while pretending not to see all of the poverty and hardship faced by hundreds of millions every day. OK, there are some good people speaking at the event and I shouldn’t be so cynical. But, I digress… 
I realize that we need not worry too much about your expertise on India. India is pretty darn close to Russia and as you told us when asked about your foreign policy experience, “They’re our next door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska.” But despite that, I thought it might be helpful for me to give you a suggested itinerary to give you a more well-rounded picture of the country:

Gujarat: I’m sure that Gujarat’s Chief Minister Narendra Modi, who will also be at the India Today Conclave, will tell you all about how much economic growth and development has occurred in his state during his rule. He’ll tell you about the factories, the roads and the GDP growth. But, I’m sure he’ll omit the fact that nine years ago, he presided over the worst communal pogroms since Indian independence, which left over 1,000 dead.  His former Home Minister (sort of like a state Attorney-General) is currently facing charges for his involvement in a “fake encounter”. He will also fail to inform you that malnutrition indicators have deteriorated since Modi took office. But, when you visit, I’m sure you will get a sense of the problems in the state. 
2. Kashmir: It’s great you’ll be there right around the time that Amnesty International is planning to release its report on indefinite detentions in Kashmir. The report entitled A Lawless Law: Detentions under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, documents how authorities are using the Public Safety Act to secure the long-term detention of political activists, suspected members or supporters of armed groups and a range of other individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence for a trial or conviction to ‘keep them out of circulation’. I can send you a link over twitter if you’d like, Governor Palin (by the way, my twitter feed is at twitter.com/acharya_dude in case you’d like to follow it). 
3. Chhattisgarh: This rural eastern Indian state has been the center of Maoist violence. And while I doubt that the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh will be at the India Today Conclave, I’d recommend heading over just the same to get a look at the violence wrought by the Maoists and by the government-backed Salwa Judum. It’s a horrible situation for the tribal peoples in the area because they are caught between the two militias. The result has been widespread human rights violations. This state is also the place where Dr. Binayak Sen has been imprisoned (take action here) for speaking out for the rights of the indigenous people in the area. Kartam Joga, a political activist, has also been arrested in the same state. While there, Gov. Palin, I hope you will get a chance to ask the Chief Minister to arrest all those involved in human rights violations and to see that there are no more prosecutions of human rights defenders such as Dr. Binayak Sen and Kartam Joga (take action here). 
Well, Governor Palin, I could list other human rights concerns in other parts of India, but I’ll stop there since I know that your time is limited. But, I’d urge you (and others of course!) to check out AIUSA’s webpage on India. And, again, I encourage you and others to follow me on my twitter feed, twitter.com/acharya_dude as I’ll be posting lots and lots of stuff on the upcoming Kashmir report in the coming days.",,"March 14, 2011 • Post",False

Yet many thousands remain stuck at borders, especially the one between Tunisia and Libya, in freezing conditions. 
Prior to the crisis, Libya was home to more than a million asylum-seeking refugees from sub-Saharan Africa. Many of these refugees are now seeking asylum in Tunisia, however, Amnesty International is concerned that these migrants in Libya are now being turned back at the Tunisian border.  Additionally, many foreign workers are seeking to return back to their country of origin but remained trapped at land border crossings or on the coast, desperately hoping for ships to rescue them. 
Thankfully, the UNHCR office in Tripoli has set up a hotline that refugees trapped in Libya can call for assistance. The number is: +218.214.777.503. Please contact this number if you or someone you know is seeking asylum from the violence in Libya. 
 
Amnesty International is urging the international community to offer critical support to assist those fleeing the violence and chaos – and not refuse entry to those seeking to flee the chaos in Libya.  Under international law, all of Libya’s neighboring states must keep their borders open and provide assistance to all those fleeing violence.

This report documented the human rights situation in 149 countries in 2021, as well as providing global and regional analysis. It presents Amnesty International’s concerns and calls for action to governments and others.  
Migrants were forcibly returned to Belarus. Parliament voted against legalizing same-sex unions. Domestic violence remained widespread. Lithuania had still not ratified the Istanbul Convention, nor implemented the European Court of Human Rights’ ruling regarding Abu Zubaydah. 
Following a significant increase in the number of migrants arriving at the border from Belarus in August, Lithuania declared a state of emergency in November, which was extended until January 2022. 
By the end of the year, Lithuanian border guards had reportedly forcibly returned over 8,000 migrants to Belarus since August. Migrants were held in poor conditions in camps.The prime minister announced plans to build a barrier separating Lithuania and Belarus. Construction began in November. 
On 1 December, the European Commission published proposals allowing Lithuania to derogate from EU rules for six months. The measures allow Lithuania to extend the registration period for asylum application and simplify returns, thereby weakening asylum protections. 
On 23 December, parliament voted to increase the six-month detention limit, introduced in July, to one year for migrants entering Lithuania from Belarus. 
The issue of Lithuania’s ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) was excluded from the parliamentary session in March. 
Domestic violence remained widespread and was exacerbated during the Covid-19 pandemic. In March, the parliamentary Ombudsman’s Office published its 2020 annual report, which concluded that provision of assistance to victims of domestic violence was insufficient. 
In May, parliament narrowly voted against debating a bill – the “partnership law” – to legalize same-sex unions. 
In September, the city of Kaunas held its first LGBTQ+ march. The local authorities, which had refused to issue a permit, lost an appeal and were ordered to authorize the event by Lithuania’s Supreme Administrative Court. 
Abu Zubaydah, a Palestinian national detained in Guantánamo Bay, submitted a petition in April to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and in November to a US federal court, calling for his release. In 2018, the European Court of Human Rights had ruled against Lithuania for its deliberate facilitation of Abu Zubaydah’s enforced disappearance and torture in a secret CIA prison that it hosted between 2005 and 2006. By the end of the year, Lithuania had still not yet fully implemented the court’s decision. 
In response to today’s proposals from the European Commission which would allow Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to derogate from EU rules, including by holding asylum-seekers and migrants at the border for 16 weeks with minimal safeguards, Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Office said:
“The arrival of people at the EU’s borders with Belarus is entirely manageable with the rules as they stand. Today’s proposals will further punish people for political gain, weaken asylum protections, and undermine the EU’s standing at home and abroad. If the EU can allow a minority of member states to throw out the rule book due to the presence of a few thousand people at its border, it throws out any authority it has on human rights and the rule of law. 
International protection of human rights is in danger of unravelling as short-term national self-interest and draconian security crackdowns have led to a wholesale assault on basic freedoms and rights, warned Amnesty International as it launched its annual assessment of human rights around the world.
“Your rights are in jeopardy: they are being treated with utter contempt by many governments around the world,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
This has been a devastating year for those seeking to stand up for human rights and for those caught up in the suffering of war zones. Governments pay lip service to the importance of protecting civilians. And yet the world's politicians have miserably failed to protect those in greatest need. Amnesty International believes that this can and must finally change.

The Lithuanian government has admitted its involvement in the US-led rendition and secret detention programmes. An investigation opened into two secret CIA detention sites that had already been acknowledged was abruptly terminated in January 2011 on highly dubious grounds. In this report, Amnesty International suggests critical lines of enquiry that have not been pursued, and calls on the authorities to re-open the investigations into both its own involvement in these operations and that of the USA and its agents on Lithuanian territory.

It has concluded that this system amounts to apartheid. It has also documented unlawful acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to maintain this system, including forcible transfers, administrative. detention and torture, unlawful killings, denial of basic rights and freedoms and persecution. It has concluded that such acts form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid.

The State of Palestine consists of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. is located in the Middle East bordering the Mediterranean Sea, Egypt, Israel, and Jordan. 4.8 million people live in Palestine, including 2.1 million people living in Gaza making it the 3rd most populated place in the world. There are 871,000 registered Palestinian refugees living in the West Bank and 1.4 million registered Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip. The population across the West Bank and Gaza Strip consist of individuals practicing Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. The predominant ethnic groups are Palestinian Arab and Jewish. 
  
The two major political factions – Fatah which runs the authorities in the West Bank, and Hamas which runs the de facto administration in Gaza – remained split. 
On 15 January, President Abbas announced the postponement of parliamentary elections until further notice, citing Israel’s refusal to allow elections in East Jerusalem. Both authorities introduced emergency regulations in response to COVID-19 in areas under their control. In March, the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank imposed lockdown measures, significantly restricting freedom of movement, easing some of the restrictions after a few months. 
People in Gaza grappled with the virus while under an Israeli air, sea and land blockade, in force since 2007, which further threatened the fragile health care system. In September, the authorities in the Gaza Strip imposed lockdown measures after a significant COVID-19 outbreak. Egypt continued to enforce an almost total closure of the Rafah border crossing with Gaza. Qatar transferred cash into the Gaza Strip in co-ordination with Israel to pay public sector employees. 
The Palestinian authorities in the West Bank continued to impose punitive measures against Gazans, including decreasing electricity and water subsidies, restricting the entry of medicine into Gaza, and decreasing or holding salaries. These measures exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Israel’s 14-year blockade. 
The West Bank authorities persisted in their crackdown on online expression, blocking access to dozens of websites. Palestinian forces in Gaza used excessive force in response to peaceful protests. Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees were commonly reported and were committed with impunity under both authorities. Women in the West Bank and Gaza are often with faced discrimination and violence. At least eight lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) people were subjected to arbitrary arrest and ill-treatment in relation to their sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Courts in Gaza continued to hand down death sentences. The High Judicial Council, a body established to enhance the independence of judges, was dissolved. Punitive measures imposed by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Palestinian judges and civil society actors continued to protest against what they deemed to be significant executive interference in the judiciary and called on President Abbas to repeal laws by decree issued on judicial affairs. 
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza occasionally fired indiscriminate rockets into Israel. 
Amnesty International’s concerns are based on international standards and applied equally within the proper legal framework. The legal framework is defined by who retains jurisdiction, or effective control, over an area and the circumstances or situation at the time of the human rights violation. Amnesty’s concerns within Israel-proper, the area inside the 1949 (W. Bank/E. Jerusalem) and 1951 (Gaza Strip) armistice lines (also called the ‘1967 borders’) include but are not limited to, ill-treatment and torture of detainees, excessive use of force, the detention of conscientious objectors, arbitrary arrest, freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of movement, impunity, indigenous communities, POC, unlawful killing, unfair trial, violence against women and children and forced evictions and home demolitions within ‘unrecognized’ Bedouin villages. 
In contravention of international law, Israel continues to build parts of the wall/fence in the OPT, expand settlements and use draconian restrictions on the movement of Palestinians with some 600 roadblocks and checkpoints. Amnesty International is also concerned about discriminatory policies affecting access to water for Palestinians. 
In areas under control of the Palestinian Authority, concerns include, excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment, torture and the use of administrative detention to jail individuals without charge or trial. Some detainees also do not receive adequate medical attention. 
The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory (the West Bank including East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip) is in its fifth decade and the undercurrent of violence and inherent abuses of fundamental human rights and disregard for international law inherent in any long-standing military occupation is presented by both sides. 
Israel maintains effective control over The Gaza Strip, controlling all but one of the crossings into the Gaza, the airspace, territorial waters, telecommunications and the population registry which determines who is allowed to leave or enter Gaza. Therefore, Israel is still considered the occupying power and is responsible for the welfare of the inhabitants in the strip under international humanitarian law. The Gaza Strip has been under increasing restrictions since 2005, when Israel unilaterally pulled troops and settlers out of the strip. June 2007, restrictions tightened to an almost air-tight blockade, deepening the hardship there and virtually imprisoning the entire population of some 2 million. 
Israeli authorities rejected or delayed hundreds of permit applications to leave Gaza by Palestinians requiring specialist medical treatment; a few died as a result. Most of Gaza’s inhabitants depend on international aid, which is severely hampered by the blockade. 
Both Israeli and Palestinian civilians continue to bear the brunt of the violence in the region. 
  
Abuses by Armed Groups 
Palestinian armed groups in Gaza occasionally fired indiscriminate rockets into Israel, killing four Israeli civilians. While the Hamas authorities prevented rocket firing much of the time, they failed to prosecute those responsible. Most of the Palestinians responsible for stabbing, shooting and carrying out other attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel, which killed three Israeli civilians during the year, were not members of Palestinian armed groups. However, these groups often praised the attacks. 
Victims of past violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including war crimes, have not obtained justice, truth and reparation, as required by international law. This impunity fails the victims, and sets the stage for more violations, as demonstrated by war crimes committed by both sides in the hostilities that have just ended. 
  
Israeli Attacks on Residential Homes 
Israeli forces have displayed a shocking disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians by carrying out a number of airstrikes targeting residential buildings in some cases killing entire families – including children – and causing wanton destruction to civilian property, in the 2021 attacks that may amount to war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
Amnesty International documented four deadly attacks by Israel launched on residential homes without prior warning and is calling for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to urgently investigate these attacks. The death toll in Gaza climbed with at least 198 Palestinians killed including 58 children and more than 1,220 injured. Ten people in Israel, including two children, were killed and at least 27 injured by Palestinian attacks. 
The Israeli army claims that it only attacks military targets and has justified airstrikes on residential buildings on that basis. However, residents told Amnesty International that there were no fighters or military objectives in the vicinity at the time of the attacks documented. 
At least 152 residential properties in Gaza were destroyed since May 11 2021, according to the Gaza-based human rights organization, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Gaza, Israeli strikes destroyed 94 buildings, comprising 461 housing and commercial units while 285 housing units have been severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable. 
  
Attacks by Palestinian Armed Groups 
Indiscriminate rocket-fire by Palestinian armed groups towards civilian areas of Israel has also killed and injured civilians and damaged homes and other civilian properties. The rockets fired from Gaza into Israel are imprecise and their use violates international humanitarian law which prohibits the use of weapons that are by nature indiscriminate. 
  
Neither the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank nor the Hamas de facto administration in Gaza took any steps to translate the State of Palestine’s commitments under the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to abolish the death penalty.  In Gaza, Hamas-administered courts sentenced at least four people to death; no executions were reported. 
The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.  Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, guilt or innocence or method of execution.  Amnesty International believes that the death penalty should be abolished, once and for all. 
  
Palestinian security forces in Gaza used excessive or unnecessary force to disperse peaceful demonstrations. Between March 14th – 16th, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated across the Gaza Strip against their dreadful living conditions. Hamas security forces used excessive force against scores of non-violent demonstrators, bystanders, journalists and NGO workers, deploying sound grenades, batons, pepper spray and live ammunition to disperse protesters. 
  
The Fatah-led Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the de facto Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip arbitrarily arrested tens of peaceful demonstrators and critics, including journalists, university students and human rights activists.  The West Bank authorities persisted in their crackdown on online expression. 
The authorities in the West Bank were responsible for 150 attacks on media freedom, according to the Palestinian Centre for Development and Media Freedoms. These included arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment during interrogation, confiscation of equipment, physical assaults and bans on reporting. The Hamas authorities in Gaza were responsible for 41 such attacks. On June 4th, security forces in the West Bank attacked members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a non-violent Islamist group, in a mosque in Hebron, after the group announced the celebration of a Muslim holiday a day before the official announcement. Security forces besieged the mosque, assaulted worshippers and arbitrarily arrested about 15 of them, releasing them without charge shortly afterwards. 
On March 10th , the Hamas authorities in Gaza arbitrarily arrested 13 activists from the “We Want to Live” movement, which was planning to stage demonstrations four days later against the rising cost of living and deteriorating economic conditions. The arrests happened during a private meeting at a house belonging to the activist Jihad Salem al-Arabeed in the town of Jabalya in the northern Gaza Strip. Security forces stormed into the house without an arrest warrant. According to the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), the Palestinian national human rights institution, the activists were tortured and otherwise ill-treated in detention. 
The authorities in the West Bank continued to clamp down on online freedom of expression using the draconian Electronic Crimes Law. The Ramallah Magistrate’s Court blocked access to 59 websites after a court decision on October 21st was made at the request of the Palestinian Attorney General. The websites were blocked on the basis that their content would “threaten national security” and “disturb public order” under Article 39 of the Electronic Crimes Law. All of the websites shared content that was critical of the authorities. Amnesty International believes that the Electronic Crimes Law arbitrarily restricts media freedom and bans online dissent, and has called for it to be repealed. 
  
President Abbas dissolved the West Bank-based High Judicial Council, a body established in 2002 to enhance the independence of judges, ensure the transparency and efficiency of their work, improve court performance and facilitate case proceedings. 
Palestinian authorities in the West Bank used a 1954 law to administratively detain dozens of people for periods up to six months on the order of a regional governor, many on political grounds, according to Palestinian human rights organizations. Such detentions require no charges and lack due process. The ICHR had documented 195 such detentions as of the end of November. 
  
Even though same-sex relationships are not criminalized in the West Bank, Palestinian police stated on that they would prevent any organized activities by alQaws for Sexual and Gender Diversity in Palestinian Society, a Palestinian NGO that works on LGBTI issues. The statement outraged human rights groups, but also sparked a wave of messages on social media inciting violence against alQaws and members of the LGBTI community, including death threats. The statement also violated provisions of the amended Palestinian Basic Law and international treaties ratified by the State of Palestine. The Palestinian police quickly rescinded the statement. 
Meanwhile, alQaws documented at least eight cases of LGBTI individuals who were arbitrarily arrested or ill-treated by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank in relation to their sexual orientation or gender identity. 
Section 152 of the Penal Code applicable in Gaza continued to criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity and make it punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment. 
  
Palestinian security forces in the West Bank and Gaza routinely used torture and other ill-treatment with impunity. As of the end of November, the ICHR had received 143 such allegations in the West Bank and 156 in the Gaza Strip. 
Journalist and activist Amer Balousha, one of the ‘’We Want to Live’’ organizers, alleged he was tortured in custody on 16 March by Hamas security forces. He said he was put in stress positions and beaten. He started a hunger strike in the initial days of his arrest to protest his detention and prison conditions. He was transferred to Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza on 19 March for medical treatment for health concerns related to his hunger strike. He was released from detention on 26 March. 
  
Women and girls continued to face discrimination in law and practice, and were inadequately protected against sexual and other gender-based violence, including “honor” killings. The Women’s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling documented at least 24 cases where women and girls were reported to have been victims of “honor” killings in the West Bank and Gaza in 2019, mainly by male relatives. 
Israa Ghrayeb, a make-up artist from Beit Sahour town in the southern occupied West Bank, died after being beaten by members of her family. Israa Ghrayeb’s death sparked protests across the West Bank and Gaza, with people demanding greater protection for women and the repeal of discriminatory laws. Subsequently, the Palestinian Attorney General announced that his office had conducted an investigation which concluded that her death was caused by domestic violence and that three unnamed individuals had been charged with manslaughter, which is punishable by at least five years in prison. 
Palestinian women’s rights groups continued to push for a comprehensive domestic violence law, a campaign launched in 2007. The Palestinian authorities in the West Bank continued to review a draft Family Protection Law, a process begun in 2016. Domestic violence is still not criminalized in the West Bank or Gaza.

New evidence showing that Israeli forces carried out war crimes in retaliation for the capture of an Israeli soldier has been released today in a joint report by Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture. The evidence, which includes detailed analysis of vast quantities of multimedia materials, suggests that the systematic and apparently deliberate nature of the air and ground attack on Rafah which killed at least 135 civilians, may also amount to crimes against humanity. 
This has been a devastating year for those seeking to stand up for human rights and for those caught up in the suffering of war zones.

Saudi blogger Raif Badawi was released from detention on March 11, 2022 after ten years in prison and 50 lashes in a public square simply for creating an online forum for public debate. Raif spent 11 extra days in detention past his original prison sentence, which ended on February 28. While this is a major victory for human rights, he has been given a ten-year travel ban. That means he will go a total of 20 years without seeing his family, who are now based in Canada. King Salman must lift his travel ban immediately. 
 
Halt Imminent Execution of Bahraini Men Sentenced after Flawed Trial 
Saudi Arabia’s king must halt the imminent execution of Jaafar Sultan and Sadeq Thamer, two Bahraini Shi’a men who were sentenced to death on terrorism and protest-related charges following a grossly unfair trial in October 2021. Sultan and Thamer were arrested in 2015 and held incommunicado in solitary confinement for 3.5 months. They were only allowed to call their families 115 days later, but prison officials did not allow them to discuss the conditions of their detention. The Appeals Court upheld their sentences in April 2022. They could be executed in Saudi Arabia as soon as the King ratifies their sentence.

On April 5, 2021, Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, a 37-year-old Red Crescent worker, was sentenced by the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh to 20 years in prison to be followed by a 20-year travel ban on charges relating to the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression, and following a trial marred by violations, including possible torture used to extract a “confession.” He has been detained arbitrarily for four years, and is still being held without contact to his family and in solitary confinement. The Saudi authorities must grant Abdulrahman al-Sadhan’s immediate and unconditional release. Take action here 
Ten Detained Egyptian Nubian Men
 
The Saudi Arabian authorities must immediately release and drop all charges against 10 Egyptian Nubian men who have been detained without charge for 16 months merely for trying to organize a remembrance event. Not only are these men being detained unlawfully, they have also been denied regular family contact and only allowed access to government-appointed lawyers, while at least two of them are elderly and in ill health. The Saudi Arabian authorities must ensure that they have full access to medical care, lawyers of their choice and regular contact with their families. They are due to are due to appear for trial on March 27.

Executions in 2022
 
As of March 21, Saudi Arabia has executed 103 people in 2022. According to our logs since 2000, this is an unprecedented escalation in Saudi Arabia’s use of the death penalty. It’s the highest number of executions for a period of three months since 2000. On March 12, the Ministry of Interior announced the execution of 81 people, all of whom had been convicted of a wide range of offenses, including “terrorism”- related crimes, murder, armed robbery and arms smuggling. A number of those executed were also convicted of charges such as “disrupting the social fabric and national cohesion” and “participating in and inciting sit-ins and protests,” which describe acts that are protected by the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.

In 2020, repression of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly intensified. Among those harassed, arbitrarily detained, prosecuted and/or jailed were government critics, women’s rights activists, human rights defenders, relatives of activists, journalists, members of the Shi’a minority and online critics of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtually all known Saudi Arabian human rights defenders inside the country were detained or imprisoned at the end of the year. Grossly unfair trials continued before the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) and other courts. Courts resorted extensively to the death penalty and people were executed for a wide range of crimes. Migrant workers were even more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation because of the pandemic, and thousands were arbitrarily detained in dire conditions, leading to an unknown number of deaths. 
The country maintained economic and political sanctions against Qatar, along with Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), in the ongoing political crisis in the Gulf that began in 2017. 
The Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the long-running armed conflict in Yemen continued to be implicated in war crimes and other serious violations of international law (see Yemen entry). 
In March, the Saudi Press Agency announced that the Control and Anti-Corruption Authority (the Nazaha) had arrested 298 public sector officials and was investigating them for corruption. 
In May, in response to plummeting oil prices and the economic impact of COVID-19, the authorities introduced austerity measures, tripling Value Added Tax to 15% and ending the cost of living allowance for state employees. 
In November, the G20 summit was held virtually, chaired by Saudi Arabia. More than 220 civil society organizations pledged not to participate in the parallel civil society engagement process to protest against Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. 
In July 2021, Amnesty International found that Saudi Arabian authorities have brazenly intensified the persecution of human rights defenders and dissidents and stepped up executions over the past six months, following a lull in prosecutions of activists and a sharp decline in use of the death penalty during Saudi Arabia’s G20 presidency last year. 
In July 2021, the Pegasus Project, a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media non-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, conducted cutting- edge forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of NSO’s spyware. From the leaked data ad their investigations, Saudi Arabia was named one of 11 potential clients. 
  
The authorities arbitrarily detained, prosecuted and imprisoned human rights defenders and family members of women’s rights activists for their peaceful activities and human rights work, including under the Counter-Terrorism Law and Anti-Cyber Crime Law. By the end of the year, virtually all Saudi Arabian human rights defenders were in detention without charge, or were on trial or serving prison terms. 
Among those arbitrarily detained for prolonged periods without appearing before a judge or being charged was Mohammed al-Bajadi, a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA), detained since May 2018. 
In April, Abdullah al-Hamid, a prisoner of conscience and founding member of ACPRA, died in detention following medical neglect. He had written extensively on human rights and the independence of the judiciary.1 In late April, the authorities arrested writers and others for expressing sympathy over his death, including Abdulaziz al-Dakhil, an economist, writer and former Deputy Finance Minister. 
More than two years after a wave of arrests targeted women human rights defenders and supporters, the authorities continued to detain incommunicado Loujain al-Hathloul and Nassima al-Sada for between two to four months at a time. In December, Loujain al-Hathloul was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, after her case was transferred to the SCC in November. The court suspended two years and 10 months of the total prison term. Several other women activists continued to be detained and on trial before the Criminal Court in Riyadh for their human rights work or expression. 
  
Unfair Trials 
Grossly unfair trials continued before the SCC, a counter-terror court notorious for due process violations including mass trials.2 Among those who continued to be tried or were convicted after such trials were a woman human rights defender, religious clerics and activists charged with offences, including capital offences, arising from the peaceful expression of their views. 
A mass trial of 68 Palestinian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian nationals facing trumped-up charges under the Counter-Terrorism Law began in March before the SCC. Two of them, Mohammed al-Khudari and his son Hani al-Khudari, were charged with “joining a terrorist entity” understood to be the Hamas de facto authorities in Gaza. Both were forcibly disappeared during the first month of their detention and were detained incommunicado and in solitary confinement for two months. They had no access to legal representation from their arrest onwards. 
In June, 14 individuals detained since April 2019 for their peaceful support of the women’s rights movement and women human rights defenders were charged under the Anti-Cyber Crime Law, the Counter-Terrorism Law or both. Among them was Salah al-Haidar, the son of Aziza al-Yousef, a woman human rights defender who remained on trial for her women’s rights work. 
In September, eight people received final sentences for the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey in 2018. The Criminal Court in Riyadh commuted five initial death sentences, and sentenced all eight to prison terms ranging from seven to 20 years. The authorities permitted the attendance of diplomats, but closed the trial to media and independent observers. Additionally, the identity of those on trial and the charges they faced were not disclosed. 
Also in September, the SCC sentenced writer and academic Abdullah al-Maliki to seven years in prison for his tweets and other online posts in which he wrote about freedom of expression and political representation and defended ACPRA members. He was also accused of hosting an intellectual forum to discuss books and philosophy, on charges of “inciting public opinion against the country’s rulers.” 
  
Courts continued to impose death sentences, and carried out scores of executions for a wide range of crimes. 
In April, a royal order announced an end to the use of the death penalty against people aged under 18 at the time of the crime for offences that attract discretionary punishments under Shari’a (Islamic law). The order was aligned to the 2018 Law on Juveniles, which prevents judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those aged under 15. This law does not prevent judges handing down death sentences for that age group in the case of hadd crimes (those with fixed and severe punishments under Shari’a) or crimes punishable by qisas (retaliation). 
In August, in a long-overdue development, the Saudi Human Rights Commission announced that the country’s Public Prosecutor had ordered a review of the death sentences against Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoun, who were at imminent risk of execution.3 The three young men had been arrested in 2012 when children and charged with offences relating to their participation in anti-government protests in the Eastern Province. In December, the public prosecution also reviewed its call for the execution of Mohammad al-Faraj, a member of the country’s Shi’a minority, who was arrested at the age of 15 for his “participation in [anti-government] protests” in the Eastern Province, and instead demanded a prison term. 
The authorities failed to abide by international fair trial standards in capital cases, often holding summary proceedings in secret and without allowing defendants access to representation or legal assistance. Foreign nationals often did not have access to translation services throughout the various stages of detention and trial. 
  
The authorities escalated repression of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, including through a crackdown on online expression and undue restrictions on freedom of expression related to the government’s responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. They harassed, arbitrarily detained and prosecuted government critics, human rights defenders, family members of activists and many others. 
In March, the Public Prosecution announced that social media posts that question, or instigate against, the COVID-19 curfew would be punished under Article 6 of the Anti-Cyber Crime Law, which carries penalties of up to five years’ imprisonment and a maximum fine of almost SAR3 million (US$800,000). 
Courts frequently invoked the Anti-Cyber Crime Law to sentence government critics and human rights defenders for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, citing tweets or other peaceful online expression as evidence. 
The authorities continued to ban the formation of political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups, and to prosecute and imprison those who set up or participated in unlicensed human rights organizations. All gatherings, including peaceful demonstrations, remained prohibited under an order issued by the Ministry of Interior in 2011. 
Members of the ruling family, former governmental officials and their relatives were among those arbitrarily arrested or detained. A year after her arrest, an official Twitter account confirmed in April the detention without charge of Basma bint Saud Al Saud, a daughter of former King Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and a writer and human rights activist. Her family expressed concern about her health as she has underlying conditions that require medical treatment. 
  
“Homosexuality” remained prohibited in Saudi Arabia, punishable by flogging and imprisonment. 
In July, Yemeni LGBTI rights defender Mohamed al-Bokari was sentenced to 10 months in prison followed by deportation to Yemen for charges related to violating public morality, promoting homosexuality online and imitating women. He was arrested after he appeared in a video defending the personal freedoms of LGBTI people. 
  
In March, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities extended residency permits of foreign workers without charge, and the Saudi Human Rights Commission announced the release of 250 foreign detainees held for non-violent immigration and residency offences. 
However, the approximately 10 million migrant workers in Saudi Arabia continued to be governed by the kafala (sponsorship) system, which gives employers disproportionate powers over them and prevents them from leaving the country or changing jobs without the permission of their employers, increasing their vulnerability to labour abuses and exploitation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this situation – alongside dire living conditions, scarce legal protection and limited access to preventive health care and treatment – put migrant workers in an even more vulnerable position and at higher risk from COVID-19. 
From March onwards, thousands of Ethiopian migrants, including pregnant women and children, were arbitrarily detained in harsh conditions in at least five detention centres across the country. Detainees said that they lacked adequate food, water, health care, sanitation facilities and clothes. Cells were severely overcrowded and prisoners could not go outside. The specific needs of pregnant and lactating women were not addressed. Newborn babies, infants and teenagers were detained in the same dire conditions as adults.4 
While it was difficult to establish the scale of deaths in detention and corroborate all such allegations, detainees interviewed said that they had seen seven bodies of inmates. Three women said they had had contact with a female detainee whose baby had died in detention. Eight detainees said they had experienced and witnessed beatings by guards and two reported that guards had administered electric shocks as punishment. 
  
Corporal Judicial Punishment 
In April, the Minister of Justice issued a circular to all courts to implement the Supreme Court’s decision to end discretionary flogging punishments and replace them with prison sentences and/or fines. Flogging continued in cases where the punishment is mandatory under Shari’a. 
It remained unknown whether the discretionary flogging punishment imposed on blogger Raif Badawi had been dropped. In 2014, he was sentenced to 1,000 lashes, 10 years in jail followed by a 10-year travel ban, and a large fine for “insulting Islam” and creating an online forum for debate. In January 2015, he received the first 50 lashes. Further floggings were delayed, initially on medical grounds and since then for unknown reasons. 
  
Spyware Targeting 
During the Pegasus Project investigation, evidence emerged that family members of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi were targeted with Pegasus software before and after his murder in Istanbul on October 2, 2018 by Saudi operatives, despite repeated denials from NSO Group. 
His wife, Hanan Elatr was also repeatedly targeted with the spyware between September 2017 and April 2018 as well as his son, Abdullah, who was also selected as a target along with other family members in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
  
 
  
In July, members of the Shura Council, a body that advises the monarchy, proposed an amendment in the executive by-law to the Saudi Nationality Law to give permanent residency, without any fee or lengthy procedures, to the children of Saudi Arabian women married to foreign nationals. This was presented as an interim solution to shortcomings of the Nationality Law, which bars Saudi Arabian women married to foreign nationals from passing on their citizenship to their children. 
In a positive development, also in July, a court ruled that “an adult, rational woman living independently is not a crime” in the case of Maryam al-Otaibi, a Saudi Arabian woman on trial in a case filed by her father – also her legal guardian – for leaving her family home. Maryam al-Otaibi had actively participated in the campaign to end the guardianship system. It remained unclear whether this signalled the authorities’ intention to end the criminalization of women fleeing their homes without the permission of their guardian, which allowed male guardians to initiate “absentees” cases against them. 
Women and girls continued to face discrimination in law and practice in relation to marriage, divorce and inheritance, and remained inadequately protected from sexual and other forms of violence. Those who had experienced domestic abuse continued to need a male guardian’s permission to leave shelters. 
2021 saw a worrying rise in executions and death sentences as some of the world’s most prolific executioners returned to business as usual and courts were unshackled from Covid-19 restrictions, Amnesty International said today in its annual review of the death penalty.  
Amnesty International has received credible information that Buheliqiemu Abula and her teenage daughter, 13, were made to take tests for Covid-19 today in preparations for their deportation to China. The police told them that they should be prepared to leave the deportation center at 9 pm local time today to board a flight bound for Guangzhou, China. 
Saudi authorities must immediately release four Uyghurs – including a 13-year-old girl and her mother – who are at grave risk of being taken to repressive internment camps if sent back to China, Amnesty International said today amid fears that deportation plans for the group may already be under way.

Singapore human rights abuses can end with your support.,"The following information is based on the Amnesty International Report 2021/22. This report documented the human rights situation in 149 countries in 2021, as well as providing global and regional analysis. It presents Amnesty International’s concerns and calls for action to governments and others. 
Defamation suits and repressive laws were used against human rights defenders and government critics resulting in steep fines and prison sentences. A new law further limited rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 
Political leaders continued to use defamation suits to silence critics. In February, blogger and activist Leong Sze Han was ordered to pay SGD133,000 (US$99,000) in damages after being sued by the Prime Minister. Leong Sze Han had shared a news article on social media linking Lee Hsien Loong to a corruption scandal. In September, Terry Xu and Rubaashini Shunmuganathan from the independent news site,The Online Citizen, were also found guilty of defamation against the Prime Minister and ordered to pay SGD210,000 (US$156,138). Later that month, The Online Citizen was forced to close its website and social media accounts after the government accused it of failing to declare its funding sources. In November, Terry Xu and Daniel de Costa were found guilty of defamation against cabinet members and were awaiting sentencing at year’s end. In October, parliament passed the Foreign Interference (Countermeasures) Act (FICA) giving the government sweeping new powers, including to remove or block access to online content if “foreign interference” is suspected. The law also introduced harsh penalties for media outlets and others considered as “foreign agents”.1 
In February, human rights defender Jolovan Wham was convicted of breaching the Public Order Act and the Vandalism Act for peaceful protests in 2017 against violations of human rights. He served 22 days in prison.2 In August, Jolovan Wham appeared in court again on charges related to an incident in 2018 when he took a photo of himself holding a poster outside a court where Terry Xu and Daniel de Costa were on trial. 
A woman was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment in June for starving, torturing and killing her domestic worker in 2016. Covid-19 restrictions continued to confine low-income migrant workers to cramped dormitories and workplaces. In November, the UN CERD Committee reviewed the government’s report and recommended stronger protections for migrant workers, including female domestic workers. 
In January, a transgender student alleged that the Ministry of Education prevented her from receiving prescribed hormone replacement therapy. Three students, who were arrested in January for protesting against discrimination against LGBTI+ people in schools, were released on bail. In November, they and three others were issued with police warnings for staging a protest without a permit.3 
There was international outcry against the planned execution in November of Malaysian national Nagaenthran Dharmalingam who was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. He was assessed to have intellectual disabilities. His appeal was still pending at year’s end.4

Thousands of civilians have been killed, raped, or otherwise subjected to horrific violence. Many more have had their homes burned or looted, and have been forced to leave for displacement camps. Indeed, war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity have been inflicted on the CAR population by armed groups, the CAR military and their allies. Worse still, very few perpetrators have been held to account for these horrific crimes. People have continued to live in the vicinity of their attackers, forced to endure trauma and the fear of further violence. Most of those who have ordered the worst atrocities have simply continued to go about their lives with total impunity. Some have even been promoted into top positions in government. 
Central African Republic:  victims call for justice 
 
https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/africa/west-and-central-africa/central-african-republic/report-central-african-republic/ 
Dozens of persons suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity remain at large in the Central African Republic (CAR), said Amnesty International in a briefing published today. 
Likewise, there is not even one suspect in pre-trial detention pursuant to an arrest warrant delivered by the Special Criminal Court (SCC) more than three years after its inauguration. The SCC is a hybrid court having jurisdiction over crimes under international law and grave human rights violations committed during a series of conflicts since 2003. 
The briefing, ‘One Step Forward, Two Steps Backwards: Justice in the Central African Republic’ reveals that, despite the start of the SCC’s work in 2018, very few persons suspected of criminal responsibility have been arrested, prosecuted, or tried. Proceedings to address the needs for justice, truth and reparation are far from enough. 
Of the 25 arrest warrants so far issued by the court, only one has been carried out, with the arrest in November 2021 of Minister Hassan Bouba Ali, a former armed group leader suspected by other NGOs of being linked to the killing in 2018 of more than 70 civilians, including children in Alindao. However, he was released by CAR authorities a few days later, without any judicial authorisation. 
“Amnesty International calls on CAR authorities and the MINUSCA to take all possible measures to ensure the execution of the SCC arrest warrants and ensure that all those suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and other serious violations or abuses committed since 2003, from all sides of the conflict, are genuinely investigated and prosecuted in fair trials.” 
The vast majority of victims and survivors are still waiting for justice, truth and reparation. 
A civil society member told Amnesty International: 
“…We [need] to see the real persecutors being tried, those who may have been heads of the state or state institutions, and the leaders of rebel groups.” 
The SCC was created to fill the accountability gap, as a mechanism complementary to the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the CAR ordinary criminal courts. 22 individuals are in pre-trial detention under its jurisdiction, but they were not in fact arrested pursuant to SCC arrest warrants. Charges pending against them are unknown and their identities have not yet been disclosed – except for Eugene Ngaikosset, a suspect arrested in September this year. 
The briefing also addresses the lack of transparency in the operation of the SCC.Although the Court will start its first trials this month or early 2022, no information has been made available with regards to the cases or suspects involved. Amnesty International has found that information about the state of ongoing proceedings remains very difficult, if not impossible, to find. Not a single judicial decision has been made public. 
No criminal trials in the country in the last 20 months 
The briefing also found that CAR ordinary criminal courts have not held any criminal session since 7 February 2020. This means there has not been a single criminal trial in 20 months in a country that, according to its law, should organise a minimum of six criminal sessions per year in its three provinces. 
Although the Covid-19 pandemic and the political and security situation in the country in December 2020 and the first half of 2021 have undoubtedly caused delays in the judicial process, these factors alone do not explain the state of lethargy that the justice sector finds itself in. 
New military courts should not prosecute crimes against civilians 
Amnesty International is also calling on CAR’s authorities to ensure that crimes against civilians are not prosecuted in the newly established military courts which held their first sessions this year. The jurisdiction of military courts over criminal cases should be limited to trials of military personnel for breaches of military discipline and should exclude human rights violations, or crimes under international law. 
In September 2021, the Bangui martial court sessions examined its first series of cases, among which there were cases about murder of civilians. These cases should fall under ordinary civilian courts. 
“Researchers found that there was no step towards amending the country’s law to ensure the jurisdiction of military courts is limited to military disciplinary matters and, on the contrary, the holding of these sessions was presented as a success in the fight against impunity within the armed forces,” said Samira Daoud. 
Background 
Amnesty researchers visited Central African Republic in October 2021 and had 35 meetings with 44 people- 33 men and 11 women- from government, civil society, judicial system, including the Special Criminal Court and ordinary tribunals, and staff of the International Criminal Court. 
The Central African Republic (CAR) is currently experiencing a human rights and humanitarian crisis of historic proportions. Amnesty International researchers have documented that war crimes, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and sectarian killings are occurring as Muslim civilians continue to come under violent attacks from anti-balaka Christian militia groups. The current crisis began in December 2012 when the predominantly Muslim armed coalition Séléka launched an armed offensive against the government of François Bozizé that culminated in his removal from power in March 2013. After gaining power, Séléka forces continued to commit human rights abuses against the majority Christian civilian population including massacres, extrajudicial executions, rape, torture, looting and massive burning and destruction of villages. 
Séléka’s leader, Michel Djotodia, resigned from the Presidency on January 10, 2014 after significant international pressure. Séléka forces then began to withdraw from cities and towns throughout the CAR as they retreated back to the northern part of the country leaving a power vacuum which the anti-balaka militia groups filled by carrying out deadly attacks against Muslim communities and civilians in a deadly tit-for-tat that has resulted in a mass exodus of Muslims out of the country. Once vibrant Muslim communities in towns and cities throughout the country have been completely destroyed as all Muslim members have either been killed or driven away. Those few left behind live in fear that they will be attacked by anti-balaka groups in their towns or on the roads. While an African Union peacekeeping force, the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA), supported by French troops, has been deployed in the country since early December 2013, they have failed to adequately protect civilians and prevent the current ethnic cleansing from taking place. The urgency of the situation demands that the international community take all measures to respond to the crisis in the CAR, protect the civilian population, deploy to threatened areas and stop the forced exodus of Muslims from their homes. 
Individuals suspected of committing war crimes including killing and rape during the conflict in the Central African Republic (CAR) are evading investigation and arrest, and in some cases live side by side with their victims, Amnesty International said in a new report released today. 
International protection of human rights is in danger of unravelling as short-term national self-interest and draconian security crackdowns have led to a wholesale assault on basic freedoms and rights, warned Amnesty International as it launched its annual assessment of human rights around the world.
“Your rights are in jeopardy: they are being treated with utter contempt by many governments around the world,” said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
Civilians in Central African Republic (CAR) remain at risk of deadly violence and instability unless serious weaknesses in the United Nation’s peacekeeping mission, MINUSCA, are urgently addressed, Amnesty International said in a new report published today. 
The Central African Republic’s (CAR) biggest traders have purchased diamonds worth several million dollars without adequately investigating whether they financed armed groups responsible for summary executions, rape, enforced disappearances and widespread looting, Amnesty International said in a report published today.

Equatorial Guinea holds regular elections, but the voting is neither free nor fair. Oil wealth and political power are concentrated in the hands of the president’s family. The government frequently detains the few opposition politicians in the country, cracks down on civil society groups, and censors journalists. The judiciary is under presidential control, and security forces engage in torture and other violence with impunity. 
The crackdown on human rights defenders continues and administrative obstacles prevents NGOs from obtaining legal registration. The right to a fair trial is violated. Police use excessive force and the right to freedom of expression, including access to information, has been violated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, draft legislation threatened to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people and sex workers. 
Press freedom is severely limited, despite constitutional protections. Most journalists consistently exercise self-censorship, and those who do criticize the regime are subject to dismissal and other reprisals. 
The authorities violates the right to freedom of expression, including access to information, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2020, the government stopped publishing the numbers of COVID-19 cases, arguing that the information had been used by its critics to discredit its public health work. 
According to Reporters without Borders, seven journalists who worked for the TV channel, Asonga, were suspended in May 2020 after they publicly criticized the use of violence by the defense and security forces to impose the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. 
 In April 2020, people regularly posted videos on social media which showed the police using violence against people while enforcing the lockdown. Many of those attacked were street sellers, particularly women, whose stalls were destroyed. 
The judiciary is not independent, and judges in sensitive cases often consult with the Office of the President before issuing important rulings. Under the constitution, the president is the nation’s first magistrate. He also oversees the body that appoints judges. The court system’s impartiality is further undermined by corruption. 
In March 2020, a military court in Oveng Asem (a city on the mainland) convicted 10 men in connection with membership of the Movement for the Liberation of Equatorial Guinea Third Republic (MLGE3R), an opposition group. They were sentenced following a trial held behind closed doors to a total of 734 years imprisonment for treason, verbal abuse/insult against the head of state, and espionage. Four of these prisoners – two Spanish nationals of Equatorial Guinean origin and two Equatorial Guineans resident in Spain – had been abducted in South Sudan and transferred to Equatorial Guinea in November 2019. Their whereabouts remained unknown for several months until they were reported to be in Black Beach Prison and then transferred to Mongomo Prison on the mainland. The Spanish nationals were denied access to their embassy representatives. 
 The authorities continues to place obstacles in the way of NGOs seeking to register their organizations. In 2019, the government had accepted recommendations during the UN Universal Periodic Review process to reform Law 1/1999 which regulates NGO registration but failed to modify the law. 
 Security forces routinely detain people without charge. Those who are tried can be subjected to proceedings that lack due process. 
In February, Joaquín Elo Ayeto, a Somos+ member, was released without explanation from Black Beach Prison, where he had been held for almost one year following his arbitrary arrest in February 2019. Although he was tried in 2019 for defamation and threats against the President, he was not given any information about his sentence. He was released on the President’s orders after the President met the Secretary-General of the opposition Convergence for Social Democracy Party.

Ghana human rights abuses can end with your support.,"The following information is based on the Amnesty International Report 2021/22. This report documented the human rights situation in 149 countries in 2021, as well as providing global and regional analysis. It presents Amnesty International’s concerns and calls for action to governments and others. 
Cases of excessive use of force were reported. Prisons remained overcrowded. Women continued to suffer discrimination and gender-based violence. Attacks against LGBTI people intensified. Efforts were made to begin vaccinating at-risk people and essential workers against Covid-19. Forced evictions left some people homeless. 
In January, President Akufo-Addo was sworn in for a second term. In May, variations of the hashtag #FixTheCountry started being used on social media by young Ghanaians calling for social and economic reforms. 
There were several incidents of excessive and unnecessary use of force by the security forces. 
Various media reported that National Security operatives assaulted journalist Peter Tabiri on 7 May as he reported on a casino raid. The operatives allegedly kicked, slapped and poured water on him, injuring his right ear. 
On 11 May, National Security operatives arrested and allegedly assaulted reporter Caleb Kudah from Citi FM after they found him filming abandoned state-funded vehicles within their premises. They then stormed Citi FM’s office and arrested Caleb Kudah’s colleague, Zoe Abu-Baidoo. Both were released without charge. 
On 29 June, police and military forces shot dead two protesters and wounded four others during a protest in Ejura Sekyedumase in the Ashanti Region. A three-member Ministerial Committee commissioned to conduct a public inquiry into the incident submitted its report to the government in July. 
On 1 July in Wa, in the Upper West Region, military officers went on a rampage, beating people over a suspected stolen phone. The Military High Command tasked a four-member committee to investigate the incident. Three officers from the Wa Barracks were demoted while eight others were tried and jailed for 30 days by a disciplinary board. 
On 14 January, a police officer arrested Selorm Gborbidzi, a reporter from the Accra-based newspaper The Finder, after he started filming a scuffle between the officer and the driver of a commercial vehicle. He was released after four hours and charged with obstruction of justice, illegally filming a police officer on duty and insulting a police officer. 
Prison overcrowding continued. According to the Director General of the Prisons Services, as of 24 June the total prison population was 13,200, despite an authorized capacity of 9,945. Food given to prison inmates was inadequate due to the insufficient feeding grant of GHC1.80 (US$0.30) a day per inmate. 
At the end of the year, the Affirmative Action bill was still pending. 
In March, UNFPA Ghana in partnership with the government launched the Orange Support Centre and the Boame mobile phone app to report cases of domestic violence. 
“Witch” camps remained open, despite the government’s promise to close them. Older women accused of witchcraft were at risk of being banished to such camps. A commemorative forum was held on 23 July, a year after a mob lynched an elderly woman, to call on parliament to criminalize the labelling of people as witches. In December, various media reported that youths beat to death an elderly woman in Nalerigu in the North East Region because they suspected her of being a witch. 
Discrimination against LGBTI people intensified. In February, police officers searched and closed the recently inaugurated office of LGBT+ Rights Ghana, a non-profit organization. On 20 May, police arrested 21 LGBTI activists for unlawful assembly during a training session. They were released on bail in June and their charges were dismissed on 5 August. 
In June, the Promotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values bill was introduced in parliament. The bill further criminalized LGBTI people and introduced prison sentences for anyone expressing support or “sympathy” towards LGBTI people. The bill also encouraged conversion therapy and gender “realignment” for children. 
On 1 February, the Ghana Medical Association declared an increase in doctors contracting Covid-19, and the deaths of two doctors from the disease during January. 
In March, Covid-19 vaccinations began for people at risk and essential workers, with drones being used to deliver vaccines to rural communities. On 7 May, the vice president, Mahamudu Bawumia, stated that 2,161 prison officers and 1,136 inmates with underlying health conditions had been vaccinated. By mid-December, less than 10% of the population were fully vaccinated. 
The Greater Accra Regional Minister’s “Let’s Make Accra Work” campaign involved demolishing illegal structures. As part of the campaign, on 5 July, authorities demolished homes of people living in the Railway Quarters along Graphic Road in Accra, making them homeless. Former residents told the media they were not given adequate notice. In the same month, about 3,000 woodworkers at Kaase-Angola in the Asokwa Municipality, who had been operating in the area for decades, were requested to vacate the area after the government allegedly sold the land to a private company. The woodworkers stated that it would deprive them of an adequate place to work, affecting their livelihood. 
In February, three global manufacturing companies expressed concern over the impact of bauxite mining on the people and wildlife of the Atewa forest, and stated that they would not use this supply chain. 
In May, the defence minister announced that 561 military officers had been deployed during a four-day operation on the Birim, Offin and Oda rivers of the Eastern and Ashanti Regions as part of Operation Halt to counter illegal mining which was polluting water bodies. On 27 May, the government announced another deployment of 401 military officers to halt operations on the river Ankobra.

Madagascar human rights abuses can end with your support.,"The following information is based on the Amnesty International Report 2021/22. This report documented the human rights situation in 149 countries in 2021, as well as providing global and regional analysis. It presents Amnesty International’s concerns and calls for action to governments and others. 
The severe drought in southern Madagascar had a devastating impact on a wide range of human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation. At least 2,747 prisoners were pardoned but detention facilities remained overcrowded, and conditions poor. Media workers were harassed for reporting on subjects such as the Covid-19 pandemic. Gender-based violence, particularly against women and girls, was widespread and abortion remained criminalized. LGBTIQ+ people continued to face discrimination. 
In June, the security forces said they prevented an alleged assassination attempt on President Andry Rajoelina and other members of the government, including the then minister of interior and decentralization, the minister of national defence and the minister of communication and culture. Dozens of people, including national police and military personnel, were investigated for their involvement in the alleged assassination attempt. 
The southern region of Madagascar experienced its worst drought in 40 years, with more than 1 million people on the brink of famine and over 14,000 people living in famine-like conditions. 
The severe drought affected the population of southern Madagascar, most of whom rely on subsistence agriculture, livestock and fishing as their main sources of livelihood. Their ability to enjoy the internationally recognized right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment which is essential to the enjoyment of many other rights, including the rights to life, health, water and sanitation, was seriously undermined.1 
Children and women were disproportionately affected by the drought. Children dropped out of school to help their families to find food. Women had to engage in negative coping mechanisms, such as restricting adult family members’ food intake to provide for children and preparing cheaper and less nutritious food for their families. Additionally, families increasingly migrated to other regions to escape hunger. 
Conditions in detention facilities were poor and overcrowded. The prison administration’s statistics showed that by July, prisons with a maximum capacity for 10,645 inmates held 27,611 people, including 918 children, all of whom suffered inhumane conditions. Thousands of people continued to be detained without trial. By July, around 45% of the prison population, including 77% of child prisoners, were in pretrial detention. 
In June, President Rajoelina commuted the sentences of 10,840 detainees and pardoned at least 2,747 sentenced prisoners, including people convicted of minor offences who had up to three months left on their sentence; women over 55 and men over 60 who had been in prison for 10 years or more; and children who had served at least half their sentence. 
On 22 April, an inter-ministerial decision led to the banning of radio and audiovisual broadcasts in the regions of Analamanga, Atsinanana, Sava, Boeny and Sofia as they were deemed to be “responsible for threatening public order and security and threatening national unity.” The decision was reversed on 26 April after a backlash from civil society and media organizations. 
The government used Law 91-011 of 1991 – intended to be applied only in exceptional circumstances – to limit the media’s ability to share information on the Covid-19 pandemic, except for government sanctioned information. Journalists who attempted to report information not sanctioned by the government were harassed and intimidated. 
On 30 May, the Madagascar Collective of Journalists denounced harassment against journalists. Police officers said journalists were not allowed on the streets during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also in May, a journalist from Basy Vava newspaper was harassed and threatened with prosecution for public defamation after she published an article on alleged embezzlement of public funds by a former communications director in the president’s office. 
On 28 September, Nifin’Akanga, which campaigns for decriminalization of abortion, published a report based on findings from its national survey. The report highlighted that 52.5% of abortions took place in unhygienic conditions outside health facilities, such as in the homes of women and girls or of the abortion practitioners; and that 31% of abortions were performed by people with no medical training. The report noted that unsafe abortion increased the risks of severe complications, including haemorrhage, physical damage, psychological trauma and even death. The report also found that over 90% of women and girls were not using contraceptive methods, due to lack of access and lack of sexual education and were therefore not protected from the possibility of unwanted pregnancies. 
On 19 October, proposed law 004-2021/PL to modify article 317 of the Penal Code to decriminalize abortion was tabled before the National Assembly. The law aimed to decriminalize abortion where pregnancy presents a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or girl, in cases of serious fetal impairment, and pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. 
Local organizations and the media reported an increase in the number of domestic violence cases during the pandemic and the resulting rise in the numbers of people in poverty. 
Discrimination against and stigmatization of people on grounds of their sexual orientation and gender identity remained widespread in Malagasy society. On 1 July, the interior ministry suspended an annual LGBT event scheduled for 3 July in Antananarivo, the capital. The Director General for Culture explained the ministry’s decision, saying that “homosexual-related activities are not yet permitted in Madagascar” and concluded that “the event will be cancelled as it harms morality”.

According to journalist Stephen Grey, Suleiman was the Egyptian conduit for the US extraordinary rendition flights closely linked to torture.  Many of those flights took off from an airport in Johnston County, NC, less than an hour from my home in Durham.  Grey’s book Ghost Plane starts with the journey of one such Johnston County flight that led to the rendition and torture of two Egyptian men, one of who was later released without ever being charged with a crime. 
Grey writes that Suleiman approved these flights, part of a system of torture that Amnesty International calls systematic.  “Egypt then came in for much criticism,” Grey writes.  “Its record both on human rights and on repressing democracy was lambasted annually by both Congress and the State Department.  But in secret, men like Omar Suleiman … did our work, the sort of work that Western countries have no appetite to do themselves.” 
I was also reminded of the Johnston County flights when I received reports this week from people in Cairo of the tear gas canisters being used against them.  Made in the USA, the canisters said. 
When you are watching the footage of the Egyptian people in the street, showing their frustration of 30 years of tyranny and abuse, it’s safe and appropriate to feel solidarity with them.  But it’s not enough.  To support the people in Cairo trying to change those abuses, we in the US and in North Carolina must end our own policies and acts that have sustained them.",,"January 29, 2011 • Post",False

Any violators of human rights can and should be held accountable to the ICC.","By Erwin Knippenberg, Cote d’Ivoire Country Specialist 
As ECOWAS negotiators entered a second round of talks with incumbent president Gbagbo, security and justice for Ivorian citizens must remain the main concern. Any violators of human rights can and should be held accountable to the ICC. 
According to the UN, Gbago backers are responsible for 173 deaths since the election and 90 cases of torture.  Armed groups still conduct nightraids in certain neighborhoods, beating up or kidnapping people perceived as opponents to the regime. The situation could still escalate into full civil war and ethnic cleansing. We see government sponsored hate speech aimed at immigrants and attacks on peacekeepers as bad omens. In Rwanda, such racist rhetoric mixed with political concerns escalated into genocide. We cannot allow this to happen again. 
 
Both Gbagbo and Ouattara have pledged to protect civilians, and Gbagbo explicitly condemned any groups involved in these atrocities. Yet, forces loyal to him continue in their rhetoric and have blocked UN investigations into reports of two mass graves. 
Instead, Gbagbo has ordered the UN force to leave, citing violations of his country’s national sovereignty, specifically targeting France. Some of his supporters have even attacked UN peacekeepers. 
Amnesty International has outlined its official position on Cote d’Ivoire, emphasizing the protection of human rights and the importance of holding violators accountable. 
While negotiations continue, the UN Operation in Côte d’Ivoire (UNOCI) is best able to defend human rights, and must remain. Both parties are responsible for supporting UNOCI in this mission, and should not seek to obstruct its mission. 
Peace and Justice in Cote d’Ivoire are not mutually exclusive. Only by enforcing the respect of human rights can we start healing the deep wounds created by civil war, and avoid a return to conflict. 
ECOWAS has taken on a crucial role as regional mediator. They’ve taken a firm stance on Cote d’Ivoire so far, cutting off Gbagbo’s finances and threatening to use force to remove him. Amnesty takes no position on the issue of legitimacy, but emphasizes that ECOWAS must prioritize security for Ivorian citizens and justice for the victims of human rights abuses. 
The international community should provide UNOCI with all resources necessary for it to defend human rights in Cote d’Ivoire. It should also remind Cote d’Ivoire that, by its own consent, serious human rights violations fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC. Those responsible will be held accountable.",,"January 4, 2011 • Post",False

Three main issues should be addressed: 
First and foremost, President Obama must demand the immediate release of political prisoners.  Some individuals such as Filep Karma have been imprisoned for peacefully protesting by merely waving the Papuan flag.  He should do this before arriving in Indonesia to demonstrate our commitment to the right to protest peacefully and the freedom of expression. 
Just last year in September, Indonesia passed a law that endorses stoning as a punishment for adultery. Not only is adultery punished but so is sexual orientation if it is not heterosexual, which can receive a punishment of 100 lashes from a cane. President Obama must urge the Indonesian authorities to repeal these laws which use cruel and unusual punishments. 
Lastly, freedom of religion is severely restricted.  In fact, several laws further restrict freedom of thought and conscience.  “Blasphemy” is punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment and at least 13 people are currently serving time under this law.  Christian groups have been attacked by villagers linked to the Islamic Defenders Front, who enjoy impunity for their crimes.  Obama should demand that the Indonesian authorities guarantee freedom of religion and protect religious minorities. 
The United States needs to stand with human rights in Indonesia and advocate for the protection of peaceful protestors, the repeal of inhumane punishments, and the guarantee of freedom of religion.  The best time to do that is when President Obama touches down on Indonesian soil on November 9th.",,"November 8, 2010 • Post",False

Today is International Day of Peace.  To commemorate the occasion, Women of Zimbabwe Arise (WOZA) took to the streets yesterday in Harare and today in Bulawayo. Their mission: raise awareness about the issue of police misconduct in Zimbabwe. In response to the peaceful march, police arrested 83 protestors, almost as if they were trying to help prove WOZA’s point. You’d think the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) would get tired of being so predictable. 
On Monday, 600 women and men marched in the streets of Harare,  first to Parliament and then on to Harare Central Police Station in solidarity after the initial arrests. The aim of the peaceful protest was to highlight community safety issues and police misconduct. Last month, 250 people in a Harare suburb were forcibly evicted by the police in the middle of the night. Last weekend, violence marred a constitutional consultation session in Harare. 
In addition to these recent incidents, WOZA observed police behavior in select communities in Bulawayo and Harare for four months. Below is a sampling of the conduct they observed. Way to keep it classy, ZRP. 
“WOZA members observed police officers beating suspects in public; harassing vendors and taking their goods for their own use; demanding and accepting bribes; drinking in uniform in public, and making people under arrest ‘run’ in front of their motor bikes and/or horses to the police station.” 
The 83 WOZA members arrested spent last night in cells at Harare Central Police Station and remain there at the time of this posting. Harare Central is super disgusting and WOZA is currently suing the co-Ministers of Home Affairs over the filthy and inhumane conditions.

But recently she has been repeatedly harassed by Cuban authorities and government supporters, in attempts to prevent her from remembering her son and continuing to protest the detention of political dissidents. 
Tamayo and other women have been victim to harassment, intimidation, threats, and arbitrary detention by Cuban authorities and pro-government supporters. This past Sunday, August 15, government supporters arrived early in the morning and surrounded her house preventing her and her relatives and friends from marching and attending mass at the church. Today, Cuban police officers dragged protesters into vans and drove them away. 
Reina Luisa Tamayo and many other protesters form the Ladies in White movement, an organization of female relatives of prisoners of conscience campaigning for their release. In remembrance of the mass detention of Cuban political activists, known as the ‘Black Spring’, where 75 activists were detained in 2003, the Ladies in White planned on marching for seven days but have been shouted down by pro-government supporters and intimidated from peacefully marching. 
One of the 75 activists detained during the ‘Black Spring’ mass detention was Orlando Zapata Tamayo who died this February after an 85-day long hunger strike, protesting the detention of other prisoners of conscience. Currently there are at least 30 prisoners of conscience in Cuba’s jails.

This is the third post in … ","By Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada.  Neve is currently at Guantánamo to observe the military commission trial against detainee Omar Khadr. This is the third post in his series from the field. 
11 August 2010 
Over the past two days I have been observing the process of selecting the “jury” for Omar Khadr’s military commission trial here at the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. Known as a “panel”, this is the group of US military officers who will decide whether Omar Khadr should or should not be convicted of any of the five charges he faces and, if they do convict, what sentence he should face. 
The process began on Tuesday morning with a group of 11 men and four women, drawn from the US Army, Navy and Air Force.  The goal was to emerge at the other end with at least five officers impaneled – the necessary minimum for the trial to go ahead.  The defence and prosecution can each exclude one of the members of the pool without giving a reason, and can seek the exclusion of as many others “for cause” as the military judge overseeing the trial may accept. 
The day began on a warm-hearted note.  When the side door through which Omar Khadr is escorted in by his guards opened on Tuesday morning, not only was the young defendant once again in attendance, he was wearing a grey suit, white shirt and tie.  We later found out that his Canadian lawyer had chanced upon the suit in a room in the courthouse building moments before Omar Khadr was to come into court. Now each time Omar Khadr enters or leaves the courtroom, there is a broad smile on his face that I have not seen before. It was a reminder of his youthfulness, and of how many small moments (like his first time in a suit) he has been denied during the eight years he has been locked away here — he was transferred to Guantánamo from Bagram air base in Afghanistan in late October 2002 soon after he turned 16.  
Much of the first day was taken up with lawyers for both sides asking questions of the 15 potential panel members as a group, covering a wide range of topics: their views on juvenile justice, their familiarity with books or films about al Qa’ida, educational background, involvement in other kinds of military justice proceedings, and their degree of commitment to fair trial principles such as the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Then each of the 15 officers was brought in to be questioned individually. 
 
Only a small number of the officers indicated that they knew anything much about the Guantánamo Bay detentions, the military commission process or issues related to the USA’s treatment of detainees in what the Bush administration dubbed the “war on terror”.  Most simply indicated they had no opinions and no knowledge about such topics – rather disturbing given that all of them held officer rank in the US armed forces.  Two of them did show considerable awareness, however, and were upfront about sharing their views that the Guantánamo detention facility should be closed down.  They said they were concerned about the damage it was doing to the USA’ s reputation as a “beacon of liberty”. 
Also troubling was the minimal concern shown by any of the members of the pool about children being treated as adults in a “war court”, or facing a possible life sentence, or other issues relevant to Omar Khadr’s young age when he was taken into custody.  All of the potential members stated that they were comfortable with a 15-year-old being treated as an adult and charged in this way.  One did go on, however, to express concern about the fact that it had taken eight years for the case to come to trial, something of particular concern to him given his age. 
The prosecution sought to have three officers dismissed for cause, all of whom had expressed opinions indicating an awareness of and concern about human rights shortcomings at Guantánamo. The defence sought to have seven dismissed. There was one officer who both sides objected to, so he was automatically excluded.  The prosecution lost their other two objections, while the defence was successful on all but one of their other six.  Each side then used their one peremptory challenge to exclude one more individual.  The result was a panel of seven members – three women and four men. 
What stays with me from these two days is the intensity of the prosecution’s determination to exclude anyone who had an informed view about the well-documented human rights concerns associated with Guantánamo Bay and other aspects of the USA’s post-September 11th counter-terrorism policies.  This was particularly notable in the case of the Army Lieutenant Colonel against whom the prosecution eventually used their peremptory challenge. He spoke openly about his understanding of the concerns that had arisen at Guantánamo Bay and elsewhere.  He worried about what he saw as US moral authority having been eroded.  He talked of concerns such as lengthy detention without charge, charges being brought which had limited legal precedent, and the admissibility of information obtained under torture.  He spoke of his concerns about the positions that former White House Counsel and US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales had taken on the handling of detainees and interrogation methods.  Ultimately he repeated several times that he supported President Obama’s position that it would be best to close down the Guantánamo detention facility. 
The prosecution was vehement in laying out their case for why this Lieutenant Colonel should be excluded.  He was accused of disloyalty for his criticism of Alberto Gonzales.  He was described as having a hostile attitude towards the government.  And he was repeatedly chastised for having said that he “agreed with the President” when it came to Guantánamo Bay, for which he was accused of clearly being biased against the government.  One was left wondering just who the prosecution thinks the government is. 
Once the selection process was completed, the military judge, Army Colonel Patrick Parrish scheduled opening arguments in the trial for tomorrow, Thursday.

Unfortunately for the minister, and luckily for the human rights movement, I am not the only one who is concerned about serious human rights violations that were committed by both the government and the Tamil Tigers during the final stage of the conflict. International concerns regarding alleged war crimes are not fading. To the contrary, this week new pressure is building up to ensure true accountability. This week, fifty-seven eight members of Congress sent a letter (pdf) to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, urging her to press for an independent international inquiry into the alleged war crimes. The congressional action is gaining considerable media attention, with stories run by AFP, AP, BBC and Al Jazeera. 
We are still awaiting Secretary Clinton’s response to the serious concerns raised by the US lawmakers. The congressional letter highlights the limitations of Sri Lanka’s sham commission on Lesson’s Learnt and Reconciliation, which started its work today, and which is not expected to produce any more credible results than its predecessors. Unfortunately, Secretary Clinton so far seems to support the domestic commission, despite the doubts raised about its credibility. 
We also just learned that the US Department of State will submit its follow up report on war crimes and accountability in Sri Lanka to Congress this afternoon. This new document will reportedly inform Congress what steps – if any – the Sri Lankan government has taken to ensure accountability for any crimes committed.

0,Maldives Political Crisis and Human Rights Implications,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/maldives-political-crisis-and-human-rights-implications/,Maldives is the only country I know where the leader is a former Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience.  I was planning on using that fact to write how Maldives was … ,"Maldives is the only country I know where the leader is a former Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience.  I was planning on using that fact to write how Maldives was a model of how a country could transition from one that was strewn with human rights abuses to one that upholds human rights and the rule of law.  Well…the situation in the country is not as rosy as I was hoping.  In fact, its political leaders will need to use a lot of deftness to avoid bloodshed. 
 
In October, 2008, Mohamed Nasheed (that AI Prisoner of Conscience) won a tough race for the presidency of the Maldives.  Nasheed was a longtime opposition leader who still has a limp from his days of being tortured, defeated Abdul Gayoom, who had the distinction of being the longest serving ruler of any country in Asia.  With the victory came the promise of human rights for all Maldivians.  Sadly, this has been a bit of a challenge for the country as there have been times when people have been at risk for flogging for alleged cases of premarital sex.  There is also the case of Ismail Didi, a Maldivian nonbeliever and air traffic controller who made the fatal mistake of telling people that he was an atheist in a country where it is mandatory to be a Sunni Muslim.  He was later found hanging at his workplace at the international airport. 
More recently and more connected with the political crisis is the arrest (and later release) of Abdullah Yameen, one of at least four opposition leaders who were detained and released in recent weeks following the resignation of the President Nasheed’s cabinet on June 29.  It is indeed this political crisis that has the makings of a disaster unless the opposition (led by the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party, which together with other oppositions parties hold a majority of seats in the legislature) and the government (the Maldivian Democratic Party) can somehow work out a power sharing arrangement.  It’s not looking too good at the moment as President Nasheed was forced to issue a decree to allow the Supreme Court to operate in the absence of an agreement in the legislature.  This has led to an absurd situation where the doors to the Maldives Supreme Court have been locked and guarded by the police to prevent anyone from entering the building.  The Maldivian paper Haveeru has more (emphasis mine): 
MPs of the ruling Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party (DRP)-led opposition were at loggerheads Saturday over the order of agenda items set for a crucial sitting eventually called off in the evening after three postponements.

The opposition controlled parliament’s failure to reach consensus led to a MDP demonstration outside parliament house. The protestors clashed with police but disbanded on riot police request one and half hours later. There were no casualties.

Early Sunday morning the armed forces opened Supreme Court and President Nasheed’s Political Advisor Hassan Afeef, Special Envoy Ibrahim Hussain Zaki and State Minister Aslam Shakir met the court’s staff. Supreme Court judges, including Chief Justice stayed home “for fear of being blocked by the armed forces on arrival at the court’s gate.” 
The widening divide between the two sides developed into a serious crisis and street violence in the past few weeks, threatening to derail the country’s two-year old democracy.  All I can do is hope that President Nasheed, the Maldivian Democratic Party and the Dhivehi Rayyithunge Party do whatever it can to resolve these issues that divide them and pass needed legislation that will bring Maldives’ justice system into line with international human rights standards.",,"August 9, 2010 • Post",False

I would like to thank the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and the Bureau of International Labor Affairs for co-hosting this conference and for giving me the opportunity to be part of this important and urgent conversation. 
I want to start by acknowledging that many of you in this room have more expertise than either I or Amnesty, as an organization, in combating child labor.  What AI has is some 50 years of experience of fighting for human rights.  What I hope we can contribute to this discussion is our understanding of the critical place of human rights in any effective effort to end child labor. 
Last month, the ILO warned that progress in ending the worst forms of child labor has slowed down, and that the global economic downturn is likely to make the situation worse.  There is, however, nothing inevitable about this trend.  As the ILO’s Constance Thomas noted: 
Most child labor is rooted in poverty. The way to tackle the problem is clear. We must ensure that all children have the chance of going to school, we need social protection systems that support vulnerable families – particularly at times of crisis – and we need to ensure that adults have a chance of decent work. These measures, combined with effective enforcement of laws that protect children, provide the way forward. 
This is also “the way” required by the human rights norms, standards, and laws by which virtually every government is bound.  Yet, the truth is that for far too long and far too often, child labor, like the poverty in which it is rooted, has been treated by governments, international bodies, and NGOs – including my own for many years – as primarily, if not exclusively, an issue for development agencies or specialized labor organizations, but not necessarily a human rights issue. Human rights have often been seen, at best as an add-on, at worst as an obstacle to development.  It was in part to contribute to changing this, AI has launched a global campaign called “Demand Dignity” to combat the human rights abuses that force men, women and children into poverty and keep them there.  The campaign aims to make human rights integral and central to the fight against poverty and poverty related practices like child labor. 
 
Why is this so important? What do human rights bring to the fight against child labor? 
The human rights starting point is that child labor violates the enjoyment of the full range of children’s rights.  Viewed from the human rights lens, solutions must therefore be comprehensive and multi-disciplinary, and guided at all times by the best interests of the child.  Child labor, for example, cannot be stopped if the result is a significant worsening of the right to an adequate income or is not replaced by education.  The child has a right not only to be free from economic exploitation but to have education and development in keeping with his or her dignity.  All these rights are indivisible and must be addressed if a genuine solution is to be found to the ugly phenomenon we are discussing. 
Secondly, a human rights approach recognizes that poverty and child labor result not just from a lack of income but from a lack of power and a lack of justice. Any genuine solution needs to address root causes including structural forms of exclusion and discrimination that allow exploitation to flourish.  As Myron Weiner has argued in looking at child labor in India, the failure to provide education for millions of children results not from low per capita income as much as from the beliefs of those in power regarding the proper place of poor people and their children. Human rights require a rigorous analysis of discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity and economic status and developing solutions that not only combat discriminatory attitudes and practices but empower those who are most marginalized.  Empowerment means not only looking at outcomes but on how those outcomes will be achieved.  It means focusing on the active participation of the most impacted by abuses and the communities round them. This means seeing children and their larger communities as partners and not simply as abstract “target groups” or aid recipients. 
Finally, human rights demands accountability and enforcement of laws.  Human rights demands that those most at risk are protected under the law, that the laws are enforced and that victims of abuses and their communities have access to institutions with the power to ensure remedy when those laws are broken.  Making this a reality requires not only a serious investment of resources, but the creation, through national and international pressure, of the political will, to use those resources to create justice systems aimed at serving the poor.  This is an enormous challenge.  It is perhaps the greatest challenge facing the human rights movement. 
The generation of the kind of political will needed to meet this challenge requires us all working together. 
In practice, the obstacles to making our recommendations a reality are formidable.  Last fall, Amnesty released a report on the plight of child domestic workers in Haiti.  According to UNICEF estimates, in 2007, there were more than 100,000 girls aged between 6 and 17 years old working as domestic servants in Haiti, living in conditions the UN Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Slavery has described as a “modern form of slavery”.  Their situation, as you undoubtedly know, is not unique.  Worldwide more girls are involved in domestic work than any other form of child labor and domestic workers are often excluded from the protection of national laws.  Most of these children come from rural families living in poverty who are unable to care for them.  They are sent to the cities in the hope their life chances will be improved.  In reality, they end up working long hours in exchange not for wages but from some shelter and food.  Most do not receive any education at all.  Many are subjected to sexual violence based on their total dependence.  Some flee and end up living on the streets. 
AI has called on Haitian authorities – and on the international donor community to support the Haitian authorities to this end – to take a number of steps to address this problem, including: 
These would be important steps but without other steps which would allow these girls to enjoy the right to education and an adequate income and the right to justice they would mean very little. 
The United States could and should play a leading role in promoting and enforcing these rights, in Haiti and around the world, advancing, among others, the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a key instrument in the fight against child labor. 
To do this it would first need itself to ratify and implement the convention instead of being one of only two countries in the world that has failed to do so.  It would then need to adopt itself a holistic approach to human rights and to develop and support programs and solutions, developed with the participation of impacted communities, which are aimed at the full enjoyment of all rights.  It could work for stronger mechanisms to enforce these rights including urging national and international corporations to adopt codes of conduct aimed at preventing any aspect of their operations that contributes to the violation of the rights of children. 
If this conference is a step toward this kind of human rights approach based on the indivisibility of all rights – one which could enable the formation of a movement bringing together development, labor, security and other groups to fight child labor in a way never seen before – then this conference will prove to have been an important one indeed.",,"June 28, 2010 • Post",False

The Sri Lankan government, for its part, is reportedly not happy with the Secretary-General naming the panel.  One Sri Lankan official yesterday, in anticipation of the panel being named today, said that it amounted to “an attempt to provide oxygen” to the Tamil Tigers (who were militarily defeated a year ago).  Another Sri Lankan official called the move by the UN “unwarranted” as the Sri Lankan government had recently appointed its own reconciliation commission to look into events during the war. 
But as Amnesty International’s report, “Twenty Years of Make-Believe:  Sri Lanka’s Commissions of Inquiry,” documents, the Sri Lankan government has a poor record of holding its own forces accountable for violations of human rights and war crimes.  One of the prior commissions of inquiry described in our report was a 2006 commission set up by the Sri Lankan government to investigate several high-profile cases of human rights violations.  That commission’s activities were observed, at the Sri Lankan’s government’s request, by an “International Independent Group of Eminent Persons” (known as IIGEP).  After a little more than a year in operation, IIGEP quit in protest, saying that the commission’s proceedings didn’t satisfy basic international standards for such commissions. 
As it happens, Mr. Marzuki Darusman, the Chair of the new UN panel, was also a member of IIGEP.  This fact has already been used by a Sri Lankan official to criticize the new UN panel.  I hope Mr. Darusman’s experience on the new panel will turn out more positively than the IIGEP experience, but judging from the Sri Lankan government’s reactions so far, I’m not very optimistic.  I do hope that the UN panel will help lead to an independent international investigation into war crimes and human rights abuses committed by both sides during the war in Sri Lanka, sooner rather than later.",,"June 23, 2010 • Post",False

‘Ali Hussain Sibat, who is 46 and has five children, was a presenter on a TV show on the Lebanese satellite TV station Sheherazade, where he gave advice and predictions about the future. He was arrested by the Mutawa’een (religious police) on charges of “sorcery” in May 2008 while he was in Saudi Arabia to perform a form of Muslim pilgrimage, the ‘umra.

I’m actually serious– this is not an April Fool’s Day joke.  It is actually true.  Lindsay Lohan has done a documentary of child trafficking in India.  See the cringe-inducing one minute preview above.

Child trafficking in India is  at epidemic levels despite efforts to combat it.  Many (upwards of 40%) of the children trafficked into India are from Nepal.  There is also cult-like group in the Indian state of Karnataka who worship the goddess Yellamma and send their children (initiated as devadasi) who are trafficked to other parts of India supposedly as part of their devotion to this goddess.  It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of girls are trafficked for prostitution.  Their lives are short and brutal, many suffer from sexually transmitted diseases.  In places like Mumbai, children as young as nine are sold at auctions reminiscent of slavery.  The testimony of Anita, a young Nepalese girl trapped in a life of prostitution is worth a read.  Maybe if even one of these girls benefit from Lindsay Lohan’s documentary, then perhaps it will be worth it.",, • Post,False

“More than 6,000 people have arrived at the makeshift camp since October—2,000 in January alone,” said MSF Head of Mission in Bangladesh Paul Critchley. “People are crowding into a crammed and unsanitary patch of ground with no infrastructure to support them. They are prevented from working to support themselves and are not permitted food aid. As the numbers swell and resources become increasingly scarce, we are extremely concerned about the deepening crisis.” 
The Myanmar government (note that Amnesty International requires use of the UN-recognized name of the country widely known as Burma) refuses to acknowledge that the Rohingya are from Myanmar rendering them stateless.  
MSF is asking that the UNHCR increase protections to these Rohingya seeking protection in Bangladesh.  At the moment, only 28,000 of the estimated 200,000 of the refugees in Bangladesh are recognized as refugees.  The result, in an already overcrowded and poor country, is that the Rohingya are vulnerable.  Human rights groups have been campaigning on the plight of the Rohingyas for a number of years, but Myanmar’s neighbors have grown impatient with the scale of the humanitarian need.  But, as MSF makes clear, the international community must support the Government of Bangladesh and UNHCR to adopt measures to guarantee the unregistered Rohingya’s lasting dignity and well-being in Bangladesh.

The report tells us that between 2007 and March 2009, 108 schools were fully destroyed, an additional 64 were partially damaged, and 40,000 children, including 23,000 girls, were deprived of their education. This is occurring in the context of a ruthless campaign by the Taliban against girls’ education, which is part of a larger campaign to impose their strict social rules and norms on the people of Northwestern Pakistan. As UNESCO’s report clearly states, “The Taliban in Swat Valley, Pakistan, left no ambiguity about their intent to target girls’ education.” 
As the Pakistani military celebrates the recent capture of several key Taliban leaders, it is important to remember the impact of the conflict between Taliban armed groups and the Pakistani military in the region on civilians. Clearly, the Taliban have been the cause of countless human rights abuses against civilians, including attacks on education.

I wish him all the happiness in the world. But at the same time Mutharika looks forward to sharing his life with the person of his choice, two men remain jailed in Malawi because they tried to do the same. 
At the end of December 2009, Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga were arrested following their participation in a traditional engagement ceremony. They are currently on trial for “unnatural practices between males” and “gross public indecency.” They remain imprisoned after being denied bail, purportedly for their own safety, and face public ridicule when appearing in court. They have applied for relief to the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of their arrest under Malawian law but have yet to receive a ruling. 
Following the arrest of Monjeza and Chimbalanga, three things have happened. First, Malawi’s gay rights movement has become much more active. Second, Malawi has harshly cracked down on gay rights activists. Third, the international community has mobilized, demanding the release of these two men and the repeal of homosexuality as a crime in Malawi. I view two of these outcomes as very positive, and unfortunately, one of them not so much. The arrest of someone for putting up posters that read “Gay Rights are Human Rights” is not only harassment, but it is violative of freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Malawi is a signatory. 
Malawi is also pushing back against the international community, stating other nations and individuals have no right to dictate the laws in their country, raising fears Malawi will only entrench further on its anti-homosexuality stance in the face of this criticism. As a general rule, I appreciate the concept of sovereignty and that other States should stay out of the business of running a nation. However, when persons are discriminated against, their rights violated, their civil liberties trampled, their basic freedoms curtailed and their safety endangered purely because of who they are as individuals, it is the duty of all human beings to stand up and say that this is wrong. 
President Mutharika looks to have a very busy year between settling into a new marriage and assuming the African Union chairmanship.  The increased visibility and prestige of chairing the African Union makes it incumbent upon Mutharika to set positive standards for all of the continent.  Monjeza and Chimbalanga return to court tomorrow as their case resumes.

0,Stop Harassing Gandhian Activists!,AI USA,https://www.amnestyusa.org/stop-harassing-gandhian-activists/,It's time for the Chhatisgarh state government to immediately put a stop to the torture and arbitrary arrest of peace activists in their state.,"The peace activists, belonging to the Vanvasi Chetna Ashram (VCA), a group that professes a Gandhian ideology of non-violence, have been campaigning for adivasi rights in the state for the past four years.  It’s been necessary because they are caught in the middle of an increasingly vicious conflict between the Maoist guerillas (aka the Naxalites) and basically pro-government vigilantes called the Salwa Judum. 
On December 10, 2009 (Human Rights Day, no less), the Chhattisgarh state police arbitrarily arrested Kopa Kunjam (a member of the VCA) and Alban Toppo, a lawyer working with the New Delhi-based Human Rights Law Network (NRLN) at Dantewada in the southern part of the state. They were taken first to the Dantewada police station and then to the Bhairamgarh police station in the neighboring Bijapur district. 
Alban Toppo reported that the police tortured him and Kopa Kunjam that night at the Bhairamgarh police station. They were beaten with thick bamboo sticks and rubber canes for 30 minutes. Toppo was forced to sign a letter stating that they had come to Bhairamgarh police station of their own accord. As a result of the torture, Toppo sustained injuries on his right elbow, biceps and back, causing severe pain and swelling. He could not move his hands and back because of the pain. Kopa Kunjam sustained serious injuries on his chest, back and leg, which left him unable to walk. 
Although Toppo was released that night, he remained at the police station, as he had no means of returning home. Accompanied by police personnel, he was able to return the next morning. On December 12, 2009, Kopa Kunjam appeared before a local court where he was charged, under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, with the murder of Punem Honga, a local leader and member of the Salwa Judum, who had been abducted by the Maoists on June 2, 2009. 
The arbitrary detention of the VCA activists clearly violates India’s Supreme Court guidelines issued in the D. K. Basu vs State of West Bengal case and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which India is a state party. Article 9 of the ICCPR guarantees the right to liberty, which includes freedom from arbitrary detention. 
The Government of Chhattisgarh needs to do the following: 
Given that the state was formed in 2000 to address the aspirations of adivasis, it is disappointing that the state government continues to use the heavy hand of the police to harm those practicing their constitutionally guaranteed rights of free expression.",,"January 9, 2010 • Post",False

Majid Tavakkoli, a student … ","The latest crude and ham-fisted attempt made by the Iranian government to stifle the legitimate expressions of dissent by its citizens–like all other similar attempts–failed spectacularly. 
Majid Tavakkoli, a student leader, was arrested after he gave a speech at Amir Kabir University in Tehran marking Student Day on December 7. The next day, in an apparent attempt to discredit him, a photo of Mr. Tavakkoli wearing women’s clothes was published by the Fars News Agency (linked to the government), which claimed that he had been wearing those clothes at the time of his arrest as he was attempting to sneak away. Not only did the hard line authorities not achieve their goal, but Iranians responded as they consistently have over the last several months, with ingenuity. Hundreds of men posted photos of themselves on Facebook and elsewhere on the internet, wearing women’s clothing, often holding a sign saying, “we are Majid,” thereby both underscoring their solidarity with Majid Tavakkoli as well as rejecting the authorities’ implication that since women are “inferior” then masquerading as one is “shameful.” 
The multiple acts of solidarity were also a recognition of the courage shown by the thousands of Iranian women who defiantly poured into the streets to participate in demonstrations. Basij paramilitary forces showed no chivalry and deference to these women protesters; many of them were savagely beaten and numbers of those women who were arrested were subjected to torture and sexual assault (the Basij also did not spare small children and the very elderly). 
Despite their best efforts to depict the post-election crackdown as necessary to preserve the well-being of the state and society, the hard-line authorities also could not stifle dissenting voices from even the highest ranks of Iran’s top clergy. Grand Ayatollah Montazeri, who sadly passed away on December 20, did not cease to hammer away at the government’s human rights violations; his positions grounded in the deeply felt convictions of his faith, undermined the hard-liners’ portrayal of their brutal post-election response as based on any kind of religious or moral principles. 
And the authorities must have thought that the show of brutal force by Basij paramilitaries and riot police would cow the populace into submission. But something interesting happened: even members of the Basij are stepping forth, sickened by what they had been ordered to do to their own people, and asking for forgiveness. The video of a repentant Basiji confessing his crimes has been widely viewed by Iranians. 
Like the single-minded robot WALL-E, who was seemingly incapable of comprehending the futility of continuing to pile up masses of trash, it seems as if the Iranian authorities are unable to override their program set on “repress, repress” as they continue to trample the rights of their own citizens, and despite their manifest failure to achieve any desired result. We can only hope that by constantly keeping the pressure on, activists will hasten the day when the authorities eventually realize that the only way they can end the Iranian people’s calls for human rights is to begin to uphold them.",,"December 21, 2009 • Post",False

Prime Minister Tsvangirai briefly boycotted the unity government. His goal: force the hand of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to step up in its role as guarantors of the Global Political Agreement (GPA) that forms the basis of the unity government. It worked; SADC held emergency meetings and appointed President Zuma of South Africa as the new negotiator, but the people in Zimbabwe who need to be talking are only grudgingly doing so. 
Tsvangirai’s boycott led to an emergency meeting in Mozambique with Tsvangirai, Mugabe, the SADC Troika (Organ on Defense and Security comprised of Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia), SADC Chair Joseph Kabila, Zuma and former South Africa President Mbeki; where it was decided that Tsvangirai’s MDC-T party and President Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party had 15 days to iron out their differences or South Africa would step back in, with all issues to be resolved within 30 days. (Who was not at the party was Zimbabwe’s civil society, excluded thus far from every step of the process in negotiating a conclusion to the political stalemate and violence.) 
The major sticking points are the appointment of the Attorney General, the appointment of the Reserve Bank governor, the appointment of ambassadors and regional governors and the harassment of MDC supporters by police.  ZANU-PF also insists on the lifting of targeted sanctions imposed by the European Union, United States and other nations against key members of the ZANU-PF party. An excellent assessment of the situation can be found here. 
 
Fifteen days came and went and the 30 day deadline (December 6th) is imminent. Talks have limped along with little information emerging regarding resolution of issues. Zuma’s advance party arrived in Harare this week to “inject urgency” into the discussions, and Tsvangirai assured party members that discussions will be completed by the deadline. However, most commentators feel that only smaller surface issues (ie matters of Cabinet protocol) will be decided to pacify SADC that progress is being made while larger issues (ie ministerial appointments) will remain unresolved. 
In the meantime, Roy Bennett’s trial on terrorism charges began and was subsequently postponed until January. Zimbabwe dodged a ban of the sale of its diamonds by the Kimberely process despite stark evidence of severe human rights violations occurring in the diamond mines. The Commonwealth (coalition of predominantly former British colonies) met and invited Zimbabwe to return (it suspended Zimbabwe’s membership in 2002 and Zimbabwe withdrew formally in 2003) if Zimbabwe met political and economic benchmarks. Mugabe is apparently unimpressed by the offer. Senseless acts of violence continue, cholera begins its comeback with the resumption of the rainy season, and women and children are bearing the brunt of Zimbabwe’s collapsed social service system.",,"December 2, 2009 • Post",False

One of the hearings I was asked to observe at, was a public hearing including two cases regarding the human rights abuses committed by the Mexican military.  AI has been following these cases closely, and they will most likely both be included in a report that AI will be releasing at the end of November addressing how flawed the military justice system in Mexico is, and how relatively easy it is for military personnel to get away with committing human rights violations. 
 
I also met with the Muñoz Guzmán family; a family who has been fighting for justice in the case of Miguel Orlando Muñoz Guzmán  for over 16 years. They have been working with our Mexico Country Specialist, along with a local AIUSA group, to try and hold those responsible, accountable for Miguel’s “disappearance” over 16 years ago. Stay tuned for more information about this case.

While Joyner was understandably shocked and motivated to action by this revelation of his family history, the story of what happened in South Carolina 94 years ago is eerily familiar to what goes on in capital punishment in America today.  Certainly, wrongful death sentences and executions (as the Cameron Todd Willingham case definitively demonstrates) are still with us.  The Griffin brothers were framed for the murder by the actual killer, as was the case in John Grisham’s non-fiction study The Innocent Man, and as seems likely to have been the case with Troy Davis. And, as is the case today, legal costs were devastating; the Griffins had to sell off their considerable land holdings (130 acres) to pay for their lawyer. 
Of course there are important differences. With the judge’s approval, the trial began just two days after the indictment, a practice that would never occur today, and which made organizing an effective defense impossible.  Appeals courts failed to address this fundamental injustice.  But, as often happens today, a petition campaign to save the lives of the Griffin brothers was organized, as doubts about their guilt began to surface.  According to the AP story cited above:  
“More than 120 people signed a petition asking then-Gov. Richard Manning to commute the men’s sentence, including Blackstock’s mayor, a former sheriff, two trial jurors and the grand jury foreman.” 
This multiracial effort was to no avail as the Governor, though he delayed, ultimately approved the executions.  Those of us who follow the death penalty know that low expectations for executive clemency have changed little in the intervening 90+ years. 
Which makes one wonder; what cases today, on which our current crop of governors and judges fail to take action, will draw posthumous pardons 90+ years from now, as the 21st century draws to a close.",,"October 16, 2009 • Post",False

Since the release of Amnesty International’s report Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta (30 June 2009), our global membership has acted to get Shell’s new CEO Peter Voser to come clean on the impacts of its operations in the Niger Delta, during his first 100 days on the job. Here’s one of my favorite actions: 
 
Parisian AI-ers show Shell how to clean up 
AI’s report looks at the impact of pollution and environmental damage caused by the oil industry on the human rights of the people living in the oil producing areas of Niger Delta. Some of the key concerns highlighted in the report focus on health and livelihood — the lack of access to potable water and damage to fisheries and local farming. 
Shell was quick to challenge AI’s report, claiming that Amnesty International made no attempt at open dialogue with Shell and that the report contained no new insights. We set the record straight providing dates and evidence. Shell should not think its recent $15.5 million settlement in the landmark Wiwa v. Shell case remedies more than 30 years of environmental contamination and inadequate clean-up. 
When will Shell do more? AI-France says that over 2,000 cards and 20,000 electronic postcards have been distributed, but the company has not heard appeals by Amnesty International. AI-UK’s Protect the Human blog says Shell has not responded to their 3500+ emails. AIUSA members can lend their support to this global action. Very simply, we’re asking Voser to clean up oil pollution in the Niger Delta, clean up Shell’s practices, and come clean on the information Shell holds on pollution in the region, but hasn’t made public. 
:: Take Action Now. Tell Voser to come clean in the Niger Delta. ::  
The reality is that Shell’s pollution and exploitation in the Niger Delta has created a hell on earth for the 31 million people who live in a region that’s home to one of the top 10 most important wetland and coastal marine ecosystems in the world.

Today, Ohio faces a similar dilemma.  Romell Broom survived the Buckeye state’s attempts to execute him by lethal injection, due to the failure of his executioners to find a useful vein in which to inject the poison.    Does this mean Mr. Broom will no longer face the needle, or will Ohio subject him to a second execution?  It appears that the latter is the case (Ohio Governor Ted Strickland merely granted Mr. Broom a week-long reprieve), although there may be arguments in court that being executed twice would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. 
Ohio has had these problems before: the execution of Christopher Newton (who “volunteered” to be executed by giving up his appeals) took 90 minutes, and the lethal injection of Joseph Clark took 40.  In both cases, the delay was the result of the inability of the execution team to find suitable veins. 
Given that this horrible problem keeps re-occurring, it would be wise for Ohio Governor Ted Strickland to at least declare a moratorium and halt executions in his state.",,"September 16, 2009 • Post",False

In her statement today to the Council, Navanethem Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, had the following to say of the displaced civilians in Sri Lanka: 
“In Sri Lanka, internally displaced presons are effectively detained under conditions of internment.  Humanitarian agencies’ access to these camps remains restricted, and the mandates of relief agencies are increasingly coming under threat.” 
In response to the High Commissioner’s statement, Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Sri Lankan Minister of Disaster Management and Human Rights, told the Council that the internally displaced civilians would be allowed to leave the camps once they were screened to ensure that they weren’t members of the opposition Tamil Tigers.  The Minister gave no timeframe for when this screening might be completed.  So far, 6,490 people are reported to have been released from the camps, out of a total population of about 265,000. 
Unfortunately for the Sri Lankan government, arbitrary detention of the displaced civilians isn’t allowed under international law – specifically, the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.  The Principles do say that if in “exceptional circumstances” it is “absolutely necessary” to confine internally displaced civilians in a camp, such confinement can’t “last longer than required by the circumstances” (see Principle 12(2)).  The Sri Lankan government claims that members of the Tigers may be hidden among the civilians and that if these members of the Tigers were released, they could resume attacks.  If the Sri Lankan government’s logic were correct, the government would be equally justified in rounding up the entire Tamil population throughout the country, and detaining them all until they could prove they weren’t members of the Tigers.  The internally displaced civilians shouldn’t have to prove their innocence to win the freedom of movement they’re entitled to. 
I hope the UN Human Rights Council takes up again the situation in Sri Lanka and gets the Sri Lankan government to release the internally displaced civilians from the camps as soon as possible. 
It was also reported today that UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was sending the UN’s political chief, B. Lynn Pascoe, to Sri Lanka tomorrow for talks with the Sri Lankan government, including on the issue of getting the internally displaced civilians released from the camps.  Even if the UN Human Rights Council doesn’t act, I hope the Secretary-General is able to get the displaced civilians released soon.",,"September 15, 2009 • Post",False

It’s imperative that conditions in the camps be improved quickly, especially with the monsoon rains coming in the next few weeks.  But even more important, the civilians must be allowed to leave the camps if they wish. On that score, we may have gotten some good news today:  the Sri Lankan government announced today that civilians in the camps could be released if they had relatives willing to take them.  We’ll see whether this is implemented and how many it will apply to.  But even those civilians without such relatives are still entitled to freedom of movement.  Being caught in a war zone is not a crime; the displaced civilians should not be treated as criminals.  Unlock the camps now!",,"September 9, 2009 • Post",False

Well, he signed half of it. The entire 36 page document was ratified into law by Parliament as Constitutional Amendment 19. President Mugabe, however, only signed an 18 page document. The result is potentially unenforceable as “It is impossible, legally, to have an act in two different versions-one version approved by Parliament, another by the President.” The missing pages included clauses governing the mandated Constitutional revision and referendum process. This means that the entire agreement can be declared null and void, or those pages not signed by the President are not enforceable. 
The Global Political Agreement (GPA) is the result of negotiations that occurred after contested Presidential and Parliamentary elections in March 2008. Although now-Prime Minister Tsvangirai received the majority of votes, he purportedly did not receive the necessary 50% +1 required to win outright, forcing a run-off election. Tsvangirai subsequently withdrew from the run-off over concern for the extreme levels of violence that occurred, including deaths, disappearances and torture and Mugabe was declared the winner. The Southern African Development Committee (SADC) stepped in and negotiated a political settlement that became the GPA and is now the guarantor of this agreement. 
ZANU-PF’s commitment to the GPA has been suspect from the beginning including refusing to cede control of the Attorney General office and Reserve Bank and chipping away at the Parliamentary majority position Prime Minister Tsvangirai’s party MDC-T secured in the 2008 elections through pressing criminal charges. Further, while levels of violence have abated, political violence is an on-going concern including the recent murder of an MDC activist. 
The law is meant to define the parameters that regulate behavior and establish social control. It is not meant to be a blunt weapon of force to repress, dominate and terrorize citizens. Mugabe’s political party, ZANU-PF, consistently uses the law to manipulate and oppress from laws used to stifle dissent such as the Public Order and Security Act, to withdrawing from the SADC Tribunal, to entering the agreement with false intentions by building in an escape hatch. 
ZANU-PF’s withdrawal from the SADC Tribunal and the failure to sign all pages of the GPA are essentially contract disputes and there is no applicable court to turn where a judge can decide which terms apply and should be enforced. Instead, the judge is SADC, who must remove the blinders of reverence towards a one time freedom fighter and see him as the leader of a party of freedom oppressors. SADC announced today it will convene an extraordinary summit in three weeks to address the outstanding issues surrounding the GPA and it MUST force a resolution on both these concerns.  
The judge is also the international community, who bears the burden of standing strong in speaking out against the injustices occurring in Zimbabwe while still standing in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe by providing appropriate humanitarian aid to repair the schools, hospitals, water treatment plants and sewer systems, electrical capacity and agricultural industry. Finally, the judge is us, who must continue to demand respect for the rule of law and insist on accountability and an end to impunity for those who use violence to retain power and control.",,"September 8, 2009 • Post",False

Soon afterwards, he met and married his wife Carol.  They had a baby girl named Amber. 
Life was going well for the Mosely family, but things started to fall apart when Ken became addicted to crack cocaine. He and his wife sought treatment from many different clinics, but after losing his job, he lost his health insurance and, with it, any hope of affording treatment for his addiction. His life went into a downward spiral. 
One day, with a gun in his pocket, Ken walked into a bank. A police officer, who later paid with his own life, spotted him and attempted to stop him from robbing the bank. They struggled and crashed through a window. During the struggle,  the officer was shot and killed. 
During Ken’s trial, the quality of the representation he received was so poor that he may as well have been deprived of his constitutional right to effective counsel.  The lawyers failed to present evidence of several mitigating factors that may have influenced the jury’s decision to impose the death penalty.  For example, despite the fact that Ken suffered a brain injury resulting in permanent damage, his attorneys did not even examine Ken’s medical records.  Nor did they address his debilitating addiction to crack cocaine.  No evidence of either impairment was presented to the jury.

Recent ethnic clashes in southern Sudan have killed at least 25 people and displaced dozens of civilians in Upper Nile State since Friday. Violence has been escalating recently, as women and children are increasingly targeted by both tribal militias and the Ugandan rebel Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). 
The World Health Organization (WHO) also warned today that conflict-affected areas of southern Sudan, including Ezo County in Western Equatoria State where the LRA has been active recently, are facing a high risk of epidemics. WHO cites damaged health facilities, displaced health workers and the difficulty of accessing health facilities as contributing factors to this increasing risk for epidemics. Attacks in recent weeks have caused forced around 80,000 people to flee their homes. 
In a separate development, Reuters reports that the NGO Global Witness claims that they have found serious discrepancies in reports of Sudan’s oil revenues, meaning that the Sudanese government may been underpaying the south by hundreds of millions of dollars.  However, government officials denied all accusations made in the report and claimed to the BCC that the south was represented in all state bodies that dealt with oil.

Those who are able to leave the area have no choice but to use mined roads. 
According to the BBC, a truce between the government and rebels which was agreed to on Friday, primarily to allow civilians to flee from the war zone, collapsed just a few hours later. Both sides blame the other for the continuing violence. 
Meanwhile, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) is waiting for security clearances in order to open a humanitarian corridor that would allow them to gain access through Saudi Arabia to displaced people in need of tents and other aid. The UN estimates that about 35,000 have been displaced by the fighting in the past three weeks alone.

Fighting erupted between government forces and one of the so-called ceasefire groups, when the army clashed with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) in Myanmar’s northeast Shan state. 37,000 people fled to the neighboring Yunnan province in China.  Even more noteworthy, the fighting and the resulting displacement led to a surprising criticism by China, the military regime’s strongest supporter. 
The MNDAA is one of the 17 ethnic armies that have signed a ceasefire agreement with the government. Last week’s fighting broke a 20 year old ceasefire and might be the beginning of increased clashes between the army and ethnic armed groups ahead of next year’s elections. Tensions have increased due to government demands that the groups convert their forces into border guard units under the command of the national army. Many analysts agree that the aim is to disarm ethnic insurgents and neutralize their threat ahead of the elections.

Gabon – Poll Uncertainties
Sunday’s presidential elections to replace late President Omar Bongo – who passed away in June after 41 years in power in this oil-rich country – are leading to uncertain results. Three different candidates – Bongo’s son, Ali Ben Bongo, veteran opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou, and former minister Andre Mba Obame – have all claimed to have won the election. The BBC reports that the vote was generally peaceful but tense, especially due to long lines at polling stations. 
Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Gabon’s security forced stepped up patrols in the capital on Tuesday, after election officials delayed announcing the results of the election until Wednesday. Witnesses said anti-riot police had been deployed to one of the squares often used for political gatherings in Libreville, Gabon’s capital, and that Republican Guard soldiers had reinforced the usual gendarme presence outside several government buildings.

Yet recently, to its credit, the Texas Forensic Science Commission reopened the case.  A nationally known fire expert, Craig Beyler, was hired to assess how Texas authorities investigated the fire.  According to the Tribune, Beyler’s report is not kind to the Texas investigators, and he determined that there was no scientific reason to believe that the fire was arson at all.  If indeed that is the case, Cameron Willingham was executed for a crime that never occurred – an exceptional cruelty for a man who had already lost his three children. 
Beyler ripped the fire marshal who investigated the case, saying, according to the Tribune, that the fire marshal had “limited understanding” of fire science, “seems to be wholly without any realistic understanding of fires and how fire injuries are created,” and that his findings “are nothing more than a collection of personal beliefs that have nothing to do with science-based fire investigation.” 
The Texas Forensic Science Commission will solicit a response from the fire marshal and then publish its final report.  If it reaches the same conclusion that this nationally respected fire expert has, the state of Texas may finally officially acknowledge that it has executed an innocent man.",,"August 25, 2009 • Post",False

The goal of the Matthew Shepard Act (which is itself attached to the 2010 Defense Department authorization bill) is to allow the investigation and prosecution of some hate crimes based on the victim’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender, gender identification, or disability. The person for whom it is named was a 21-year old college student from Colorado who was tortured and murdered in Laramie, Wyoming in 1998 by two other young men. As an openly gay young man, Matthew Shepard was the victim of much discrimination and violence. During the trial for his murder, witnesses stated that he was victimized that night by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson because of his sexuality. 
After McKinney’s conviction the jury began deliberating the death penalty, but Matthew’s parents were able to broker a last-minute deal so that McKinney was sentenced to life in prison instead. Matthew Shepard’s dad was quoted as saying to him: 
“I would like nothing better than to see you die, Mr. McKinney. However, this is the time to begin the healing process. To show mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy. Mr. McKinney, I am going to grant you life, as hard as it is for me to do so, because of Matthew.” 
This profoundly difficult and heart-wrenching decision to show mercy after such a terrible crime may mean nothing to Senator Sessions, but his amendment can still be removed when a House-Senate conference committee meets to reconcile the differences between the two bills, or when the entire House and Senate vote on the bill after that.",,"July 21, 2009 • Post",False

This documentary film was produced by Skylight Pictures, an outstanding team of filmmakers who collaborated with AIUSA on our 2007 documentary Justice Without Borders.  Click here for local listings, as times vary. 
The broadcast date is significant, in that it marks the week eleven years ago that more than 160 governments came together to negotiate the treaty creating the International Criminal Court (ICC).

The Reckoning follows the ICC’s Prosecutor as he and his team confront the most challenging of armed conflict situations, compiling evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in order to build cases against leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, militia leaders in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the President of Sudan. 
I’ve had the privilege of viewing and commenting on various stages of the film as it was being developed.  It’s a great piece of work.  With each viewing, something new strikes me.  I wanted to share with you some of the themes in the film that resonate with me today. 
First, The Reckoning builds to what feels like a “Law and Order: War Crimes”- style finale, with the Prosecutor and his team closing in on a target — a sitting head of state — considered by many to be out of reach.   The crime thriller analogy is actually very appropriate, because some of the footage we see in the film is, when you think about it, crime scene footage.  It’s easy to forget that.  Mass rapes, murders, mutilations and starvation are often treated as the tragic and inevitable consequences of war, instead of as crimes which are planned — which actually require planning to implement on a mass scale — and for which specific individuals are responsible and can be held accountable. 
Secondly, The Reckoning is very much a “David and Goliath” story.  Critics of the ICC’s work try to portray the Court as a big, Western-dominated bully out to get Africa.  I think you will come away from The Reckoning struck by how small the Prosecutor’s team really is in comparison with the massive crimes they are confronting.  I think you will also be struck by how relentless they are in pursuing justice for the victims, who they stress are the millions of Africans subjected to human rights abuses, instead of the few who try to obscure their culpability by hiding behind the mantle of nationalism. 
Finally, The Reckoning tells the story of what is essentially an unfinished revolution.  The film explores both the breakthroughs in the advancement of human rights and the rule of law that made the ICC possible, as well as the lack of political to make enforcement a reality.  Former Nuremberg prosecutor (and one of my heroes) Benjamin Ferencz recalls how the entire body of human rights law that we take for granted today came to be in his lifetime, demonstrating how much is possible in what is essentially a blink of the eye in historical time.  Yet most of the world’s governments — some of whose representatives we see celebrating the ICC treaty at the start of the film — continue to fail to give any meaningful support the ICC in apprehending indicted war criminals.  We may still have a long way to go, but it’s possible to get there. 
I encourage you to tune into PBS tonight, and if you’re as moved as I was, please take action.  Write to Secretary of State Clinton and U.N. Ambassador Rice and urge them to support the ICC’s work on Darfur.",,"July 14, 2009 • Post",False

On the evening of Sept. 18, 2007, six men broke into the home of Justine Masika Bihamba in Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bihamba wasn’t home, but six of her children, ages 5 to 24, were. The men, reportedly government soldiers, tied up the children at gunpoint and abused two daughters in their 20s, sexually assaulting one with a knife. Bihamba and her children identified the attackers to military police but authorities refused to arrest the suspects, saying there was no evidence against them. They remain free today. 
The men targeted Bihamba’s children because of her work coordinating medical and psychological care for women and girls who have been sexually assaulted. In the violent conflict that has raged in Congo for a decade, rape is a weapon of war. 
The conflict has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and forced more than a million to flee; it is the latest in Congo’s long and bloody history. During the colonial period, ivory and rubber were the prizes for which Europeans sacrificed African lives. Today, the fighting is fueled by the country’s vast mineral resources – diamonds, gold and coltan, which is used in all mobile phones and laptops. Armed groups control mines and export minerals illegally, using the cash to buy arms. 
The mineral wealth is of little benefit to the impoverished Congolese population. 
More than 1,000 people die daily from preventable diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Most are children. These preventable deaths are human rights abuses in violation of international treaties on the right to health and the rights of the child. Until corporations that benefit from the mineral trade, together with the Congolese government and the international community, are persuaded to end the abuses, cases like Bihamba’s will keep recurring. 
Amnesty International campaigns to ensure that human rights defenders like her can carry out their vital work in safety. But to stop the carnage in Congo, we recognize that we must also fight poverty – what Mahatma Gandhi called “the worst form of violence.” 
People are accustomed to thinking of human rights violations as abuses committed by repressive regimes – torture, arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, enforced “disappearances,” political assassination, and the like. 
But the international human rights framework is much broader. Sixty years ago, following the brutality of World War II when the Nazis denied Jews, Roma, gays, and others their very right to exist, the response of the international community was unequivocal – human rights had to be based on the principle of inclusion. That is, everyone is entitled to the same set of rights by virtue of being human. These include the right to freedom from torture and arbitrary imprisonment, and no less importantly, the right to adequate food and shelter, basic healthcare, education and employment. In short, the right to live a life of dignity. 
People living in poverty are trapped, much like political prisoners. 
Now, as the global economic crisis threatens to push an estimated 53 million more people into poverty this year, Amnesty International is launching the most ambitious campaign of its nearly 50-year history. 
Just as we have fought effectively to protect civil and political rights on behalf of tens of thousands of political prisoners, we intend to mobilize our volunteers and supporters to hold governments, corporations, armed groups, and others accountable for the human rights abuses that drive millions around the world into poverty. 
Governments have reneged on human rights obligations in the belief that economic growth alone would lift all boats. But now the tide is receding. Virtually none of the growth of the last two decades benefited poor and marginalized communities; instead, the gap between rich and poor only deepened in many parts of the world. 
All human rights are interlinked, as the Congo demonstrates. If development was based on the fulfillment of basic human rights instead of skewed toward enriching a few at the expense of many, we might not be witnessing the violent upheaval of Congo and elsewhere. 
Without an approach to poverty and development that puts human rights first, there will be many more stories like that of Justine Masika Bihamba.",,"June 26, 2009 • Post",False

In the face of a tightening government grip on all things viral, Iranians have managed to circumvent the communication restrictions laid upon them to tell the world their story in ways previously thought to be reserved only for social networking. For anyone who has so much as glanced at the news during the past week, Twitter has been the name of the game for Iranian protesters. 
With a limitation of 140 characters per post, only the most pertinent information is tweeted—rally locations, real-time updates, and details only those on the ground can see. While sites such as Facebook and Twitter have been blocked off before, Iranians have continued to gain access to them via proxies, servers that allow users to access another site through them. Proxy sites are continuously being updated in an effort to stay one step ahead of the Iranian government’s filtering apparatus. 
The Iranian government’s strategy for blocking the flow of information appears to be two-fold. Foreign news services have all been asked to leave (just this morning, the BBC reporter Jon Leyne, one of the few reporters left, was given a similar request) and the internet speed has been slowed to a snail’s pace. According to the Wall Street Journal, limiting bandwidth in this manner is meant to discourage and frustrate users so much that they’ll give up. 
This strategy is, for now, not working. Iranians have harnessed the internet in ingenious ways—from their Twitter posts to uploaded YouTube videos. All major news networks have caught on to the phenomenon, allowing the messages coming out of Iran to truly reach the entire world.

WOZA traditionally marks World Refugee Day because they “believe Zimbabweans are refugees in their own country – displaced, unsettled and insecure.” 
WOZA used UNHCR’s theme this year, “real people, real needs,” to highlight the plight of Zimbabwe’s informal traders, still the only means of survival for many persons in Zimbabwe with its 90%+ unemployment rate. The marches also convened at the offices of state-owned Chronicle newspaper to highlight issues with media freedom in Zimbabwe. Upon arrival, “they were attacked by uniformed police officers who brutally beat them, arresting many.” 
Jenni Williams and Magodonga Mahlangu already face trial on charges of disturbing the peace for violation of the Public Order and Security Act, an onerous law in Zimbabwe that restricts freedom of association by limiting the ability of people to congregate in groups larger than five persons. Their trial is set to reconvene on July 7th, pending word of an appeal to the Constitutional Court. Many people had the privilege of meeting Jenni and Magi when they visited the US in March to speak at Amnesty’s Annual General Meeting. I don’t know yet if either Jenni or Magi were arrested or harmed in today’s demonstrations. I will update this post when I have more news. 
Update from WOZA: “Eight members have been arrested, four women and three men.

Amnesty International today said that the Security Council should stop discussing Sri Lanka informally and instead should address Sri Lanka’s human rights crisis in a formal session resulting in strong action being taken by the Council.  The Sri Lankan government is still denying aid agencies full access to civilians displaced by the recent fighting who are being held in military-controlled internment camps.  The Sri Lankan government recently reconquered the remaining territory held by the opposition Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who fought for over 26 years for an independent state for the Tamil minority in the north and east of the island.  Both sides were responsible for gross human rights abuses during the conflict.  Nearly 300,000 people were displaced in the last few months by the fighting.  Amnesty is urging the Security Council to demand that the Sri Lankan government provide full access for aid agencies to the displaced civilians. 
AI also called on the Security Council to demand an international investigation into the abuses of human rights and humanitarian law committed by both the Sri Lankan government forces and the LTTE during the recent fighting.  That call was echoed today in Geneva by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, who repeated her earlier support for an independent international inquiry.  The Sri Lankan Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva responded to her remarks by rejecting an international inquiry, saying that any process of accountability would be handled by Sri Lankan institutions.  You should also be aware that yesterday, a Sri Lankan minister told reporters that the government had no plans to investigate the reported deaths of thousands of civilians during the recent fighting.  So what kind of accountability will we ever see if it’s left to the Sri Lankan government? 
We don’t have time to waste.  AI is still getting disturbing reports of family members searching fruitlessly for relatives who were forcibly separated from them at government-controlled crossing points after the families managed earlier this year to flee the war zone.  Given the thousands of human rights violations committed by the security forces, we’re very concerned that the people taken away by the government forces could be at serious risk of torture and enforced disappearances.  We need the Security Council to act now.",,"June 5, 2009 • Post",False

That sounds like the name of a rock star or pop music group, no? Well, to me, human rights activists and environmental defenders are rock stars. And I have no doubt that Ken Saro-Wiwa would still be touring and drawing huge crowds if he were alive today. 
Ken Saro-Wiwa was more of a prolific indie rocker. He was a recipient of the Goldman Environmental Prize, primarily for his work as president of the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP). MOSOP grew out of the concerns of indigenous peoples in the Niger Delta – concerns that are globally echoed by many indigenous communities today – about land rights, environmental degradation, and physical abuse by security forces. If you’re not already familiar with the region, it’s important to understand that the Niger Delta is a major source of oil production. 
Under the rule of General Sani Abacha, the Nigerian military tried and executed Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other MOSOP leaders in 1995. The deaths of the Ogoni 9 are widely acknowledged to be the result of MOSOP’s peaceful protests against Royal/Dutch Shell. Royal Dutch Petroleum (Shell) isn’t the only oil giant implicit in human rights violations in Nigeria. Concerns over human rights violations by Chevron (CVX) and subcontractors of both multinational oil companies were highlighted in Amnesty International’s 2005 Report Nigeria: Ten years on: injustice and violence haunt the oil Delta. 
You won’t hear a cover band performing Ken Saro-Wiwa’s biggest hits, but his message is still on the top of the charts. Fourteen years later, Shell now finds itself at the center of a landmark lawsuit by the families of the Ogoni 9 led by EarthRights International and the Center for Constitutional Rights. Wiwa v. Shell cites the Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) – one of the only pieces of legislation that exists to hold corporations accountable for their human rights abuses. More specifically, it allows non-US citizens the opportunity to file suits in U.S. courts. But wait, that’s not the amazing part. Did I mention that the ATCA was adopted in 1789? A law that’s been on the books for 200+ years has the potential to form legal precedent for future corporate accountability work. 
You can be sure the significance of this case is not lost on big corporate human rights offenders like Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM). That is the legacy of Ken Saro-Wiwa’s voice. We keep it on shuffle or archive it in our iTunes library, but rest assured, human rights activists never forget.

Over 150,000 Tamil civilians have managed to flee the war zone this year.  They have been placed by the Sri Lankan government in camps which they are restricted from leaving.  Access to the camps by journalists and aid agencies is limited by the government. 
The Channel 4 News video includes shocking claims of shortages of food and water, dead bodies left for days and even sexual abuse.  The Sri Lankan government has dismissed the claims in the video as Tiger propaganda.  AI cannot confirm whether the claims in the video are accurate or not.  We are asking that the Sri Lankan government allow independent observers, including journalists and aid agencies, full and prompt access to all of the camps.

Demolitions in east Jerusalem have increased dramatically in the last two years with wide swathes of land slated for demolitions.  Settlement expansion which has been in the works for some time is now being given the green light by newly elected government officials.  
Obama has also been asked to follow up on recent events in Gaza.  Despite statements by Sec’y Clinton that goods and humanitarian aid is getting into the Gaza Strip, other sources such as the U.N. and other monitors on the ground continue to report excessive restrictions which continue to keep out spare parts for medical equipment or equipment needed to rebuild, such as bulldozers. 
We’ve also asked that Obama urge Israel to cooperate with the investigation being conducted by the team created by the United Nations Human Rights Council and under the leadership of Justice Richard Goldstone, a highly respected war crimes prosecutor.  Justice Goldstone has stated that he will be investigating the allegations of human rights abuses by all parties involved in the conflict.  The team is currently meeting in Geneva to organize and outline their investigation into war crimes committed during the Gaza crisis.  The government of Israel has publicly stated that they do not plan to cooperate with the team. 
Even though the two leaders will be focused on the peace process, human rights are directly linked to any workable resolution.  Both parties must respect the basic human rights of each other and the United States must play a key role in getting all the  parties involved to recognize this basic tenet.

Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes told a press conference in New York, following his two-day visit to Sri Lanka, that “both sides are pursuing their military logics, if I can put it that way.”  He was referring to the Sri Lankan government’s refusal to agree to a humanitarian pause in hostilities and the refusal by the opposition Tamil Tigers to let the civilians trapped in the war zone in northeastern Sri Lanka leave the area.  Will continued fighting in a shrinking war zone, combined with tens of thousands of civilians being held captive by the Tigers, inevitably mean massive civilian deaths? 
We may not have much more time to find out.  President Rajapaksa said today that the government planned to conquer the remaining Tiger-held area in the next five or six days. 
“With relatives like these…”:  A Sri Lankan government minister said today that the civilians who’ve managed to flee the war zone already “are totally free and willing to be members of a single Sri Lankan family.”  Meanwhile, a Tiger spokesman today denied that the Tigers were holding the estimated 50,000 civilians in the war zone as human shields, saying, “We all are family.  How could anyone hold his or her family as a ‘human shield?'”

For their part, the Tigers had declared a unilateral ceasefire last Sunday.  The Sri Lankan government said today that the Tigers’ ceasefire was a bluff as the Tigers had reportedly carried out seven suicide attacks against government troops in the prior 24 hours.  Are the Tigers keeping to their ceasefire promise? 
The foreign ministers of both Great Britain and France visited Sri Lanka today and tried to get the Sri Lankan government to halt its offensive against the Tigers and allow humanitarian aid into the conflict area.  The ministers later reported that they had failed to get the Sri Lankan government to make this commitment.  The U.N appealed again today for a humanitarian pause in the fighting to allow the trapped civilians to leave the war zone and to allow aid into the zone.  The Sri Lankan government has not promised to cease fighting, and the Tigers have not promised to let the civilians leave if the government did call a temporary halt. 
In response to the over 100,000 civilians who’ve fled the war zone over the past 10 days, the U.N. and various international donors have pledged millions of dollars in emergency assistance in recent days.

The Tigers’ ceasefire declaration said nothing about allowing civilians to leave the war zone.  Amnesty International has reported that the Tigers have attacked civilians trying to flee the area.  AI also said that the Sri Lankan government has used heavy artillery in attacking the Tigers, which has resulted in civilian deaths and injuries. 
You also need to understand that some young Tamil men who have managed to flee the war zone have  “disappeared” after being detained by the army (and by “disappeared”, I don’t mean they just vanished; rather, the government had first detained them but is now denying knowledge of their whereabouts).  AI had warned last month that civilians fleeing the war zone were at risk of enforced disappearance and other human rights violations, if they were suspected to be members or supporters of the Tigers.  I was sickened to read last Friday that enforced disappearances were now occurring.  Fleeing civilians should be protected from any Tigers who may be mixed with them, but given the long history of enforced disappearances by the  Sri Lankan security forces, any screening process by the army of the fleeing civilians should be supervised by international monitors.   
Here’s what I think should happen:  The Tigers should announce that any civilians who wish to leave the war zone would be free to do so.  If they don’t make this announcement immediately, the Tamil diaspora should publicly call on them to do so.  The Sri Lankan government should announce that it is agreeing to a pause in hostilities to allow civilians to leave and aid to enter the zone.  The Tigers and the Sri Lankan government should allow the U.N. team currently in Sri Lanka to enter the war zone to monitor civilians leavning the zone and the distribution of aid to those still in the zone.  The Sri Lankan government should announce that international monitors will supervise the screening of all civilians leaving the zone.  The government should also say that the U.N. and other international agencies will have access to the camps housing the civilians who’ve left the zone, so that they won’t be at risk of human rights violations from the security forces. 
If anyone has any better ideas for protecting the trapped civilians, I’d welcome your comments.  We must do whatever we can to save them.  Visiting the AIUSA website and writing the Sri Lankan government and the Tigers is one thing you can do.  I’d welcome other ideas as well.",,"April 26, 2009 • Post",False

Brett Elder, 15, from Bay City, Michigan died after police used Tasers to break up a fight between him and another teenager. 
Disturbingly, Brett is already the second teenager to die after being Tased this year. In January, an unarmed 17-year-old boy in Virginia died after police responding to a minor street incident shocked him in his apartment. As of today, the total number of deaths after the use of Taser guns in the U.S. has surpassed 334 since June 2001 and it keeps rising. Perhaps what’s most unsettling is that in over 90% of those cases, the person shocked didn’t even have a weapon.  
The news of these teen deaths comes soon after the unveiling of a new Taser weapon, the Taser Shockwave, capable of shocking entire crowds at once.  Clearly, this money could have been better spent conducting rigorous safety testing and research into why so many have died after being shocked with a Taser.  Amnesty International has called on U.S. law enforcement departments to cease using the weapons, pending further safety studies, or to strictly limit their use to a weapon of last resort.",,"March 25, 2009 • Post",False

USA Today: “Opposing view: We’re seeing progress” By Dora Schriro, special adviser to Homeland Security Secretary 
“I have learned that the best way to achieve change is to work closely with partners inside and outside of government, including vital organizations such as Amnesty International, which will issue a report raising concerns about immigration detention later today. I will carefully consider this important report.” 
San Francisco Chronicle: “New report blasts U.S. on immigrant detainees” 
“More than 400,000 people a year are detained by immigration officials in the United States – including undocumented immigrants, legal immigrants who run afoul of the law and asylum seekers who come fleeing persecution – but according to a report released today by Amnesty International, conditions are often deplorable and detainees are routinely denied due process.”

“In a scathing report on the treatment of immigration detainees held in detention centers and more than 300 local facilities such as the Santa Clara County Jail, Amnesty International charges the federal government violates human rights by allowing tens of thousands of people to languish in custody every year without receiving hearings to determine whether their detention is warranted.”",, • Post,False

This announcement was made just two weeks before Secretary of State is due to meet with newly elected government officials in Israel. 
Settlements are illegal under international law and Amnesty International condemns their presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories based on their illegality and believes the existence of these settlements has led to mass human rights violations against the local Palestinian population.  
Settlements aren’t only illegal under international law, but are at odds with American policy. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeatedly made trips to Israel, often having to repeatedly condemn settlement activity. 
Settlements are an impediment to peace, but also a catalyst for human rights violations including (but not limited to) evictions and home demolitions. Often Palestinian lands are confiscated for direct construction or ‘security reasons’ created by settlement expansion and water confiscation and shortages are a major issue. 
B’tselem video on water shortages due to settlement activity: 
The expansion of Efrat specifically threatens the environs of Bethlehem such as the Hope Flowers School which is supported by peace groups and churches here in the US. Back in 2007, the BBC wrote a story already alluding to the expansion of Efrat saying, 
“Officials say the order was issued because the cafeteria [at Hope Flowers School] was built without a permit, but staff believe it is to make way for the expansion of the adjacent Jewish settlement of Efrat.” 
Special Envoy George Mitchell strongly condemned illegal Israeli settlements in his report in 2001 calling on Israel to freeze all settlement activity. President Obama made overtures to the Arab world and showed that he is willing to listen and show respect for their perspectives and human rights 
But, will Sec’y Clinton, when she’s in Israel this March, go farther than parroting diplomatic sound bites?

Today the New Mexico House of Representatives will be debating and possibly voting on a bill to abolish the death penalty (HB285).   This is but one of a stream of bills to repeal or limit the death penalty under consideration across the country. 
Yesterday, the New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee held hearings on bills to abolish the death penalty (HB556) or conduct a study (HB520) of its flaws.  Also yesterday, hearings were held on an abolition bill in Washington state (SB5476). And tomorrow or Friday, the Senate in Montana is expected to vote on an abolition bill (SB236).  A week from today, the much anticipated Senate committee hearing on the Maryland abolition bill (SB279) will take place. 
With the exception of Washington, these are all states where death penalty abolition was expected to be given serious consideration, and those expectations are clearly being realized.  Other states, like Washington, Kansas (where Republican Senator Carolyn McGinn filed an abolition bill (SB208)) and Colorado (where a bill to repeal the death penalty and use the money saved to solve cold cases (HB09-1274)) have also begun to have serious discussions about ending the death penalty, primarily for economic reasons.  In Missouri, where lethal injection and other snafus have brought executions to a halt in what was once a very active death penalty state, over 60 co-sponsors, including at least 13 Republicans, have endorsed a bill to establish an official moratorium on executions (HB484). 
There are notable exceptions to this apparent trend.  Executions continue in Texas at their usual high rate, and the Virginia legislature has, once again, passed a bill to expand the death penalty (HB2358 and SB961) to include those involved in murders who do not actually pull the trigger.  (If history is any guide, the Governor will once again veto this legislation.) 
But, all in all, important debates about the wisdom of capital punishment are occurring in a larger number of states, and the slow, steady drift away from support for the death penalty seems to be continuing.",,"February 11, 2009 • Post",False

The Gaza war was bound to get caught up in the human rights abuses of other countries in the region.  From Egypt comes news this weekend that German-Egyptian blogger and activist Philip Rizk was arrested by Egyptian security officials during a Gaza solidarity rally.  Friends of Philip say 14 others were also arrested, but all but Philip were released. 
This is a recurring story in Egypt, where the government is suspicious of any popular movement or demonstration that exists outside of their control.  Their goal is to muzzle all of civil society. Philip is just one of a number of Egyptian activists arrested because of their public efforts on Gaza. 
Following the arrest, security officials continued to harass family members in Egypt. Amnesty International has met with the family and is following the case closely, as it is with the other arrested activists.

For example, there hasn’t been an execution in Washington since 2001, and there have been only four total in the 30+ years since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. 
Not that there are never any serious crimes in The Evergreen State.  Gary Ridgway was convicted of 48 murders … but he avoided the death penalty.  This has led many to recognize that capital punishment in Washington is extremely arbitrary, which in turn led to an important Washington Supreme Court decision in 2006.  Four Washington Supreme Court judges said that “No rational explanation exists to explain why some individuals escape the penalty of death and others do not.”  The other five Supreme Court judges said that the question of “whether the death penalty can, in fairness, be proportional” was an important one that the state’s Legislature was in the best place to answer.  So far this important question has yet to be adequately addressed. 
Which brings us to Darold Stenson, who is scheduled to be executed on December 3 (really one minute after midnight on December 2).  The crime he was convicted of, two murders, was certainly terrible (although he is refusing to petition for clemency and continues to try to get more DNA testing to challenge his conviction).  But as long as the capital punishment remains as arbitrary as it is in Washington, Governor Gregoire should not allow executions in her state to proceed.",,"November 24, 2008 • Post",False

I met her at an Amnesty meeting two years ago where she spoke at a panel of former prisoners of conscience.  I didn’t know where the Maldives were or anything about the islands, other than they are a popular resort for celeb weddings.  (I’m sure I’m not alone — here’s the google map link.) 
It was one of those meetings that Amnesty International makes possible that can change a volunteer’s outlook on life.  Jennifer’s story was that behind the facade of a resort island, the Maldives is run by a dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who stands by passively as many on the island become addicted to drugs.  Political opposition is treated as a crime.  Her father was jailed, and so was she.  (She was convicted on terrorism charges in 2005 after she participated in a peaceful street demonstration and sentenced to 10 years in jail.) Amnesty International USA adopted her as a special focus case, and she was released in 2007.  She particularly credited Amnesty’s work in her release. (Read about her case in Amnesty magazine here.) 
Once released, she continued her work to bring human rights to the Maldives.  Anyone who met her at the Amnesty conference understood that given her bravery and determination, the threat of jail wouldn’t deter her.  And now, the news brings a surprise that indicates that her work has borne fruit. 
In late October, a coalition of opposition groups defeated the ruling party and threw Gayoom out of power for the first time in three decades. The Maldives being so small, the news received the scantiest of mentions in even the largest of the newspapers.  However, we are so used to dictators using any methods to remain in power that we may forget to celebrate when human rights and democracy activists such as Jennifer actually achieve that result peacefully.  But celebrate we should. 
And we should remember one value of Amnesty International is that it reminds us that human rights are important even halfway around the world and on the smallest of islands with the smallest of populations — even if many of us can’t find it on the map.",,"November 6, 2008 • Post",False
