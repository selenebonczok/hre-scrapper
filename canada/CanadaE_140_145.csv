Date:               Tuesday, August 13, 2019 at 2 p.m.
Location:        Amnesty International, 312 Laurier Avenue East, Ottawa
Speakers:
Setsuko Thurlow, recipient of the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons;
Wang Juntao, political activist and friend of Liu during the 1989 pro-democracy movement;
Ti‑Anna Wang, daughter of Wang Binzhang, political prisoner and founder of Chinese pro-democracy movement overseas;
Senator Con Di Nino
Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada
Richard Stursberg, Chair, PEN Canada
Winnie Ng, Chair, Toronto Association for Democracy in China
Writer, literary critic, philosopher and human rights activist Liu Xiaobo co-wrote Charter 08, a manifesto calling for freedom of expression, human rights, and political reforms in China. He was arrested and sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009.
Liu was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. The Chinese government refused to allow him to travel Oslo to receive the prize. His absence was marked by an empty chair on stage during the award ceremony.
Liu died in prison on July 13, 2017.
The Liu Xiaobo Memorial is a bronze replica of the “empty chair” by Ruth Abernethy, a Canadian sculptor whose iconic works include the Glenn Gould statue at CBC in Toronto, the Oscar Peterson statue at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, as well as the Goddess of Democracy at York University, Toronto.
“Liu Xiaobo – be it through the courage of his activism, the injustice of his imprisonment, the power of his Nobel Prize, the heartbreak of his forced separation from Liu Xia or the tragedy of his death in custody in China – has long embodied the very essence of the global human rights struggle,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada. “Drawing on his legacy, the Empty Chair will be an evocative public reminder of our collective responsibility to insist that universal human rights be upheld, at all times and by all governments. It will offer a place for passersby to reflect and to make a commitment to act for rights and justice. Amnesty International is deeply honoured to host this magnificent sculpture, combining the beauty of art with a crucial message of our shared humanity.”

“Hong Kong police have once again used tear gas and rubber bullets in a way that have fallen short of international standards. Firing at retreating protesters in confined areas where they had little time to leave goes against the purported objective of dispersing a crowd.” 
According to media reports, one protester suffered from a ruptured eye in Tsim Sha Tsui after being shot by what appeared to be a bean bag projectile from the police. Police fired multiple rounds of tear gas and pepper ball projectiles were fired within a short range inside a train station in Kwai Fong and Taikoo against protesters, sometimes aiming at their heads and upper bodies.  
Tear gas should not be used in confined spaces or where exits are blocked or restricted. Tear gas, rubber bullets and pepper ball projectiles can cause serious injury and is even potentially lethal. They should therefore never be fired directly at anyone and should not be fired at all when visibility is poor. When such weapons are deployed, it must be in strict compliance with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality.  
“The Hong Kong police have once again demonstrated how not to police a protest,” said Man-kei Tam. “Law enforcement officials must be able to carry out their duty to protect the public. However, violence directed at police does not give officers a green light to operate outside of international policing standards.” 
“Any heavy-handed policing approach will only increase tension and provoke hostility, leading to the overall escalation of the situation.”  
Amnesty International is calling on all governments to suspend transfers of less lethal “crowd control” equipment to Hong Kong until a full and independent investigation is carried out, and adequate safeguards are put in place.

“The nightmare is finally over!” Maryam wrote on Twitter. “Together we prevailed.” 
Maryam thanked “every single person who supported us throughout this time.” 
Saeed, a permanent resident of Canada, was arrested in Iran in October 2008 while on a visit to his dying father. 
Saeed was a web programmer and it was alleged that a program he developed was used to upload pornographic photos to the internet. Saeed had no knowledge of the program being used for that purpose. 
After his arrest, Saeed was held in solitary confinement for more than a year. Ill-treated, tortured and denied medical care until he “confessed”, Saeed’s televised “confession” was the only evidence used against him. 
Following an unfair trial, Saeed was sentenced to death. In 2012, his sentence was reduced to life imprisonment. 
Amnesty activists threw their support behind Maryam’s campaign to free Saeed. They took part in public events to raise awareness of Saeed’s situation, and they wrote to their MPs and to Canada’s government asking them to not forget Saeed and to do everything in their power to secure Saeed’s release. 
In 2012, when Saeed was facing imminent execution, Amnesty mobilized the Urgent Action Network to call on the Iranian authorities to not execute Saeed. Time and again, Amnesty supporters pressed the Iranian authorities to set him free. 
Last week, after many years of intense campaigning, it was reported that Saeed was given a temporary release from prison, and it was during this time that he was able to return to Canada and be reunited with family and friends.

The campaign is an initiative of Canada Caring Society and MOSAIC, which are working with partners in Australia to raise $3.3 million to bring 200 refugees to Canada. Hassan Al Kontar, an advocate and Syrian refugee who lived in the Kuala Lumpur airport for seven months and was detained in a Malaysian detention centre for two months, is also leading this project. Since moving to Vancouver, BC last year, Al Kontar has wished to help other refugees resettle in Canada.
“For years, refugees and asylum seekers have been detained in desperate and inhumane conditions in Australia’s cruel offshore detention policy,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner with Amnesty International Canada. “This resettlement project will finally offer hope to those who have essentially been living in open air prisons, with little freedom to move and a lack of appropriate healthcare.”
Nearly half of the men and women still being detained on these islands have been accepted for resettlement to the United States, but almost 200 refugees are still waiting with no other alternative in sight. All funds raised through Operation #NotForgotten will support the sponsorship and settlement of these 200 refugees. MOSAIC will hold and disburse the funds and all donors will receive a charitable tax receipt. 
Background:
Since 2013, Australia has been sending refugees who attempt to reach its shores by boat to be ‘processed’ on Nauru or Manus Islands in Papua New Guinea. On these remote islands, thousands of people have endured years of detention and abuse while their refugee claims are assessed.

0,Italy/Malta/Spain: 121 people including babies and children stranded at sea in searing heat must be allowed to dock,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/italymaltaspain-121-people-including-babies-and-children-stranded-sea-searing-heat-must-be/,"More than 30 children, including two babies, and nearly 90 men and women stranded at sea in searing temperatures, must be immediately allowed to dock, said Amnesty International, as the stand-off between the Italian, Maltese and Spanish authorities and a NGO rescue ship enters its second week....","More than 30 children, including two babies, and nearly 90 men and women stranded at sea in searing temperatures, must be immediately allowed to dock, said Amnesty International, as the stand-off between the Italian, Maltese and Spanish authorities and a NGO rescue ship enters its second week.
Despite mounting concerns for their well-being, Italian and Maltese authorities are refusing a port where they could safely be disembarked. Spanish authorities have yet to formally request help from European institutions to mediate a solution.
“After a week stranded at sea in blistering heat, these women, men and children who have risked their lives to escape human rights abuses in Libya should be immediately disembarked either in Malta or Italy,” said Maria Serrano, Amnesty International’s Senior Researcher on Migration.
“Despite mounting concerns for the well-being of those on board, politicians are shamelessly breaching their responsibilities under international law by refusing to grant a safe port to people who could face torture if returned to Libya and who are exhausted and in need of protection and care.”
Seven days after they were rescued from the water by the Proactiva Open Arms NGO ship, 121 people – including 30 children and two babies – remain on board in sweltering heat and overcrowded conditions. The ship, sailing under the Spanish flag, remains about 30 nautical miles from Italy, between Malta and Lampedusa.
Those on board were saved in two rescues on 1 and 2 August in international waters, the first at 78 nautical miles from Libya and the second one close to the Maltese search and rescue zone. Many claim to have suffered extreme forms of abuse whilst in detention in Libya and some reportedly have third degree burns and gunshot wounds. At least one man claims to have sustained his injuries during last month’s attack on Tajoura detention centre in Tripoli.
This stand-off comes a day after the Italian parliament signed off on Minister of Interior Salvini’s second “security decree”. The new law, dubbed “the Decreto Sicurezza bis”, means that private rescue boats entering Italian territorial waters without permission could face fines of up to 1 million Euros and be impounded.
This is just the latest in a series of instances of ships in the Central Mediterranean rescuing people at sea only to be blocked from docking in the nearest safe port. UNHCR and UN Special rapporteurs have already criticized the new measures which could further discourage shipmasters from rescuing people while states have mostly withdrawn from rescue efforts in the central Mediterranean. Meanwhile, another boat from the NGO Proactiva, the Astral, will depart from Spain on Saturday to provide assistance – including food, water and medical supplies – to the Open Arms.
“It is unconscionable that just off the beaches on which holiday-makers bask, babies are stranded at sea. European states, starting with Italy and Malta, have brazenly undermined the search and rescue system and used people as pawns to negotiate abusive migration policies, with callous disregard for peoples’ safety,” said Maria Serrano.
“It is time that European governments stop playing with people’s lives and deploy adequate resources for search and rescue where they are needed. They must urgently agree on a swift and predictable disembarkation mechanism in line with international law and on a fair system to distribute asylum-seekers among EU countries.”

Background:
Prompt disembarkation is discouraged by the unfairness of the European asylum rules (the so-called Dublin system). These determine the country responsible for examining an asylum application.
Usually the country through which the asylum-seeker first entered the EU is responsible for examining their asylum claim. This forces a few countries to process the majority of the applications.

It aims to hold up a mirror to the U.S. using the model of the United States Department of State’s travel advice for U.S. travelers to other countries.
“Travelers to the United States should remain cautious that the country does not adequately protect people’s right to be safe, regardless of who they might be. People in the United States cannot reasonably expect to be free from harm – a guarantee of not being shot is impossible,” said Ernest Coverson, campaign manager for the End Gun Violence Campaign at Amnesty International USA. “Once again, it is chillingly clear that the U.S. government is unwilling to ensure protection against gun violence.”
The travel advisory addressed growing gun violence, mostly hate crimes, including racism and discrimination, highlighting that the traveler’s race, country of origin, ethnic background, sexual orientation or gender identity may place them at higher risk after recent attacks linked to white supremacist ideology. 
The action called attention to the extent to which all aspects of life in the United States have been compromised in some way by unfettered access to guns, without comprehensive and uniform regulation of their acquisition and use. By prioritizing gun ownership over basic human rights, the U.S. government is willfully and systematically failing on multiple levels and ignoring its international obligations to protect people’s rights and safety.
Amnesty International has been calling for common sense reform regarding the use and possession of firearms, including comprehensive background checks, national regulations for registering and licensing firearms, required training, a ban on high capacity magazines/assault weapons, and mandatory safe-storage laws. Amnesty International USA’s campaign to end gun violence has focused efforts on passing S.42., the Assault Weapons ban, and the Disarm Hate Act.
Background 
A report by Amnesty International, “In the Line of Fire: Human Rights and the U.S. Gun Violence Crisis” examined how all aspects of American life have been compromised in some way by the unfettered access to guns, with no attempts at meaningful national regulation. 
Last month, Amnesty International published a report examining how survivors of gun violence in the United States suffer years of trauma and pain due to a destructive combination of government policies which ignore their needs.

“We are relieved and delighted to learn of Saeed Malekpour’s safe return to Canada after more than a decade in Iran’s notorious Evin Prison. Saeed’s resilient spirit in the face of torture, psychological abuse, forced confessions and unjust imprisonment has been truly remarkable.  His return home is testament as well to the courage and dedication of his sister, Maryam Malekpour, who diligently worked to shed light on his situation and tirelessly led the campaign for his freedom. Amnesty International Canada extends a warm welcome home to Saeed and wishes him and Maryam well in their long-awaited reunion.”
Alex Neve further said:
“Amnesty International has long called on Iranian authorities to carry out a prompt, independent, impartial investigation into Saeed Malekpour’s allegations of torture and other ill-treatment and bring to justice anyone suspected of responsibility for the human rights violations he has experienced.
Amnesty International also continues to call on the Iranian government to release all prisoners of conscience in Iran and to address other cases involving human rights violations against Canadians or individuals with close connections to Canada. Canadian citizen Maryam Mombeini has been refused permission to leave Iran for eighteen months, since the troubling death of her husband, environmentalist and Canadian citizen Kavous Seyed-Emami, while he was detained at Evin Prison. She must be allowed unconditionally to return to her family in Canada.”
Background:
Saeed Malekpour, a web developer and Canadian permanent resident, was arrested in 2008 during a trip to visit his ailing father in Iran. Initially sentenced to death for “spreading corruption on earth” in relation to a web program he created to upload photos to the internet, his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. On August 2, 2019, Saeed Malekpour safely returned to Canada. 
Amnesty International considered Saeed Malekpour’s detention to have been on the basis of unfounded and politicized charges and the organization’s members across Canada and around the world actively campaigned for Saeed Malekpour’s release.
Amnesty International understands that neither Saeed Malekpour’s lawyer or family in Iran were involved in or aware of the circumstances leading to his departure from Iran.  His escape was facilitated and arranged from outside the country.

The decision was taken at Amnesty’s highest decision-making forum – the Global Assembly – which is formed of delegates from around the world. The assembly also voted to take further steps to reduce the organization’s climate impact including by aiming to be totally carbon neutral by 2035, to slash air travel by a third and move towards holding more international meetings virtually.
“Fossil fuel companies know that their business model is resulting in human suffering because of its lethal contribution to climate change. As the world’s largest human rights organization, we want to send a clear message that continued investment in coal, oil and natural gas companies is at odds with human rights, because of the direct link between their activities and climate disaster,” said Mwikali Muthiani, Chair of the International Board of Amnesty International.
“Climate change has grave implications for human rights, threatening our rights to health, water, food, housing, and life among other civil and political rights. These risks are even graver for communities living in poverty or whose rights are already threatened or poorly protected by their governments.
“We need to remember who is responsible and accountable for the crisis humanity is facing. The primary reason we are in this mess is because governments and corporations are refusing to take the necessary steps to move away from dangerous fossil fuels and invest in developing clean technologies.”
The use of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change, exacerbating natural disasters and environmental degradation that in turn causes massive loss of life, destruction of communities and economies.
All corporations have a responsibility to respect human rights and to take pro-active steps to make sure they do not cause or contribute to human rights abuses. Yet fossil fuel companies have so far failed to take adequate steps to shift towards human rights-consistent renewable energy, despite their considerable capacity to do so.
“Too many financial institutions treat fossil fuel companies as an acceptable mainstream investment. It is time for all of us to question whether they should instead be seen as a deadly gamble that jeopardies all of our futures,” said Mwikali Muthiani. 
The decision means all of Amnesty International’s entities, which include the International Secretariat and country offices, must ensure that all assets under their sole and direct control are not invested in fossil fuel companies, and divest any existing assets from fossil fuel companies. A working group will be formed to prepare guidance on how to implement the decision.
Amnesty International joins major insurers, faith groups, sovereign wealth funds and universities in choosing to divest from fossil fuel companies. Since it was first launched as a call for climate action by students in 2011, more than 1,110 investors with $9.94 trillion in assets have committed to divest.
“While this is a vote against investing in fossil fuel companies, this is also a vote for moving towards human rights-consistent renewable energy and technologies. The divestment movement has been a powerful force in showing the world that all of us can make the choice to invest in the solutions to the climate crisis,” said Mwikali Muthiani.
The decision also underlines the organization’s intention to target companies as part of its global work on corporate accountability, in order to promote a shift away from fossil fuels and towards human rights consistent renewable energy.
“Amnesty International has a well-recognised expertise and track record in exposing severe human rights abuses by corporations, campaigning to prevent such abuses and ensuring accountability for survivors. We hope to build on this work, and this decision underscores our intention to scrutinize fossil fuel companies for their human rights impacts as part of our strategy on climate change and environmental degradation,” said Mwikali Muthiani.

Notes to editors
Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, will be available for interview at the Global Climate Divest-Invest Summit in Cape Town in September. The conference will take place September 10-11, 2019.
Background 
Fossil fuel companies have been historically among the most responsible for climate change – and this continues today. Research shows that just 100 fossil fuel-producing companies are responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions since 1988.
There is growing evidence that major fossil fuel companies have known for decades about the harmful effects of burning fossil fuels and have attempted to suppress that information and block efforts to tackle climate change. The power of fossil fuel companies must be weakened in order to allow governments to rapidly transition towards a zero-carbon economy.
This year the Philippines Human Rights Commission will publish its investigation into the responsibility of major fossil fuel companies for human rights abuses because of their contribution to climate change. This is the first world investigation of this kind: Amnesty supported Greenpeace in strengthening the human rights arguments of the petition and our Secretary General testified at the hearings. Although the findings and recommendations will not be binding, if positive, they could lead to tougher regulations, could intensify public pressure on the companies to move away from fossil fuels and could become a foundation for lawsuits around the world.
Since the early 2010s, the divestment movement has been exponentially growing. It started with students-led campaigns in US universities to divest the universities’ endowments from coal and has since then grown into a well-known social movement and an important strand of the climate justice movement. The Divest/Invest movement also targets public and private institutions, including banks and insurers, to stop investing in the fossil fuel industry and increase investment in clean energy.

The CSO coalition calls on all states, including Canada, to cease the sale or transfer of weapons to any government where there is risk that those weapons might be used in the conflict in Yemen. This conflict continues deteriorate, including ongoing attacks against the civilian population and grave violations of the rights of children.
In spite of this, and in spite of the fact that Canada has deposited its instrument of accession to the Arms Trade Treaty, Canada exported 127 Armoured Combat Vehicles to Saudi Arabia in 2018 alone. Meanwhile, the United Kingdom recently declared weapons exports to Saudi Arabia unlawful, and there have been repeated votes in the United States Congress in favor of banning arms transfers to that country. Denmark, Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Greece and Austria have taken measures to end or suspend transfers to Saudi Arabia.
The CSO coalition calls on the Government of Canada to complete its review of exports to Saudi Arabia and communicate the outcome of that review without delay. Canadians, the international community, and the people of Yemen deserve clear answers with respect to Canada’s position on these military exports.

Starting on Aug. 1, the delegation will follow the salmon’s migratory route from the Pacific Ocean, up the Fraser River and to Quesnel Lake, known as an ‘incubator’ for returning salmon. They’ll make several stops along the way, taking photos of the “solidarity salmon” messages and those travelling with the caravan.  
“These solidarity messages show that Canadians have been watching the devastating aftermath of the Mount Polley Mine disaster – which is still ongoing,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “We at Amnesty International are also throwing our support behind Indigenous peoples and those living near Quesnel Lake who have been harmed by the contamination stemming from the mining disaster.”  
On Aug. 4, 2014, a portion of the Mount Polley copper mine tailings pond collapsed, releasing 25 million cubic metres of mine wastewater into the pristine Quesnel Lake. Although it has been named the worst environmental mining disaster in Canadian history, no charges have been laid, despite recommendations by two independent United Nations bodies to do so. Furthermore, Imperial Metals, the company responsible for the mine, continues to pump mine wastewater into Quesnel Lake and has applied for a permit keep doing so in perpetuity.  
“The government’s failure to lay charges for the Mount Polley mine disaster sends a bad message to other mining companies that they can pollute BC waterways and get away with it,” said Tara Scurr, Business and Human Rights campaigner. “The people living near and downstream of Quesnel Lake deserve better. At the minimum, they are calling on the province to revoke the company’s permit to discharge waste water into Quesnel Lake. Ultimately, we would all like to see charges laid and accountability for this disaster.” 
The Caravan is due to arrive at Quesnel Lake on Aug. 4 to join in a commemoration of the 5th anniversary of the disaster, which will be hosted by the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake.

0,Saudi Arabia: Women’s rights reforms must be followed by release of detained activists,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/saudi-arabia-womens-rights-reforms-must-be-followed-release-detained-activists/,"Saudi Arabia must follow up on crucial reforms announced today to address women’s rights by ending its persecution of women’s rights defenders and immediately and unconditionally releasing those who are currently detained for their peaceful activism, said Amnesty International. Saudi Arabian...","Saudi Arabia must follow up on crucial reforms announced today to address women’s rights by ending its persecution of women’s rights defenders and immediately and unconditionally releasing those who are currently detained for their peaceful activism, said Amnesty International.
Saudi Arabian newspapers announced major reforms to several laws easing some of the major restrictions which are imposed on women as part of the country’s repressive male guardianship system. The reforms will allow women the right to obtain a passport that should make it possible for them to travel without the permission of a male guardian. They also give women equal rights to lead household and some family-related matters.
“The reforms announced today are a significant but long overdue step forward for women’s rights. These changes are a clear testament to the tireless campaigning of women’s rights activists who have battled against rampant discrimination in Saudi Arabia for decades,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“These changes are a clear testament to the tireless campaigning of women’s rights activists who have battled against rampant discrimination in Saudi Arabia for decades” – Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International 
Many of these activists are currently detained, on trial or facing travel bans for their peaceful activism. Several women’s rights activists detained during a wave of arrests last year endured torture, sexual abuse and other forms of ill-treatment during the first three months of their detention. They were detained incommunicado with no access to their families or lawyers. 
Several women face charges related to their human rights work, including “promoting women’s rights” and “calling for the end of the male guardianship system.” Three of them, Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Nassima al-Sada, remain behind bars while several others have been temporarily released but remain on trial. 
At least 14 individuals who have supported the women’s rights movement, including male relatives of women human rights defenders, are also currently detained without charge since being arbitrarily arrested since April 2019. 
Those arrested include Salah al-Haidar, the son of human rights activist Aziza Al-Yousef, who was temporarily released but remains on trial after more than a year of a terrible ordeal. Others include Abdullah al-Duhailan, a journalist, novelist and advocate for Palestinian rights and Fahad Abalkhail, who has supported the Women to Drive Campaign. 
“If Saudi Arabia wants to show the world it is truly serious about improving the rights of women, the authorities must drop all charges against the defenders of women’s rights who have been crucial in pushing for these kinds of reforms through their activism.” -Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International 
“If Saudi Arabia wants to show the world it is truly serious about improving the rights of women, the authorities must drop all charges against the defenders of women’s rights who have been crucial in pushing for these kinds of reforms through their activism. They must immediately and unconditionally release all those who are in detention for fighting for these most basic of rights,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
For decades women in Saudi Arabia have been subjected to repressive male guardianship laws that have imposed restrictions on their rights to travel independently, work or study – shackling several aspects of women’s lives to their male relatives. 
The amendments published today will now allow women over the age of 21 to obtain passports, which will significantly ease travel without the permission of a guardian. They also grant women the right to register marriages, divorces, births and deaths and to obtain family records. Women will still require a guardian’s permission to be released from prison or to leave a shelter where they have sought protection from domestic abuse or violence. They are also still required to seek their guardian’s approval to marry.

Peyman Mirzazadeh had been sentenced to two years in prison and 100 lashes after being convicted of “drinking alcohol” and “insulting Islamic sanctities”. The flogging was carried out on 28 July and left him in agonizing pain with a severely swollen back and legs. He is currently on hunger strike in protest at his treatment and sentence.
“It is appalling that Peyman Mirzazadeh was subjected to such an unspeakably cruel punishment. His flogging highlights the inhumanity of a justice system that legalizes brutality. He is a prisoner of conscience detained merely for exercising his freedom of expression and the Iranian authorities must release him immediately and unconditionally,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“There can be no justification for carrying out flogging, which amounts to torture and is therefore a crime under international law. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran is legally obliged to abolish the practice, as well as other forms of corporal punishment such as amputations and blinding.”
According to the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), an Iranian human rights group, Peyman Mirzazadeh had been sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and 80 lashes for “insulting Islamic sanctities” and 20 lashes for “drinking alcohol”. He had also been sentenced to two years in prison in a separate case on charges including collaborating with an opposition group.
He had also been arrested in December 2017, following which he was sentenced to six months in prison for “spreading propaganda against the system” through singing songs in support of opposition groups. He was released in June 2018 after completing this sentence.
He was arrested again in February 2019 and has since been in prison.

The army, which was illegally deployed, used live ammunition to disperse protests in the capital Harare, after delays in the release of the presidential election results by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission.
“The tragedy of the post-election shootings is compounded by the fact that no one in the army suspected to be responsible for the bloodshed has been held to account for these brutal killings. This is despite the fact that the alleged perpetrators have been identified through the media and social media videos and pictures,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“If the Zimbabwean government wants to demonstrate that it is committed to human rights, it needs to ensure that the wheels of justice start turning faster than they have done over the past year.”
After the shooting on 1 August 2018, the Zimbabwe Republic Police confirmed that three people were killed when soldiers fired at demonstrators as they ran away. The number was later confirmed to be six. Some of the injured and dead were shot from the back.
The army also ordered journalists covering the protests to switch off their video recording equipment and cameras.
If there is violence in the context of a protest and the use of force is unavoidable to mitigate against the threat posed by participants or bystanders, law enforcement officials must use only minimum force necessary to contain the situation and must comply with the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.
“Authorities must institute a thorough, effective and impartial investigations into the killings of protesters, some of whom were killed while fleeing, with those found to have acted unlawfully brought to justice through fair trials,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
“Zimbabwean authorities should under no circumstances allow further impunity and cover ups for the killings. If Zimbabwe is to become a human rights respecting society, no one, including the army, should be untouchable for violating human rights.” 
Background 
The violence on 1 August 2018 followed the country’s elections on 30 July 2018. The vote combined presidential, parliamentary and local government elections.
Demonstrators were calling for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to expedite the release of the presidential election results after voting on 30 July.

Anonymous death threats were sprayed last night outside the offices of Amnesty International Israel and ASSAF, an organization working to assist refugees and asylum-seekers in Israel. At the same time, a box containing death threats and a dead mouse was left at the entrance to the Elifelet Children’s Activity Center for refugees.
“These are deplorable and malicious acts targeting civil society organizations carrying out human rights work. The Israeli authorities should take a strong stand by publicly condemning these acts and making clear that attacks against NGOs will not be tolerated,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The Israeli authorities must also take steps to ensure that human rights defenders and civil society organizations more generally are effectively protected and can carry out their work free from threats, intimidation or harassment. All attacks against human rights defenders must be promptly investigated and those responsible brought to justice.”
In recent years, the climate for human rights defenders in both Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories has rapidly deteriorated. Israeli authorities have taken steps to unduly restrict the rights to freedom of expression and association inside Israel, with officials intimidating human rights defenders critical of the government and introducing legislation to silence dissent.

“It’s astonishing that the authorities in Sudan are attempting to deal with the recurring issue of armed officers using lethal force against protesters in this way. Closing schools and preventing children from receiving an education is misguided and unfair – pupils should not be punished because of the actions of an out-of-control paramilitary unit.
“This bloodshed must stop. The Rapid Support Forces must be removed from all law enforcement activities across Sudan, and those responsible for committing the killings – and giving the orders – should be brought to justice.
“The decision to close schools underlines the failure of the Sudanese authorities to contain or direct the Rapid Support Forces, who have time and again used firearms on peaceful protestors across Sudan.”

“By using such vague charges against pro-democracy protesters, the Hong Kong authorities seem intent on sending a chilling warning to anyone considering taking part in future protests.
“While there was violence over the weekend, the definitions of illegal assembly and rioting under Hong Kong law are so broad they fall far short of international standards. It is highly questionable that individuals facing these sweeping charges would have a fair chance of defending themselves at trial.
“With these ambiguous charges combined with the repeated use of excessive force by police and the outright banning of some protests, the authorities are showing a flagrant disregard to the right to peaceful assembly.
“Many people in Hong Kong will today be questioning why charges have been swiftly brought against pro-democracy protesters yet no one involved in the vicious beatings at Yuen Leung station more than a week ago has so far been charged.
“The police were again too slow to respond when fireworks were recklessly thrown from a passing car at pro-democracy protesters in Tin Shui Wai last night.
“The violent scenes during last weekend’s protests, were in part because Hong Kong police chose to inflame a tense situation rather than deescalate it. We urge the police to adopt a less confrontational approach to future demonstrations and instead facilitate the right to peaceful protest.”

Since January, the Nicaraguan journalist Carlos F. Chamorro has been presenting his programme Esta Semana from this Costa Rican television station, because of fears for his life inside Nicaragua, where he has suffered attacks and threats in response to his criticism of Daniel Ortega’s government.
Concerned that the explosion might have been a response to the broadcasting of the Nicaraguan journalist’s programme from Teletica, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International said:
“The possibility that this attack could be related to the work carried out by the Confidencial team and Carlos F. Chamorro at Teletica is deeply concerning. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it would show just how far Daniel Ortega’s government is prepared to go to silence the voices that are courageously informing the world about what is happening in Nicaragua. The Costa Rican government must identify and prosecute the material and intellectual authors of this incident, which is probably an attack on the freedom of expression, and pursue all possible lines of inquiry.”

In the state of Tabasco, state deputies approved a reform that criminalizes public demonstrations. It provides for lengthy prison terms for actions opposing any public or private project or works and for obstructing roads or other means of communication.
“The reform in Tabasco would allow the government and the private sector to impose megaprojects and deprive local people of a voice to oppose them if they are affected. This is a clear violation of the right to freedom of expression. In addition, people wanting to exercise their right to peaceful assembly would be criminalized,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International believes that the restrictions set out in the bill are so broadly framed that people would effectively no longer be able to meet and freely express their views about government-approved projects.
Laws of this kind have been used in Mexico to unduly restrict demonstrations and to criminalize human rights defenders.
Since 2016, the federal government has used this type of offence to criminalize peaceful protesters opposing a Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) project in Cuetzalan in the state of Puebla. The CFE is currently using such criminal charges to try to force the community to accept a public project.
On Friday, 26 July, students and others in the state of Jalisco demonstrating against the announcement of a rise in the cost of public transport reported excessive interference from the authorities, including the misuse of force by police officers. Several protesters were beaten in circumstances where they did not appear to pose a risk to anyone and the gathering was dispersed without any clear justification.
“These actions show the fragile state of human rights in Mexico and the lack of political will on the part of governments to ensure that people can express themselves freely against projects or policies promoted by the authorities,” said Tania Reneaum, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico.

Many of...","The Egyptian authorities must immediately end cruel and inhumane detention conditions and allow regular family visits at al-Aqrab maximum security prison in Tora where approximately 130 detainees have gone on a mass hunger strike for more than six weeks, said Amnesty International today. Many of those on strike were arrested more than two years ago and have not been allowed a single visit from their families or lawyers.
In response to the hunger strike, which began on 17 June, authorities have retaliated against the detainees by beating them, applying electric shocks with tasers and punished some of them with disciplinary measures, in an effort to coerce them to end their strike, according to a statement issued by detainees from prison. At least 10 hunger-strikers were blindfolded and transferred to special cells which they are not allowed to exit all day. 
“The Egyptian authorities have pushed scores of detainees at al-Aqrab to breaking point. The combination of squalid and inhumane detention conditions and the denial of family visits and access to their lawyers – in some cases for over two years – has created an unbearable situation for detainees,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“By refusing to allow detainees to see their families, the Egyptian authorities are flagrantly flouting both Egyptian and international law and displaying callous cruelty. Instead of prolonging their suffering, the Egyptian authorities should immediately end this practice and allow family visits for inmates at al-Aqrab.”
Barred from receiving family visits
According to court documents reviewed by Amnesty International, before their referral to trial, the majority of those on hunger-strike were subjected to enforced disappearances for periods ranging from 11 to 155 days, before the authorities acknowledged their detention and brought them before the Supreme State Security Prosecution, a special branch of the prosecution which has jurisdiction over terrorism-related crimes. Many also said they suffered torture and other ill-treatment at the hands of National Security Agency (NSA) officers.
Amnesty International interviewed four family members of people participating in the hunger strike who said that at this point they were only able to catch sight of their loved ones for a few minutes when transported in police cars on their way to and from the prosecution building in New Cairo for questioning. After the detainees’ referral to trial, they could only see them from behind glass cages in the courtrooms during the hearings and could only communicate with them using hand signals.
Family members also described how police and court security officials physically assaulted them and hurled insults at them, and sometimes denied them entry to the courtroom or refused to bring detainees causing the judge to postpone the hearing.
Two said that even when they managed to receive authorization from the Supreme State Security Prosecution to visit their detained family members, the prison authorities always refused to allow the visit to go ahead. In one incident in February 2017, a police officer at al-Aqrab prison ripped up the written document authorizing the family member’s visit.
International standards require that detainees be allowed regular contact with their family members and prohibit the use of preventing family visits as a disciplinary measure.
Several detainees had previously gone on hunger strikes in October 2017 and February 2018 and ended their protest on the basis of assurances that they would be allowed family visits, but these promises were never fulfilled.
Dire prison conditions
The detainees are held in overcrowded cells infested with mosquitos, flies and other insects which, without fans or proper ventilation, reach temperatures of over 40 degrees Celsius in the summer. Prison authorities also deny detainees adequate health care, do not allow them to receive food or drinks from their families outside prison and have placed restrictions on clothes and medicine.
The Egyptian authorities must effectively investigate the allegations of torture or other ill-treatment of detainees on hunger strike and bring those suspected of responsibility to justice, in accordance with international fair trial standards.
The authorities must also allow independent observers to visit Al-Aqrab prison, in order to ensure that the conditions of detention are up to international standards.
“There can be no justification for the cruel and inhumane treatment these detainees have endured. The Egyptian authorities must urgently ensure that all individuals in their custody receive adequate health care, food, and are held in sanitary conditions in properly ventilated cells in accordance with international law.,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“The numerous allegations of the torture and other ill-treatment of hunger strikers must be investigated, and officials suspected of responsibility must be brought to justice.”

On June 20, World Refugee Day, TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer published an op-ed urging businesses to help address the global refugee crisis and pledging to donate millions of dollars to humanitarian organisations “to support and help refugees rebuild their lives and reclaim their futures”. 
This is, of course, a commendable initiative, if only it did not contradict in spirit other practices of the company. While TripAdvisor has decided to help refugees in certain parts of the world, elsewhere – namely in the occupied Palestinian territories – it is contributing to the suffering of the local population, which itself is the source of one of the world’s largest refugee communities. 
Over the past seven decades, Israel’s ruthless policies of land confiscation, illegal settlement and dispossession, coupled with rampant discrimination, have inflicted immense misery among the Palestinians, depriving them of their basic rights. TripAdvisor has also played a role in this ongoing abuse. 
In January 2019, Amnesty International released a report called Destination Occupation which exposed how the world’s leading digital tourism companies – Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor – contribute to and profit from the maintenance, development and expansion of illegal Israeli settlements. Such activities amount to war crimes under international law.  
TripAdvisor is the second-most visited website (after Google) by foreign tourists arriving in Israel, with over a quarter (more than 800,000 people) saying that they consulted the site for attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels or rental apartments before arrival.  
In our campaigning, we have asked Kaufer to stop listing or promoting properties, activities and attractions located in illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. TripAdvisor responded by claiming that “[t]he listing of a property or business on TripAdvisor does not represent our endorsement of that establishment”. Yet the company does make a profit from listings including those in illegal Israeli settlements. 
TripAdvisor and other businesses try to defend their position by claiming that the issue of illegal Israeli settlements is too political, so they cannot take a stance on it. We understand that businesses don’t have the mandate to resolve political questions, but they do have a responsibility to ensure that they do not cause harm or contribute to human rights abuses. 
The human rights impact of tourism and other business operations in Palestine is perhaps difficult for the reader to envision, but it is very real for the people living under Israeli occupation. For example, we found that TripAdvisor has prominently featured, and acted as a booking agent for the City of David, a popular tourist attraction located in Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem. The site is managed by an organisation called the Elad Foundation, which is backed by the Israeli government and works to help Israeli settlers move into the area.   
Silwan is home to about 33,000 Palestinians. Several hundred settlers now live there, as well in heavily protected settlement compounds. Israel has been moving its citizens into the neighbourhood since the 1980s. This has resulted in numerous human rights violations, including the forced eviction and displacement of Palestinian residents. 
In the past 10 years, at least 233 Palestinians have been displaced from Silwan. Most recently, on July 10, Israeli police and security forces evicted a Palestinian family of five, including four children, from their home in the neighbourhood. 
By actively encouraging users to visit the City of David and take guided tours of the site, TripAdvisor has boosted Elad’s business and profited from every booking made through its site. 
If TripAdvisor had conducted even a basic risk assessment of its business activity in or with Israeli settlements, it would have found that such listings are contributing to sustaining an illegal situation that is inherently discriminatory and abusive of the human rights of Palestinians. It is astonishing that a multibillion-dollar company (which claims to be the world’s most visited travel site, with more than 450 million unique visitors a month) has either not done such due diligence on its operations in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, or has done so but decided to continue its activities regardless. 
Other digital tourism companies have also sent mixed messages on human rights. In April 2019, Airbnb announced that it would be reversing a previous decision to remove listings in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank following a class-action lawsuit by Israeli lawyers. The company stated that it would donate the profits from these listings to “non-profit organizations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world”. 
Airbnb, like TripAdvisor, cannot continue to ignore its business with illegal Israeli settlements which goes against basic tenants of international human rights law, while trying to demonstrate concern for people in need through a corporate responsibility programme. 
No amount of donations will erase the wrong they are doing in the occupied Palestinian territories and indeed, no amount of short-term profit should be worth contributing to war crimes.

The human rights impact of tourism and other business operations in Palestine is perhaps difficult for the reader to envision, but it is very real for the people living under Israeli occupation. For example, we found that TripAdvisor has prominently featured, and acted as a booking agent for the City of David, a popular tourist attraction located in Silwan, a Palestinian neighbourhood in occupied East Jerusalem. The site is managed by an organisation called the Elad Foundation, which is backed by the Israeli government and works to help Israeli settlers move into the area.   
Silwan is home to about 33,000 Palestinians. Several hundred settlers now live there, as well in heavily protected settlement compounds. Israel has been moving its citizens into the neighbourhood since the 1980s. This has resulted in numerous human rights violations, including the forced eviction and displacement of Palestinian residents. 
In the past 10 years, at least 233 Palestinians have been displaced from Silwan. Most recently, on July 10, Israeli police and security forces evicted a Palestinian family of five, including four children, from their home in the neighbourhood. 
By actively encouraging users to visit the City of David and take guided tours of the site, TripAdvisor has boosted Elad’s business and profited from every booking made through its site. 
If TripAdvisor had conducted even a basic risk assessment of its business activity in or with Israeli settlements, it would have found that such listings are contributing to sustaining an illegal situation that is inherently discriminatory and abusive of the human rights of Palestinians. It is astonishing that a multibillion-dollar company (which claims to be the world’s most visited travel site, with more than 450 million unique visitors a month) has either not done such due diligence on its operations in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, or has done so but decided to continue its activities regardless. 
Other digital tourism companies have also sent mixed messages on human rights. In April 2019, Airbnb announced that it would be reversing a previous decision to remove listings in illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank following a class-action lawsuit by Israeli lawyers. The company stated that it would donate the profits from these listings to “non-profit organizations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world”. 
Airbnb, like TripAdvisor, cannot continue to ignore its business with illegal Israeli settlements which goes against basic tenants of international human rights law, while trying to demonstrate concern for people in need through a corporate responsibility programme. 
No amount of donations will erase the wrong they are doing in the occupied Palestinian territories and indeed, no amount of short-term profit should be worth contributing to war crimes.

“We have received no reports about large scale releases – in fact, families and friends of people who are being detained tell us they are still not able to contact them.
“Given China’s record of heavy censorship, outright falsehoods and systematic obfuscation about the situation in Xinjiang, it remains imperative that UN human rights investigators, independent observers and the media be given unrestricted access to the region as a matter of urgency.”

“On behalf of Amnesty International, I would like to express our sincere disappointment with this latest outcome in Hassan Diab’s long and arduous journey in seeking answers and justice for the human rights abuses that he has faced. Unfortunately, the report of former Ontario Deputy Attorney General Murray Segal does not provide meaningful answers to the key questions that would allow Canada to ensure that such a travesty of justice is never reproduced.
 Mr. Segal’s review determined that the government lawyers who handled Dr. Diab’s case fully complied with the applicable law, practices and procedures. That conclusion – that following Canadian laws, practices and procedures led readily and inevitably to serious human rights violations – should deeply worry all Canadians. It demonstrates that the chosen External Review was the wrong process, tasked with the wrong terms of reference. It is important to note that the concluding recommendations of Mr. Segal are not focussed on ensuring that human rights abuses are avoided in the future. Instead, they envision minor adjustments which could streamline the extradition process. They do not provide meaningful insight into the legal and policy reform agenda that would ensure that Canada does not violate the human rights of its citizens and others in accordance with an extradition request in the future. Despite the ten-month long External Review, this key question remains completely unanswered.
Due to the limited nature of Mr. Segal’s mandate, there are many questions about Dr. Diab’s extradition and subsequent treatment in France that remain unaddressed. Key information from Global Affairs Canada about the provision of consular services was not available to Mr. Segal due to privacy concerns, and Mr. Segal was not tasked with examining how this case was handled from a consular perspective. The limited comments of Mr. Segal with respect to Dr. Diab’s access to consular assistance are nevertheless worrying. The Canadian government’s frequent assertions that: 1) the French legal system was reliable, 2) Canadian intervention with respect to proceedings in France would be improper, and 3) that it is not the role of Canadian officials to monitor the fairness of a trial against a Canadian citizen in a foreign jurisdiction, must be fully assessed. As a result, Amnesty International continues to call for a full and public inquiry into these events, with a broad mandate and full judicial powers, so that the relevant lessons can be learned with the benefit of a full record.
Amnesty International deeply regrets that the Segal Report leaves Dr. Diab, his family, and all Canadians with no clearer understanding as to how and why it was possible for a Canadian citizen, who mounted a full and robust defence throughout lengthy extradition proceedings, to be surrendered to France on the basis of weak and unreliable evidence, and then to languish in detention in France, almost entirely in solitary confinement, without charge or trial for more than three years.  
Mr. Segal’s report cannot be considered the final word with respect to Dr. Diab’s extradition. We further regret that the lengthy two-month delay and release of this report at the end of July, means that serious human rights issues related to what is – and what is not – included in the report are unlikely to receive the degree of parliamentary and public scrutiny required because of the summer break and upcoming federal election. Nevertheless, we remain hopeful that this report will serve as a call for the Government of Canada to recognize that our extradition law, policy, and relations with extradition partners is in desperate need of review and reform.”

The campaign highlights that despite the current government’s promises to make sure that every child receives a quality education, South Africa’s education system still is failing most school children and perpetuating deep inequalities.
Featuring the smiling image of Hendrik Verwoerd, the original “architect of apartheid”, the campaign encourages the public to “sign the smile off Verwoerd’s face” by demanding that South Africa’s leaders urgently provide all children with the decent quality, basic education that is their birth right as enshrined in the constitution.
“More than two decades after the end of apartheid, South Africa’s education system still mirrors the apartheid years, with many schools serving our poorest communities relying on outdated and poorly maintained infrastructure and a dire lack of teaching resources that provides a wholly inadequate learning space for young people. South Africa is yet to tackle the deeply entrenched legacy of apartheid, left by Hendrick Verwoerd, that continues to result in massive inequalities in the country’s education system,” said Shenilla Mohamed, Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa.
“Our vision is simple. All children have the right to a quality primary and secondary education. Being able to read and do simple maths can be a ticket out of poverty, and a chance to build a better future.”
The campaign highlights how 78% of South Africa’s 10-year-old learners cannot read, and 61% of 11-year-old schoolchildren cannot do basic mathematics. Pupils at 18% per cent of the country’s schools are still forced to use highly dangerous and unsanitary pit latrines, leading to several tragic deaths by drowning in recent years. Currently half of the around 1.2 million learners enrolled in Grade 1 every year drop out by Grade 12. Only 14% of pupils that enter our school system will qualify for university.
Recognising that these problems are entrenched and widespread, Amnesty International emphasised that they are also fixable by any government with the determination and political will to meet its own targets, monitor them rigorously and take the necessary remedial action instead of kicking the can down the road.
“South Africa is obliged under international human rights law to provide all public schools with sufficient resources to enable all children to enjoy their right to a decent education including equipping them with at least basic skills in reading and mathematics. The government must also replace every school pit latrine with safe, clean toilets by 1 January 2021,” said Shenilla Mohamed.
Kumi Naidoo, a South African who joined Amnesty International as its new Secretary General in August 2018, started campaigning for equality, including in education, aged 15 at his school in Durban.
“Our campaign rightly points out that if the man who created apartheid looked back now, he’d be smiling,” said Kumi Naidoo. By coming together now, we can wipe the smile off his face and erase his legacy forever.
“Learning from the past is vital to understanding our present. However, Amnesty International’s ultimate goal with this campaign is firmly focused on the future.”
 
Background
From today, and for the next couple of weeks, smiling images of Hendrik Verwoerd, the original “architect of apartheid”, will be seen around Johannesburg. The campaign urges members of the public who care about the provision of quality education to “sign the smile off Verwoerd’s face” by demanding that South Africa’s leaders urgently provide all children with the decent quality, basic education that is their birth right as enshrined in the constitution. By signing the smile off Verwoerd’s face the public will add their names to a petition that calls on the government to fix the problems in education by 2021.

Traumatized and shocked by the ill-treatment
Detention of Maurice Kamto and some of his supporters reaches sixth month anniversary on Sunday  
Authorities in Cameroon should promptly and independently investigate the severe beatings and ill-treatment that 59 opposition supporters -including six women- were allegedly subjected to during their questioning at the State Secretariat for Defense (SED), Amnesty International said today.
Before releasing them, security forces beat them with sticks and forced them into humiliating positions. Amnesty International also calls for the immediate release of their leader Maurice Kamto and more than 100 other supporters arbitrarily detained six months to the day solely for peaceful participation in protests.
“Like many other unofficial detention centres across Cameroon, the SED has a reputation for torturing detainees. These repressive and brutal tactics to silence dissent must end,” said Marie-Evelyne Petrus Barry, Amnesty International West and Central Africa Director.
“Judicial authorities must investigate the allegations that these 59 opposition members have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment and take concrete measures to bring perpetrators to justice.”
The 59 opposition members were arrested on 1 June during a planned peaceful protest in the capital Yaoundé. Brought to the SED for questioning about the protest, they were tortured and arbitrarily detained by security forces, who also warned them against participating in another protest scheduled a week later.
Amnesty International interviewed several opposition members now released who were victims of torture or other ill-treatment. They detailed techniques including beatings and hard physical exercises, including against women.
A woman who was released on 3 June told the organization:
“When we arrived, gendarmes asked us to do physical exercises, knees and hips bent, arms out for balance…. They passed by and kicked my head and buttocks… Then ordered us to roll around the ground while continuing to kick with their shoes… we were moved up and down the stairs in the duck position. I was then asked to do push-ups with the men until I could not continue. So, I was again beaten with a belt.”
Another ex-detainee described the beating with wooden sticks, cables and batons:
“… We were taken to the SED where gendarmes were waiting for us. Each of them was armed with a wooden stick, a cable and a baton with which we were beaten in the ears and our bodies. They then forced us to walk like a duck in the mud. 53 men and six women were together, some crying, traumatized and shocked. After our release, I spent more than a week at the hospital as I had fractures, bruises and trauma.”
While some of his supporters were released, Maurice Kamto, arrested on 28 January 2019, is still behind bars six months later.
An 11 July 2019 military court decision said it has jurisdiction to judge them and confirmed charges of rebellion, hostility against the homeland, incitement to insurrection, offence against the president of the republic, and destruction of public buildings and goods against Maurice Kamto and 107 other people. The same decision dropped all charges against 61 other supporters and ordered their release. Under international law, military courts should not have jurisdiction over civilians.
In January, nearly 300 MRC supporters were arbitrarily arrested along with Kamto. Mass arrests also took place on 1 and 8 June. In Douala, where more than 200 protesters were arbitrarily arrested, 30 of them are currently in administrative custody waiting to appear before an ordinary court.
“By confirming these opposition members are to be tried before a military court, the Cameroonian authorities are failing to respect international law. Kamto and his supporters risk an unfair trial and the deeply disturbing possibility of facing the death penalty,” said Marie-Evelyne Petrus Barry.
“Maurice Kamto and all his supporters should have never been arrested in the first place. Authorities should immediately release them and drop all charges against them.”

Where:  135-B Press Conference Room in West Block on Parliament Hill, Ottawa
When:  Friday July 26, 2019, 3:00 PM
Background
Dr. Hassan Diab is a Canadian citizen and sociology professor who lives in Ottawa. He was extradited from Canada to France in November 2014, even though the Canadian extradition judge, Robert Maranger, described the evidence presented against Diab as “very problematic”, “convoluted”, “illogical”, and “suspect”. However, given the low threshold of evidence in Canada’s Extradition Act, the judge felt compelled to order Diab’s extradition.
Diab spent more than three years in prison in France while the decades-long investigation in his case was ongoing – this despite the fact that Canada’s Extradition Act only authorizes extradition to stand trial, not to continue an investigation.
In January 2018, the French investigating judges dismissed all charges against Diab and ordered his release. They stated that there is consistent evidence that Diab was not in France at the time of the 1980 bombing in Paris that tragically killed four people and injured dozens. They also notably underlined the numerous contradictions and misstatements contained in the anonymous intelligence, and cast serious doubts about its reliability. The investigating judges also stressed that all fingerprint and palm print analysis excluded Diab.
Shortly thereafter, Diab was released from prison in France, and returned to his home and family in Canada. He had spent almost ten years of his life either imprisoned or living under draconian bail conditions, including more than three years in near solitary confinement in a French jail.
In June 2018, CBC News reported that a key fingerprint analysis exonerating Diab was not disclosed to the court in Canada during the extradition proceedings. The court in Canada was told that no such evidence existed, when in fact the fingerprint analysis that excluded Diab was done in early 2008, many months before France requested Diab’s extradition. CBC News also reported that in 2009 a senior lawyer at the Canadian Department of Justice (DOJ) urged the French authorities to obtain new handwriting ‘evidence’ against Diab when the extradition case was about to collapse. In another effort to shore up the case, the DOJ lawyer requested another fingerprint analysis of a police document signed by the suspect as he believed that the evidence would be very powerful in getting Hassan extradited. When the RCMP fingerprint analysis excluded Diab, the DOJ lawyer never disclosed this fact to the court in Canada or to the defense.
Numerous human rights, civil society organisations and labor unions – including Amnesty International Canada, British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Association of University Teachers, The Criminal Lawyers’ Association, the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group (ICLMG), Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) among others – have called on the Canadian government to conduct an independent public inquiry into Diab’s extradition, as well as to undertake a complete review of the Extradition Act so no other Canadian would go through what Hassan Diab and his family had to endure.

“The Saudi authorities continue to claim that they are fighting ‘terrorism’ when this trial, as well as those of other activists, including the 37 men who were executed last April, are clearly politically-motivated and meant to silence independent voices in the country.
“Sheikh al-Awda has been calling for a more inclusive society that would end the marginalization of Saudi Shi’a citizens. For this, he is being punished. In the same way, women and advocates of women’s rights who have called for greater rights, are similarly being punished. What gains are the authorities hoping to achieve by treating their own citizens this way? Instead of moving ahead with this sham trial, they must immediately and unconditionally release Sheikh al-Awda and drop all charges against him.”
 
Background
On 7 September 2017, state security officials arrested Sheikh Salman al-Awda, 61, from his home without a warrant, a few hours after he posted a tweet encouraging the Qatari and Saudi Arabian authorities to end their diplomatic stand-off. In November 2017, men in civilian clothing and balaclavas who were believed to be from the state security directorate searched his house without a warrant, and confiscating electronic devices and books.
He was detained incommunicado and in solitary confinement for the first five months of his detention, with no access to his family or a lawyer, except for one brief phone call a month after his arrest. In January 2018, he was hospitalized as his health was deteriorating. He was only allowed to call his family a month later.
In August 2018, Sheikh Salman al-Awda was brought to trial before the SCC in a secret session, where he was charged on 37 counts, including affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood, and calling for government reforms and “regime change” in the Arab region. In May 2019, he was brought to another trial in a secret session, after which his lawyer informed the family that the Public Prosecutor had sought the death penalty.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

0,71 YEARS OF SUFFOCATION:  STORIES OF PALESTINIAN REFUGEES,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-71-years-suffocation-stories-palestinian-refugees-0/,"Amnesty International marked the 71st anniversary of the Nakba with “70 + Years of Suffocation”,  an online showcase of Palestinian refugees living in the OPT, Lebanon and Jordan who have shared their reality and experiences of being “stateless”. Award winning photographer, Tanya Habjouqa,...","Amnesty International marked the 71st anniversary of the Nakba with “70 + Years of Suffocation”,  an online showcase of Palestinian refugees living in the OPT, Lebanon and Jordan who have shared their reality and experiences of being “stateless”. Award winning photographer, Tanya Habjouqa, has taken pictures that weave a relationship with the interviews, giving the reader visual context.  
For over 50 years, Israel has been confiscating Palestinian land and bulldozing Palestinian homes with complete impunity. These lands are being used to build illegal settlements to house Israeli citizens, while Palestinians become homeless.  
As Israel continues to suffocate the existence of Palestinians by controlling most aspects of their daily and private lives while attempting to present a reality void of its inhumane treatment of Palestinians, it’s more crucial than ever that Palestinians, the oldest and largest refugee group in the world, have platforms to be heard.  
Also known as ‘the catastrophe’, Nakba Day (May 15th) commemorates the displacement of more than 700,000 Palestinians following the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.  
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians living within the territories before 1948 were expelled or forced to flee the territory during the conflict, and are restricted from ever returning to the homes, towns and villages in which they were born.  
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) states that in 1950 they responded to the needs of an estimated 750,000 Palestinian refugees. Today there are 2 million Palestinian refugees living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza) alone. In 2018, the United States announced a $65 million cut in funding for UNWRA, affecting the agency’s ability to provide educational programs and medical and emergency services to Palestinian refugees.  
The UN General Assembly Resolution 194 states that: 
“refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property which, under principles of international law or in equity, should be made good by the Governments or authorities responsible.”  
Yet Israel refuses to comply with this and other resolutions and refugee laws that maintain Palestinians’ right to return to their original homes.  
This blatant disregard for international law has been routine practice for Israel, which continues to exercise restriction of movement, systematic abuse, excessive use of force and arbitrary arrests and detention against the Palestinian refugee population.  
The close proximity of a checkpoint near Aida Refugee Camp in the West Bank has led to continuous confrontations between the Israeli army and Palestinian refugees, who have reported excessive use of force during Israeli army raids in the camp.  
The arbitrary and reckless use of tear gas by the Israeli army is one such example. One paramedic stated that “half of the emergency calls in the Bethlehem district regarding tear gas exposure come from Aida refugee camp.”  
The use of tear gas is so widespread in Aida camp that all parts of society have been affected and, as one refugee stated to Amnesty: “we all have breathing issues”. Amnesty has received testimonies from Palestinian parents, children, seniors, the disabled, paramedics, educators, students and journalists who all expressed the widespread fear and experience with tear gas.  
“70 + Years of Suffocation” highlights the life of Umm Ahmad, a refugee living in Aida camp who was 4 months pregnant when a tear gas canister entered her home. This experience forced her and her children to learn precautionary survival skills. 
“Now my children tell me when the soldiers are here and when they are shooting gas. We put wet towels on the doors and windows to try to protect ourselves, but this is not enough. We need gas masks and first aid training at the very least.”  
The fear of tear gas has paralysed many aspects of Palestinian life, including the right to an education. Israel routinely uses tear gas in schools and in close proximity of schools, forcing educators to train students and staff on escape drills to get the children home under a barrage of tear gas. Students are forced to leave class, miss school and suffer from lack of concentration due to the physical and psychological effects of being tear-gassed.  
During a protest in December, 2017, the Israeli army aimed 130 tear gas canisters at an UNRWA school: 
“We spoke to the UNRWA operations office, asking them to inform the Israeli military of our whereabouts and to make them stop shooting gas at the school… but, instead of stopping, they shot more tear gas canisters at the school. We found about 130 tear gas canisters in the school yard that day.” – Reem Awaineh 
A student, Ibtihaj, explained to Amnesty her inability to focus on her studies: 
“During these last three days [14-16 May 2018], we were meant to break for final exams, so that we could study. But there was tear gas fired at the camp every night. I couldn’t study or focus for two days, and today I couldn’t concentrate on the exams. There is no safe space. There is only fear. I cannot focus, and I cannot study; studying is pointless.” 
Refugees have reported that Israeli forces fire tear gas arbitrarily and have no particular aim: “they hit mosques, schools, homes.” 
Amnesty’s “70+ years of Suffocation” shares the personal stories of these individuals and others.  
Gaza has a population of 1.9 million people, 70% of which are refugees. It is the most densely populated area in the world.  
Gaza has been under a 12-year illegal blockade of land, air and sea. This blockade prevents the movement of goods, food, medical supplies, clean water, electricity and employment and stops Palestinians from entering or leaving Gaza, stifling the economy and health of the entire region.  
In 2017, the UN stated that Gaza was on the verge of being “unliveable”, due to the humanitarian crisis the blockade has created. This month, UN Commissioner General Pierre Krahenuhl stated that there was an “epidemic deterioration of mental-health conditions”.  
On March 30, 2018, between 40,000 – 50,000 Palestinian refugees living in Gaza began “The Great March of Return and Breaking of the Siege”, calling for the lifting of the blockade and the return of the refugees to their original villages, which are now in modern-day Israel.  
Peaceful protests were met with excessive lethal force by the Israeli army. Amnesty reports found that “the Israeli army reinforced its forces – deploying tanks, military vehicles and soldiers, including snipers, along the Gaza/Israel fence – and gave orders to shoot anyone within several hundred metres of the fence.” Soldiers shot at protestors who showed no immediate threat, leaving hundreds dead, and hundreds with severe injuries leading to amputation.  
“70+ years of Suffocation” highlights many of these victims, including children, women, seniors, and the disabled.  
The UN Independent Commission of Inquiry into the protests stated that Israel’s lethal force could amount to war crimes, as occupied people are to be protected.  
Amnesty International calls for Palestinians who fled or were expelled from Israel, the West Bank or Gaza Strip, along with those of their descendants who have maintained genuine links with the area, to be able to exercise their right to return in accordance with UN General Assembly Resolution 194. 
The Israeli authorities must allow Palestinians to return to their original home or lands. If this is not possible – because they no longer exist, have been converted to other uses, or because of a valid competing claim – they should be allowed to return to the vicinity of their original home. 
Palestinians who choose not to exercise their right to return should receive compensation for lost property, in accordance with principles of international law. Those returning should likewise be compensated for any lost property. 
The international community must ensure full and consistent funding to UNRWA to ensure that millions of Palestinian refugees continue to have access to essential services. 
The Lebanese and the Jordanian governments must ensure that Palestinian refugees have the right to an adequate standard of living, with dignified access to health and education services. Also, they should have the right to work and to benefit from adequate work conditions. 
Raise your voice with Amnesty International, and TAKE ACTION on the SEVENTY+ YEARS OF SUFFOCATION microsite, to tell the international community: 
I stand in solidarity with Palestinian refugees, who are still awaiting a just solution to attain their inalienable rights, including their right to return as defined by #UNResolution194. Over 71 years on, it’s time to #EndNakba https://nakba.amnesty.org/en/chapters/west-bank-gaza/

Volunteers with the global human rights organization will also construct a barbed-wire beach scene at PARLIAMENT HILL to draw public attention to the issue.
“Israel’s policy of settling Israeli citizens on stolen Palestinian land in occupied territory is a war crime. By promoting tourism in these illegal settlements, TripAdvisor is contributing to the immense suffering of Palestinians who have been uprooted from their land, had their homes destroyed and their resources plundered for settlement use,”said Andrea Marie Portugal, IOPT coordinator, Amnesty International Canada.
Illegal Israeli settlements have had a devastating impact on the human rights of Palestinians, with tens of thousands of homes demolished and large numbers of Palestinians forcibly displaced to make way for their construction, in flagrant violation of international law, since Israel’s occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 1967.
In January, Amnesty International published Destination: Occupation, an investigation into the way online booking companies are driving tourism to illegal Israeli settlements and contributing to and profiting from their expansion, maintenance, and normalization. It found that TripAdvisor, one of the most visited online tourism websites by foreign visitors to Israel, lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels and rental apartments in settlements across the OPT.
“All companies have a responsibility to respect human rights around the world. War crimes are not a tourist attraction. Amnesty International calls on TripAdvisor to stop listing or promoting properties, activities and attractions located in illegal Israeli settlements or run by settlers in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.,” said Andrea Marie Portugal.

“The United States used to be a leader in providing refuge to those in need, all around the world. We can’t say that anymore. It is beyond shameful and a new low, even for this administration, to even consider accepting no refugees to the U.S. 
“People are in need all over the world – families, children, human beings with unique stories and lives on hold. Zero will never be an acceptable number for any country let alone a country with so many resources and people willing to welcome new neighbors looking to rebuild their lives in peace and safety.
“We call on every member of Congress and their community to speak out for those seeking safety and welcome refugees into their neighborhoods, schools, houses of worship, and homes.” 
Amnesty International USA also calls for the United States to admit at least 95,000 refugees in Fiscal Year 2020.
Background
Every year, the President determines the number of refugees who should be resettled to the U.S. in the upcoming fiscal year,signaling U.S. commitment to protect those fleeing violence, war, and persecution.
The United States is on track to resettle 30,000 refugees this year, the lowest refugee admissions goal in the history of the program. Of the 70 million people displaced around the world, over 1.4 million people are identified as needing access to resettlement. A small fraction of those in need will ever be resettled. The 
Department of Homeland Security has already successfully interviewed nearly 30,000 refugees, with nearly 9,000 more readyfor travel.  
Prior to last year, the yearly refugee admissions goal since 1980 averaged 95,000 persons to be accepted per year.

Two of his relatives – his brother, Kener Murillo López, and his brother-in-law, Javier Cortez – also sustained serious injuries.
According to a police statement, the officers reportedly fired in self-defence. However, information analysed to date suggests that the police were carrying out an unlawful operation during which they used military-grade weapons. According to information received by Amnesty International, the victims, who were unarmed at the time of the shooting, belong to a family that has openly opposed the government of Daniel Ortega in the context of continuing political violence against those who disagree with the government.
“The death of young Bryan Murillo López and the serious injuries sustained by Kener Murillo López and Javier Cortez demonstrate once again the brutality of Daniel Ortega’s government. The circumstances surrounding the operation, as well as the profile of the victims, suggest that it may be a new act of lethal repression of dissent,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“The Nicaraguan authorities, far from giving a plausible explanation, have presented the victims as criminals. We demand a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation into these events and other possible serious violations of human rights, to ensure access to justice for victims and guarantees of non-repetition.”

Manuel de Araújo is the candidate for the main opposition party Mozambique National Resistance’s (RENAMO); he is currently the mayor of Quelimane. The 15 October vote is contentious as it will be the first time that a governor is chosen by the electorate, previously the position was filled by presidential appointment.
“These pre-election intimidation tactics are a terrible reminder of what tends to happen during elections in Mozambique; death threats and intimidation. We have witnessed this grim pattern time and time again as political leaders are harassed and even killed for their critical views,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“Elections should never be deadly, because after all it’s a battle of ideas. Violence has no place.”
Araújo received the latest anonymous letter on 10 July. The letter reminded him that he had been previously warned not to stand for the opposition party. It said he should be careful because he would be killed for standing for election. The letter was sent to his office and later printed and posted in local markets. It was also circulated on social media.
Prior to the October 2018 municipal elections – in which Araújo won the position of Mayor of Queliminane – he also received several intimidating and anonymous messages discouraging him from running. Araújo has consistently spoken out against corruption at the provincial and national level, making him a target of political attacks. On 27 September 2016, during the previous administration, a member of the ruling Frente de Libertação de Moçambique (FRELIMO) party in the municipal assembly of Quelimane threatened him during a session, saying that “the mayor deserves a bullet in his head”.
 
Politics – a dangerous game in Mozambique
Araújo is not the first leader within the main opposition RENAMO party to receive death threats this year. In May, Paulo Vahanle, the mayor of Nampula, also received a message instructing him to leave his position as the mayor, or else he would lose his life. He was told that the position he was occupying had an “owner”.
Paulo himself won a by-election in Nampula in January 2018, held after the murder of the former mayor, Mahamudo Amurane, member of the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM) in October 2017.
 
Timeline of recent political murders and attempted murders
On 4 October 2017, an unidentified gunman assassinated the then Mayor of Nampula City, Mahamudo Amurane, at his home. Since his election as Mayor of Nampula in 2013, Mahamudo Amurane had embarked on a public quest to root out corruption in the city’s administration and revitalize public infrastructure.
On 8 October 2016, Jeremias Pondeca, a senior RENAMO member and part of the mediation team seeking to end the clashes between his party and the government, was shot dead in Maputo by unknown men, at least some of whom are suspected to be security officers.
On 16 January 2016, Manuel Bissopo, the then Secretary General of RENAMO, was shot and severely wounded by unknown assailants as he travelled in his car in Beira city, in Sofala province. His bodyguard died following the shooting. The incident took place hours after a news conference in which Bissopo had accused state security forces of abducting and killing members of his party.
Amnesty International is very concerned that the continued impunity for such crimes creates an environment of public fear and insecurity in which political opponents are dissuaded from participating in politics.
“Mozambican authorities must launch an independent and effective investigation into the allegations of death threats and intimidation and bring suspected perpetrators to justice,” said Deprose Muchena.
“Beyond that, authorities must guarantee the rights to freedom of association and expression ahead of the country’s general election in October, and beyond. Participation in the country’s politics should not expose anyone to the risk of death.”
 
Background
Mozambicans will vote in presidential and provincial elections scheduled for 15 October 2019. While provincial governors were previously appointed by the president, through a patronage system, it will be the first time that they are directly elected through elections this year.

A ruling by the Jerusalem District Court confirming the authorities’ decision to expel Omar Shakir is an unreasonable and disproportionate restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and association, Amnesty International is arguing in an amicus curia briefing submitted to the Israeli Supreme Court in Jerusalem today. The court is scheduled to hear the case on 25 July 2019.
“The Israeli authorities’ decision to deport Omar Shakir is a crushing blow to freedom of expression in the country and sends an alarming signal to human rights activists and civil society in general of the extent they are willing to go in their attempt to silence those who defend human rights.” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“We hope that the Israeli Supreme Court will uphold the state’s obligations under international human rights law and overturn Omar Shakir’s expulsion order.”
On 7 May 2018, the Israeli Ministry of Interior revoked Omar Shakir’s work permit, citing a 2017 amendment to the Entry to Israel Law that refuses entry to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) to anyone who supports or calls for a boycott of Israel as defined under the 2011 “anti-boycott” law. The Israeli authorities ordered Omar Shakir to leave the country within 14 days.
“Calling on companies to respect international law and abide by the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, as Human Rights Watch and Omar Shakir have been doing, is protected by the right to freedom of expression under international human rights law. The authorities’ move to penalize him for his human rights work is an act you expect only from oppressive governments”. said Saleh Higazi
Human Rights Watch challenged the Ministry of Interior’s decision in the Jerusalem District Court, which froze the deportation order for the duration of the case.
However, on 16 April 2019, the Jerusalem District Court upheld the deportation order and gave Omar Shakir until 1 May 2019 to leave the country. Omar Shakir and Human Rights Watch appealed the decision to Israel’s Supreme Court and also made a request that the court issue an injunction to allow him to remain in Israel until the appeal is heard, which was accepted.
“Omar Shakir and Human Rights Watch’s public calls on businesses to respect international law are part of their peaceful human rights work.” said Saleh Higazi
The Israeli Supreme Court is expected to make a ruling on Human Rights Watch’s appeal at the end of the hearing on 25 July 2019.
Background
The “anti-boycott law” of 2011, formally known as the Law for Prevention of Damage to State of Israel through Boycott, makes it a civil wrong to call for a boycott of any entity because of its affiliation to Israel or to a territory under its control, including entities operating in illegal settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. A 2017 amendment to the Entry to Israel Law prohibits granting an entry visa to Israel (and therefore to the Occupied Palestinian Territories which are under Israeli control) to anyone who knowingly published, or operates within an organization who knowingly published, a call for a boycott as defined under the 2011 law.
Both the Law for Prevention of Damage to State of Israel through Boycott of 2011 and the 2017 amendment to the Entry to Israel Law contravene Israel’s obligations under international human rights law.
Amnesty International does not take a view on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign and has never called for or endorsed specific boycotts. It is up to individuals and organizations to determine which peaceful strategies to use in furtherance of human rights. Advocating for boycotts, divestment and sanctions is a form of free expression that must be protected. Advocates of boycotts should be allowed to express their views freely and take forward their campaigns without harassment, threats of prosecution or criminalization, or other measures that violate the right to freedom of expression.

The new rule makes it unambiguously clear that the US refugee protection system in no way adequately guarantees the rights of those seeking to make claims in that country.
Under the STCA, refugees who present themselves at a Canada-US border post seeking to make a refugee claim in Canada are, with limited exceptions, denied access to the Canadian refugee system and immediately returned to the United States. It does not apply to individuals who cross irregularly into Canada, other than at a border post, and subsequently make a refugee claim inside Canada. Therefore, a person who claims refugee protection at a Canada-US border post would be sent back to the US to make their claim, even if the new US rule means that they would be ineligible for protection there.
“With the implementation of this policy, there is no single basis upon which the STCA can, in any way, be defended,” said Justin Mohammed, Amnesty International Canada’s Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner. “The US is choosing to implement a measure that constitutes an automatic bar to refugee protection for a wide-sweeping category of claimants. The operation of the STCA would prevent those very same claimants from obtaining protection in Canada and therefore must be suspended, or otherwise risk complicity in US violations of international refugee and human rights law.”
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has declared that the new rule “excessively curtails the right to apply for asylum, jeopardizes the right to protection from refoulement, significantly raises the burden of proof on asylum seekers beyond the international legal standard, sharply curtails basic rights and freedoms of those who manage to meet it, and is not in line with international obligations.”
Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, said the following: “the Canadian Government has long relied on the UNHCR’s monitoring and assessment of the US refugee protection system to defend the STCA. Now the UNHCR itself has stated, in unequivocal terms, that this latest measure is contrary to the US’ international legal obligations. That includes, but is not limited to, the right to protection against refoulement to torture. Thus, it is incumbent on Canada to act accordingly and suspend the STCA without delay. It would be unconscionable to fail take that step given this latest development.”

“It is a relief that this ordeal for Şebnem Korur Fincancı, Erol Önderoğlu and Ahmet Nesin is finally over. After almost three years of a baseless prosecution, these three human rights defenders, who stood up for press freedom by expressing solidarity with persecuted journalists, have finally been acquitted.
“It was clear from the start that this case should never have seen the light of day. The absurd charges levelled against them, and scores of others who also took part in the solidarity campaign, were clearly intended to silence and intimidate rights defenders, journalists, and wider civil society in Turkey.
“Whilst we celebrate their acquittal, others who also expressed solidarity with the Özgür Gündem newspaper, were convicted and some have even served their sentences. The authorities must immediately drop the cases against everyone who has been charged and end the judicial harassment of human rights defenders in Turkey.”

BACKGROUND
Erol Önderoğlu (Reporters Without Borders representative in Turkey and International Press Institute member), Şebnem Korur Fincancı (Chair of  Human Rights Foundation of Turkey) and writer Ahmet Nesin were detained in 2016 after symbolically guest editing a publication for a day as part of a solidarity campaign for the now shuttered Özgür Gündem newspaper.
In all, of the 56 people who took part in the solidarity campaign, 49 were subjected to criminal proceedings. Of those, 38 people were eventually prosecuted for their participation in the solidarity campaign for one day as symbolic editors of the Özgür Gündem newspaper.
Of the 31 people whose trials have concluded, four were acquitted, with 27 receiving a total of over 24 years in prison and 67,000 TL (approximately 10,500 Euros) in fines. The sentences of two of the convicted guest editors, rights defender Murat Çelikkan and writer and journalist Ayşe Düzkan, were not suspended and they were imprisoned for two and five months respectively. They were then released on bail with judicial controls for the remainder of their senten

“As President of the United States, Trump has demonized minority groups, whipped up hatred, fear and sowed division. Trump’s ugly targeting of these Congresswomen exposes the racism and xenophobia at the heart of his despicable policies – from imposing a travel ban on people travelling from Muslim majority countries to separating children from their parents at the Mexican border to denying the rights of people seeking asylum. His words prove that xenophobia, rather than the safety of the people of the United States, motivates these policies.
“President Trump must stop normalizing racism, sexism, transphobia, cruelty and hate. He must start seeing all people, not just a favoured few, as humans; not scapegoats or targets for ridicule. He must honour the US’ commitments to the world’s most vulnerable, including people fleeing horrific violence and persecution, and protect the human rights of all.”    
Background
In a series of tweets on 14 July, President Trump said of the four Congresswomen: “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how … it is done.”
Trump did not identify the lawmakers by name in his 14 July tweets, but it was widely understood that he was referring to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
On 15 July, Trump renewed his attack on AOC, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is popularly known, and the other lawmakers, accusing them of being “anti-America” and having policies that would “destroy our Country!”.

The organization has identified a pattern of at least six such cases since April 2019. In one of them, a young women’s rights defender was subjected to enforced disappearance from 2 to 13 July.
“Threatened by the momentum behind a growing women’s rights movement against Iran’s forced veiling laws, the Iranian authorities are employing crude tactics to discredit activists campaigning against forced veiling, dissuade others from joining the movement and instil fear in society,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“These women should not even be detained in the first place. It is outrageous that they are now being tortured or otherwise ill-treated to compel their participation in state propaganda videos in which they ‘confess’ their ‘guilt’ and renounce the anti-forced veiling campaign. The authorities should release them immediately and unconditionally, drop all the charges against them and refrain from broadcasting their forced ‘confessions’ on state media outlets.”
Intelligence and security officials orchestrating the production of the propaganda videos are ordering the women’s rights defenders to retract their opposition to forced veiling, denounce the White Wednesdays campaign against compulsory veiling laws and express “regret” for allowing themselves to be “incited” by “anti-revolutionary opposition agents” outside the country.
The most recent case documented is that of women’s rights defender Saba Kordafshari, aged 22, who was arrested on 1 June. According to her mother, Raheleh Ahmadi, following her arrest, Saba Kordafshari was held in prolonged solitary confinement in Vozara detention centre in Tehran until 11 June when she was transferred to Shahr-e Ray prison. During her time in solitary confinement she was put under constant pressure to appear before a camera and denounce the White Wednesdays campaign. The interrogators conditioned her release on giving forced “confessions” and threatened to arrest her mother if she did not “co-operate”. On 10 July, the authorities carried out their threat and arrested Raheleh Ahmadi.
On 2 July, the authorities transferred Saba Kordafshari to another location and concealed her fate and whereabouts from her family until they returned her to Shahr-e Rey prison on 13 July, so subjecting her to enforced disappearance for 12 days. She subsequently informed her family that she had been held in section 2-A of Evin prison, which is under the control of the Revolutionary Guards, and put under renewed pressure to give forced “confessions”.
In another case, women’s rights defender Yasaman Aryani, aged 24, was arrested by security forces on 10 April at her home in Tehran. Her mother, Monireh Arabshahi, was arrested the next day after enquiring about her daughter’s whereabouts at the Vozara detention centre in Tehran.
Amnesty International has since learned that, while held in solitary confinement for nine days, members of the security forces threatened Yasaman Aryani with, among other things, the arrest of her younger sibling and father unless she appeared before a camera expressing “repentance” for sending videos to the White Wednesdays campaign. She was also taunted with claims that her case had been forgotten by the outside world.
On 18 April, Yasaman Aryani and Monireh Arabshahi were removed from the Vozara detention centre, put into a van and driven to an unidentified location in Tehran, without being given an explanation. As soon as they were taken out of the van, they were confronted with camera crews from the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) corporation, who filmed them without their consent. They were then taken to a room to be “interviewed” by the IRIB and, when they objected, were told that they had no choice but to answer the questions.
In March 2019, the authorities also summoned Zarrin Badpa, the elderly mother of Masih Alinejad, a US-based Iranian journalist and founder of the White Wednesdays campaign, for interrogation. She was questioned for two hours about her daughter’s activities while being filmed. Amnesty International is concerned that the authorities may feature statements she gave under duress in future propaganda videos, given their long-standing record of engaging in such abusive practices.
“The Iranian authorities should be under no illusion that the coercive and cruel nature of the video ‘confessions’ extracted from women’s rights defenders and their families will go unnoticed. Any state-controlled bodies involved in the production and broadcasting of these ‘confession’ videos share responsibility for the human rights violations committed against the women and their families,” said Philip Luther.
“By resorting to crude propaganda tactics, the authorities cannot mask the truth that women in Iran are increasingly standing up for their right to choose whether or not to wear a headscarf in public. They must stop treating women’s rights defenders like criminals and abolish forced veiling laws.”
Background
The White Wednesdays campaign is a popular online platform on which women from inside Iran share videos of themselves walking in public without a headscarf and expressing opposition to forced veiling and discussing their hopes for women’s rights.
Amnesty International is aware of at least eight women currently in detention for their activism against forced veiling and the White Wednesdays campaign: Yasaman Aryani and her mother, Monireh Arabshahi; Saba Kordafshari and her mother, Raheleh Ahmadi; Mojgan Keshavarz; Fereshteh Didani; and two other women whose names are not yet known to Amnesty International. They are facing charges including “inciting and facilitating corruption and prostitution”, “spreading propaganda against the system” and “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”.
Under Iran’s compulsory veiling laws, the punishment for women seen in public without a headscarf includes arrest, a prison sentence, flogging or a fine. Forced veiling laws violate a whole host of rights, including the rights to equality, privacy and freedom of expression and belief. The practice of compulsory veiling also degrades women and girls, stripping them of their dignity and self-worth.

This new rule would prevent anyone other than people from Mexico or Canada from seeking asylum in the United States.
In response, Amnesty International USA advocacy director for the Americas Charanya Krishnaswami issued the following statement:
“This rule is an outrageous violation of our obligation to protect families and individuals seeking safety. Once again, the Trump administration has shown the lengths it will go to deny people protection.
“As US State Department reporting makes clear, people cannot access protection in the countries they commonly transit through on the way to the United States. Families and individuals who have fled violence and persecution could be turned away at our doors and left vulnerable to grave harm, all as a result of the administration’s agenda of fear and hate.
“This is nothing short of deliberate cruelty. While the Trump administration argues that this policy upholds the integrity of the asylum system, it actually destroys the institution of asylum as we know it.
“Everyone seeking safety has the right to humane treatment and a fair asylum process, per international and domestic standards. The US government must immediately abandon this ill-advised and illegal policy.”

“While it’s also concerning that we don’t know anything about what these plans will look like, it’s not unreasonable to be concerned that people facing deportation will not have adequate time or legal resources to protect themselves.

European Union foreign ministers gathering in Brussels on 15 July 2019, should issue a clear call to Libyan authorities to close their migrant detention centres, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) said today. The EU ministers should make a commitment on behalf of EU states to facilitate the evacuation of detainees to safe places, including outside of Libya and to EU member states.
“Expressions of outrage over dire conditions and dangers to detainees amid fighting in Tripoli ring hollow without urgent life-saving measures to get people out of harm’s way,” said Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “EU governments should offer concrete support to Libyan authorities to close all migrant detention centres and take immediate action to help evacuate those most vulnerable and at risk.”
Libyan authorities have shown an openness to release people from official detention centres, in the wake of a deadly attack on the Tajoura detention centre earlier in July. The outgoing EU high representative for foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini, said on July 10 that, “Libya’s current system of detaining migrants has to end.” Citing “ghastly conditions” in detention centres, on June 7, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights appealed to Libyan authorities and the international community to ensure that all migrants and asylum seekers detained in centres in Tripoli are “immediately released.”
However, EU governments have never conditioned their support to Libyan authorities on closing the detention centres and releasing the thousands of people unlawfully detained. They have insisted instead that EU-funded humanitarian assistance would lead to improved living conditions in the detention centres, despite lack of evidence that it does. And they have continued to aid the Libyan Coast Guard to return people intercepted at sea to indefinite detention in Libya. In a new statement on July 11, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), called for all funding to be conditional on closure of the centres, with a range of proposals to allow immediate release of detainees.
Already appalling conditions in migrant detention centres under the nominal control of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), based in Tripoli, have deteriorated since forces under General Khalifa Hiftar began their assault on Tripoli in early April. An airstrike on the Tajoura detention centre, located inside a military compound southeast of Tripoli, on the night of July 2, killed 53 people and wounded at least 130. Two detainees of the same facility had been injured in a previous attack on May 7, when an airstrike hit just 100 meters from the centre. On July 9,  UNHCR announced that Libyan authorities had allowed survivors at Tajoura to leave the centre, though it appears that they were not granted adequate assistance upon release, nor an opportunity to leave the country to reach safety elsewhere if they so wished. In late April, armed men had attacked detainees in the Qasr Ben Geshir detention centre, about 24 kilometres south of Tripoli. Responsibility for both attacks remains unclear and should be established through credible and independent investigations.
In other centres in and around Tripoli, the fighting has interrupted food and water supplies and worsened sanitary conditions, as well as limited access to detainees by humanitarian organizations and UN agencies providing vital care. As of the beginning of July, UNHCR has transferred 1,630 people out of detention centres on the front lines to its Gathering and Departure facility, also in Tripoli, but also to other Libyan detention centres in areas deemed safer. UNHCR estimates that 3,800 people are detained in migrant detention centres near conflict areas, while the total detainee population is estimated at 5,800 as of June 21. Under Libyan law, any undocumented migrant, asylum seeker, or refugee may be detained without an opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of the detention, making the detention arbitrary.
All people arbitrarily detained in GNA facilities should be released from detention and those centres closed, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and ECRE said. Given the risks facing foreigners in Libya, the GNA should work with international agencies and the EU to provide immediate humanitarian assistance to released detainees and establish humanitarian corridors to safety.
EU member states should ensure that those evacuated from detention centres are offered safe routes and regular pathways out of Libya, including by increasing resettlement pledges and expediting processes to allow UNHCR to ramp up evacuations to its transit centre in Niger or directly to EU member states. Since the beginning of April, UNHCR has been able to evacuate only 289 people to Niger and 295 to Italy – the only EU country that has agreed so far to take asylum seekers directly from Libya. Non-EU countries should also support evacuation efforts and pledge resettlement.
“The horrific attack on the Tajoura detention centre last week has once more showed the mortal danger that women, men and children locked up in Libya are exposed to,” said Matteo de Bellis, researcher on migration and asylum at Amnesty International. “Rather than keeping their eyes closed in the face of the inhuman conditions, torture, rape and other abuse refugees and migrants face in Libya’s detention centres, EU governments should urgently set up safe routes out of Libya for them, and ensure that people rescued in the central Mediterranean are not returned to Libya.”
Outsourcing of migration controls to Libyan authorities by EU institutions and member states, and the EU’s collective abdication of responsibility for rescue at sea have contributed to the dire situation, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and ECRE said. According to IOM, by July 6, the EU-supported Libyan Coast Guard had intercepted and taken back to Libya 3,750 people since the beginning of the year. In that same period, 4,068 people had reached Italy and Malta, while 426 people died in the central Mediterranean.
With an estimated total of 667 dead across the Mediterranean in the first six months of 2019, UNHCR calculates that one out of every six persons died in the attempt to reach Europe, compared with one in 18 in the same period last year.
Despite broad international consensus that Libya cannot be considered a safe place for returns, many EU governments and institutions have supported a policy of enabling Libyan authorities to assert control over a vast search-and-rescue area, pulling European forces out of the central Mediterranean and engaging in or tacitly supporting efforts to obstruct or criminalize nongovernmental rescue organizations that have sought to take responsibility for rescue in the absence of an effective state response.
This policy puts any shipmasters rescuing people in the Mediterranean in an untenable situation, as they are directly or indirectly encouraged by European governments to disembark people in Libya even though that clearly constitutes a breach of international law.
Negotiations among EU member states to address this issue through an agreement to share responsibility for disembarking and relocating people rescued at sea  have floundered, leading to ad hoc agreements to resolve stand-offs with nongovernmental rescue ships, and even coastguard and merchant vessels, amid Italy’s increasingly harsh “closed ports” policy.
In March, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International published a Plan of Action for a fair and predictable rescue system in the Mediterranean. The plan, which draws on recommendations by the European Council of Exiles and Refugees (ECRE), proposes a temporary system to ensure that people rescued at sea are promptly disembarked in keeping with international law as well as an equitable system of shared responsibilities through relocation.
“With international and EU agencies, cities and civil society ready to provide operational support, an agreement among European states is urgently needed, and feasible,” said Catherine Woollard, Secretary General of ECRE. “The European Commission and the Finnish EU Presidency should focus on facilitating the agreement – not on peddling false solutions involving North African countries. The IOM, UNHCR, African Union and the shipping industry can all use their leverage to get European states on board. Taking the steps outlined would contribute to saving lives and improving the situation in Libya.”

The statement calls on China to provide “meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent international observers, including for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights”.
The record number of states standing up to China at the Council on their human rights record shows the mounting international concern over the mass detention of Uyghurs and members of other minority groups in Xinjiang.
The countries that signed the statement include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.
In the face of China’s continued failure to engage credibly with the allegations, Amnesty International and others have been calling on the Council to launch an investigation into the situation in Xinjiang. By issuing this statement, these 22 countries have made clear that they will not continue to look the other way.
Amnesty International welcomes this statement and reiterates its own call for China to provide independent human rights monitors immediate and unfettered access to Xinjiang. If China fails to respond positively to this request, the Council should take more robust action at future sessions.

The unanimous decision to resign is due to the erosion of civil society and labour unions’ trust and confidence in the government’s commitment to international corporate accountability.
The resigning Advisory Body members and alternate members represented: Above Ground; Amnesty International Canada; L’Association québécoise des organismes de coopération internationale; Canadian Council for International Cooperation; Canadian Labour Congress; Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability; Development and Peace-Caritas Canada; Inter Pares; Mining Watch Canada; United Steelworkers Union and World Vision Canada.
In January 2018, the government publicly announced the creation of a Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) and committed to entrusting the office with the necessary tools to conduct credible independent investigations, including the power to compel documents and summon witnesses. This announcement was endorsed by civil society and labour groups, who promoted the CORE to their national and international partners. The government’s decision to backtrack on its promise in April 2019, and instead appoint a special advisor to the Minister of International Trade Diversification without needed investigatory powers, has amounted to a betrayal of civil society and labour unions’ trust, erosion of our confidence and concerns that the government has not acted in good faith during consultations on this topic.
The creation of the promised independent ombudsperson office has faced repeated delays, over multiple years. Organizations have continued to wait for further developments over the past three months, since the April 8, 2019 announcement of an independent legal review on the CORE’s investigatory powers. Minister Carr indicated on that day that the review would be completed within 4 to 5 weeks, and made public shortly thereafter. Three months later, the study has not been made public, the CORE remains without meaningful powers to serve impacted communities and workers. Civil society believes the government will not provide the promised investigatory powers before the upcoming federal election.
The government may commit to passing legislation to provide investigatory powers in the future. Civil society instead has called on government to make use of the credible and well-substantiated proposal to grant investigatory powers now, via the Inquiries Act, as a bridge towards legislation in the next government. This has reportedly been determined to be a feasible option by the independent legal review. Civil society views the refusal to take that step now as further evidence that the commitment to take bold action to uphold human rights is no longer a priority.
In this context, the organizations have lost faith in the ability of the Advisory Body to function as originally envisioned and according to its agreed upon terms of reference.
“It was because of assurances that the CORE would have independence and real investigatory powers that we stood alongside the government in January 2018 and we promoted the announcement both nationally and internationally. Because of these commitments, I was pleased to take up the role of vice chair to the Advisory Body,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada. “The government of Canada’s decision to backtrack on those promises, despite ongoing assurances to do so over the past year, has led me to lose confidence. I will no longer be able to continue in this role.”
“Our partners around the world have suffered human rights abuses linked to Canadian companies for far too long,” said Emily Norgang, Senior Researcher, Canadian Labour Congress. “They rejoiced at the government’s 2018 promises, which had been hard-fought and long-awaited. Now they are being told that they need to wait again; that maybe an effective office might be put in place in a few years’ time. This is an unacceptable way to respond to serious human rights abuses.”
“Without independence and investigatory powers, the CORE amounts to nothing more than a broken promise. A powerless CORE won’t serve impacted communities. In fact, it has all the hallmarks of the failed offices it is supposed to be replacing. It is like giving someone a car, but telling them that the gas tank won’t be installed for two years,” said Emily Dwyer, Coordinator, Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. “How can civil society have any faith that law and policy reform discussions at the Advisory Body will be fruitful when the government has bowed to industry pressure and reneged on concrete commitments regarding the ombudsperson?”
Civil society and labour members of the Advisory Body note that the only way that the government can restore trust is by replacing the CORE’s mandate by an order pursuant to the Inquiries Act, as a bridge towards legislation in the next government.
Making use of the Inquiries Act at this time would signal to civil society and impacted communities around the world that this office can be seen as credible and that this government is taking concrete action to advance human rights. The government’s own study will reportedly confirm that the federal government has the legal authority to do so.

“This vote provides hope for thousands of bereaved families in the Philippines, and countless more Filipinos bravely challenging the Duterte administration’s murderous ‘war on drugs’. It’s a crucial step towards justice and accountability.
“The Philippines has failed to hold those responsible to account at home. The Human Rights Council resolution sends a clear message that the international community will not look the other way as extrajudicial executions and other serious violations continue to be committed with impunity.
“We urge the Philippines to cooperate with the UN Human Rights Office leading the investigation and take urgent measures to halt the brutal killings that have become the hallmark of the Duterte administration’s campaign. If they do not, the Council may take further and more robust action. From here on, pressure on the architects of the government’s murderous policies will only grow stronger.”
Background
Today, the UN Human Rights Council voted in favour of a resolution, tabled by Iceland, requesting the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to provide a detailed report on the situation of human rights in the Philippines, and for it to be presented to and discussed by the Human Rights Council at its 44th session.
The resolution passed with 18 votes in favour, 14 against and 15 abstentions.
The resolution follows years of campaigning by national and international civil society groups, including Amnesty International. Just ahead of the vote, Amnesty International released a new report documenting ongoing violations and crimes under international law committed as part of the “war on drugs.”
The list of current Human Rights Council member states – which includes the Philippines – is available here.

We are writing to ask you to join us in speaking out against TripAdvisor’s role in driving human rights violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. 
Amnesty International is the world’s largest human rights organization, with more than seven million supporters and members globally. Through research and campaigning, we help ensure respect for people’s human rights and that those who violate them are held accountable. We also campaign for a world in which companies respect human rights and don’t contribute to, or profit from, human rights violations wherever they operate in the world. 
In January of this year, Amnesty’s report Destination Occupation revealed that TripAdvisor and other online booking companies, are profiting from war crimes by listing tourist attractions and properties in illegal Israeli settlements. Our research found that TripAdvisor lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels and rental apartments in settlements across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israel has built these settlements, in flagrant violation of international law, since its occupation of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 1967. 
The settlements have had a devastating impact on Palestinian communities over the past five decades. To make way for their construction, Israel has demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian homes, forcibly displaced large portions of the population and diverted water and other Palestinian natural resources for settlement use. 
To maintain and expand illegal settlements Israel imposes a system of institutionalized discrimination and human rights violations from which hundreds of thousands of Palestinians suffer on daily basis.By promoting tourism in these illegal settlements, TripAdvisor is boosting their economy, helping them to expand and contributing to the mass suffering they have caused.  
Last year, Amnesty International researchers visited a West Bank village called Khirbet Susiya. For the past 40 years the villagers have been living in makeshift homes and tents after they were forcibly evicted to make room for the expansion of the Israeli settlement of Susya. The settlement is surrounded by vineyards and orchards and has a large swimming pool. By contrast, Israel has refused to connect Palestinian homes to the water and sewage system and electricity networks, making life for them a daily struggle. Villagers also suffer regular harassment from settlers and live in constant fear of their homes being destroyed. 
The settlement – built on stolen Palestinian land – is thriving. This is partly thanks to the tourism industry. TripAdvisor currently provides tourist information on two settlement-run attractions – a vineyard and the archaeological site – both on land that belongs to the Palestinians of Khirbet Susiya. But they will not see a cent of the profits that tourism will bring to the site.This is just one example of how TripAdvisor is boosting settlement economies while driving human rights violations against Palestinians. 
By promoting Israeli settlements as tourist destinations, TripAdvisor is also glossing over their horrifying human rights record and normalizing to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation. As one of the most visited online tourism websites by foreign visitors to Israel, TripAdvisor is hugely influential – it has the power to help stop this injustice. 
As TripAdvisor employees, we believe you too have a real power to make a difference by speaking out and demanding that the company stops listing accommodation and tourist attractions based in Israeli settlements. Last year, Google employees joined Amnesty International in a call to drop a censored search engine in China, Dragonfly. Thanks to Google employees speaking out, the project was dropped. 
By cutting business ties with illegal settlements, TripAdvisor would be leading the way in the travel sector and demonstrating a true commitment to ending human rights abuses.We urge you to do the right thing: stand up for human rights and help us and your company put an end to decades of war crimes and other grave violations.

“These charges are a ploy to harass and intimidate the two activists and force them to end the ongoing post-election demonstrations.
“Malawian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release them and stop clamping down on the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.
“Organizing and participating in peaceful protests is not a crime. Authorities must stop targeting dissenting voices and using politically motivated charges to suppress differing views. The rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association must be fully respected, protected, promoted and fulfilled in Malawi.”
Background
Police arrested Gift Trapence – Vice Chairman of the Human Rights Defenders Coalition – and McDonald Sembereka – a coalition member – on 9 July following days of demonstrations after the disputed election which were held on 21 May.
The demonstrators are calling for the resignation of the Chairperson of the Malawi Electoral Commission, Jane Ansah, accusing her of mishandling the election.
Major cities such as Lilongwe, Blantyre, Mzuzu and Rumphi have been the scenes of post-election protests since the disputed election results in May. President Peter Mutharika has dismissed the protesters as nothing but people hellbent on making Malawi a “lawless state”.

The organization has documented...","The Egyptian authorities’ growing trend of re-imprisoning people who have been arbitrarily detained, instead of complying with court orders to release them is an alarming signal of how decayed the country’s justice system has become, said Amnesty International.
The organization has documented the cases of five individuals, where the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) bypassed court orders to release them from arbitrary detention by imprisoning them in new cases based on fabricated charges, in a bid to keep them behind bars indefinitely.
“The Egyptian authorities’ practice of re-ordering the detention of detainees on blatantly fabricated charges just as they are about to be released is an alarming trend that illustrates the extent of Egypt’s decayed justice system,” said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.
“This unlawful practice has seen detainees who were already detained on spurious grounds trapped in the ‘revolving doors’ of Egypt’s arbitrary detention system, as part of deliberate ploy to prolong their detention.” 
Amnesty International interviewed lawyers and family members and examined media statements and video footage to document five cases.  
In each case, the individual had been initially subjected to enforced disappearance or incommunicado detention upon their arrest and was later brought before the SSSP, who ordered their detention pending investigation on the charge of “membership of a terrorist organization” in relation to their legitimate activities or for baseless accusations. Their detention was then repeatedly renewed –  in some cases for months or even years- before a judge finally ordered their release on probation. However, in each case, instead of ordering the individual’s release, the SSSP charged them with fresh offences, using the same or similar charges, and imprisoned them once again. During their prolonged pre-trial detention, each detainee was only questioned during the first week of their detention.
“The practise of refusing to release arbitrarily detained individuals as their families are waiting to embrace them following months or years of arbitrary detention is beyond cruel for both victims and their families. Imagine hearing that you will be free and expecting to be reunited with your loved ones following months of arbitrary detention, only to be told that they will be sent back to prison at the last moment,” said Najia Bounaim.
These cases mirror a common practise under former President Hosni Mubarak’s rule, where the police ignored court decisions ordering the release of detainees by simply re-detaining them under the Emergency Law, which allowed people to be administratively detained indefinitely without charge or trial. The article that allowed administrative detention in the Emergency law was struck down by the Supreme Constitutional Court in June 2013. 
The SSSP is now seeking to replicate administrative detention by detaining individuals for months and sometimes years without trial or formal charges, solely based on secret investigations that neither lawyers nor defendants are allowed to examine. After initial questioning in the first week, detainees are rarely if ever questioned again during their months or years of pre-trial detention, which has transformed pre-trial detention to a punishment in itself.
“The Egyptian authorities reviving Mubarak-era tactics of repression including prolonged pre-trial detention to silence peaceful activists, journalists and punish people for their political affiliations by detaining them indefinitely as part of their bid to crush dissent under the guise of combatting ‘terrorism’,” said Najia Bounaim.
In one of the most recent cases documented, instead of complying with a court order to release Ola al-Qaradawi, daughter of the cleric Youssef al-Qardawi, on 3 July 2019, the SSSP ordered her detention in another unfounded case a day later. She was re-detained for “membership of a terrorist group” and “funding a terrorist group through her connections in the place of detention”, despite the fact she had been in solitary confinement all the time that she was detained. She had been arbitrarily detained since 30 June 2017, along with her husband Hossam Khalaf, on trumped up charges including being a member of and financially supporting a “terrorist group”. Since then, she had been detained in prolonged solitary confinement in conditions amounting to torture. Amnesty International believes her detention is arbitrary and that she is being targeted because of her father’s connections to the Muslim Brotherhood. Ola al-Qardawi began a hunger strike in protest at her treatment after she was returned to solitary confinement last week.
Another prominent case is that of the Al Jazeera producer Mahmoud Hussein, who has been arbitrarily detained since 23 December 2016 in connection with his journalistic work. The SSSP charged him with “membership in a terrorist organization”, “receiving foreign funding” and “publishing false information” in a hearing without a lawyer and ordered his pre-trial detention pending investigations. Throughout his detention for two and a half years he was only questioned once upon his arrest. On 21 May 2019 a judge finally ordered his release on probation and the decision was upheld two days later. The authorities moved him to Abu el-Nomrs police station in Giza governorate in preparation for his release. However, on 28 May the SSSP decided instead to charge him with “membership of a banned organization”, “receiving foreign funding” and “working for international organizations” for a second time, again in the absence of his lawyer and ordered his detention again. Mahmoud’s detention had already surpassed the two- year maximum term for pre-trial detention under Egyptian law.
Others targeted include Somia Nassef and Marwa Madbouly who were arbitrarily arrested in connection with their peaceful activism on 31 October 2018, as part of a crackdown on human rights activists. They were subjected to enforced disappearances for three weeks and, during that time, they were tortured, including through beatings and electric shocks.
They then appeared before the SSSP and were detained pending investigation for “membership in a terrorist group” and “receiving foreign funding” before being held incommunicado in the NSA building in Abbassiya for two months. They were then transferred to Qanatar women prison in January 2019. A judge ordered their release on probation on 25 May 2019 and the decision was upheld three days later, however the SSSP decided to charge them with “membership of a terrorist group” and “receiving foreign funding” in the same case with Ola al-Qardawi and re-ordered their detention.
“Instead of arbitrarily detaining them on baseless charges, the Egyptian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Ola al-Qardawi, Mahmoud Hussein, Somia Nassef and Marwa Madbouly and all others detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly,” said Najia Bounaim.
“Pending their release, the authorities should ensure that they are detained in lawful conditions including being released from solitary confinement and granted access to their family, lawyers and any necessary medical care.”

Think Twice.,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/doing-business-in-the-illegal-israeli-settlements-think-twice/,"Doing business with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) poses significant risks to companies. Not only are these settlements illegal under international law, they are associated with widespread human rights violations.

Not only are these settlements illegal under international law, they are associated with widespread human rights violations. Companies weighing up whether they can do business with the settlements should reconsider.  
Unfortunately, many companies have no framework for examining their business interests and potential relationships with the settlements.  
To this end, Amnesty International recently released “THINK TWICE: Can companies do business with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories while respecting human rights?”; a briefing that covers issues relevant to companies across all industry sectors and at all stages of their trade and investment relationships in and with Israeli settlements. This publication draws on a range of standards and laws that are relevant to business conduct including international human rights law, international humanitarian law and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. 
Companies must regard this as a legal compliance issue; where companies involved may face reputational damage, withdrawal by investors and legal measures including criminal prosecution. 
Israeli settlements are built on confiscated Palestinian land and benefit from discriminatory policies resulting from the illegal ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories since 1967. Businesses operating in and with these settlements therefore inherently contribute to their maintenance and risk contributing to grave international law violations, illegal activities and serious violations of fundamental human rights.  
Some of these businesses include banks and other financial institutions, law firms, construction companies, real estate agents, utilities and service companies, agricultural and food companies, manufacturing companies, tourism agencies and security and information technology companies. Although companies may believe they are operating ordinary courses of business, they must take into account and acknowledge that they are located and operating in the context of a military occupation and therefore cannot mitigate contributing to serious human rights violations. 
 Doing business in occupied territories carries very real risks, dilemmas and potential liabilities for companies. 
Companies considering operating in or doing business with Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories need to take account of the fact that any business activity there will inevitably contribute to an illegal situation. 
 In order to adhere to international human rights and humanitarian law, companies should respect international rules applicable to situations of occupation, such as The Hague Regulations of 1907 and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention. These include a number of special protections designed to safeguard the local population from abuse, protect their assets from being pillaged and ensure the continuation of the pre-conflict way of life, which includes respect for cultural rights. 
For instance, international humanitarian law prohibits an occupying power from transferring its own civilians into a territory that it occupies. It also prohibits an occupying power from forcibly transferring protected persons from occupied territory. Moreover, under the Hague Regulations of 1907, the public property of the local population of the occupied territories (such as land, forests and agricultural estates) is subject to the laws of usufruct. This means that an occupying state is only allowed to use this property for the benefit of the local population or for its military needs. 
Human rights violations are inherent and inextricably linked to Israel’s settlement enterprise, because they contribute to serious human rights abuses against Palestinians living in the OPT, inter alia: 
The right to life 
The right to adequate housing 
The right to equality and non-discrimination 
The right to liberty and fair trial 
The right to an effective remedy 
The right to security of person and to health 
The rights of children 
The right to water 
The right to education 
The right to peaceful assembly 
Labour rights 
The right to freedom of movement 
Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. The transfer of the civilian population of the occupying power into the occupied territories, and the forcible displacement of the local population from the occupied territory constitutes a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
Companies cannot do business in or with illegal Israeli settlements without contributing to serious violations of both international humanitarian law and human rights law. 
Settlement businesses depend on and benefit from Israel’s unlawful confiscation of Palestinian land and other resources. Industrial parks in settlements offer numerous incentives, including tax breaks, low rents and low labour costs. They benefit from Israel’s discriminatory policies for planning and zoning, financial incentives, access to utilities and infrastructure. Meanwhile, Palestinian enterprises are disadvantaged through restrictions on movement and administrative and legal constraints. 
In its January 2018 report on business enterprises linked to the occupation, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) concluded that: 
considering the weight of the international legal consensus concerning the illegal nature of the settlements themselves, and the systemic and pervasive nature of the negative human rights impact caused by them, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which a company could engage in listed activities in a way that is consistent with the Guiding Principles and international law. 
As a result of these special circumstances, it is inevitable that conducting business in the OPT and/or with Israeli settlements involves potential illegal activities and human rights violations.  
In the past few years a considerable number of companies have terminated operations linked to Israeli settlement in the OPT. Banks and pension funds have taken steps to exclude companies from their investment portfolios, owing to concerns about the legal and ethical implications of those companies’ activities there. 
The reasons for these divestments vary from case to case: legal action, government pressure, outcomes of dispute resolution processes under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, reputational risk, civil society campaigns or the ethical policies of state pension funds. Some companies have explicitly cited the illegality of the settlements under international law as a reason for disengaging. Amnesty International’s Think Twice briefing includes examples of divestment that demonstrate this increasing trend. 
The scrutiny of companies doing business in or with Israeli settlements will increase with the UN’s compilation and publication of a database of enterprises involved in activities there. And as the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission report of 2013 stated: 
It is with the full knowledge of the current situation and the related liability risks that business enterprises unfold their activities in the settlements and contribute to their maintenance, development and consolidation. 
The risk of criminal prosecution and civil litigation under domestic legal regimes for damages arising from business activities in or with settlements is real. The International Committee of the Red Cross has noted that international humanitarian law applies to businesses in situations of conflict, imposing obligations on managers and staff not to breach these rules.  
As outlined above, certain acts carried out by Israel in relation to its illegal settlement policy amount to war crimes. This means that companies carrying out activities that contribute to the maintenance, development and expansion of these settlements expose themselves – and their individual directors and managers – to the risk of prosecution for complicity in war crimes. They may also be sued for damages in civil courts. 
Amnesty’s Destination: Occupation campaign covers the online tourism industry and its role in helping maintain and grow illegal Israeli settlements. The report examines four international digital tourism companies: Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor, exposing their activities related to Israeli settlements in the OPT and their contribution to and benefit from Israel’s violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. 
SIGN our online petition telling TripAdvisor that settlements are on stolen Palestinian land. Their promotion as a tourist destination helps normalize and legitimize them to the public. Settlements are illegal under international law; their creation amounts to a war crime. They should not be tourist destinations. 
Amnesty’s Occupation @50 campaign calls on states to prohibit Israeli settlement goods from entering their markets, and to stop companies domiciled in their territories from operating in settlements or trading in their goods.   
Since its occupation in 1967, Israel has promoted the creation and expansion of settlements in the OPT, resulting in: 
the appropriation of 200,000+ hectares of Palestinian land; 
the establishment of 250+ settlements, populated by 600,000+ Israeli settlers; 
the physical enclosure and segregation of the 3 million West Bank Palestinians; 
the extension of Israeli laws to the West Bank and the creation of a discriminatory legal regime; 
the unequal access to natural resources, social services, property and land for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. 
SIGN our online petition to tell the Canadian government it’s time stop fuelling Palestinian suffering. It’s time to ban settlement products from entering our borders and stop Canadian companies profiting from the settlements.

The human rights organization said the 7 July 2019 bombing in a crowded area of Ghazni city that killed at least 14 people, including one child, and injured more than 180, included 60 children, shows a chilling disregard for human life.
“These bombings demonstrate a chilling disregard for human life. At the same time that the Taliban is engaged in supposed peace talks with other Afghans, the armed group continues to claim the lives of civilians, including children,” said Samira Hamidi, South Asia campaigner at Amnesty International.
The Taliban said they had targeted the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence agency, in Ghazni, which is located near public places including schools. Under international humanitarian law, all precautions must be taken to avoid civilian casualties.
The Ghazni bombing comes less than a week after the Taliban claimed responsibility for a large bombing near the Ministry of Defence, killing three people and wounding more than 90 others, including 50 children from nearby schools.
Last year saw the number of civilian deaths recorded since 2009, including the highest number of children killed. According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, 3,804 civilians – including more than 900 children – were killed in the country in 2018, and a further 7,000 people were injured.
In recent weeks, the Taliban has also threatened to target Afghan journalists and media groups. In a statement issued on 24 June 2019, the Taliban’s “military commission” issued an ultimatum to journalists, warning them against issuing statements and running advertisements that are critical of the armed group.
The Taliban said it would consider these journalists “not as media organizations but as nests of the enemy’s intelligence apparatus” and targeted as such. Journalists and employees of media organizations, the Taliban said, “will not be safe.”
“There is no justification for targeting journalists and media outlets and this would amount to war crimes. Afghanistan’s journalists are among the bravest in the world, working under extremely difficult conditions in a country that has saw more journalists killed last year than anywhere else.

Out of 36...","Thirty academics and political figures facing trumped-up charges, including espionage for the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition, were sentenced to death by the Sana’a-based Huthi-run Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) following a fundamentally flawed legal process, said Amnesty International.
Out of 36 individuals who were on trial, 30 were handed down death sentences. Amongst those is Youssef al-Bawab, a 45-year-old father of five and linguistics professor and political figure, who was arbitrarily arrested in late 2016. He was charged in April 2017, alongside 35 others, with several offences carrying the death penalty. Throughout his detention, proceedings against him and others in the same case were seriously flawed, and included enforced disappearance, excessive pre-trial detention, undue delays in his trial, incommunicado detention, allegations of torture and other ill-treatment and lack of access to legal counsel and medical care. 
“This trial was a mockery of justice and only confirms how the judiciary, and the SCC in particular, is turning into a tool of repression, evidently incapable of dispensing impartial justice. Since the Huthi de facto authorities assumed control of the justice system in 2015, they have progressively utilized the Sana’a-based SCC to target persons they deem to be opponents or even just critics,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Research.
“Today thirty individuals, and all of their loved ones, are bracing for what is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, and handed down following such flagrantly unfair trials. We call on the Huthi de facto authorities to quash these unjust convictions and brutal sentences and release the 30 men immediately.”
According to witnesses present at the court session and to the surprise of the legal defense team, the judge speedily read out the charges on which they were convicted, most of which carry a mandatory death sentence under Yemeni Criminal Law, in the presence of the detainees, their families and lawyer, before formally sentencing 30 to death and acquitting and releasing six others.
“As Yemen’s armed conflict rages on, the grossly unfair trial of all these defendants is part of a wider pattern of the judiciary being used to settle political scores,” said Lynn Maalouf.
On the same day, Asmaa al-Omeissy, a 23-year-old mother of two, was handed a 15-year prison sentence after being convicted of aiding an enemy state. Amnesty International further calls on the Huthi de facto authorities to quash her conviction and sentence and release her immediately.
Background
Amnesty International has documented the increased use of the SCC in targeting religious minorities. In September 2018, 24 Yemenis from the Baha’i faith – including eight women and a child – were accused of charges that carry the death penalty by the Huthi-controlled SCC. Currently, Hamid Haydara is also being tried by the SCC for his conscientiously-held beliefs. Amnesty International and other organizations have repeatedly called on the Huthis to immediately quash the death sentence against Hamid Haydara.
All parties to the conflict, including Huthi forces, the Yemeni government, the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates (UAE)-led coalition and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have engaged in arbitrary detention practices. In areas under their control, Huthi forces have arbitrarily arrested and detained critics and opponents as well as journalists, human rights defenders and members of the Baha’i community, subjecting scores to unfair trials, incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance. The majority of those targeted have been leaders, members or supporters of the political party al-Islah. The internationally recognized Yemeni government has harassed, threatened and arbitrarily detained human rights defenders and other activists. Meanwhile, UAE-backed Yemeni forces in southern Yemen conducted a campaign of arbitrary detentions and enforced disappearances. In May 2018, Amnesty International published a report detailing the cases of 51 men held in a network of secret prisons by UAE and Yemeni forces operating outside the command of Yemen’s government, including individuals detained between March 2016 and May 2018.

“This is a landmark ruling for women in Indonesia. This teenager is not a criminal. She is the one who suffered a sexual assault –  and did nothing other than claim her rights over her body. It beggars belief that the courts tried to impose this reckless, vicious and absurd sentence on a teenage victim of sexual violence. She should not have spent a single day in detention.
“We welcome the Supreme Court’s ruling. It must send a message to law enforcement agencies and public prosecutors across the country that their role is to protect victims of rape, not aggravate their suffering.
“Authorities in Indonesia must decriminalise abortion in all circumstances. No woman or girl should face any kind of penalty for seeking or obtaining an abortion. Authorities must further ensure access to safe and legal abortion to all women and girls, particularly to victims of rape, sexual assault or incest. These are Indonesia’s international human rights obligations.”
Background
On 19 July 2018, a 15-year-old girl was sentenced to six months behind bars by the Muara Bulian District Court in Batanghari District, Jambi Province, for getting an abortion after she was raped by her brother. The victim challenged the verdict at the Jambi High Court, which ruled in her favour on 27 August 2018. The prosecutors took the case to the Supreme Court, which has again ruled in the teenager’s favour.
Indonesia has a legal obligation under international human rights law to ensure that victims of rape or incest have timely access to a safe and legal abortion. Moreover, denial of abortion services to women or girls who have become pregnant as a result of rape, sexual assault or incest is a violation of the right to be free from torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment.

In Last Chance for Justice, the organization exposes the serious setbacks and imminent risks to human rights in Guatemala as a result of measures taken by the Jimmy Morales administration, the Public Prosecutor’s Office led by Consuelo Porras, the judiciary, and the national Congress.
“Access to justice is receiving heavy blows from which Guatemala will not be able to recover unless measures are taken now. The actions being taken by the nation’s highest authorities must be stopped immediately and they must ensure justice for every case of human rights violations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
In the last decade, Guatemala has made remarkable progress in the fight against impunity in the country. Between 2007 and 2018, the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a body created under the auspices of the United Nations to support the Public Prosecutor’s Office in investigating criminal structures infiltrated into state institutions, was able to present more than 100 cases, several of them closely tied to human rights violations in the country. At the same time, starting in 2009, Guatemalan courts began to dictate historic sentences against former military commissioners, and members of the police and army – including high-ranking commanders – something that had never happened before.
However, since August 2017, President Jimmy Morales’s government has sought to hinder the work of CICIG. On 31 August 2018, the president announced his decision not to extend CICIG’s mandate, which will end on 3 September 2019. Faced with this situation, Attorney General Consuelo Porras has not taken concrete or timely action to guarantee the continuity of the work of the prosecutor’s offices that collaborate with CICIG, such as the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity (FECI), thus endangering the investigations opened in more than 70 joint cases.
For its part, Guatemala’s Congress has promoted regressive legislative proposals that would guarantee impunity for serious human rights violations committed during the armed conflict and for certain acts of corruption and would limit the right of association and the defense of human rights.
“The Attorney General cannot stop the momentum that has given hope again to thousands of people in the country. She has a great responsibility and obligation to ensure that cases of human rights violations and corruption do not go unpunished. It is time to stop talking and take action to provide the conditions, resources and security that will allow prosecutors to continue the investigations that are underway, so that justice can prevail in Guatemala,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
The report shows the need to continue the process of strengthening the capacities of the Public Prosecutor’s Office that began with CICIG, and exposes the state’s inability to guarantee the independence of prosecutors, as well as certain judges who deal with these kinds of cases, who face intimidation, stigmatization and multiple unfounded criminal or disciplinary procedures.
Amnesty International calls on the Guatemalan authorities to put an end to the improper use of criminal proceedings to harass prosecutors, judges and human rights defenders, in order to create an environment in which justice and the defense of human rights can be carried out.
“In the last 10 years, Guatemala has advanced in the consolidation of justice to become an example in the region. However, these setbacks are taking us back to the drawing board, confronting us with the same situations for which the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala was created in the first place,” said a lawyer interviewed by Amnesty International.
Amnesty International also warns about the deteriorating situation of human rights defenders and freedom of expression in Guatemala. The departure of CICIG and the weakening of justice and human rights institutions means that criminal structures can continue to violate the law with impunity and increases the risk that human rights defenders will suffer further attacks.

Following today’s International Criminal Court (ICC) conviction of Bosco Ntaganda, former leader of a rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) for war crimes and crimes against humanity, Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa welcomed the conviction, saying:
“We can only hope that today’s verdict provides some consolation to those affected by the grotesque crimes perpetrated by Ntaganda and paves the way for his victims and their families to finally obtain a measure of justice and reparations.”
“Every day of the seven years that Ntaganda freely roamed the streets of Goma after the International Criminal Court issued his arrest warrant increased the torment that the victims and their families had to endure – to the shame of DRC authorities and the international community.
“But today, the 2,123 victims in the case can at last begin the process of reparations for all the harm inflicted upon them by Ntaganda.”
Background
Ntaganda was convicted of all 13 counts of war crimes and five counts of crimes against humanity, including enlisting and conscripting child soldiers, and rape and sexual slavery. A total of 2,123 victims participated in the trial, including former child soldiers and victims of Ntaganda’s rebel group.
In 2002, Ntaganda was the Chief of Military Operations in the rebel group Union of Congolese Patriots, the same rebel group to which Thomas Lubanga belonged. Lubanga was convicted by the ICC for the use and recruitment of child soldiers in March 2012 and sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Bosco Ntaganda has the right to appeal today’s decision, and he is expected to do so. A separate sentencing hearing will be held in the coming weeks.

Amnesty International is appalled by the fact that a crucial piece of human rights legislation will not become law in Canada because of the procedural tactics of a few Senators. 
Bill C-262, a bill setting out a framework to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, was passed by the House of Commons more than a year ago. 
We are confident that if Bill C-262 had come to a vote in the Senate, it would have been adopted into law. However, a handful of Conservative Senators were able use delaying tactics to prevent such a vote taking place before the Senate adjourned last month. 
This happened despite the fact that all parties in the House of Commons supported a unanimous motion calling Bill C-262 a critical piece of legislation and urging the Senate to pass the Bill into law. 
Amnesty has joined Indigenous partners and other human rights NGOs in public statement condemning what we have called a blow to democracy and human rights. 
The joint statement emphasizes, however, that the failure to pass C-262 does not diminish Canada’s obligation to uphold the UN Declaration. Nor does it turn back the clock on numerous initiatives already underway to hold federal, provincial and territorial government accountable to this obligation. 
What this setback does is clearly underline is the hard work ahead of us to ensure that Canada’s commitments to rights the Indigenous peoples are actually put into practice. 
In the words of MP Romeo Saganash, responding to the demise of the Bill he authored and championed: “Let us rise with more energy. Let us stand with a greater determination.” 
Along with partners we are calling on all parties to support reintroduction of implementation legislation – at least as strong as the provisions of C-262 – following the federal election.

Scale of abuses reaches the threshold of crimes against humanity 
The wave of police killings triggered by Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s murderous anti-drugs campaign continues to rage on, destroying lives and devastating communities, a report by Amnesty International reveals today. The UN must immediately open an investigation into gross human rights violations and possible crimes against humanity committed as part of the “war on drugs.”
The new report, ‘They just kill’: Ongoing extrajudicial executions and other violations in the Philippines’ ‘war on drugs,’ shows police operating with total impunity as they murder people from poor neighbourhoods whose names appear on manufactured “drug watch lists” established outside of any legal process.
“Three years on, President Duterte’s ‘war on drugs’ continues to be nothing but a large-scale murdering enterprise for which the poor continue to pay the highest price,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia.
“It is time for the United Nations, starting with its Human Rights Council, to act decisively to hold President Duterte and his government accountable.”
The Philippine government has acknowledged at least 6,600 killings at the hands of police. Evidence points to many thousands more killed by unknown armed persons with likely links to the police.
Following the transfer of senior police officers from Metro Manila – until then the country’s epicentre of killings – Bulacan province, in Central Luzon, is now the country’s bloodiest killing field.
President Duterte has repeatedly defended his administration’s “war on drugs,” saying people involved in drugs are “criminals” and that their killing is “justifiable.”
In its investigation, Amnesty International identified 20 cases in which 27 people were killed, many of which appear to be extrajudicial executions. These killings took place across Bulacan province between May 2018 and April 2019. In total, the organisation carried out interviews with 58 people, including witnesses of extrajudicial executions, families of victims, local officials and human rights activists, among others.
The report builds on a previous Amnesty International investigation, whose results were published in January 2017, that showed how the police had systematically targeted mostly poor and defenceless people across the country while planting “evidence,” recruiting paid killers, stealing from the people they kill, and fabricating official incident reports.
“It is not safe to be poor in President Duterte’s Philippines,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “All it takes to be murdered is an unproven accusation that someone uses, buys, or sells drugs. Everywhere we went to investigate drug-related killings ordinary people were terrified. Fear has now spread deep into the social fabric of society.”
Many killings, one pattern
In every police operation Amnesty International examined, police cited the same “buy-bust” justification: an undercover drug sting where suspects were armed and fought back, “prompting” the use of lethal force.
Families and witnesses repeatedly refuted police accounts. In some cases the victim never owned a gun or was too poor to buy one, family members said. In other cases, victims of drug-related killings were first reported as missing, only to be suddenly and systematically classified by the police as “buy-bust” kills once the body was discovered.
A Filipino forensic expert interviewed by Amnesty International said that police reports of “buy-bust” operations she had examined did not meet the minimum standards of plausibility: “It’s so consistent, it’s a script. In fact, when you see the report, it looks like a template.”
In one case, police claimed Jovan Magtanong, a 30-year-old father of three, fired at them, and that they recovered a .38 calibre gun and sachets of illicit drugs from the scene of the incident. Witnesses said he was sleeping alongside his children when officers knocked on his house door asking for another man. Jovan’s family said he did not own a gun and had not used drugs for over a year.
“They killed him like an animal,” a family member told Amnesty International.
When ‘drug watch lists’ become kill lists
In the majority of cases reviewed by Amnesty, those killed were said to have been on so-called “drug watch lists” compiled by the authorities outside of any legal process.
These lists effectively serve as guides for the police of people to arrest or kill. Local officials down to the neighbourhood (barangay) level are pressured to show results by collecting the names of so-called “users,” “pushers,” “financiers,” and “protectors” in their area. Amnesty International views these lists as unreliable, illegitimate, and unjustifiable. They provide further evidence of the government’s targeting of poor and marginalised communities.
Amnesty International researchers interviewed local human rights investigators, barangay personnel, and others, who confirmed that there is no way to get de-listed, creating a system of perpetual surveillance and risk.
“The Duterte administration has created a deadly numbers game where officials must manufacture lists and monitor them, regardless of whether the individuals on it actually use or sell drugs. This insatiable and vicious system rewards blind compliance and murder,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
Police responsibility
The sharp rise in unlawful killings in Bulacan follows personnel transfers in the upper ranks of the police. Commanders who previously held posts in Metro Manila – formerly the deadliest region for drug-related killings – have been promoted to senior roles in Bulacan and the wider Central Luzon region.
One of them is provincial director Senior Superintendent Chito Bersaluna, the police chief for Caloocan City at the time of the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos in August 2017.
Following global media attention to the case, Bersaluna was put on “administrative leave.” No charges were filed against him but three junior officers under his command were prosecuted, and ultimately convicted and sentenced.
“The transfer of senior police officials to regions where killings then surged is an alarming indicator of impunity,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “The Duterte administration’s continuing efforts to deny and deflect responsibility are nothing short of mendacious.”
Time for a UN investigation
With the single exception of the police officers convicted for the killing of Kian delos Santos, the Philippine authorities have failed to credibly investigate and prosecute those responsible for unlawful killings and extrajudicial executions in anti-drug operations.
Amnesty International’s new report contributes to a growing volume of evidence that human rights violations committed in the Philippines’ murderous “war on drugs” constitute crimes against humanity.
The Philippine government has to date evaded all attempts to scrutinise human rights violations committed in the context of its widely-criticized “war on drugs.” Although the International Criminal Court launched a preliminary examination into the anti-drug campaign in February 2018, President Duterte quickly announced that the Philippines would pull out of the court’s statute, a withdrawal that came into effect last March.
Families of victims, witnesses, lawyers, religious leaders and others repeatedly expressed their despair at the obstacles stopping them from seeking justice, and the total climate of impunity within the country.
“Every time I see a photo of my son, I feel my heart being pierced,” a mother of a 20-year-old victim told Amnesty International. “He wants me to fight for him, what do I do?”
Amnesty International also found that drug rehabilitation and treatment programmes for people who use drugs remain woefully inadequate. The organisation emphasises that the authorities must ramp up the availability of health and social services to reduce the risks and harms associated with drugs, and end its campaign based on violence and fear.
The organization is calling on the UN Human Rights Council to immediately initiate an independent, impartial and effective investigation into human rights violations in the “war on drugs,” including the commission of crimes under international law.
Likewise, the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court must expedite its examination into the situation and open a full and thorough criminal investigation.

The use of military forces to control demonstrations across the country has had a deeply concerning toll on human rights, said Amnesty International upon presenting the findings of a field investigation. 
“President Juan Orlando Hernández’s (JOH) message is very clear: shouting ‘JOH out’ and demanding change can be very costly. At least six people have died in the context of protests and dozens have been injured, many of them by firearms fired by security forces since the beginning of this wave of demonstrations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
In a desperate attempt to silence the voices demanding his resignation, President Hernández has used the armed forces to control the protests. According to information gathered by Amnesty International, during this period the security forces have indiscriminately used less-than-lethal weapons, such as tear gas or rubber bullets, causing injury to dozens of people. In total, six people have been killed in this context since April, four of them by firearms at the hands of the security forces.
The repressive policies of the Hernandez government in response to protests have previously been condemned. On 13 June 2018, Amnesty International published the report Protest Prohibited: Use of Force and Arbitrary Detentions to Suppress Dissident in Honduras, which documents how the authorities not only used excessive force to repress peaceful protesters immediately after the controversial elections of 26 November 2017, but also arbitrarily detained and held protesters in deplorable conditions for months, denying them their right to due process and an adequate defence.
Since then, the wave of anti-government demonstrations has been a constant in the country. According to the non-governmental organization Committee for Free Expression (C-Libre), from 4 March to 25 June this year, there were at least 346 protests across the country. The current generalized discontent of the population was provoked by the approval, on 25 April, of laws that transformed the national health education systems, which in the opinion of teachers’ leaders and the Medical College of Honduras, will lead to the privatization of these sectors and the massive dismissal of employees. Although these laws were repealed, protesters have continued to demand the president’s resignation.
Amnesty International’s Americas crisis team conducted a rapid response mission during the first week of July, following the upsurge in violence during demonstrations of the last few weeks, which left a toll of six people dead and almost 80 injured. The organization documented a total of eight cases, two of which involved people killed by the army and military police, and six that involved people who were injured, four of them by firearms. In addition, the organization analyzed more than 60 pieces of audio-visual and photographic material to identify the weapons and ammunition used, among other things. 
DEATHS DUE TO THE USE OF LETHAL FORCE
On 20 June, Eblin Noel Corea Maradiaga, a 17-year-old student, was killed by the army in the town of Yarumela, La Paz, where hours before a road blockade had taken place as a form of protest, before finally giving way. Despite this, an army convoy arrived moments later, fired on civilians and chased several people, including Eblin and his father. Although they were unarmed and attempting to take refuge in an alley, witnesses report that an army officer took position, aimed and shot the teenager, who fell into his father’s arms after being hit in the chest.  
In another case, on 19 June, Erik Peralta was trying to cross an avenue blocked by a protest in Tegucigalpa’s Pedregal neighbourood, after returning from work, when soldiers arrived and, without a word, began to shoot. According to the forensic report, a bullet pierced his chest and killed him almost immediately. Erik was 37 years old and had four children. 
INJURIES FROM USE OF LETHAL AND LESS-THAN-LETHAL FORCE
Another case that Amnesty International documented of the excessive use of force was the incursion into the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH) on 24 June, when Military Police officers entered the compound and shot at dozens of people demonstrating in the entrance. In a press release, the government said this was justified by the need to rescue an officer who was abducted by students, as well as by the use of Molotov cocktails and other devices launched against security forces, and the need to “repel the attack”.  
While Amnesty International was able to document the use of stones and, in some cases, handmade mortars by demonstrators, the organization believes that the use of lethal force was excessive and unnecessary. The fact that some groups or individuals use violence in a demonstration does not make the whole protest violent per se. 
That said, the organization could find no evidence of the alleged abduction of the military official, and the university rector himself confirmed to Amnesty International that no evidence of this had been presented, nor that there had been any negotiation process prior to the use of force. Likewise, the authorities violated the principle of exceptionality of lethal force, which can only be used in cases of imminent risk against the lives of agents or third parties.
As a result, at least five people were shot, including a 25-year-old student, whose identity has been omitted for security reasons, who was shot in the arm, and Elder Nahúm Peralta, another 21-year-old student, who was hit by a bullet impact that entered and exited his right buttock. In an interview with Amnesty International, Elder said that while running to protect himself, he was struck by a bullet and fell to the ground. He was helped by university security personnel and students, who took him to the Hospital Escuela, where he received medical attention.
On 30 May, a young teacher participating in local protests was shot by National Police officers after they fired into the crowd. The shot to his back caused the loss of a kidney and damaged his large intestine, transverse colon and lung. 
Violent police repression also affected people who were not participating in the protests. In Tegucigalpa, National Police officers assaulted two members of a family who had reprimanded them for throwing tear gas near their home. Feeling suffocated, the family left their home to demand an end to the use of tear gas and were beaten with clubs, punches and kicks. As a result, one of them required immediate medical attention, included stitching of head wounds.
IMPUNITY 
Impunity, which has been continuously denounced in the country in recent years, remains endemic in Honduras with regard to human rights violations, and this encourages further violations.
“The Honduran justice system has demonstrated once again that human rights violations in the context of protests continue without proper investigation, nor are people suspected of criminal responsibility brought to justice. The facts of these last few weeks demonstrate how impunity is a constant that fuels the repetition of serious human rights violations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
In two of the eight cases that Amnesty International documented, families did not file a complaint with the Public Prosecutor’s Office for fear of reprisals. In the remaining six cases, although they filed complaints, they did not trust in the impartiality or efficiency of the Public Prosecutor’s Office, and in at least three cases they claimed that the steps necessary to ensure a thorough investigation had not been taken in time.
For example, Eblin Noel Corea Maradiaga’s family did not allow the autopsy to be performed for fear that the authorities would “misplace” the bullet that was lodged in his body. Considering it to be a key piece of evidence for the solving of the crime, they requested an exhumation with the cooperation of trusted forensic personnel provided by the family. However, the Public Prosecutor’s Office denied their participation and they are still waiting for this to happen. Such was the family’s distrust of the authorities that they installed a light bulb to be able to watch over his body 24 hours a day, for fear that someone might tamper with the corpse and steal the bullet. 
In another incident, on 29 April, a public official, dressed in civilian clothes and operating in conjunction with the national police, fired on a person whose identity has been omitted for security reasons. Despite it being clear from testimonies and images of the event that the official was carrying a semi-automatic weapon consistent with the caliber of bullet that the victim has lodged in their chest, no one has been prosecuted so far. Although a complaint was filed immediately after the incident, as well as requests made to the prosecutor’s office soliciting information on the proceedings, the Committee of Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared in Honduras (COFADEH), the organization that accompanies victims, has not received a response.
In this context, Amnesty International considers it essential to advance the investigations and guarantee the correct processing of all available evidence for the proper identification of possible perpetrators and their subsequent prosecution.
Amnesty International also met with government officials to discuss the current context of the crisis and the evidence gathered by the organization that exposes serious human rights violations. The officials stated that they have adhered to the law and that if there were cases to the contrary, this would be due to individual actions by inexperienced personnel, not a policy of repression. In addition, they justified military deployment for security purposes in accordance with the Constitution. The authorities pledged to provide Amnesty International with information regarding the investigation into the attack on the UNAH.
Meetings were also held with national human rights organizations, which expressed concern about the state’s repressive strategy aimed at silencing critical voices demanding structural changes in public policies. The organization reiterates its condemnation of the stigmatization, harassment and aggression against human rights defenders and calls for their protection.  
Amnesty International has already publicly condemned the National Security Council’s decision of 20 June 2019 to deploy the armed forces, police and intelligence agents in response to protests, as this could lead to an increase in the excessive use of force against demonstrators. The organization reiterates that the state must guarantee an orderly withdrawal of the armed forces from public security tasks and implement a process of strengthening the capacities of the National Police.
“The president must urgently demonstrate that he is willing to use all the means at his disposal to stop lethal repression, otherwise there will be compelling reasons to consider his responsibility for each of the deaths and attacks against people exercising their legitimate right to protest,” concluded Erika Guevara-Rosas.

The new network, launched in May 2019, is urging the B.C. government to reform the Mineral Tenure Act to respect no-go zones and decisions by local residents and First Nations, in line with best practices and international law.
Need for Reforms
Calvin Sandborn, University of Victoria Environmental Law Centre and cofounder of the B.C. Mining Law Reform Network, said, “We don’t want mining claims to undermine community-based land use planning, environmental protection, and private property any longer. B.C.’s laws should require Indigenous consent and meaningful public participation in the assessment of mining activities.”
Andrew Gage, West Coast Environmental Law Association, added, “BC’s gold rush era mining laws, which give mining activity priority over virtually all other land uses, are out of touch with today’s realities. Building a responsible, modern mining sector that has social license to thrive in BC needs to begin with updating our mining laws.”
The federal government rejected Taseko’s New Prosperity mine proposal twice in the past, yet the province approved it through its previous Environmental Assessment Act. The most recent exploratory permits were approved in the last days of Christy Clark’s Liberal government in 2017. The current mineral tenure laws grant mining first and priority use of the land.
B.C. Lagging Behind
Ugo Lapointe, MiningWatch Canada: “BC is lagging behind as most major mining jurisdictions have modernized their mineral tenure regimes in the past decade. BC can learn from other jurisdictions and identify and implement best practices.”
Nikki Skuce, Northern Confluence, Smithers: “It’s time for the B.C. government to update our mining laws to include reasonable restrictions on where mineral claims and mining leases are allowed. Ensuring mineral activity respects land-use plans and limits around certain areas, such as key salmon habitat, drinking water sources, and culturally sensitive sites, will go a long way to avoid conflicts from First Nations and local communities.”
Tara Scurr, Amnesty International Canada: “B.C. must uphold its commitment to review and modernize its laws to respect the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.”
More than One Conflict
The groups are also concerned about Imperial Metals preparing to drill into the fragile Skagit Watershed next to Manning Park despite clear local opposition and deep concerns from our U.S. neighbours. Joe Foy, Wilderness Committee: “This is the same company that has not paid a cent in fines for the 2014 Mount Polley disaster near Quesnel Lake, the largest mine waste spill in Canadian history and if Canada fails to prosecute soon, they will walk away scot free.”

The 1,200 page report included 231 Calls for Justice to end the staggering levels of violence experienced by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit women, girls, and two-spirit persons in Canada. 
The federal government accepted the report’s finding of genocide and committed to developing a National Action Plan to prevent and address the violence by June 2020. However, government delayed development of the National Action Plan, citing the pandemic as a cause for delay. 
On June 3, 2021, the federal government released the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People. 
The National Action Plan creates a distinctions-based approach co-created with Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people, and some actions have been undertaken while the plan was under-development. However, the plan fails to articulate a comprehensive list of government priorities, with associated goals, objectives, and implementation timelines clearly connected to each of the 231 Calls for Justice. The actions taken to date are too little, too late. The long delays and incomplete plan are unacceptable. The lack of transparency around the plan’s creation and implementation must end. 
Every delay leads to further violence, and the further denial of justice to survivors. Real action cannot be delayed any longer. 
The UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has said that the failure to provide a comprehensive, coordinated response to violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons is a grave human rights violation. 
The government of Canada must not further delay action.

0,Libya: Abhorrent attack on migrant detention centre must be investigated as a war crime,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/libya-abhorrent-attack-migrant-detention-centre-must-be-investigated-war-crime/,"The International Criminal Court must order an urgent investigation into an abhorrent attack on the Tajoura immigration detention centre in eastern Tripoli, Libya, in which at least 40 refugees and migrants were killed and more than 80 injured, said Amnesty International. “This deadly attack...","The International Criminal Court must order an urgent investigation into an abhorrent attack on the Tajoura immigration detention centre in eastern Tripoli, Libya, in which at least 40 refugees and migrants were killed and more than 80 injured, said Amnesty International.
“This deadly attack which struck a detention centre where at least 600 refugees and migrants were trapped in detention with no means of escape, and whose location was known to all warring parties, must be independently investigated as a war crime. The International Criminal Court should immediately investigate the possibility that this was a direct attack on civilians,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“This brutal slaughter is also a sickening reminder of the deadly consequences of Libya and Europe’s callous migration policies. Their cooperation to stem the flow of migrants and refugees means that instead of being offered safe routes out of the country, thousands of people intercepted in the central Mediterranean are returned to Libya where they are arbitrarily detained in centres where they are exposed to torture and mortal danger.”
There are fears the death toll could rise from last night’s attack on the detention centre. But even the initial report doubles the civilian death toll since the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army’s (LNA) offensive to capture Tripoli from the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) began on 4 April 2019, according to UN figures.
“Most of the victims of the attack were migrants and refugees, many of whom fled bloodshed, persecution or poverty to seek a better life abroad, only to find themselves indefinitely incarcerated in a Libyan detention centre near active conflict zones,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“This attack should shame all sides into taking immediate action to remove migrants and refugees from areas of active conflict where their lives are endangered and to end their cruel practice of arbitrarily detaining migrants.”
This morning Amnesty International spoke to three refugees detained at Tajoura and who survived the attack. An Eritrean refugee said a first air strike hit a hangar adjacent to the detention centre, followed by a second strike that hit the men’s cell at the centre itself around five minutes later. Following the attack, up to 300 migrants and refugees – some of whom were returned to Libya after being intercepted in the Mediterranean in recent weeks – are now out in the streets of Tajoura, frightened and waiting for urgent assistance.
The organization has analysed and verified video footage and photos posted from the scene of the attack, geolocating them to the immigration detention centre in Tajoura, which is managed by the General Directorate for Combating Illegal Migration under the Libyan Ministry of Interior. A photo from the men’s cell shows a large crater, several metres across, consistent with the damage caused by an air-dropped bomb.
While it remains to be established who is behind this attack, this week media reports indicated LNA forces had recently received F-16 fighter jets. Such jets are capable of carrying out a night time air strike with larger bombs that would cause damage of this type.
Amnesty International has repeatedly called on warring parties to protect refugees and migrants from attacks and remove them from areas of active conflict and military targets.
The organization’s research indicates that a warehouse used to store weapons was located in the same compound as the Tajoura detention centre. Following an airstrike that hit a military vehicle approximately 100 meters from Tajoura detention centre on 7 May, Amnesty International had warned the Libyan authorities that they were endangering the lives of refugees and migrants by arbitrarily detaining them close to military targets. UNHCR had also called for the urgent relocation to safety of refugees and migrants in detention centres located in conflict areas in Tripoli. 
Under international humanitarian law all parties to a conflict must take all feasible precautions to minimize the risk to civilians including by delaying or cancelling an attack. Even if the military depot was the intended target of the attack the high number of civilians in close proximity to the area would make this attack unlawful. Parties also must take all feasible measures to protect civilians under their control from the effects of attacks, including by avoiding locating military objectives, such as weapons storage sites, in the vicinity of civilian areas.
Amnesty International’s research also confirmed that some detainees had been forced to work at the military site in Tajoura against their will – also a violation of international law.
“This attack should be a wake-up call for EU states to end their shameful policies outsourcing migration control to Libya in their bid to reduce the number of refugees and migrants arriving on European shores. They can no longer turn a blind eye to the inhuman conditions, torture, rape and other abuse refugees and migrants face, or their failure to support refugees to reach safety by offering sufficient resettlement places,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“EU member states should urgently ensure safe routes out of Libya for refugees and migrants trapped in the country and ensure that refugees and migrants rescued in the central Mediterranean are not returned to Libya.”
Amnesty International has warned that breaches of the UN arms embargo on Libya are fuelling violations including war crimes in the battle for Tripoli, which has raged since 4 April. More than 100,000 civilians have fled their homes, electricity has been repeatedly knocked out and indiscriminate rocket and artillery attacks have put civilians’ lives in grave danger.

The organization has today published a damning overview of human rights in Egypt since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s ascent to power, which has been submitted to the UN Human Rights Council ahead of Egypt’s upcoming periodic review of its human rights record in November.
“Since President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power, the human rights situation in Egypt has experienced a catastrophic and unprecedented deterioration. Through a series of draconian laws and repressive tactics by its security forces, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government has orchestrated a concerted campaign to bolster the state’s grip on power by further eroding judicial independence and imposing suffocating restrictions on the media, NGOs, trade unions, political parties, and independent groups and activists,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
Under his rule and under the guise of fighting terrorism, Egypt has witnessed thousands of arbitrary arrests including hundreds targeting peaceful critics and protesters, as well as continuing impunity for widespread human rights violations including torture and other ill-treatment, mass enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and excessive use of force.
Since 2014, more than 1,891 death sentences have been handed down and at least 174 people executed, often following grossly unfair trials.
Of the 300 human rights recommendations made to Egypt by other states during its previous review at the UN Human Rights Council in 2014, Egypt accepted 237 and partially accepted a further 11. However, Amnesty International’s research indicates that in practice Egypt has failed to implement any reforms in line with these recommendations.
Legalizing repression
Egypt’s 2017 NGO law is a prime example of the draconian laws the Egyptian authorities have introduced to stifle freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. The law grants the authorities the powers to deny registration to NGOs, curtails their activities and funding, and permits prosecution of staff for vaguely worded offences. Plans to amend the NGO law were announced in December 2018 but it remains unclear whether the proposed amendments would address human rights concerns. Since 2014, at least 31 NGO staff members have faced travel bans and the authorities have frozen the assets of 10 individuals and seven NGOs as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into the foreign funding of NGOs.
In 2018 Egyptian authorities approved new media and cybercrime laws which have further empowered them to censor print, online and broadcast media. According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, since May 2017, the authorities have blocked at least 513 websites, including news sites and websites of human rights organizations.
A series of legislative amendments signed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in 2017 have also allowed the authorities to carry out mass arbitrary arrests, permit indefinite pre-trial detention and undermine the right to a fair trial.
Since 2013, thousands have been held in pre-trial detention for prolonged periods, sometimes for up to five years, often in inhuman and cruel conditions lacking adequate medical care and with little or no access to family visits. In some cases, police have even detained individuals for months after the courts had ordered their release.
Throughout the period, the Egyptian authorities have routinely relied on a colonial era law on assembly, adopted in 1914, and the draconian protest law of 2013 as well as and the 2015 counter-terrorism law to arbitrarily restrict freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.
During an intensified crackdown between December 2017 and January 2019, at least 158 people were arrested for peacefully criticizing the authorities, attending political gatherings or taking part in protests. More recently, in May and June 2019, the Egyptian authorities arrested at least 10 peaceful opponents, including a former member of parliament, opposition party leaders, journalists and activists.
Egypt’s Military Justice Code also continues, contrary to international standards, to allow trials of civilians before military courts, which lack independence and are inherently unfair. Hundreds have been sentenced to death after unfair mass trials.
The authorities have also passed laws that have enhanced restrictions on independent trade unions and have bolstered impunity for senior members of the armed forces for crimes committed between 2013 and 2016, a period during which hundreds of protesters were unlawfully killed by security forces.
Amendments to Egypt’s constitution adopted in 2019 weaken the rule of law, undermine the independence of the judiciary, expand military trials for civilians, further erode fair trial guarantees and enshrine impunity for members of the armed forces.
The constitutional amendments will also enable President al-Sisi to fully control the implementation of laws that “legalize” repression by granting him far-reaching powers to appoint senior judges and oversee judicial affairs.
“Under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s rule, laws and the judicial system, which are meant to uphold the rule of law and protect people’s rights, have been transformed into tools of repression used to prosecute anyone who peacefully criticizes the authorities, while security forces routinely use torture to extract false confessions and obtain convictions in grossly unfair trials,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
“The international community must stop being silent witnesses to the Egyptian authorities’ decimation of civil society, crushing of all signs of dissent and jailing of peaceful critics and opponents who face torture, enforced disappearances and cruel and inhuman prison conditions. States, particularly those who made human rights recommendations to Egypt during its last UN review have a duty to speak out to stop this catastrophic human rights decline.”
Amnesty International is also calling on all states to take concrete action and suspend the transfer of policing equipment and surveillance technology being used by Egyptian authorities to repress peaceful opposition.

0,BC Government Must Intervene to Protect Tsilhqot’in Rights Threatened by Needless Mining Exploration,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/public-statements/bc-government-must-intervene-protect-tsilhqot-rights-threatened-needless-mining-exploration/, “The Panel is convinced that the Tsilhqot’in cultural attachment to Fish Lake (Teztan Biny) and the Nabas areas is so profound that they cannot reasonably be expected to accept the conversion of that area into the proposed New Prosperity mine.” – from the 2013 federal environmental...," “The Panel is convinced that the Tsilhqot’in cultural attachment to Fish Lake (Teztan Biny) and the Nabas areas is so profound that they cannot reasonably be expected to accept the conversion of that area into the proposed New Prosperity mine.” – from the 2013 federal environmental assessment of the last project proposed by Taseko Mines and ultimately rejected by the federal government  
Amnesty International is urging the Province of British Columbia to suspend permits that could allow destructive mineral exploration to begin as early as this week on lands that the Tsilhqot’in National Government has long sought to protect.
The Tsilhqot’in people describe Teẑtan Biny (Fish Lake) and Yanah Biny (Little Fish Lake) and the surrounding area as “a place of profound cultural and spiritual significance.” The destructive impacts of mining exploration cannot be justified, especially in light of the fact that exploration will almost certainly never lead to the actual opening of a mine. 
The federal government has twice rejected proposals by Taseko Mines Ltd. to open a large, open pit gold-copper mine in the area. Tsilhqot’in concerns over the impacts on their culture, heritage and spiritual traditions were a crucial factor in these decisions. These concerns remain unchanged. 
The fact that the previous provincial government issued new exploration permits in the same area, and to the same company, highlights profound flaws in a provincial mining regulatory system.
In Amnesty International’s views, planned exploration activities in the area of Teẑtan Biny and Yanah Biny violate rights protected in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other international human rights standards, as well as the protection of Indigenous rights in the Canadian Constitution. 
BC’s mining laws are outdated and must be urgently reformed to bring the province in line with its human rights obligations, particularly with regard to upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples. The granting of exploration permits under this flawed system does not shield the province or Taseko Mines from their human rights responsibilities.
The fact that the Taseko Mines is determined to push through exploration despite the continued opposition of the Tsilhqot’in people demonstrates flagrant disregard for its responsibility to respect human rights.
Five years ago, a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Tsilhqot’in people had continued ownership over a large part of their traditional territory, as well as ongoing Aboriginal land use rights over other areas including Teẑtan Biny and Yanah Biny. That decision came after an onerous two-decade long process in which the provincial government fought vigorously to deny and minimize the rights of the Tsilhqot’in people.
The province’s numerous public commitments to reconciliation, and its fundamental legal obligation to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples without discrimination, requires the province to abandon such adversarial approaches. 
The province should work collaboratively with the Tsilhqot’in in respect to the future of Teẑtan Biny and Yanah Biny. The first step must be to suspend the exploration permits that needlessly threaten both this area and the prospects of reconciliation.

‘Saving lives is not a crime’: Politically motivated legal harassment of migrant human rights defenders by the USA reveals how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have increasingly misused the criminal justice system to deter activists, lawyers, journalists, and humanitarian volunteers from challenging – or simply documenting – the systematic human rights violations that US authorities have committed against migrants and asylum seekers.
“The Trump administration’s targeting of human rights defenders through discriminatory misuse of the criminal justice system sets it on a slippery slope toward authoritarianism. The US government is disgracing itself by threatening and even prosecuting its own citizens for their vital work to save the lives of people in a desperate situation at the border,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
The US government has inappropriately investigated human rights defenders for alleged crimes including human smuggling, based on their humanitarian and human rights-related activities, and their expression of political or other opinions. While the most sweeping investigations targeted human rights defenders supporting a large caravan of migrants and asylum seekers in November 2018, authorities have continued to target those and other defenders since then, including simply for helping asylum seekers to know their rights and request protection at an official port of entry.
US authorities have subjected human rights defenders to warrantless surveillance, interrogations, invasive searches, travel restrictions, and, in isolated cases, a false arrest and unlawful detention. In so doing, they have violated the Constitution, US and international law, and DHS policies – all of which prohibit discriminatory restrictions of freedom of speech and expression. In some cases, US and Mexican authorities have reportedly collaborated in the unlawful restrictions against human rights defenders on their shared border.
Amnesty International interviewed 23 human rights defenders, who detailed the restrictions they have faced because of their professional activities. Ten of them – five activists, three lawyers, a journalist and a clergy member – were included on a DHS surveillance watch list, as part of a dubious criminal investigation into human smuggling. They provided similar accounts of how US authorities have used the border region as a criminal dragnet, exploiting their authority to conduct warrantless searches, interrogate travellers about their finances and professional networks, and search their electronic devices – apparently seeking to build criminal cases against them.
“In recent days, President Trump has threatened to arrest and deport millions of people residing irregularly in the USA, including those whose family members are US citizens. Who will authorities target next with spurious charges of smuggling, simply for seeking to support communities who are under attack?” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“The Trump administration must immediately end its politically motivated misuse of the criminal justice system and its abuse of powers to search, detain and interrogate human rights defenders at the border. Instead of targeting lawyers, journalists, and activists for trying to stop human rights violations, the government should be listening to them.”
So far this year, US authorities have criminally prosecuted nine humanitarian volunteers from the organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, for their provision of humanitarian aid to migrants and asylum seekers on the border of Arizona with Mexico, where thousands of people have died over the last two decades. Among the most serious charges, Dr. Scott Warren was prosecuted for alleged crimes of harboring and conspiracy to transport two migrants, simply for providing them with water, food, and medical assistance in the desert town of Ajo, where he lives. The case ended in a mistrial on 11 June, yet federal prosecutors have still not yet dropped the charges against Dr. Warren.
“Humanitarian volunteers have been saving the lives of migrants and asylum seekers for years, in hostile desert terrain that authorities have weaponized against migrants with deadly effects. The US government must immediately drop all charges against Dr. Warren and adopt and implement exemptions from criminal prosecution in all situations involving the provision of humanitarian aid,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

Following reports that the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) army has deployed hundreds of soldiers to forcibly remove an estimated 10,000 artisanal miners from the Tenke Fungurume mines in Lualaba Province to the south of the country from 2 July, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, Sarah Jackson said:
“Given the long history of excessive use of force by the Congolese army and its lack of appropriate training in managing public order, the DRC government must immediately withdraw its armed forces from the mines to avert unlawful killings. These artisanal miners are merely trying to eke out a living and sending in the army against them would be completely irresponsible.”
Background
Lualaba province is part of the former Katanga province in southern DRC and is the country’s most significant copper and cobalt mining area. The government estimating that 20% of the cobalt currently exported from the DRC comes from Katanga’s artisanal miners.
There are about 110,000 regular artisanal miners in the Katanga region, rising to about 150,000 on a seasonal basis. In the absence of authorised artisanal mining areas (ZEAs), many artisanal miners illegally enter private concessions.
Tenke Fungurume Mining Complex in DRC hosts one of the largest, highest-grade producing copper and cobalt mines in the world and is owned by China Molybdenum Co., Ltd., which is listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

“The footage shows clearly that the woman is in distress. To bring criminal charges against her is inappropriate. The state’s priority should be her wellbeing. Her actions may have felt insensitive, but these issues can be resolved peacefully. It is not a matter for the courts.
“In Indonesia, blasphemy laws are often used to target individuals who belong to minority religions or whose interpretations of Islam are not sanctioned by the government. Charges have been levelled against others for their peaceful opinions. This latest, unfortunate and absurd case is further proof that blasphemy laws are not fit for purpose. The police must immediately release the woman and drop the charges against her. Further, authorities in Indonesia should repeal the blasphemy law to comply with their human rights obligations.”
Background
On Sunday, a video of a woman wearing shoes walking with a dog into a mosque in Sentul, West Java, went viral on social media. Congregation members immediately asked her to leave the mosque. Many Muslims consider dogs to be impure, particularly their saliva.
On Monday, a doctor from Kramat Jati Police Hospital in East Jakarta announced that the woman has a mental health diagnosis. The police have charged her with blasphemy on the following day under Article 156(a) of Indonesia’s Criminal Code. She remains in detention and faces up to five years’ imprisonment if found guilty by a court.

“An entirely peaceful Istanbul Pride has yet again been tainted by the shocking unwarranted actions of the police who attacked groups of Pride participants. The wanton use of tear gas and plastic bullets in this context is completely unacceptable and further compounds the unlawful ban LGBTI people and their allies have been subjected to.
“In a blatant attack on freedom of expression, Amnesty International’s representatives monitoring the Pride event received allegations that police announced that people in ‘inappropriate’ dress would be detained.
“We are dismayed at the news that people have been arbitrarily detained by police simply because of their participation in Istanbul pride. They must be immediately and unconditionally released and an urgent investigation into the use of excessive force must be launched.”
Background
The Istanbul Pride march was banned by Istanbul governor’s office from taking place in central Taksim district and elsewhere in the city. Following last minute negotiations between police and Istanbul Pride organizers, the participants were allowed to gather at Mis Street near Taksim square where representatives of the Pride organising committee read out a press statement. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Pride participants who had left Mis Street as they continued to celebrate in small groups in adjacent streets. The Istanbul Pride march has been banned by the authorities since 2015, on unlawful grounds.

Minister of Foreign Affairs                            Minister of Justice
Ottawa, Ontario                                                Ottawa, Ontario
June 30, 2019
Dear Ministers Freeland and Lametti,
We are writing this Open Letter to you in response to last week’s Globe and Mail report indicating that the Montreal-based agency Dickens & Madson, headed by Canadian citizen Ari Ben-Menashe, has entered into a contract with Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC), which has ruled Sudan since Sudan’s former president Omar al-Bashir was removed from power and arrested on April 11, 2019.  We urge the Canadian government to investigate this contract closely and pursue all available measures to ensure that it does not facilitate or contribute to human rights violations in Sudan.
As you will be aware, the TMC has in recent weeks been responsible for grave human rights violations in responding to protests and the popular movement pressing for fundamental human rights and democratic reforms in Sudan.  That includes attacks on peaceful protesters by the country’s notorious paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) during the morning of June 3, 2019, which resulted in more than 100 deaths and serious injuries of at least 700 people. There are numerous reports of security forces dumping bodies into the Nile River, weighted with bricks. Hundreds of people have been arrested and detained. Security forces have stormed a hospital, firing live ammunition and tear gas at patients and medical staff, in an attempt to arrest injured protesters. Furthermore, the Sudanese population faces considerable obstacles in communicating within and outside the country at this very worrying time, because officials have imposed a shutdown of the internet. A sense of fear and terror prevails in the country.
Amnesty International has also recently publicized new evidence of Sudanese government forces, including the RSF, continuing to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur.  We have documented the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings and sexual violence.  Notably, senior commanders in charge of the TMC, which includes the RSF, are the same individuals responsible for these atrocities in Darfur.
By any measure Sudan, which has had an abysmal human rights record for decades, is in the midst of a full-blown human rights crisis. Given these urgent concerns, Amnesty International has pressed the UN Human Rights Council, currently in session, to convene a Special Session or at least schedule an emergency debate as part of the regular session of the Council, so as to move forward with independent investigations and other measures. 
In this context it is deeply disturbing to learn that a Canadian citizen, heading a Canadian-based agency, entered into a contractual relationship with the TMC on May 7. A reported copy – which we have been able to review – includes promises to: 
lobby the US, Saudi, Russian and other governments, as well as the United Nations, African Union and other organizations and NGOS, to assist in “the devising and execution of policies for the beneficial development of [the TMC’s] political aims”;
attain recognition for the TMC as the “legitimate transitional leadership” in Sudan and “create a supervisory role for [the TMC]”;
arrange meetings for the TMC with “senior personalities in the United States”, including a “public meeting between the Honorable President Trump and [the TMC]”;
arrange “private meetings … with senior Russian and other political figures”;
“use best efforts to ensure favourable international as well as Sudanese media coverage” for the TMC;
“strive to obtain funding and equipment for the Sudanese military”;
“strive to obtain funding for [the TMC] from the Eastern Libyan Military Command in exchange for [Sudanese] military help to the LNA (Libyan National Army)”;[1]
arrange meetings with “Heads of various Middle Eastern Governments … to enhance mutual cooperation especially in the field of internal security”;
“strive to secure … U.S. investment in a joint oil project involving the Republic of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan”; and
“provide military training and security equipment to [Sudanese] military forces.” 
Ministers, Amnesty International is calling on the international community, including Canada, to pursue action to address the situation in Sudan.  Our recommendations include pressing for all members of the RSF to be withdrawn from policing and law enforcement throughout the country; and calling for army officers, police and intelligence officials, including members of the RSF, who are suspected of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations, to be suspended, pending investigations leading to prosecution when there is sufficient admissible evidence. 
Those recommendations are undermined by this contract, which is intent on strengthening and bolstering the position of the TMC, of which the RSF is a key member.  It is also deeply concerning that this contractual arrangement proposes alliances which would potentially link and deepen the human rights crises in both Sudan and Libya.
Notably, the contract involves or contemplates business dealings with three countries – Sudan, Libya and South Sudan – that are currently subject to sanctions imposed by the federal government under the United Nations Act and/or Special Economic Measures Act.  Beyond general concerns about business dealings are specific considerations about possible arms deals.  In the case of Sudan, the contract explicitly obligates Dickens & Madson to seek “equipment for the Sudanese military” and “military training and security equipment” for Sudanese forces. With respect to Libya, the reference to “military help” gives rise to the obvious possibility of the sale or exchange of military equipment.  
In this context, it is vital that the Canadian government ensure that no action under this contract breaches Canadian arms control laws and regulations, a particularly important consideration in the wake of Canada having acceded to the UN Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on June 19, 2019. The activities contemplated in this contract may constitute brokering as defined by the Export and Import Permits Act. Upon the entry into force of Bill C-47 and its accompanying regulations on September 1, 2019, the brokering of certain military equipment by Canadian citizens and Canadian corporations will require a brokering permit. We expect that any application for such a permit by Mr. Ben-Menashe and/or Dickens & Madson for its activities related to the TMC contract will be subject to thorough scrutiny in light of Sudan, Libya and South Sudan’s human rights records and in full compliance with both Canadian law and Canada’s international legal obligations under the ATT.
Ministers, we expect that you will share Amnesty International’s concerns about this situation and look forward to hearing of the steps you propose to take to investigate thoroughly and take action. We would welcome a meeting with you or your officials to discuss these concerns further.
Sincerely,

Ahead of the nationwide protests planned for 30 June to mark 30 years since former President Omar al-Bashir’s seized power through a military coup, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said:
“The horrific unprovoked use of lethal and unnecessary force against peaceful protestors as witnessed on 3 June must not be repeated this Sunday, or ever again. The transitional authorities must fully respect and uphold the Sudanese peoples’ rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association; and protect their lives.
“Since the bloody crackdown earlier this month, there has been an alarming regression on human rights. This includes an ongoing internet shutdown, attacks on the media and the refusal to allow opposition groups to organize public forums, as well as the continued dispersal of peaceful protestors using unnecessary and excessive force. This clampdown clearly points to the return of the repressive days associated with al-Bashir.
“Despite the brutal attempts to shut down these protests and close access to the outside world by blocking social media, the rest of the world has seen very clearly the passion with which Sudanese people are campaigning for their human rights. The Transitional Military Council must not allow the country to slide back into yet more repression. The world is watching.”
Background
Horrific attacks on peaceful protestors in Khartoum on 3 June led to more than 100 people being killed, and over 700 injured. The Sudanese security forces also committed savage acts of sexual violence against men and women on the same day.

Spokespeople will attend the event and are available for interview 
The Istanbul Pride march will take place on Sunday 30 June in spite of a decision by the Governorate of Istanbul to ban the celebrations. 
“Fifty years ago today, LGBTI+ people took to the streets outside the Stonewall Inn in New York City to fight against bigotry and prejudice – and they won. On Sunday, thousands will take to the streets of Istanbul, defying an unlawful ban and possibly braving plastic bullets, teargas and police batons, to celebrate Pride,” said Sara Hall, Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director.
“By rejecting all suggested locations in the city, including designated protest areas, the authorities have exposed what really lies behind this ban. It has nothing to do with security or public order concerns; it is instead a naked attempt to erase the public collective presence of a group which, in the words of the Governorate, is deemed to be ‘societally objectionable.”  
“There is still time for the authorities to do the right thing and ensure Istanbul’s annual celebration of love, inclusion and diversity takes place free from state harassment and intimidation for the first time since 2015.
This year we call on the authorities to ensure that there is only joy – and not blood – on the streets this weekend.”
Thousands of people are still expected to gather on the streets of Istanbul on Sunday, Amnesty International therefore urges the Governorate of Istanbul to urgently lift this groundless and arbitrary ban. In the past, those trying to peacefully defy Pride bans have been met with police batons, plastic bullets, water cannons and tear gas.

This is the first Pride season since the lifting of Turkey’s state of emergency in July 2018. The Istanbul Pride had been celebrated since 2003 as a peaceful and inclusive event. However, the Istanbul Pride march has been banned by the authorities since 2015, on unlawful grounds.
A series of negotiations with the authorities took place in early June. Amnesty has been appealing to both the Istanbul Governorate and the Minister of Interior to ensure Pride takes place in Istanbul.
On 14 June the Governorship of Izmir banned all Pride events, followed by the governorate of Antalya the next day. In Mersin this week, Pride events were banned for 20 days.

Amnesty International is shocked by President Sirisena’s announcement that he has signed the execution warrants of four death row prisoners convicted of drug-related crimes, and that they will be hanged in “the near future.”
While the President has confirmed signing the death warrants, no names have been revealed and no details have been shared about any scheduled executions or information on the cases. The lack of transparency makes it impossible to ascertain whether these prisoners have exhausted clemency appeals or if all safeguards were followed in their conviction or sentencing. There is also no confirmation that the four prisoners, or their families, have been alerted to their imminent execution.
The executions would be the first time Sri Lanka has implemented the death penalty since 1976.
“We are outraged that the President has signed the first execution warrants issued by Sri Lanka in 43 years. In one stroke, he will undo all the country’s progress in putting a stop to the use of the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International.
Earlier, Amnesty International had learned that there are 13 prisoners who are at grave risk of imminent execution. It is unclear if their execution warrants have also been issued and signed or that they will be in the future.
Executions for drug-related offences are unlawful. They do not meet the threshold for “most serious crimes” – i.e. intentional killing – to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international human rights law and standards.
“At a time when other countries have come to the realization that their drug control policies are in need of reform, and are taking steps to reduce the use of the death penalty, Sri Lanka is bucking the trend. This will be devastating to the country’s international reputation and we hope that President Sirisena will reconsider his decision,” said Biraj Patnaik.
States have a duty to ensure all proceedings have complied with international standards for a fair trial, including respecting the right to appeal, and to apply for clemency, and ensuring that the prisoners, their families and legal representatives are given adequate notice of any plans to carry out the execution.
Amnesty International absolutely opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. The human rights organization calls on the Sri Lankan government to halt its current execution plans and establish an official moratorium on the implementation of death sentences, with a view to abolishing the death penalty altogether. 
Background
Amnesty International has repeatedly called on President Sirisena to halt his plans to resume executions, making clear that the death penalty does not have a unique deterrent effect on crime. The human rights organization absolutely opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the crime committed or method of execution.
In the briefing, Sri Lanka: Halt Preparations to Resume Executions, Amnesty International highlights how the death penalty in Sri Lanka is being used in circumstances that violate international law and standards, has failed to act as a unique deterrent to crime in other countries, could claim the lives of people who may have been convicted through unfair trials, and could disproportionately affect people from minority and less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds.
Sri Lanka is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which sets the abolition of the death penalty as the goal to be achieved by countries that still retain this punishment. Instead of resuming executions, the Sri Lankan authorities must take measures to erase the death penalty from the country’s laws.

They demanded identification and arrested anyone they suspected of being gay or dressed in a way that didn’t conform to mainstream society’s narrow understanding of gender. 
The events that followed would spark the modern LGBTI rights movement, inspiring the first LGBTI Pride parade down Christopher Street.   
In 1969, it was still illegal to be gay in most parts of the US. For many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, nights out at places like the Stonewall Inn were the only times where they could openly be themselves. The venue was known for its celebration of inclusion and also became a safe space for sex workers and the homeless. 
In the early hours of 28 June 1969, as police started harassing everyone in the bar and dragging them into the backs of squad cars, the Stonewall patrons didn’t just protest a police raid on a bar: They were protecting their home. 
  
How did the Stonewall Riots start? 
Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson leading a protest at City Hall in New York 
There is still some debate over the exact moment the riots started. But people who were there that night agree that three women of colour, Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Stormé Delarvarie were pivotal in inspiring the other guests to rise up against the police.  
Police raids at the Stonewall Inn were by no means a rare occurrence. In fact, regardless of where they were or how openly they expressed themselves, many LGBTI people lived in constant fear of being arrested for “crimes against nature”, being attacked or losing their jobs and livelihoods if they were ever discovered. In the face of such blatant oppression and violence, a few voices of resistance ignited that first spark.  
Like many transgender people at the time, Marsha and Sylvia faced constant harassment, particularly from the police. Since it was illegal for people assigned male at birth to wear women’s clothes (and vice versa) they and other trans women and drag queens at the Stonewall Inn were forced into the bathroom, strip searched and arrested if it was revealed that they were born with male characteristics. 
Marsha and Sylvia refused to comply with these demands and decided to defend themselves, intensifying the tension between the police and the customers. Only moments later, you could hear people chanting: “We shall overcome” and “Gay Power” from down the street which provoked crowds to gather outside the venue. 
 
Meanwhile, Stormé Delarvarie, a biracial lesbian from Louisiana, was outside and was shoved into the back of a squad car after being beaten over the head by a police helmet. She shouted to onlookers outside, “Why don’t you do something?”. The crowd responded to her call and jumped to defend those who were still inside. 
People started throwing coins and bottles at the police, forcing the officers to retreat into the bar. Trash cans were thrown through the window as the crowds grew outside. For many of the people there that night, it was the first time that they could stand up and declare that they weren’t going to tolerate discriminatory treatment from the police or anyone else any longer. 
The officers called in back up in an effort to control the protestors, even bringing in tear gas to scatter the riots, but the crowds outside continued to grow. It would be another four days before the riots simmered to a close. 
  
Defending human rights at the Stonewall Riots 
The riots at the Stonewall Inn are an iconic demonstration of how a single decision, an instinctive reaction to injustice, can be the first step to igniting a movement that can change the course of history.  
When Marsha and Sylvia decided to go out that night, there was no way they could have imagined that their actions would become defining moments in the struggle for LGBTI rights around the world.

Stonewall’s legacy 
A year after Stonewall on 28 June 1970, people returned to the Stonewall Inn and marked the anniversary as Christopher Street Liberation Day. This parade became known as the first LGBTI Pride festival and served as a catalyst to other movements and events across the globe. 
Even though LGBTI people had long-standing acceptance in many cultures around the world, the centuries preceding what would become known as the Gay Liberation Movement were dominated by a primarily Western narrative of gender and sexuality that forced many to repress their true selves and conform to society’s expectations. 
The Stonewall riots were the first step in a series of events in the late 20th century that would pave the way for legal and social change that would improve the lives of LGBTI people. The people who organized the protests that night became examples that would embolden LGBTI people around the world to resist bigotry and embrace diversity. 
Decades after the riots, there are now hundreds of Pride festivals around the world, with thousands of participants every year. Although it can still be incredibly dangerous to participate in LGBTI activism in some parts of the world, to most people attending these events, Pride is a time for LGBTI+ people to celebrate and be celebrated by their communities, a noteworthy sign of progress when you think about the way Marsha, Sylvia and Stormé were attacked 50 years ago. But their legacy stands to remind us that Pride was, and always will be, built on the tradition of protest, outrage and a hunger for equality.

They demanded identification and arrested anyone they suspected of being gay or dressed in a way that didn’t conform to mainstream society’s narrow understanding of gender. 
The events that followed would spark the modern LGBTI rights movement, inspiring the first LGBTI Pride parade down Christopher Street.   
In 1969, it was still illegal to be gay in most parts of the US. For many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, nights out at places like the Stonewall Inn were the only times where they could openly be themselves. The venue was known for its celebration of inclusion and also became a safe space for sex workers and the homeless. 
In the early hours of 28 June 1969, as police started harassing everyone in the bar and dragging them into the backs of squad cars, the Stonewall patrons didn’t just protest a police raid on a bar: They were protecting their home. 
How did the Stonewall Riots start? 

Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson leading a protest at City Hall in New York 
There is still some debate over the exact moment the riots started. But people who were there that night agree that three women of colour, Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Stormé Delarvarie were pivotal in inspiring the other guests to rise up against the police.  
Police raids at the Stonewall Inn were by no means a rare occurrence. In fact, regardless of where they were or how openly they expressed themselves, many LGBTI people lived in constant fear of being arrested for “crimes against nature”, being attacked or losing their jobs and livelihoods if they were ever discovered. In the face of such blatant oppression and violence, a few voices of resistance ignited that first spark.  
Like many transgender people at the time, Marsha and Sylvia faced constant harassment, particularly from the police. Since it was illegal for people assigned male at birth to wear women’s clothes (and vice versa) they and other trans women and drag queens at the Stonewall Inn were forced into the bathroom, strip searched and arrested if it was revealed that they were born with male characteristics. 
Marsha and Sylvia refused to comply with these demands and decided to defend themselves, intensifying the tension between the police and the customers. Only moments later, you could hear people chanting: “We shall overcome” and “Gay Power” from down the street which provoked crowds to gather outside the venue. 
 
Meanwhile, Stormé Delarvarie, a biracial lesbian from Louisiana, was outside and was shoved into the back of a squad car after being beaten over the head by a police helmet. She shouted to onlookers outside, “Why don’t you do something?”. The crowd responded to her call and jumped to defend those who were still inside. 
People started throwing coins and bottles at the police, forcing the officers to retreat into the bar. Trash cans were thrown through the window as the crowds grew outside. For many of the people there that night, it was the first time that they could stand up and declare that they weren’t going to tolerate discriminatory treatment from the police or anyone else any longer. 
The officers called in back up in an effort to control the protestors, even bringing in tear gas to scatter the riots, but the crowds outside continued to grow. It would be another four days before the riots simmered to a close. 
Defending human rights at the Stonewall Riots 
The riots at the Stonewall Inn are an iconic demonstration of how a single decision, an instinctive reaction to injustice, can be the first step to igniting a movement that can change the course of history.  
When Marsha and Sylvia decided to go out that night, there was no way they could have imagined that their actions would become defining moments in the struggle for LGBTI rights around the world. Although they had been active campaigners for trans people’s and sex worker’s rights, their participation in the Stonewall Riots would lead them to found STAR (Street Transvestite* Action Revolutionaries) as well as becoming key leaders in the Gay Liberation Front. 
Similarly, Stormé Delarverie was a known figure in the LGBTI community on Christopher Street and was a regular drag king performer and emcee at some of the venues in the area.

She passed away in 2014 and lived to see same sex marriage become legally recognized in New York in 2011.

Following the publication of a “Government agreement” committing itself to introduce consent-based rape legislation Amnesty International’s Women’s Rights Researcher, Anna Błuś, said:
“This commitment by the new government to amend Danish law to recognize the simple truth that sex without consent is rape in law is a welcome if long-overdue, step forward. It is a testament to all the survivors who have spoken out and all the campaigners who have fought long and hard for change.
“Together with the survivors campaigning for improved access to justice, we look forward to seeing the draft law and hope that the authorities also commit themselves to taking steps to challenge rape myths and gender stereotypes at all levels of society. This will require institutional and social change, as well as comprehensive sexuality and relationships education, including on sexual consent.
“Shockingly, Denmark will be only the tenth country in Europe (EEA) to recognize that sex without consent is rape in law. However, coming hard on the heels of the decision to amend the law in Greece this month, and legislation in Sweden last year, we are confident that the momentum for change in Europe and beyond is now unstoppable.”

BACKGROUND
Read the statement published today here.
Rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the 24,000 women found by a recent study to have experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017 alone, just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions.
Amnesty International has analysed rape legislation in 31 countries in Europe, and only nine of them have laws that define rape as sex without consent.

The shutdown has created an information black hole in an area where the Myanmar military has committed serious violations – including war crimes – raising serious concerns about the safety of civilians. It is essential that the Myanmar authorities ensure the right to information in times of crisis.
On 20 June 2019, Myanmar’s Ministry of Transport and Communications instructed mobile operators in Myanmar to “temporarily” suspend internet access in nine townships – Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Maungdaw, Minbya, Mrauk-U, Myebon, Ponnagyun, and Rathedaung in Rakhine State and Paletwa in Chin State. The shutdown went into effect at 10 p.m. on 21 June. Since then, people living in the affected areas have been unable to access the internet, although mobile telephone calls and text messaging services are still available. A government official quoted in local media said the shutdown, believed to have been invoked under Section 77 of the 2013 Telecommunications Law,[1] is in place as a result of “weak rule of law” and “instability” in the area.[2] According to one mobile operator, the government directive referenced “disturbances of the peace and use of internet services to coordinate illegal activities” as a justification for the shutdown.[3] The government has yet to make an official statement, and it remains unclear how long the shutdown will continue.
The shutdown applies to an area where Amnesty International has recently documented serious violations, including war crimes, by the Myanmar military, as well as abuses by the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic Rakhine armed group operating in western and northern Myanmar. Fighting between the two forces has escalated since the start of 2019 and is ongoing, raising the prospect of additional crimes being committed.
Activists, journalists, and others in the affected areas rely on the internet – in particular encrypted messaging services – to document and share information about the situation there, including allegations of human rights abuses. Without secure methods of communication, they are forced to rely on less secure means of communication, such as telephone calls and text messages, meaning they risk being surveilled, harassed, or arrested and prosecuted in connection with their work. At least three news editors are currently facing politically-motivated charges in connection with their reporting on Rakhine State, while other journalists face threats, harassment, and intimidation.
The shutdown will also make it more difficult for humanitarian workers to monitor the situation and respond to new displacement, and could hamper the supply of life-saving medical treatment and assistance to displaced populations. According to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), some 23,000 people are currently displaced as a result of the fighting between the Myanmar military and the AA. However, the authorities – both civilian and military – have imposed severe restrictions on humanitarian access.
Amnesty International is also concerned about the wider human rights impacts of the shutdown. Affected users are restricted in their access to emergency services, and other information and services, including healthcare. The shutdown will also make it difficult for the government to disseminate information to communities in the affected areas – including information about the ongoing fighting which could be vital for the safety and protection of the civilian population.
The right to freedom of expression includes the right to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Restrictions on the right to freedom of expression must be the exception rather than the rule, and must be provided in law; applied only in specific circumstances, namely to protect the rights and reputation of others, to ensure national security, public order, public health, or public morals; and be necessary and proportionate, that is, the least restrictive means required to achieve any of the above aims. All three requirements need to be met for a restriction to accord with international human rights law and standards.[4]
While Amnesty International acknowledges that the government is permitted to restrict the right to freedom of expression in certain circumstances, the organization does not believe the current shutdown complies with requirements for restrictions on freedom of expression set out under international human rights law. It is unclear what criteria were used to decide to cut off internet access or what mechanisms are available to challenge the decision, in violation of the requirement of legality. The decision to deprive a large part of the population in Rakhine and Chin States their right to access all online information and secure messaging is a particularly broad and sweeping restriction, which clearly fails the requirements of proportionality and necessity.
The UN Human Rights Council has unequivocally condemned “measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law”, and has called on all States to “refrain from and cease such measures”.[5] Similarly, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of expression has stated that “[a] general network shutdown is in clear violation of international law and cannot be justified by any means… Shutdowns are damaging not only for people’s access to information, but also for their access to basic services.”[6]
Private companies have a responsibility to respect human rights independent of state actions or obligations, and over and above compliance with national laws. As such, Amnesty International also calls on all mobile operators and telecommunications providers in Myanmar to urgently seek clarification from the Myanmar authorities regarding the shutdown, publicly and privately call for the immediate resumption of internet access in Rakhine and Chin States, and pursue all legal options to challenge the decision to cut internet access.
Background
There has been a significant escalation in fighting between the Myanmar military and the Arakan Army (AA) since January 2019. Amnesty International has documented serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by the Myanmar military, including unlawful attacks which have killed and injured civilians, arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances, and forced labour. Some of these violations amount to war crimes. Amnesty International has also documented abuses by the AA, including abductions and arbitrary deprivation of liberty.
Many of the violations documented by Amnesty International were committed by soldiers from the Myanmar Army’s 22nd and 55th Light Infantry Divisions (LIDs). Other violations were committed by soldiers from units under Western Command, the regional military command based in Rakhine State and which has been implicated in atrocities against the Rohingya population from August 2017. More than 730,000 Rohingya women, men, and children were forced to flee a devastating campaign of violence which included widespread killings, rape and sexual violence, and the burning of hundreds of Rohingya homes and villages. A UN Fact-Finding Mission has called for senior military officials to be investigated and tried for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide.
Amnesty International reiterates its call to the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court (ICC), to impose a comprehensive global arms embargo, and to impose targeted financial sanctions against senior officials responsible for serious violations and crimes.

Filibuster a blow to democracy and human rights but cannot turn back the clock on implementation of UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
“There are and always have been obvious flaws in a governing system that is designed to maintain a status quo and deny rights to people who power rejects. The process of bringing C-262 along the legislative path has highlighted this for me… Let us rise with more energy. Let us stand with a greater determination.” 
                   – MP Romeo Saganash, author of Bill C-262  
When the United Nations General Assembly adopted the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in September 2007, it established an obligation for all states to fully implement this crucial instrument as the minimum global standard to the protect the human rights of Indigenous peoples. The solemn commitment of all states to uphold the UN Declaration has since been reaffirmed by 10 consensus resolutions of the General Assembly. 
Our Nations and organizations are outraged by the failure of the Senate to pass Bill C-262, a bill that would have provided a principled and collaborative legislative framework to guide the implementation of the UN Declaration in Canada.
Many individuals from all walks of life have embraced C-262 as a crucial means of reconciliation and were shocked that a handful of Conservative Senators were able to block the passage of such urgent and long overdue human rights legislation in such an undemocratic, illegitimate and indeed discriminatory manner. 
In April 2019, Conservative MPs joined with all other members in the House of Commons to adopt a unanimous motion supporting both Bill C-262 and a second private member’s bill, Bill C-337 that provides for sexual-assault training for judges. This motion underlined that “both critical pieces of legislation … have been duly passed by the House of Commons” and “both bills should be passed into law at the earliest opportunity”.
Despite having supported this motion, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer failed to ensure his unelected Senate members would respect the express will of the House of Commons. As a result, both institutions of Parliament are being undermined.
Such prejudicial actions also undermine reconciliation in Canada. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has emphasized that the UN Declaration “is the framework for reconciliation at all levels and across all sectors of Canadian society.” In addition, the final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls relies on the UN Declaration and other human rights instruments in ensuring the security and well-being of Indigenous peoples and individuals.
Despite this serious breach of democratic principles, it must be emphasized that the actions of these Senators do not in any way diminish Canada’s obligations to implement the UN Declaration. Nor does the failure to adopt C-262 diminish our intention to hold the Government of Canada accountable to such obligations.
The will of Parliament to implement the UN Declaration is now clearly established. Bill C-262 was adopted by a majority vote of the House of Commons in 2018. In addition to the subsequent unanimous motion supporting the Bill, the intent to uphold and implement the UN Declaration is set out in a number of other bills that were passed into law during the current session including C-69 (impact assessment), C-91 (Indigenous languages) and C-92 (Indigenous child and family services). 
The work of implementation will continue despite the setback in the Senate. Indigenous governments are incorporating the UN Declaration into their own laws and procedures and using it to inform their expectations of partnerships with government and industry. Canadian courts and tribunals are already using the UN Declaration to interpret Indigenous rights in domestic law. The clock cannot be turned back.
It has recently been confirmed that the Liberals, if re-elected, will reintroduce UN Declaration implementation legislation as a government bill. Our Nations and organizations are urging all federal political parties to commit both to supporting a legislative framework for UN Declaration implementation that is at least as strong as C-262 and to ending the kind of partisan game-playing that prevented adoption of C-262 in this session of Parliament.

The announcement was made ahead of a hearing at the regional Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Community Court of Justice on 27 June 2019, where the case was initially filed in May 2018.
“We at Amnesty International believe this ban clearly conflicts with the right to education without discrimination, according to international and regional standards,” said Lucy Claridge, Director of Strategic Litigation at Amnesty International.
“Courts from South Africa, Zimbabwe to Colombia have already found that such bans violate the rights of women and girls to be treated equally and to receive education. This case represents the first time that a regional court in Africa has considered the issue. It therefore has the potential to impact the situation of pregnant girls outside of Sierra Leone and even beyond the ECOWAS community.”
Amnesty International has documented how the ban, which was imposed after the Ebola crisis in 2015 by Sierra Leone’s then Minister of Education, put the rights of thousands of girls under threat.
Background
On 17 May 2018, a Sierra Leonean NGO (WAVES) in partnership with Equality Now and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa, filed a case before the ECOWAS Court challenging Sierra Leone’s ban on pregnant girls attending school and taking exams. This will be the second hearing in the case.
The Court has granted permission for Amnesty International to intervene as amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), to provide the Court with further information on how other international, regional and national bodies have treated policies that, like those in Sierra Leone, restrict the rights of pregnant girls to education, non-discrimination, bodily integrity and freedom from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.
Amnesty International has submitted third party and amicus curiae interventions before in a diverse range of domestic and international courts and bodies, including the ECOWAS Court, the European Court of Human Rights and Inter-American Court of Human Rights, providing expertise on matters of international human rights law, international criminal law and international humanitarian law.

Amnesty International is alarmed to learn from media reports that preparations are underway to execute death row prisoners as part of the so-called National Drug Eradication Week, from June 21 – July 1, 2019. The executions would be the first time Sri Lanka has implemented the death penalty since 1976.
“We are dismayed by these reports that will see Sri Lanka surrender its positive record on the death penalty. Executions will not rid Sri Lanka of drug-related crime. They represent the failure to build a humane society where the protection of life is valued. The last thing that Sri Lanka needs right now is more death in the name of vengeance,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International.
While no official announcement has been made by the President’s Office, several sources have confirmed to Amnesty International that the newly-recruited executioners have been trained and that President Sirisena has every intention to resume hangings.
Executions for drug-related offences are unlawful. They do not meet the threshold for “most serious crimes” – i.e. intentional killing – to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international human rights law and standards.
The details of the scheduled executions, how many prisoners at risk of execution remain unknown and it is not clear what the circumstances of their convictions and sentencing are.
By keeping these plans secret, the Government of Sri Lanka is preventing the public and human rights activists from accessing vital information to ensure that critical safeguards put in place by the international community to protect the rights of those facing the death penalty are fully observed.
“The taking of a human life by the state is one of the gravest acts a government can commit. The severity of the punishment as a minimum requires complete transparency as a key safeguard of due process,” said Biraj Patnaik.
States have a duty to ensure all proceedings have complied with international standards for a fair trial, including respecting the right to appeal and apply for clemency, and ensuring that the prisoners, their families and legal representatives are given adequate notice of any plans to carry out the execution. It is not clear that this process has been followed in these cases.
Amnesty International absolutely opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. The human rights organization calls on the Sri Lankan government to halt its current execution plans and establish an official moratorium on the implementation of death sentences, with a view to abolishing the death penalty altogether.  
Background
Amnesty International has repeatedly called on President Sirisena to halt his plans to resume executions, making clear that the death penalty does not have a unique deterrent effect on crime. The human rights organization absolutely opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, regardless of the crime committed or method of execution.
In the briefing, Sri Lanka: Halt Preparations to Resume Executions, Amnesty International highlights how the death penalty in Sri Lanka is being used in circumstances that violate international law and standards, has failed to act as a unique deterrent to crime in other countries, could claim the lives of people who may have been convicted through unfair trials, and could disproportionately affect people from minority and less advantaged socio-economic backgrounds.
Sri Lanka is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which sets the abolition of the death penalty as the goal to be achieved by countries that still retain this punishment. Instead of resuming executions, the Sri Lankan authorities must take measures to erase the death penalty from the country’s laws.

“President Bukele’s government has a great opportunity to set El Salvador on a new course, but it also has a responsibility to ensure that human rights are central in decision-making and in the design and implementation of the nation’s public policies,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Given the enormous human rights challenges also faced by the neighboring countries of Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, this is a deeply concerning time for Central America. We therefore urge El Salvador’s new government to take a proactive role in promoting the protection of human rights in the region.”
President Bukele pledged to create an inter-ministerial roundtable to discuss strategies to improve the human rights situation in the country. He also promised to open up to international scrutiny and allow access to different bodies, such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. He was firm in his commitment to become a distinct voice in Central America and to condemn human rights violations committed in the rest of the region.
The Amnesty International delegation told him that, sadly, El Salvador is best known for two issues: violations of women’s and girls’ human rights through the total ban on abortion, and for the widespread violence in the country.
The president stressed that his government will not criminalize women and girls – especially those who live in situations of poverty – and will guarantee their sexual and reproductive rights. With respect to public security, he committed to implementing a comprehensive strategy that prioritizes an approach centered around prevention and rehabilitation. He also recognized the important work of Salvadoran civil society organizations and the role of human rights defenders in the country.
This constructive exchange must result in concrete action. Amnesty International is taking President Bukele’s word that he will push forward a human rights agenda, but will also be watching closely to ensure that El Salvador’s government complies with its international human rights commitments.
“Amnesty International will continue accompanying Salvadoran human rights organizations, who we hope will have the opportunity to share with the president their concerns and recommendations about the challenges facing the country as soon as possible,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

“The leaders of the Americas must step up and overcome the grave challenges facing the region. This is the most dangerous place in the world for human rights defenders, particularly those standing for climate justice and the environment, and it is also the scene of two major global human rights crises in Nicaragua and Venezuela,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
Last year, 241 people were killed for standing up for human rights in the Americas, more than two thirds of the global total. At the same time, more than 300 people were killed and over 700 people faced criminal charges for protesting in Nicaragua. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, the deepening human rights crisis has driven more than 4 million people to leave their country, and just this year nearly 1,000 people have been arrested and scores killed during protests, while many more have faced ill treatment and torture for taking to the streets to demand change.
“With so much at stake in the Americas, states must make clear and specific commitments to protect human rights defenders, including by swiftly ratifying the Escazú Agreement. They must also strengthen their demands for truth, justice and reparations for all the victims of the grave human rights crises in Nicaragua and Venezuela, as well as ensuring that effective protective measures are in place for those fleeing Venezuela, and that humanitarian aid reaches those still in the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
Amnesty International is also calling on states to respect the autonomy and independence of the Inter-American Human Rights System, ahead of the appointment of four new Human Rights Commissioners during the General Assembly.
This comes after five states from the region issued a statement in April with recommendations for “strengthening the Inter-American Human Rights System”, which was largely rejected as an attempt to weaken the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.
“If states are serious about confronting the harsh realities facing the Americas, then they must shift their approach from stale political debate and alarming efforts to weaken the Inter-American Human Rights System towards decisive action in favour of the human rights of everyone in the region,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
An Amnesty International delegation will be present during the 49th General Assembly of the Organization of American States and spokespeople will be available for interviews.

Under an interim decision from the CJEU from November 2018, Polish authorities had already been ordered to restore the Supreme Court to its composition before April 2018, when the law came into force.
In response to the news, Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office, said:
“Today the European Union’s top court has confirmed what we have long been saying, that the Polish government acted against EU law when it attempted to force almost a third of Supreme Court judges to retire and attempted to exert control over the judiciary.”
The amendment of the Law on the Supreme Court is part of a broader “reform” of the judiciary in Poland. Amnesty International considers that these changes effectively politicize the judiciary and undermine its independence.
“Despite numerous procedures going on to challenge this “reform”, the Polish authorities have continued to harass and discipline judges who they presumably considered to be unfavourable to their cause. It is imperative that they return to the respect of EU law. Today’s ruling is significant not only for Poland but for other European Union countries who think that they can breach human rights with impunity.”
“We call on Member States to follow suit and issue a clear call on Polish authorities to change their course and fully restore the independence of the judiciary.”

Background
Amnesty International has been documenting the situation in Poland’s judiciary since the beginning of the “reforms” in 2016. On 4 July 2019, the organization will launch a report “Poland: Free Courts, Free People” documenting the impact of the changes on human rights.
The Polish Law on the Supreme Court, which entered into force on 3 April 2018, lowers the retirement age of Supreme Court judges from 70 to 65, putting roughly a third of Supreme Court judges at risk of forced retirement, including the First President, whose mandate expires only in 2020 under the Polish Constitution.
On 24 September 2018, the European Commission took the government of Poland to the CJEU on grounds that the Polish law on the Supreme Court is incompatible with EU law because it undermines the principle of judicial independence, including the fact that judges should not be removed. In October 2018 the CJEU granted interim measures requested by the European Commission, meaning Poland’s Supreme Court had to be restored to its makeup before 3 April 2018.
In December 2017, the European Commission initiated so-called Article 7.1 TEU proceedings with regard to Poland, beginning a process that could lead to sanctions, including a loss of voting rights in the EU. Earlier this year, the European Commission started infringement proceedings regarding the disciplinary regime for judges. Another case brought by the European Commission, regarding the common courts, as well as several requests for preliminary rulings from Poland, are currently pending before the CJEU. So far, Polish authorities have shown little willingness to backtrack on the contested reforms of the judiciary, despite clear calls from the European Commission, EU leaders, the Venice Commission and a wide range of other national and international bodies and organizations.

Over the course of the past two months, government agencies have repeatedly arbitrarily summoned al-Tamimi for questioning. Since 2012, the authorities have subjected al-Tamimi to a smear campaign by way of government-linked press publishing fabricated accusations against him. During this period, the authorities have refused to investigate a number of serious incidents targeting al-Tamimi’s businesses and personal safety.
“Osama Muhana al-Tamimi is one of the few openly critical Sunni voices in Bahrain. His harassment comes as no surprise, and serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing, multi-faceted means the authorities have been resorting to, to silence any independent thinking in the Kingdom,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Research.
Osama Muhana al-Tamimi entered Bahrain’s Council of Representatives after a by-election in October 2011. In a speech in parliament in April 2012, he called for the resignation of Prime Minister Khalifah bin Salman Al Khalifah. On 11 February 2014, he called for the release of prisoner of conscience Nabeel Rajab, the Shi’a head of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights.
In November 2016, al-Tamimi was sentenced to a month in prison for “insulting” a police officer. Upon his release after completing his sentence in 2017, the authorities compelled him to pay a “fee” of over US$66,000 to the al-Hoora police station.
Al-Tamimi’s harassment and intimidation comes in the context of heightened rhetoric by the authorities, who have threatened to arrest and prosecute those who criticize the government, especially through social media.
King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa said in a speech on 20 May 2019 during Ramadan festivities that he had “directed … security agencies to put a decisive stop” to the “misuse of social media.” This message was immediately supported and echoed by the royally appointed Shura Council’s Foreign Affairs Committee.
On the same day, 20 May, the Ministry of Interior issued a statement that it was “taking the necessary legal actions against those involved in” social media accounts which “deface Bahrain’s reputation.”
“Too many Bahraini citizens are paying a hefty price for voicing their opinion in the Kingdom. The authorities’ crackdown will not make the issues they are raising disappear, but only continue to fuel resentment and deepen the divide between citizens and their state,” said Lynn Maalouf.
“Bahrain’s allies, namely the UK and the US, should pay heed to the consequences of this repression and pressure the Bahraini authorities to reverse this appalling pattern of silencing peaceful critics like al-Tamimi.”

As Minister Freeland herself stated, the ATT opened for signature in 2013 so this step by Canada is long overdue and most welcome. In particular we commend the Government of Canada for the legislative and regulatory changes to Canada’s export control regime to more effectively regulate Canada’s arms exports in accordance with the high global standards set out in the ATT.
“Canada’s new arms export vetting procedures include an obligation on the Foreign Minister to deny an export permit where there is a “substantial risk” the Canadian-made weapons could be used to commit or to facilitate serious human rights abuses or undermine international peace and security.” – Cesar Jaramillo, Project Ploughshares
Another important change to existing practice is that, for the first time ever, export permits will be required for some US-destined weapons – namely full conventional weapons systems, albeit under an expedited method without a prior risk assessment. 
“The inclusion of at least some exports to the USA is a modest first step toward full compliance and transparency in Canada’s military exports with its largest trading partner.  Hopefully, Canada will amend the legislation in the future to meet all its obligations under the ATT, which requires export permits and risk assessments for all conventional weapons exports, including parts and components, to all destinations.” – Thomas Woodley, Canadians for Peace and Justice in the Middle East (CJPME)
This action by Canada to formally join the Arms Trade Treaty comes against a backdrop of controversy over our continuing export of LAVs to Saudi Arabia, despite that country’s shocking record of internal repression and war crimes in Yemen. Most recently, the UK has suspended weapons exports to Saudi Arabia in light of the UK Court of Appeal ruling them in violation of international law and the U.S. Congress has voted for a second time to ban American arms exports to Saudi Arabia.
“Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia have now been under review for a full 8 months. In the meantime, our exports to Saudi Arabia have continued with, according to some credible media reports, alleged use of Canadian LAVs in Yemen, even as the peace process flounders and civilians continue to suffer from indiscriminate air strikes, torture and forced recruitment of children. The time has come for Canada to take decisive action, once and for all, and suspend any further weapons exports to Saudi Arabia.” – Peggy Mason, Rideau Institute
We believe that joining the Arms Trade Treaty will only be meaningful if Canada “walks the talk” and ensures that, henceforth, our export of weapons will strictly comply with the global standards set out in that Treaty.

Indigenous women’s organizations, grassroots activists, violence survivors, and the families and loved ones of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people long called for a national inquiry to compel government to investigate and take urgent action to end the violence. Amnesty International advocated alongside Indigenous partners in calling for a national inquiry. 
In 2015, the federal government agreed to call for a national commission of inquiry, and in 2016 the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls commenced its work. Amnesty International was a Party with Standing to the National Inquiry. We participated in two Inquiry hearings, testified as a witness on the findings of our Out of Sight, Out of Mind research into the intersection of gender, Indigenous rights, and energy development in northeast British Columbia, and we made final oral and written submissions to the Inquiry before it concluded its work. 
On June 3, 2019, Amnesty International was honoured to be present at a ceremony where the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its final report, Reclaiming Power and Place. The 1,200 page report, executive summary, and supplementary reports on Quebec and on genocide, culminate in 231 Calls for Justice. 
In response to the report, Amnesty International called on all governments in Canada to move beyond the piecemeal approach to ending the violence that has tragically failed First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, two-spirit people, families, and communities. 
Amnesty International welcomed the Inquiry’s call for a National Action Plan on violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit persons as a way to move beyond a piecemeal government response to comprehensive action, and were pleased that the federal government accepted this recommendation. 
We particularly welcomed the Inquiry’s inclusion of a section on “Resource Extraction and Violence Against Indigenous Women,” which heavily referenced Amnesty International’s research on this issue and led to five strong Calls for Justice to recognize and address violence associated with resource development projects, including industry labour camps. 
Read the National Inquiry’s final report including the 231 Calls for Justice. The Calls for Justice make strong recommendations to government, police, and institutions like the media and healthcare sectors to take urgent action. They also include specific Calls for Justice to all people in Canada. 
In particular, please read the eight Calls for Justice addressed to every person in Canada. Read them, share them with your family, friends, colleagues, and fellow activists. Please respectfully engage in difficult discussions about how the structures and institutions of Canadian society with which we engage, and from which many of us benefit, put Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people in harm’s way or deny them justice. We all have a role to play and a responsibility in making sure that Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people can live in safety and dignity, free from violence and discrimination. 
Here are the eight Calls for Justice for every person in Canada: 
As this report has shown, and within every encounter, each person has a role to play in order to combat violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people. Beyond those Calls aimed at governments or at specific industries or service providers, we encourage every Canadian to consider how they can give life to these Calls for Justice. We call on all Canadians to: 
15.1 Denounce and speak out against violence against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people. 
15.2 Decolonize by learning the true history of Canada and Indigenous history in your local area. Learn about and celebrate Indigenous Peoples’ history, cultures, pride, and diversity, acknowledging the land you live on and its importance to local Indigenous communities, both historically and today. 
15.3 Develop knowledge and read the Final Report. Listen to the truths shared, and acknowledge the burden of these human and Indigenous rights violations, and how they impact Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people today. 
15.4 Using what you have learned and some of the resources suggested, become a strong ally. Being a strong ally involves more than just tolerance; it means actively working to breakdown barriers and to support others in every relationship and encounter in which you participate. 
15.5 Confront and speak out against racism, sexism, ignorance, homophobia, and transphobia, and teach or encourage others to do the same, wherever it occurs: in your home, in your workplace, or in social settings. 
15.6 Protect, support, and promote the safety of women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people by acknowledging and respecting the value of every person and every community, as well as the right of Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people to generate their own, self-determined solutions. 
15.7 Create time and space for relationships based on respect as human beings, supporting and embracing differences with kindness, love, and respect. Learn about Indigenous principles of relationship specific to those Nations or communities in your local area and work, and put them into practice in all of your relationships with Indigenous Peoples. 
15.8 Help hold all governments accountable to act on the Calls for Justice, and to implement them according to the important principles we set out.

“We are delighted that justice has finally prevailed in this horrific case and that the rights of the survivor have been upheld. But the journey to get here has been long, and caused the woman involved further unnecessary and avoidable suffering.
“This case shows exactly why it’s so crucial for Spain’s Penal Code to be amended. Sex without consent is rape; it’s that simple. The assumption in law that a victim gives their consent because they have not resisted is deeply problematic and undermines access to justice, especially since “involuntary paralysis” or “freezing” has been recognized by experts as a common response to sexual assault.
“While changing laws won’t eradicate rape, what is written in the law plays a major role in defining attitudes as to what rape is.”
Background
Spain’s Supreme Court today convicted the five men of rape based on the existence of intimidation and lack of consent. Two previous sentences passed by the lower and superior courts in Navarra established that the woman didn’t consent to the sexual act but sentenced the men to the lesser offence of sexual abuse as they didn’t find enough violence or intimidation for the crime to be considered rape. The full ruling will be available in the forthcoming weeks.

Restraint urged in policing of upcoming protests
Police must be held to account for unlawful use of force 
Hong Kong police must end the unlawful use of force against peaceful protesters who have once again taken to the streets on Friday, Amnesty International said, as it published details of verified instances of unnecessary and excessive use of force by police on 12 June.
Experts in policing and digital verification examined in detail footage of 14 incidents of apparent police violence. All verified incidents were filmed during the 12 June protest, which saw tens of thousands of people take part in a largely peaceful demonstration against the Hong Kong government’s proposed extradition bill.
“The evidence of the unlawful use of force by police against peaceful protesters on 12 June is irrefutable. In the footage Amnesty has verified, police officers appear out of control, placing peaceful protesters who posed no threat in danger of serious injury,” said Man-kei Tam, Director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. 
“The Hong Kong authorities should send a clear message that these failures in policing will not be tolerated. A thorough, independent and effective investigation needs to take place and any officers found responsible must face justice, at any level of the chain of command.”
The verified footage includes:
–           The beating of subdued protesters by police officers;
–           The firing of rubber bullets at a protester’s head, risking serious injury;
–           Multiple rounds of tear gas fired against protesters who were trapped in a confined area with severely limited opportunities for escape;
–           Aggressive police tactics against journalists.
All of the examples Amnesty International verified are violations of international law and standards on the use of force by law enforcement officials. The verified footage draws upon media coverage, as well as footage posted on social media.
Amnesty International’s analysis unmistakably shows that Hong Kong police used the violent acts of a small minority on 12 June as a pretext to use unnecessary and excessive force against the vast majority of peaceful protesters. Tear gas, guns firing rubber bullets, pepper spray and batons were used to disperse the demonstration.
Such “less lethal” weapons are usually classified as crowd-control devices, the use of which can result in serious injury and even death. Rubber bullets, pepper spray or batons should never be used for dispersal or directed at peaceful demonstrators or bystanders, but only used against persons engaged in violence.
The deployment of excessively high numbers of police officers and visible heavy anti-riot equipment was clearly intended to intimidate protesters and is likely to have increased the tensions leading to violence. Instead, law enforcement officials must attempt non-violent means first in the policing of assemblies, including dialogue, de-escalation and negotiation, before resorting to any use of force.
With further protests underway on Friday in near government and police headquarters, Man-kei Tam said: “While there is no doubt police are under intense pressure during large-scale protests, there can be no excuses for the excessive use of force witnessed last Wednesday. We urge the police to learn from these serious mistakes and ensure there is no repeat in upcoming demonstrations. There needs to be a sea-change in approach in the policing of assemblies in Hong Kong, away from one using heavy-handed tactics to one of protecting and facilitating peaceful assemblies.”

Prime Minister of Canada
80 Wellington Street
Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0A2
June 20, 2019
Dear Prime Minister,
We are writing this Open Letter to you, as members of the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China,1 in advance of the 2019 G20 Summit, to be held in Osaka, Japan on June 28-29. We are writing in response to media reports that you are seeking a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Summit and to share with you nine crucial human rights recommendations to press with President Xi if such a meeting does occur. More broadly, these are points that we urge you, your Ministers and all Canadian government officials to raise in meetings and other exchanges with Chinese counterparts, be it in connection with the G20 Summit or other opportunities over the coming weeks and months.
It is a particularly critical time for ensuring that concern for human rights is the top priority in the Canada/China relationship. While the tensions that have arisen due to the Meng Wanzhou extradition case have obviously had wider implications, including ramifications for trade between our countries, of gravest concern have been apparently retaliatory measures taken by Chinese officials that have led to serious human rights violations against Canadian citizens. Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been imprisoned for more than six months, following their arbitrary arrests in December. They have endured harsh detention conditions and treatment and face the prospect of deeply unfair trials. Two other Canadians, Robert Schellenberg and Fan Wei, have both been sentenced to death in the past five months in separate cases involving drug-related charges.
There is as well considerable global attention to China’s human rights record at this time, Prime Minister, notably with respect to the mass incarceration and unrelenting human rights violations against Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in the west of the country, unprecedented protests in Hong Kong in response to proposed changes to Hong Kong’s extradition law and the recent 30th anniversary of the 1989 killings of student protesters in Tiananmen Square, the truth of which the Chinese government continues to conceal and deny. There continue as well to be serious concerns with respect to human rights violations against Tibetans and Falun Gong practitioners, unrelenting crackdowns against human rights defenders, lawyers and democracy activists, repression of free expression, and widespread use of the death penalty and torture.
In this context, Prime Minister, any meeting or opportunity for exchanges with President Xi must put human rights first. We urge you in particular to make the following requests of the President: 
Release Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor and commute the death sentences imposed against Robert Schellenberg and Fan Wei. 
Release other Canadians and individuals with close Canadian connections who have been wrongfully imprisoned in China, in several cases for many years, including citizens Huseyin Celil (detained since 2006) and Sun Qian (detained since February 2017), as well as Wang Bingzhang (detained since 2002) and ten imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners, who are all close family members of Canadians. 
Agree to an international fact-finding mission, under the auspices of the UN Human Rights Council, to investigate “re-education camps” in the Uyghur region of China. 
Ensure that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government refrains from using excessive force against protesters, withdraws the extradition bill and commits to preserving the high degree of autonomy, rule of law and an independent judiciary in Hong Kong.  
Grant unrestricted access to Tibet for independent researchers, human rights experts, journalists, diplomats, and parliamentarians and allow officials from the Canadian Embassy in China to visit Tibet. 
End the persecution of Falun Gong. 
Establish an independent investigation into the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. 
Respect and protect human rights defenders and lawyers in China. 
Cooperate with Canadian investigations into harassment, intimidation and surveillance in Canada against activists campaigning on human rights concerns in China. 
Thank you for your attention to our concerns and recommendations. We would welcome an opportunity to meet with you or your officials for further discussions before the Summit.
Sincerely,
Alex Neve

Refugees are people who find themselves with no choice other than to leave their lives behind hoping for safety. Many arrive in hostile environments but stepping back home could put their lives at risk. American states must protect those in need and promote a coherent regional response.
In South America, Venezuela is experiencing a context of massive human rights violations that has forced over four million people to flee the country. Most states in the Americas have openly denounced this human rights crisis and have generally kept an open-door policy. Colombia has received the highest number of Venezuelans -1.3 million- and Peru hosts the highest number of Venezuelan asylum seekers in the world; 227,000 as of March 2019, out of over 727,000 Venezuelans in Peru. Despite this dramatic reality and repeated political outcries, some states have taken steps back in their international obligations to welcome and protect Venezuelan refugees. On 15 June 2019, against its international obligations, Peru began requesting Venezuelans hold a ‘humanitarian visa’ to access the country. Together with other civil society organizations, Amnesty International called on Peru to revert its decision and continue welcoming Venezuelans. In the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago, which hosts approximately 40,000 Venezuelans, recently concluded a two-week registration process that allowed Venezuelans to gain legal residency. Against Amnesty International’s request and despite this process only reaching around 14,000 people, authorities refused to extend the registration period and instead decided to re-enforce national immigration legislation and established visa restrictions for Venezuelans entering the country. Risks of illegal pushbacks and deportations now leaves thousands of Venezuelans in need of international protection out in the cold.
In Central America, a year on from the brutal crackdown of mass protests in Nicaragua, some 62,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, the majority -some 55,000- seeking refuge in neighboring Costa Rica. By allowing Nicaraguans to enter, the Costa Rican government has set an example to the region by giving them the safety they are denied in their own country. Challenges remain, including access to healthcare, education, and work, and the international community must support Costa Rica in its efforts to receive, protect and support people fleeing the human rights crisis in Nicaragua. Likewise, people leaving Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, are not only leaving due to poverty and inequality, but in most cases, are forced to leave their countries to save their lives due to persecution and violence. Since 2018, the departure of thousands of Central Americans from their countries heading north changed when people started fleeing collectively in the so called “caravans”. In recent years, Mexico has also become a destination country for those people. In 2017, Amnesty International called on the Mexican government to review its migration practices to stop refoulement and child detention. Against these calls, the Mexican government strengthened security on its southern border and accepted the “Remain in Mexico deal” with the USA, which makes people that have asked for asylum in the USA wait in the Mexican side of the border for their claim to be adjudicated. The constant pressure of the USA on Mexico to stop migrants and refugees from getting to the US border has resulted in mass detentions, overcrowded detention centers and mass deportations without due process, and now with 6,000 members of the National Guard patrolling the south border of Mexico.
In North America, Amnesty International has shown that people seeking safety and protection in the USA have been systematically denied their right to seek asylum at the Mexican border, and thousands of refugees have been left stranded in the Middle East as a result of President Trump’s “Muslim Ban” and other restrictive policies targeting refugees. The US government has taken actions which violate US and international law, including family separations, mass illegal pushbacks of asylum seekers at the border back to Mexico and potentially into harm’s way, and arbitrary and indefinite detention of asylum seekers, without parole, constituting ill-treatment in some cases of vulnerable individuals, including LGBTI people and children. Furthermore, the US is pushing for its southern neighbors to control the transit of refugees and migrants. Amnesty International urges Mexico and Guatemala to refrain from signing safe third country agreements with the US.
Across the Americas, these examples highlight that in the face of millions fleeing their homes in need of international protection, American states are failing in their obligation to welcome them according to international human rights standards, turning their backs on the Americas’ legacy on advanced and progressive standards related to human mobility, such as the Cartagena Declaration. On World Refugee Day, Amnesty International calls on all states in the Americas to take steps towards guaranteeing the rights of refugees and asylum-seekers. They must find joint solutions to the current context and ensure that no one in need of international protection is left behind. Critically, humanitarian and development aid should actively contribute to hosting communities.

Ruling is first time UK court has acknowledged risks of continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia
UK has sold more than £4bn of arms to Saudi Arabia since Yemen conflict began
‘We welcome this judgment as a major step towards preventing further bloodshed’ – Lucy Claridge
 
Amnesty International has welcomed a judgment from the Court of Appeal today which has found that the UK Government’s decision to continue licensing exports of military equipment to Saudi Arabia is unlawful.
The ruling came in a judicial review brought by Campaign Against the Arms Trade (CAAT), which was joined by Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and Rights Watch UK.
Lucy Claridge, Amnesty International’s Director of Strategic Litigation, said:
“This judgment is a rare piece of good news for the people of Yemen.
“During four years of devastating war the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has killed thousands of civilians in Yemen, flattening homes, schools and hospitals in indiscriminate airstrikes.
“This is the first time that a UK court has acknowledged the risks of continuing to lavish Saudi Arabia with military equipment for use in Yemen. We welcome this judgment as a major step towards preventing further bloodshed.
“We call upon the Secretary of State to undertake this review as a matter of urgency and believe it should result in suspension.
“We hope that this marks the end of this chapter of shameful impunity and leads to increased scrutiny of other major arms suppliers to Saudi Arabia, such as France and the US. We continue to call for the immediate suspension of all arms transfers to all parties to the conflict for use in Yemen.”
The importance of NGO research as evidence
A crucial aspect that the Court of Appeal emphasised is the importance of research by Amnesty, other NGOs and the UN as authoritative evidence of the risks of continuing to license arms exports to Saudi Arabia, which the Secretary of State must now properly take into account in licensing decisions. On the question of evidence of whether past violations are a relevant consideration when assessing whether there is a real risk of future violation, the court said:
“In our view that is obviously correct. How could it reasonably be otherwise?”
As a result of this judgment, the Secretary of State’s decisions not to suspend current licensing exports and to continue to grant further licences will be quashed. He has undertaken not to grant any new licences for export of arms or military equipment to Saudi Arabia for possible use in the conflict in Yemen until those decisions have been re-taken on the correct legal basis, unless he applies for and gets deferral of the court’s order.
Amnesty research on Yemen
Extensive and credible reports, including Amnesty’s own research in Yemen, have demonstrated that equipment and weapons similar to the ones exported by the UK, including British-made weapons, have repeatedly been used to commit serious violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war crimes. According to publicly-available information, Saudi Arabia has not adequately investigated such violations, nor has it held those responsible for any breaches to account. As such, Amnesty considers that there is a clear risk that authorising further arms exports would lead to further serious violations in Yemen, and therefore would be counter to the UK’s obligations under domestic and international law.
Four years of UK arms sales
During the past four years, Amnesty has repeatedly called on the UK Government to halt all arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of the clear risk that they will be used to carry out violations of international humanitarian law in Yemen.
Since the conflict began in March 2015, the UK has sold more than £4bn of arms to Saudi Arabia, including more than two dozen Eurofighter Typhoon war planes. The real value of the sales may be far higher, as large quantities of arms equipment are sold to the Saudi air force by UK companies like BAE Systems and Raytheon under so-called “open” export licences which do not provide figures, making it impossible to assess the scale of all the arms sold over this period.
To mark the four-year point of the Yemen conflict in March, Amnesty activists took a replica Typhoon plane to Parliament in protest at the UK’s continuing arms sales to Riyadh. Amnesty also took a 56,000-signature petition addressed to Liam Fox to the Department for International Trade in Whitehall.
Amnesty has previously said that UK ministers were “signing a death warrant for the people of Yemen” through their arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
Other countries suspend arms sales
Several countries – including the Netherlands, Belgium (Flemish region) and Greece – have partly or totally suspended arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Other countries – such as Austria, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland – have put in place restrictive measures on exports to Saudi Arabia. In the aftermath of the murder of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, several European states also announced they would be suspending arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, including Germany, Norway, Finland and Denmark.
Judicial review
The judicial review was brought by CAAT in 2016 against the UK Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills. CAAT has challenged the legality of the UK Government’s decision to continue to issue licences for arms exports to Saudi Arabia, despite the clear risk that the weapons could be used for violations of international law in Yemen. The case was originally heard by the High Court in February 2017, and Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and Rights Watch UK intervened at that stage. The court dismissed CAAT’s case and ruled on 10 July 2017 that the Government was not acting unlawfully in continuing to authorise arms exports to Saudi Arabia. In May 2018, CAAT was given permission to launch an appeal, which was heard in April 2019 and which the Court of Appeal ruled on today. Amnesty’s joint intervention focused on how a clear risk is determined, the authoritative nature of NGO research reports and the value such research has in making such a determination. 
Amnesty and others have documented how all sides to the conflict in Yemen have committed serious breaches of international humanitarian law, including possible war crimes. This includes the Huthi armed group and allied forces which have also indiscriminately fired explosive munitions with wide-area effects – including mortars and artillery shells – into residential areas, killing and injuring civilians.

“We call on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to immediately take up the Special Rapporteur’s recommendation to launch an international follow-up criminal investigation.

“Those proven to be responsible for this despicable act must be brought to justice, regardless of their official capacity. Secretary General Guterres must send a strong signal that the targeted killings of dissidents, journalists, activists and human rights defenders worldwide will be met with robust action.
“The report’s findings confirm that the lives of Saudi Arabian dissidents and critics living abroad are at risk. The international community must continue pressuring Saudi Arabian authorities to put an end to their relentless crackdown against all form of free expression which manifest through the ongoing pattern of arbitrary arrests, torture, and grossly unfair trials followed by executions of a wide range of Saudi Arabian civil society members.”

0,Myanmar/Bangladesh: Older people denied dignity in camps after facing military atrocities,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/myanmarbangladesh-older-people-denied-dignity-camps-after-facing-military-atrocities/,"Tens of thousands of older women and men from ethnic minorities across Myanmar who faced military atrocities and were forced to flee their homes are being let down by a humanitarian system that often fails to adequately address their rights and needs, Amnesty International said in a report...","Tens of thousands of older women and men from ethnic minorities across Myanmar who faced military atrocities and were forced to flee their homes are being let down by a humanitarian system that often fails to adequately address their rights and needs, Amnesty International said in a report published today.
“Fleeing my whole life”: Older people’s experience of conflict and displacement in Myanmar is the organization’s first comprehensive investigation into the specific ways older people’s rights and dignity are not respected amid armed conflict and crisis, as well in the provision of humanitarian assistance.
 
“For decades, Myanmar’s ethnic minorities have suffered recurrent abuse at the hands of the military. Many older people racked by atrocities amid recent military operations lived through similar crimes as children or younger adults. Their experience lays bare the military’s longstanding brutality, and the need for justice,” said Matthew Wells, Senior Crisis Advisor at Amnesty International.
“Tens of thousands of older women and men are among the more than one million people displaced to camps as a result of conflict and military abuse. The humanitarian community has responded admirably to crisis after crisis, saving many lives. But older people are slipping through the cracks, their specific needs often overlooked. The humanitarian response must become more inclusive.”
The report is based on 146 interviews with older women and men from the Kachin, Lisu, Rakhine, Rohingya, Shan, and Ta’ang ethnic minorities. They were conducted during three missions to Myanmar’s Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan States, as well as to the refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, between December 2018 and April 2019. Those interviewed range from 54 to more than 90 years old.
Military crimes against older people
As the Myanmar military has committed atrocity crimes during operations in Kachin, Rakhine, and Shan States, older people confront particular risks. Some older people stay behind as villages empty at word of a military advance, often due to their strong ties to home and land or to being physically unable to flee. After finding them, soldiers arbitrarily detain, torture, and at times kill older women and men. 
A 67-year-old ethnic Rakhine farmer who stayed behind when most of his village fled in March 2019, in part because a severe hearing impairment meant he had not heard fighting nearby between the military and Arakan Army (AA), described what Myanmar soldiers did after forcing him out of his home: “When I got to where the captain was, the soldiers tied my hands… behind my back, with the rope that’s used for cattle. They asked me, ‘Did the AA come to the village?’ I said no, I’d never seen [the AA]… and then the soldiers beat me.”
During the military’s attack on the Rohingya population in 2017, many older women and men were burned alive in their homes. Mariam Khatun, an ethnic Rohingya woman around 50 years old, fled to the nearby forest with her three children when Myanmar soldiers entered her village in Maungdaw Township. “My parents were left behind in the home,” she said. “I had two young children, how could I take them as well? … My parents were physically unable to move.”
As she and her children reached the river next to the village, Mariam Khatun looked back and saw the village burning, knowing her parents were still inside their home.
Amnesty International’s review of lists of people killed from different Rohingya villages indicates older people often suffered disproportionately. A quantitative study by Médecins Sans Frontières found similarly, showing that in the month after the military began its brutal operations on 25 August 2017, the highest rates of mortality – by far – were among Rohingya women and men age 50 and older. 
For older people in Rakhine and Kachin States who have fled, the journey through Myanmar’s mountainous borderlands was often difficult, worsened by the military blocking main routes and restricting humanitarian access. Amnesty International documented several cases of older people dying as they tried to flee to safety, unable to access health care.
 
Humanitarian assistance falls short
UN agencies and humanitarian organizations have responded to enormous needs in Bangladesh, where more than 900,000 Rohingya live in camps, and in Myanmar, where more than 250,000 people are displaced. Insufficient donor funding and government restrictions in both countries – particularly severe in Myanmar – create further challenges. But, even amid the constraints, the humanitarian system has too often neglected older people.
In the Bangladesh refugee camps, many older Rohingya women and men are unable to regularly access the most basic of services, including sanitation, health care, water, and food. The camps’ congestion and hilly terrain make for a difficult environment, particularly for older people with limited mobility.
Many older Rohingya report being unable to access latrines and having to use a pan in their shelters – a major loss of dignity. Mawlawi Harun, an ethnic Rohingya man in his 90s, said, while sitting in his shelter in Camp #15 in Bangladesh: “I go to the latrine here, I eat and sleep here. I have become like a cow or goat. What more can I say? Cows defecate and urinate in the same place where they eat… Now I’m sleeping in a latrine.”
Older women and men also struggle to access health facilities, due to the distance and terrain. Even when they can, they find some clinics cannot treat even common chronic diseases – such as high blood pressure and chronic respiratory illness – that disproportionately affect older people. Many older people are forced to buy medication from market stalls that should be part of the health response.
Gul Bahar, around 80 years old, said she spends 5,000 taka (US$59) per month on medication, including pills for high blood pressure, as the camp clinic near her generally provides only paracetamol. To pay for her medications, she said, “We sell part of our food ration and cooking oil. We also sold our blankets.”
In northern Myanmar, where many ethnic Kachin have been displaced since 2011, some humanitarian programmes, particularly for livelihood support, under-include older people. Older people also face discrimination in accessing work, which has a cascade of negative effects, compounded by the decrease in humanitarian assistance in recent years, due to donor fatigue and an expectation that people in the IDP camps can access work in surrounding areas.
“I’ve approached the employers and said I want to work,” said Zatan Hkawng Nyoi, a 67-year-old ethnic Kachin woman who spent a lifetime farming before being displaced to an IDP camp. “They said I’m too old, that I won’t be able to walk that far to [the paddy fields].”
Older people in general, and older women in particular, are also under-represented in camp leadership, denying them a voice in decision-making.
“Older people need to be better included in all aspects of humanitarian response – from having their voices inform initial assessments to being involved in assistance programmes. Responding more effectively to older people’s rights begins with engaging their unique skills and perspective,” said Matthew Wells.
Repeated trauma
For many older people from ethnic minorities across Myanmar, the current displacement is the latest in a lifetime of conflict and military oppression. Amnesty International interviewed several dozen older people, including ethnic Kachin, Rohingya, and Shan, who had fled their homes three or more times – often as children, as younger adults, and again in older age. The repeated upheaval has caused economic hardship in addition to psychosocial harm.
“I’ve fled so many times since I was nine years old… I’ve had to be alert all the time. It doesn’t matter what I do – on the farm, in the orchard – I’ve never had peace of mind,” said Nding Htu Bu, 65, a Kachin woman living in an IDP camp.
Some older people have also witnessed one or more of their children being murdered or raped by the Myanmar military.
Yet, despite the acute and chronic harm, very little psychosocial care is targeted at, or even inclusive of, older people.
Amnesty International requested responses from the Bangladesh offices of the UN Refugee Agency and the International Organization for Migration to questions about the organization’s main findings. Both agencies cited challenges, especially during the early crisis period; the enormous progress in the overall provision of aid; and initiatives that are underway or planned to make assistance more inclusive for older people.
“The improvements in the camps are notable, but, for many older people, they have been much too slow and remain insufficient. Older people’s rights should inform humanitarian response and resourcing from a crisis’s first days, not as an afterthought. Anything else fails to meet core humanitarian principles: respond based on need, and leave no one behind,” said Matthew Wells.
“For their part, donor governments must provide greater support for the response in both Myanmar and Bangladesh and ensure that implementing partners are assessing and meeting older people’s specific needs.”

“The news of Mohamed Morsi’s death in court today is deeply shocking and raises serious questions about his treatment in custody. The Egyptian authorities must immediately order an impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the circumstances of his death, as well as his detention conditions and his ability to access medical care.  
“Egyptian authorities had the responsibility to ensure that, as a detainee,he had access to proper medical care.
“Mohamed Morsi was subjected to enforced disappearance for months after his detention, before first appearing in front of a judge on 4 November 2013. He was held in solitary confinement for almost six years, placing a considerable strain on his mental and physical wellbeing and violating the absolute prohibition against torture and other ill-treatment under international law. During this six-year period, he was effectively cut off from the outside world – he was allowed only three family visits and was prevented from access to his lawyers or a doctor. 
“The Egyptian authorities have an appalling track record of detaining prisoners in prolonged solitary confinement and in dire conditions as well as subjecting prisoners to torture and other ill-treatment. This makes it all the more crucial for the authorities to carry out an investigation to determine whether any such ill-treatment was a contributing factor to Mohamed Morsi’s death, and ensuring that those responsible for the violation of his rights are held accountable.” 
BACKGROUND 
According to his family Mohamed Morsi had diabetes and fainted twice during his detention. His family reported that he has not been afforded proper medical treatment. Because of the restrictions over Mohamed Morsi’s ability to communicate with the outside world, little is known about his exact conditions of detention. 
Amnesty International has previously found that in six cases of solitary confinement the treatment amounted to torture.

0,Canada’s new guidelines to support human rights defenders a step in the right direction,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/joint-press-release/canadas-new-guidelines-support-human-rights-defenders-step-right-direction/,"With human rights defenders increasingly under attack around the world, civil society organizations today welcomed the Government of Canada’s new guidelines aimed at strengthening its approach to ensuring the safety and security of these courageous activists as part of its feminist foreign...","With human rights defenders increasingly under attack around the world, civil society organizations today welcomed the Government of Canada’s new guidelines aimed at strengthening its approach to ensuring the safety and security of these courageous activists as part of its feminist foreign policy. 
Human rights defenders are often criminalized, targeted with smear campaigns, discredited, threatened, arbitrarily arrested, and face violence because they advocate for human rights. According to Front Line Defenders Global Analysis 2018, 321 human rights defenders in 27 countries were targeted and killed for their work in 2018.  More than three-quarters of these were defending land, environmental or Indigenous peoples’ rights, often in the context of extractive industries and mega projects.  More than 80% of those killed had previously received a specific death threat.
Civil society organizations applaud Canada’s new guidelines for recognizing the key role that human rights defenders play in holding governments and companies to account for adhering to human right laws and standards and keeping “respect for human rights alive”. The groups also welcome Canada’s acknowledgement that human rights defenders put themselves at great risk—along with their families, communities and the movements they represent—as they work to promote human rights and strengthen the rule of law. Women and LGBTI human rights defenders, for example, face high-levels of sexual and other forms of gender-based violence because of their gender and the rights they are advocating for.
“In many parts of the world, human rights defenders are at risk as a result of their courageous work and their willingness to speak truth to power. Canada and the international community need to be strong supporters of these brave individuals. Human rights defenders must be able to act freely and without any interference, intimidation, abuse, threats, violence or reprisal. We are committed to speaking out against violations, standing up for human rights defenders and striving for a world where the rights and freedoms of all people are respected,” said Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland today in Ottawa at a human rights event where the guidelines were announced.
For Canada’s new guidelines to be effective in helping to protect and support human rights defenders, they will need to be accompanied by a comprehensive implementation plan and increased Canadian funding going directly to human rights defenders and the movements they represent.  Canada also needs to take a stronger approach to support human rights defenders advocating for corporate accountability, for instance, by enabling robust investigations when defenders face heightened risks linked to private sector investments.  It will also be critically important that Canada create an advisory body that includes the participation of human rights defenders with experience and first-hand knowledge of the threats facing human rights defenders.
Canada’s new guidelines define a human rights defender as someone who, individually or with others, “acts to promote or protect human rights through peaceful means, such as by documenting and calling attention to violations or abuses by governments, businesses, individuals or groups.”
Importantly, the new guidelines call for Canadian diplomats working abroad at overseas missions or at Global Affairs Canada headquarters in Ottawa to take a more feminist and intersectional approach to promoting the rights of defenders. The document notes that many human rights defenders have multiple and “overlapping” identities, and often work on multiple issues.  Human rights defenders may belong to one or more groups facing discrimination, including women, LGBTI people, Indigenous people, land and environment defenders, people with disabilities, journalists, and those seeking greater freedom of religion or beliefs.  Human rights defenders in conflict and post-conflict countries face unique risks posed by high levels of militarization.
Canada’s guidelines on supporting human rights defenders were first launched in 2016.
After input from civil society, government committed to revising and updating the guidelines to best support defenders and to align with Canada’s approach to a more feminist foreign policy.

Quotes from Canada’s Voices at Risk: Canada’s Guidelines on Supporting Human Rights Defenders
“Canada recognizes the key role played by human right defenders in protecting and promoting human rights and strengthening the rule of law, often at great risk to themselves, their families and communities, and to the organizations and movements they often represent.”
“Canada has a strong tradition of supporting these brave people in communities around the world as they hold governments and companies to account and keep respect for human rights alive.”
“Canada’s guidelines on supporting human rights defenders is a clear statement of Canada’s commitment to supporting the vital work of HRDs.”
“HRDs help defend the vital and fundamental human rights that we all enjoy.  We need to continue to be strong advocates for them.”

“The news that Murtaja Qureiris will not face execution is a huge relief for him and his family, but it is utterly outrageous that the Saudi Arabian authorities were seeking the death penalty for someone arrested under the age of 13 in the first place. Use of the death penalty against people under 18 at the time of the crime is a flagrant violation of international law.
“While the Saudi authorities have spared Murtaja Qureiris’ life in this case, the law in Saudi Arabia still allows people arrested for crimes committed when they were children to be sentenced to death where the crimes are punishable by death under Shari’a (Islamic law).
“To show they are sincere about respecting the rights of children the Saudi Arabian authorities must abolish the use of the death penalty for all crimes committed by juvenile offenders. They should start by immediately quashing the death sentences of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon – three other Shi’a men who were all arrested while under the age of 18 and are at imminent risk of execution.”
Murtaja Qureiris was held in solitary confinement, beaten and intimidated during interrogation and coerced to “confess”. His trial was blatantly unfair and he has been treated as an adult rather than a child in the eyes of the law, despite the fact that some of the charges against him relate to when he was just 10 years old. 
Murtaja Qureiris, now aged 18, was arrested in September 2014. He was brought to trial before the Specialized Criminal Court in September 2018 and charged with a series of offences including participating in anti-government protests, attending the funeral of his brother Ali Qureiris who was killed in a protest in 2011, joining a “terrorist organization,” throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station, and firing at security forces.
In August 2018, King Salman issued the Law on Juveniles. This stipulated a maximum prison sentence of 10 years for juveniles in cases where they might otherwise be sentenced to death, except for crimes punishable by death under Shari’a (Islamic law). By excluding these, it falls short of international human rights law, which strictly prohibits the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18 at the time of the crime.

The Norwegian government must immediately halt the deportation of a 16-year-old boy and his two siblings back to Afghanistan where they will be at grave risk of serious human rights violations, Amnesty International said today.
Eshan Abbasi (16) and his sister Taibeh (20) and brother Yasin (22), were deported from Norway to Istanbul on Saturday together with their mother. Due to her health condition, their mother is expected to be returned to Norway, but the children are in danger of being flown to Kabul imminently.
“Uprooting these three young siblings from the communities where they have lived for more than seven years and deporting them alone to a warzone is an unconscionable abuse of power,” said Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director.
“Afghanistan is not a safe country for returns, and if this heartless and unnecessary deportation is completed it will split the family, endanger these three young people’s live and rob them of their futures.”
Taibeh Abbasi was born in Iran to Afghan parents and fled to Norway with her mother and brothers in 2012. She is a brave human rights defender, speaking out for her family, who have been fully supported by their local community in Trondheim.
The Norwegian government has justified the family’s deportation by claiming that Afghanistan is safe for returns. This claim is contradicted by the record-high levels of violence documented across Afghanistan. Earlier this month, the Institute for Peace and Economics described Afghanistan as the ‘least peaceful’ country in the world.
The whereabouts of the family in Istanbul are unknown but it is believed that they have had no access to information or contact with the outside world since they were put on a plane early on Saturday.
“This deportation is emblematic of the cruel and dehumanising policies of many European governments, who are turning a blind eye to the reality of life in Afghanistan in order to increase the number of returns,” said Massimo Moratti.
“Norway must immediately reverse this callous decision and allow the siblings to return to their home and their friends in Norway and it must stop the dangerous and illegal return of all asylum seekers to Afghanistan. Norwegian and Turkish authorities must ensure the family can communicate with the outside world and receive information, legal counselling and support from organizations.”

Background
There are reportedly 10 Norwegian immigration police in Istanbul escorting the siblings to Kabul.
Since 2017, more than 280,000 people have signed an Amnesty International petition calling on Norway’s government not to deport Taibeh and her family.
Norway appears to deport more Afghans than almost any other European country – not just in proportion to its population, but in sheer total numbers. According to the Afghan authorities, 32% (97 out of 304 people) of forcible returns from Europe in the first four months of 2017 came from Norway.
In 2018, the United Nations documented the highest ever recorded civilian deaths in Afghanistan, including the highest ever recorded number of children killed in the conflict. There were nearly 11,000 casualties which included 3,804 deaths and 7,189 injuries.

In some cases, these families were cleared to come to the United States in late 2016 and early 2017, only to be stranded in countries where they face restrictive policies, increasingly hostile environments, and often lack the same rights as permanent residents or citizens.
The new report, “The Mountain is in Front of Us and the Sea is Behind Us,” is based on nearly 50 interviews conducted by AIUSA with refugees currently living in Lebanon and Jordan. The report describes the desperate circumstances faced by families who continue to be locked in an impossible limbo because of discriminatory U.S. policies as they try to seek a safe new life and permanent home.
“These are families who put their trust in the United States at their most desperate hour, and now find themselves on the brink of catastrophe through absolutely no fault of their own,” said Denise Bell, researcher at AIUSA. “They have already made the wrenching decision to leave their homes and are now bearing the discriminatory impacts of U.S. policies. Their situation is only getting worse. The U.S. government must live up to its promise to these families and countless other refugees. It has a responsibility to protect refugee rights, and turning its back on refugees is one more abysmal abdication of its obligations. ”
Among the refugees that AIUSA spoke with were Ahmed Amari* (name changed for the family’s protection) and his family. They are Syrian refugees who fled to Beirut in 2013. They registered as refugees with the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR in 2014, and were told to prepare for their new home in Virginia in December 2016. When President Trump signed the Muslim ban in January 2017, Ahmed was told to wait until the ban was over before his case would proceed.
Two-and-a-half years after he was initially cleared to enter the United States, Ahmed will soon lose his residency status, exposing him and his family to the risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, and forcible return to Syria. The carpet store where he works is closing in a few months, and it is extremely difficult to find a new job without a residency permit. The family cannot return to Syria because of the war for fear of the ongoing armed conflict and the possibility of forcible conscription by the Syrian military. “It is really hard, really difficult [living in limbo in Lebanon],” Ahmed and his wife Amina* told AIUSA.
Another refugee that AIUSA spoke with was Malik,* who fled from Baghdad to Beirut with his wife and two sons after fearing for their lives because of their Christian faith. Malik’s family had gone so far as to complete trainings to prepare for their new lives in the U.S. after his case was approved. Since the Muslim Ban was signed in 2017, his case has been held up due to what he is told are “security checks,” even though it was previously approved.
When asked what he would say if he could speak with President Trump, Malik said, “We are refugees. We’re human refugees. We’re refugees because there are difficult situations that made us flee . . . Please, so that we’re able to live. We want to live; we want to live in peace.”
The U.S. has historically resettled the largest number of refugees annually from around the world. Since the modern U.S. Refugee Assistance Program was established in 1980, the average number of persons being resettled each fiscal year (FY) was 80,000. This changed in 2017 when one of President Trump’s first acts in office was to cut the refugee admissions goal from 110,000, which President Obama set in his last year in office, to 45,000 — the lowest refugee admissions cap ever set to that point. Barely 22,000 refugees were resettled by the end of FY 2018 – the lowest number admitted in the history of the program. Under the current U.S. administration, refugee resettlement has dropped 71 percent in three years.
Trump’s discriminatory policies have decimated refugee resettlement from Lebanon and Jordan, which host the highest number of refugees in the world relative to their populations.
The report also chronicles the devastating effects of the elimination of U.S. funding for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). The report recommends fully restoring humanitarian assistance to UNRWA’s critical mandate in providing humanitarian assistance to refugees in the region.
“Refugees are not a threat, and refugees are not just numbers,” said Bell. “Refugees are women, men, and children with unique stories to tell. We talked to teachers, artists, engineers, laborers, and homemakers – people like you and me and everyone we know. All they want is what any person in their situation would want – safety, a place to call home, work to support themselves, and education for their children. They  just want to live with dignity.”
The report calls on the U.S. to hold to the goal of admitting at least 30,000 refugees in FY 2019, and to increase the goal to at least 95,000 in 2020 .
“Congress must do its job and hold the Trump administration accountable to refugees,”  said Ryan Mace, grassroots advocacy and refugee specialist for AIUSA. “This means rejecting the president’s proposed devastating cuts and instead providing life-saving humanitarian aid to refugees and displaced populations. The administration must ensure that  the United States does not discriminate against refugees based on how they worship or where they come from.”

Amnesty International is urging its members and supporters to do all they can to help this vital and timely campaign. 
The people of Grassy Narrows are living with the devastating consequences of a half century of mercury contamination of their rivers and lakes. The harm they’ve experienced, including erosion of culture, loss of livelihoods, and one of the worst community health crises anywhere in Canada, has been made so much worse by decades of government denial and inaction.  
Last month, federal Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan visited Grassy Narrows but failed to deliver on a long promised treatment centre for mercury survivors.  
This stalling and inaction is all the more shocking in light of the fact that two of the United Nations independent human rights advisors, the expert of health and the expert on toxic wastes, have now both urged Canada to take action on the mercury crisis. 
Here’s what you can do to support the people of Grassy Narrows at this crucial moment:

Forty-five years later, this discrimination persists. Amnesty International spoke with Quebec Native Women’s Legal and Policy analyst Éloïse Décoste to learn more about steps her organization is taking to end sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act once and for all. Here’s what she had to say. 
The Indian Act determines who is consider an Indian in the eyes of the government. Historically, an Indian* would be defined as a man, his wife, and his children. When an Indian woman married a man without Indian status, she lost her own status and could not pass her status on to her children. This was the situation until 1985. 
In 1985, after Indigenous women mobilized and took legal action and raised concerns with international bodies, and after Canada adopted the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the Indian Act was amended by Bill C-31. This bill removed the explicit discrimination against Indigenous women, and allowed women who had married non-Indian men and lost their status to have their status reinstated. But the Bill introduced some new forms of discrimination. 
Bill C-31 created two categories of Indians—6(1) and 6(2)—which refer to sections of the Indian Act, and impacts your ability to pass along your status to your children. If both parents are Indian the child is entitled to 6(1) status, regardless of gender. So on it’s face, the Act seems neutral. But, it is more complex than that. If one parent has 6(1) status, and the other does not, the child get 6(2) status. But if one parent has 6(2) status, and the other parent does not have status, the child is not entitled to status and thus is not considered an “Indian” in the eyes of the law. What we see here is the continuation of the assimilationist goal of the Indian Act, which previously was carried out through the exclusion of women and now is pursued through inter-generational exclusion.    
The other aspect is that the Bill C-31 introduced a hierarchy of 6(1) status. All those who had status prior to 1985 maintained it and received 6(1)(a) status (this includes non-Indigenous women who had acquired status by marrying an indigenous man). But the women who had lost status through marriage and had it reinstated by the bill received 6(1)(c). 
What this did in practice is that two cousins, both of whom have one parent that is Indigenous and one that is not, will not be entitled to the same status, depending on the gender of their Indigenous parent. The cousin whose father is his Indigenous parent will have 6(1) status, while the cousin whose mother is his Indigenous parent will have 6(2) status. As discussed above, this in turn will have impact upon the next generation with regards to their respective ability to transmit status to their children and grandchildren. 
Despite court challenges in 2010 and 2015 which led to new amendments in the Indian Act, the differences in status between 6(1) and 6(2) remains. Moreover, with each amendment the government further reinforced the logic of hierarchy of 6(1) status by creating new subparagraph, rather than removing such hierarchy which would solve a good amount of discrimination. 
Without status, some women could not live on reserves, take part of the civil, political and social life of their community and evolve within their own language and culture, Consequently, when they were reinstated, they were seen as outsiders. Having different categories of “Indians” creates a system where some women are seen as “less Indian” in their communities. 
It is clear with the issue of violence and missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls is related to the precarity and vulnerability of Indigenous women and girl created notably by the exclusion and devaluing of Indigenous women in their communities through their exclusion from status and therefore the right to participate in the life of their community. 
There’s the trauma of being excluded and being considered less. There’s the challenge of being seen as Indigenous from the settler world but not seen as Indigenous from the Indigenous world. 
The fact that women were excluded from decisions in their communities has also led to a lack of interest in the issues affecting Indigenous women. 
There are two key changes that need to be made. The discrimination was corrected in parts but they only impacted women who lost their status between 1951 and 1985. These two cut off dates maintain the discrimination. The cut off dates must be removed to end the discrimination. 
The 1951 cut off date was intended to be removed by the last bill that was adopted (Bill S3) in 2017, but the implementation of the specific provision on the cut off date was suspended and it’s not clear when it will come into effect. The government insists it has to consult first, although there is not doubt that the Indian Act pre-1951 was just as discriminatory as the Indian Act post-1951. That speaks to the politicization of the issue. 
Laws surrounding Indian status continue to change, increasing the number of status Indians. But the funding and land base for communities have not increased, so there is reluctance from leadership and others to remove the discrimination. More members with the same funding and land base means less resources for more people.  Removing the 1951 cut off date is seen as opening up the flood gate to a ton of registrations and creating community pressures. But this perception does not seem to match real statistics. It seems to be more a scare tactic to delay equality. 
Indigenous women’s groups have been fighting for “6(1)(a) all the way” for years. This was confirmed by the UN Human Rights Committee decision issued in January 2019 in the McIvor case, which said that the categories of 6(1) status has created stigma and discrimination and should be removed. 
Government has been resistant because the goal of the Indian Act was assimilation and removing the discrimination doesn’t help with that. It’s just a new mechanism to pass the Charter test around discrimination but continue to move towards having less and less Indians. 
When we see the crisis of under-funding of services on reserve, it’s not an actual problem of cost, it’s a problem of priority. It all goes back to the constitutional responsibilities of Canada towards Indigenous peoples. 
That’s why, at the end of the day, what our petition and campaign is about is about removing all forms of discrimination as a first step towards moving away from the Indian Act and towards self-determination and the full implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. First, we need to remove discrimination so everyone can be at the table when self-determination is discussed. 
Fully implement UN decision in the McIvor case, which says that the hierarchy of categories of status in 6(1) should be eliminated and remove all other forms of discrimination within the Indian Act, including the cut-off dates and the very problematic rules around unstated or unknown paternity. Moreover, those whose rights have been violated should be provided with reparations. 
We want to end sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act by introducing legislation or amending existing legislation to remove the hierarchy of status in 6(1) and 6(2). We are also calling on government to issue a decree immediately to remove the cut-off date for reinstating status to Indigenous women. Once that is done, we believe we need to work of moving beyond the archaic system of the Indian Act towards self-determination.  
*The term “Indian” is used to refer to people with legal status under the Indian Act. In contexts not related discussing the Indian Act, Amnesty International uses the terms Indigenous, or the distinction-based terms First Nations, Métis, and Inuit.

Following an admission by Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC) that they all met the country’s security chiefs on 2 June, and after receiving undisclosed advice from the Attorney General and the Head of the Judiciary, ordered the dispersal of peaceful protestors on 3 June, which “by mistake” killed more than 100 people and injured hundreds more, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes Sarah Jackson said:
“It is completely outrageous and unacceptable that what has now been confirmed to have been a carefully planned attack on sleeping protestors has in the same breath been reduced to a ‘mistake’.
“The senseless killing of protestors must be stopped immediately, and those responsible for the bloodbath, including at command level, must be held fully accountable for their actions.
“The Attorney General and Head of the Judiciary should urgently clarify the advice they gave before leaving the meeting where this decision was taken. The world needs to understand the extent to which they advised the security forces on the legality and proportionality of deadly force used.
“Following this admission, it is now more urgent than ever, in the interest of accountability and transparency, that the military authorities allow international scrutiny and investigations by the United Nations and African Union into the escalating human rights violations under their watch.”
Background
The TMC spokesperson Lieutenant General Shams al-Deen al-Kabashi on 13 June issued a statement about the 2 June meeting where the decision was taken to clear the protestor sit-in area near the military headquarters in Khartoum. The statement reads in part:
“In the evening before the implementation of the decision to clear the sit-in area, we called for a meeting attended by all members of the TMC, the head of military intelligence, the head of General Staff Command (army), the head of national security and his deputy, the head of police and his deputy, and the head of RSF. We also requested the Head of the Judiciary and the Attorney General to attend this meeting to provide us with legal advice on how to deal with this situation.

“The ugly scenes of police using tear gas and pepper spray against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters is a violation of international law. Police have a duty to maintain public order, but in doing so they may use force only when strictly necessary. Hong Kong’s police have today failed to live up to this standard.
“The police have taken advantage of the violent acts of a small minority as a pretext to use excessive force against the vast majority of peaceful protesters.
“Tear gas and projectiles like rubber bullets are notoriously inaccurate and indiscriminate and can result in serious injury and even death. They should only ever be used in a targeted response to specific acts of violence and never to disperse peaceful protesters.
“This excessive response from police is fuelling tensions and is likely to contribute to worsening violence, rather than end it. We urge the Hong Kong police not to repeat such abuses against peaceful protesters, and instead ensure people can legitimately exercise their rights. We also remind police that using force against protesters already brought under control is unlawful.”
Background
On Wednesday, thousands of protesters in Hong Kong took over streets around the city’s government headquarters to demand that the Hong Kong government withdraw proposed amendments to the extradition law. Police started dispersing protesters in the afternoon, using tear gas and pepper spray, and in some instances guns firing bean bags and rubber bullets. Some protesters were taken away by police.
While the afternoon saw increasing clashes between front-line police and protesters in some locations, the tear gas deployed by police affected areas far beyond those skirmishes, where no violence had taken place at all. The impact was compounded by the fact that some escape routes had been blocked off by police, limiting opportunities for demonstrators to get out of harm’s way.
The proposed law changes to expand extradition arrangements would have the effect of enabling the handover of persons in the territory of Hong Kong to mainland China. If enacted, this law would extend the ability of the mainland authorities to target critics, human rights activists, journalists, NGO workers and anyone else in Hong Kong. Amnesty International Hong Kong joined more than 70 other NGOs in a joint letter to Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, calling for the proposed extradition law amendments to be dropped because they pose a direct threat to human rights
Amnesty International continues to monitor the protests in Hong Kong and our experts on the human rights situation in Hong Kong are available for interview.

“Today’s arbitrary and often brutal arrests of over 400 peaceful protestors, including children, are a perfect example of the cruel repression that brought protestors to the streets in the first place. Amnesty International observers witnessed police violence and recorded complaints of detainees being beaten. Yet again, the Russian authorities met peaceful dissent with an assault on rights and freedoms.
“Those who took to the streets of Moscow today were demanding accountability for the appalling treatment of journalist Ivan Golunov, who was arrested on fabricated drugs charges in a blatant attempt to silence him. Confronted by unprecedented public indignation, the authorities backtracked and released Ivan Golunov.
“It is outrageous that those who called for his freedom and now for accountability are being punished for their solidarity. We are calling on the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release those peaceful protesters arrested today and respect the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.”

Since July 2018 the Lebanese authorities have been arranging returns of refugees to Syria, claiming these returns are wholly voluntary. However, Amnesty International’s  analysis shows that people are being pushed back to Syria through a combination of restrictive government policies, dire humanitarian conditions and rampant discrimination.
“Life for many Syrian refugees in Lebanon is marked by fear, constant intimidation and feelings of hopelessness. Despite the Lebanese government’s claims that returns to Syria are voluntary, incidents like the attack on Deir al-Ahmar show that life is becoming intolerable for refugees, leaving many with no choice but to return to Syria,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
The organization has researched how unlawful evictions, curfews, constant raids on refugee camps and mass arrests are making life unbearable for many refugees in Lebanon, forcing many to return to Syria despite the ongoing dangers.
“By failing to ensure refugees are protected from attacks, harassment or intimidation and imposing unfair and restrictive policies that make their lives more difficult, the Lebanese authorities are fuelling an environment that effectively coerces refugees to return to Syria, where they could be at risk of interrogation on arrival, torture, enforced disappearance and other violations and abuses,” said Lynn Maalouf.
For the return of refugees to Syria to be truly voluntary it must be based on their free and informed consent. Amnesty International believes that many Syrian refugees who apply to leave Lebanon are not in a position to take a free and informed decision, for a number of reasons: the dire conditions they face in Lebanon, including difficulties in obtaining or renewing valid residence visas barring them from fully accessing essential services, as well as their lack of access to objective and updated information about the current human rights situation in Syria. 
This means that the Lebanese authorities are in breach of their obligation not to return refugees to a place where they would be at real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations (the obligation of non-refoulement), as they are imposing on them conditions that effectively force them to leave Lebanon.
Deir al-Ahmar
On 5 June, Lebanese authorities ordered the evacuation of Deir al-Ahmar, which housed 600 refugees, after tensions at the camp soared when a fire broke out. Refugees living there complained that firefighters had arrived late, leading to an altercation between the refugees and local residents. NGO workers present at the camp told Amnesty International that some local men from Deir al-Ahmar threatened to burn the refugees in their tents, prompting many to flee immediately.
Later that night, at least 50 men arrived and began to attack the camp, setting three tents on fire and using a bulldozer to demolish another two. They yelled threats at the refugees: “You are sullying our soil – get the hell out of here – burn here and in hell…” None of the security forces present at the camp intervened to stop the attack. A day later, the municipal authorities of Deir al-Ahmar, as well as neighbouring villages and the nearby town of Baalbek, issued a statement ordering Syrian refugees to leave Deir al-Ahmar, describing this order as “for their own protection.”
None of the surrounding villages agreed to take in the refugees but around 90 families out of 120 were finally allowed on 10 June to set up camp in the remote village of Mekna. There, the vast majority are living in fields out in the open without access to electricity, water, food or tents, and no amenities nearby.
Desperate conditions
In another indication of just how hostile the atmosphere for refugees in Lebanon has become, the Free Patriotic Movement, a Lebanese political party, organized a meeting on 8 June to mobilize against Syrian refugees and call for their return. The party circulated leaflets bearing the following slogan: “Syria is safe to return to and Lebanon cannot cope any more” and posters urging people “to protect Lebanese workers” by reporting refugees who violate labour laws.
In April, Lebanon’s Higher Defence Council, a military body, imposed a deadline of 10 June for all “semi-permanent structures” built by Syrian refugees in informal camps in the northern town of Arsal, using cement and higher than 1.5 metres, to be demolished. According to a humanitarian worker in Arsal, the authorities are pressuring the refugees to demolish the structures themselves to avoid images of soldiers forcibly demolishing homes in the camp. A video reviewed by Amnesty International appears to show a female refugee demolishing a concrete wall using a hammer.
A document released by UNHCR on 10 June also revealed that the Lebanese authorities have tightened restrictions on Syrian refugees and children under 15 seeking regular residency status. They have also issued a new decree to deport any Syrian found to have entered Lebanon irregularly after 24 April 2019.
Around 73% of refugees from Syria live in Lebanon without valid residency visas, either because they cannot afford to pay the $200 fee or because of delays in processing applications by local authorities. Refugees without regular migration status risk detention and their access to services such as education and health care is restricted.
End “voluntary returns”
Amnesty International considers the coercive environment in which returns to Syria are taking place means that they are not voluntary. Therefore, the Lebanese authorities are in breach of their obligation under international law not to return refugees back to a place where they would be at real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations.
To date, civilians returning to their place of origin are requested to go through a “security clearance” involving interrogation by Syrian security forces responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses constituting crimes against humanity, including the use of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.
“The Lebanese government must urgently eliminate any coercive factors such as refugees’ inability to obtain official residency papers and other restrictions or stop returns of refugees to Syria altogether. For its part the international community must provide sufficient funding and resources, resettle refugees, and press the Lebanese authorities not to return refugees to Syria until it is clear that the situation there is safe and that the rights of returnees will be protected,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Background:
As of 2019 there are 938,531 Syrian refugees in Lebanon registered with UNHCR and 31,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
In addition, the Lebanese government claims that around 550,000 live in Lebanon unregistered.
In March 2019, General Security announced that 172,046 refugees had returned to Syria since December 2017 due to easing administrative restrictions and facilitating and organizing returns.

Bill C-262, a...","We are hopeful that in a matter of days the Senate will vote to adopt a private member’s bill that would require the federal government to begin in earnest the work of implementing global human rights standards to protect the cultures, lives and well-being of Indigenous peoples.
Bill C-262, a Bill to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is a vital and necessary step for reconciliation in Canada, consistent with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s recognition of the UN Declaration as “the framework” for reconciliation.
However, some Conservative Senators have already used stalling tactics to delay the Bill’s passage through the Senate and there is concern that they might use such tactics again to prevent a final vote.
These Senators have claimed to support the UN Declaration and the rights of Indigenous peoples while asserting that Bill C-262 is “rushed” and that Parliament has not had the opportunity to understand the “far-reaching” implications of implementing the UN Declaration.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Bill C-262 was adopted by the House of Commons more than a year ago following Committee hearings in which 71 witnesses were called. The Bill has now been subject to further consideration in the Senate. More to the point, the UN Declaration itself is not new or unknown.  It rests on a foundation of long-established international human rights standards that have been subject to extensive debate in Canada and internationally.
The UN Declaration was the product of more than two decades of deliberation within the UN system before its adoption in 2007. No other international human rights instrument has been subject to such long and rigorous consideration. Critically, Indigenous peoples from Canada and federal officials both played an active role in this lengthy process.
Since its adoption in 2007, the Declaration has also been reaffirmed ten times by consensus resolutions of the UN General Assembly. No State in the world currently objects to this human rights instrument.
Furthermore, all the provisions of the Declaration reflect norms and standards that were already established in international law when the Declaration was adopted. This includes provisions on self-determination contained in international treaties ratified by Canada in the 1970s.
Because of the Harper government’s initial opposition, the UN Declaration has also been the subject of extensive public debate in Canada, including within Parliament.
In 2010, the Harper government issued a formal statement endorsing the Declaration, adding that the government was “confident” that the Declaration could be interpreted “in a manner consistent with our Constitution and legal framework.” According to the statement, the basis of that confidence was having reviewed the Declaration, listened to Indigenous leaders, and learned from the experience of other countries.
In its Calls to Action, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada has called on federal and other governments to fully implement the UN Declaration as “the framework” for reconciliation.
Bill C-262 is itself modest in scope. Canada has repeatedly committed to implement the UN Declaration. The Bill would create a legislative framework to guide the federal government’s role in that work of implementation. 
Critically, the Bill does NOT have the effect of codifying the Declaration into Canadian law.
Bill C-262 calls for a process by which federal laws can be reviewed in a systematic and collaborative way to ensure that Canada’s commitment to uphold the UN Declaration is being met. It would be up to Parliament to enact any required legislative changes identified in this process.
The fact is that Canadian courts regularly use international human rights standards to interpret Canadian law and work to avoid contradictions between the interpretation of Canadian law and Canada’s international commitments. The UN Declaration is already being applied by Canadian courts to interpret Canadian law in exactly this way. C-262 affirms this practice.
The Bill also calls for the government to collaborate with Indigenous peoples in developing a broader national implementation plan. Parliament would be provided an annual report on the progress being made.
Surely this is a better way forward than the piecemeal, uncoordinated and often contradictory approach taken to meeting Canada’s international human rights commitments?
The Liberal government has shifted position to fully support Bill C-262 just as the Conservative government before it changed its position to formally support the UN Declaration. By setting out a legislated requirement to move ahead with the work of implementation of the UN Declaration, Bill C-262 provides an important insulation against whatever political winds may blow under future governments. Anyone who supports implementation of the Declaration should support such a measure.
Because there is no basis for claims that C-262 has been rushed, our Nations and organizations call on all Senators to ensure the Bill is brought to a vote in a timely fashion and passed into law during this session of Parliament. If, instead, some Senators continue to employ procedural tactics to essentially kill the Bill, and oppose the human rights of Indigenous peoples, this will be a very regressive and shameful landmark in the history of the Parliament of Canada.

“Today’s court judgement sends a strong message that no one should be harassed, discriminated against or criminalized because of their sexual orientation. With this ruling, Botswana has said ‘no’ to intolerance and hate and ‘yes’ to hope and equality for all people,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“For far too long, people entering same-sex relationships in Botswana were discriminated against by the very same laws that are supposed to protect them. This court decision marks an exciting new era of acceptance, which should inspire other African countries to follow suit.”
Botswana is the latest country in Africa to decriminalize same sex relations, following Angola in January 2019, Seychelles in June 2016, Mozambique in June 2015 and São Tomé and Príncipe, and Lesotho in 2012.
However, another 29 countries in Africa retain laws criminalizing same sex relations, including Kenya, where a law banning gay sex was upheld by the Kenyan High Court in May 2019.
“It is absolutely thrilling that people in Botswana will no longer be considered criminals because of who they are and who they love. Authorities must immediately implement this progressive judgement,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
Background
On 14 March 2019, the Gaborone High Court heard an application to challenge the constitutionality of sections 164(a), 164(c) and 167 of the Botswana Penal Code which criminalised “Unnatural Offences” and “indecent practices”.
The provisions criminalised consensual sexual acts between consenting adults of the same sex and created a climate in which people could be discriminated against, harassed or subjected to violence with impunity because of their real or perceived sexual orientation.
The Lesbians, Gays & Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO), a local NGO, challenged the colonial era piece of legislation in court, with the Southern Africa Litigation Centre providing legal support.

UN and AU set to vote to close UNAMID peacekeeping mission on 27 June
Peacekeeper drawdown would expose civilians to brutal tactics of Sudanese security forces
UN and AU must pause the drawdown of UNAMID and resist Transitional Military Council demand to hand over bases to Rapid Support Forces 
Amnesty International has disturbing new evidence, including satellite imagery, showing that Sudanese government forces, including the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, have continued to commit war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Darfur. In the past year these have included the complete or partial destruction of at least 45 villages, unlawful killings, and sexual violence.
Tens of thousands of civilians currently protected by United Nations (UN)/African Union (AU) peacekeepers (UNAMID) in Jebel Marra, Darfur, must not be placed at the mercy of the RSF, a ruthless Sudanese security force that has committed crimes against humanity and war crimes, the organization warned ahead of a crucial vote on the mission’s future on 27 June.
If the UN Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Council authorize UNAMID’s closure, it would effectively give the RSF control over civilian areas. Formed from the former “Janjaweed” militia, the RSF are responsible for crimes against humanity in Darfur’s Jebel Marra region as well as the ongoing bloody crackdown on protesters in Khartoum since 3 June.
“In Darfur, as in Khartoum, we’ve witnessed the Rapid Support Forces’ despicable brutality against Sudanese civilians – the only difference being, in Darfur they have committed atrocities with impunity for years. Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC) must immediately withdraw the RSF from any policing and law enforcement operations, especially in Khartoum and Darfur, and confine them to their barracks in the interests of public safety,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“As for the UN and the AU, they must not turn their backs on people in Darfur who rely on peacekeepers for protection. A decision to close UNAMID would recklessly and needlessly place tens of thousands of lives at risk by removing their only safeguard against the government’s scorched earth campaign.”
UNAMID drawdown
In 2017 and 2018, the UN and AU decided to dramatically reduce the number of UNAMID troops, close the majority of its bases, and reconfigure the remainder of the mission to focus on the protection of civilians in the Jebel Marra region of Darfur, where the human rights and protection concerns were greatest. At the end of June, the AU and UN are considering voting to withdraw all the remaining peacekeepers from Darfur by June 2020, including the majority of the remaining team sites by December 2019.
The closed UNAMID bases were supposed to be handed over to the government to use for civilian purposes but are, in fact, nearly all being used by the RSF. This same Sudanese government security force carried out crimes against humanity in North and South Darfur in 2014, in Jebel Marra in 2015 and 2016, continues to carry out war crimes and other serious human rights violations in Jebel Marra, and was chiefly responsible for killing scores of protesters in the Sudanese capital of Khartoum since 3 June 2019. Moreover, Sudan’s current governing body – the TMC – has demanded that the remaining UNAMID bases be handed over directly to the RSF.
“Given the RSF’s history of brutality in Jebel Marra, North Darfur, South Darfur, Southern Kordofan, and Blue Nile, and the shocking violence the very same forces have been meting out against protesters in Khartoum in recent days, it is bewildering that the UN and AU would even consider removing the last peacekeepers from Darfur, effectively handing over control of civilian areas in Jebel Marra to them at this time,” said Jonathan Loeb, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International.
“The logic behind the drawdown was premised on the idea that peacekeepers should withdraw once conditions on the ground had sufficiently improved. This arguably made sense in certain parts of Darfur, but it is not the case in Jebel Marra. Perversely, the UN is using its own failure to document the violence in Jebel Marra as the basis for its argument that the mission should close.”
Evidence of ongoing ‘scorched earth’ attacks
Hundreds of thousands have died from direct violence and conflict-related disease and starvation during the conflict in Darfur. According to the UN, approximately 2 million people remain displaced by violence in Darfur, many of whom remain refugees in neighboring Chad.
Despite severe government restrictions on access to Jebel Marra for journalists, independent human rights monitors, and UNAMID, Amnesty International has been able to confirm recent attacks against the region’s civilians, much of which have gone unreported by the mission.
Satellite evidence and testimonies confirm that government forces and associated militias damaged or destroyed at least 45 villages in Jebel Marra between July 2018 and February 2019. Amnesty International has also documented other abuses by security forces, including unlawful killings, sexual violence, systematic looting, and forced displacement.
Jebel Marra civilians taking refuge at UNAMID base
Closing the mission could have a devastating impact on the displaced population in and around Jebel Marra, many of whom rely on UNAMID bases for protection.
UNAMID’s Sortoni base in northern Jebel Marra is one example of where UNAMID’s presence is still vital. In 2016, tens of thousands of civilians fled to the area immediately around the base after the Sudanese government forces destroyed their villages; many remain there today, unable to go home because of fear of ongoing attacks by security forces against people who attempt to return to their areas to farm. Closing the base will leave people exposed to attack by the very same fighters who destroyed their villages and still continued to carry out attacks in the area during the past year.
Amnesty International interviewed people living around Sortoni and other UNAMID bases in Jebel Marra, nearly all of whom said they feared a return to large-scale violence if UNAMID left, and that they would be forced to flee again if this happens.
Adam, a 54-year-old man who was displaced to Sortoni by violence in 2016 told Amnesty International that his brother was killed in late 2018 when he tried to return to his farm in northern Jebel Marra. Adam told Amnesty International that he is fearful of UNAMID leaving: “UNAMID, even though they are not doing much… their existence is a threat to the [security forces] who want to mistreat people… that is why [those forces] don’t commit atrocities. If UNAMID is not there then they will have nothing to fear. … If no one is protecting them there will be unimaginable behavior. Anyone who is armed can do anything.”
“Although UNAMID has consistently failed to prevent attacks on villages, it has been able to provide protection for civilians displaced by violence who manage to get themselves to safety near UNAMID bases. In certain parts of Darfur this protection is still urgently needed and UNAMID’s mere presence in these areas justifies the mission’s continued existence in Jebel Marra,” said Jonathan Loeb.
RSF crackdown in Khartoum
The case against closing UNAMID has been made even stronger by events in Khartoum on 3 June, when the RSF swept into protest sites and opened fire on unarmed people, killing more than 100 and injuring many more. Senior commanders in charge of the TMC – which includes the RSF – are the same individuals responsible for carrying out atrocities in Darfur.
“It’s hard to imagine a worse time to decide to close UNAMID. Sudan is in the middle of a political crisis. And given that the men who have retained political and military power are the architects of many of the most violent campaigns during the Darfur conflict, it would be dangerously naive for the UN Security Council and the AU Peace and Security Council to dismiss the possibility of an escalation of violence against civilians in Darfur. A decision to remove the last remaining peacekeepers from Darfur at this time would reveal a shocking lack of understanding about the current reality in Sudan,” said Jonathan Loeb.

Parole comes days after detention of journalist, Ivan Golunov  
Responding to news that Shali City Court in Chechnya has granted parole to the imprisoned human rights defender Oyub Titiev after almost one-and-a-half years behind bars, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia said:
“We have been calling for Oyub Titiev’s immediate and unconditional release since his detention. The real agenda behind his criminal prosecution on trumped up charges was to stop a human rights defender from doing his lawful human rights work.
“In spite of overwhelming evidence that the case against him had been fabricated, the authorities in Chechnya crudely abused the justice system to convict an innocent man. Today the court decided to at least partially amend the gross injustice by releasing Oyub in ten days time.
“But if justice is to prevail, Oyub Titiev’s conviction should be quashed, and he must be given access to an effective remedy, including compensation, for his unlawful imprisonment. We further call on the Russian authorities to ensure a safe and enabling environment for human rights defenders in Chechnya and elsewhere in Russia.
“This decision comes just days after prominent Russian investigative journalist Ivan Golunov was detained and charged with supplying drugs amid allegations that he was framed, held incommunicado and beaten in custody. He is currently under house arrest and we call on his allegations against the authorities to be immediately investigated.”
Background
Oyub Titiev, the head of the Chechen office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre, was stopped in his car by police on 9 January 2018 and held incommunicado for several hours. The Chechen authorities later stated that drugs had been “discovered” in his car. Titiev denied the allegations and insisted the drugs had been planted by police.
He was sentenced to four years in a penal colony for “drugs possession” (Article 228, part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) by the Shali City Court in Chechnya on 18 March 2019. Prior to the sentencing, he spent one year and two months in pre-trial detention.
Amnesty International believes Oyub Titiev was a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for his work for the victims of human rights abuses in the Chechen Republic.

For 52 years, tens of thousands of Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), resulting in the displacement of thousands of Palestinians. The wanton destruction of property and the forcible transfer of civilians in the occupied territory are both war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
 
When a power assumes the occupation of a territory, it also assumes responsibility for the protection, security, and welfare of the local population in the occupied territory under international law.  
Israel must respect and guarantee protections for the local Palestinian population under international humanitarian and human rights law. Generations of Palestinians living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories have fallen victim to a discriminatory system built to repress their rights and freedoms. 
For 52 years, it has been an Israeli government policy to promote the creation and expansion of Israeli settlements in the OPT. These settlements are directly linked to the mass human rights violations faced by Palestinians in the occupied territory. These violations include: 
Violation of the right to equality and non-discrimination; 
Violation of the right to adequate housing; 
Violation of the right to liberty of movement;  
Violation of the right to access to an effective remedy for acts violating fundamental rights;  
Violation of the right to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health; 
Violation of the right to water;  
Violation of the right to education; 
Violation of the right to earn a decent living through work; 
Violation of the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly;  
Violations of the right to liberty, security of the person and equal treatment before the law; 
Violations of the right of the child; 
Violations of the right to family life; 
Violations of the right to life 
As the Israeli government continues to pursues policies promoting the expansion of illegal settlements, it enforced a discriminatory system against Palestinians residing in the same territory, by enacting military laws to increase barriers to Palestinians in obtaining building permits, demolishing Palestinian structures for building without permits, and charging punitive costs for the demolition of homes. This has resulted in the forcible transfer and displacement of communities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories from their lands. 
For 52 years, Israel has acted in breach of international humanitarian law through the appropriation and destruction of Palestinian property. The Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits “the destruction of private or state property, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations.”  
Article 49 of the Convention also states that an occupying power is prohibited from deporting or transferring parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. Yet, programs and financial incentives have been geared towards supporting Israeli settlers and growing illegal settlements.  
Settlements and settlers linked to the tourism industry are experiencing an increase in support, as the Israeli government announced it would spend $13 million USD on excavations at the settler-managed archaeological site, the City of David. This site is located in the predominantly Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan. The Prime Minister’s office also announced subsidies for the “establishment, conservation, and expansion” of hotels, B&Bs, and guest rooms in the settlements in the West Bank. 
As Israel continues to build these programs, the country is experiencing an increase in visitors, with more than 4 million tourists recorded in 2018. This has resulted in great financial profits to both Israel and the businesses operating within the Occupied Palestinian Territories. These businesses include digital tourism companies, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor. 
The US-based TripAdvisor, which recorded an average of nearly 455 million visitors per month in 2017, lists more than 70 different attractions, tours, restaurants, cafes, hotels, and rental apartments within settlements of the OPT and East Jerusalem, often mislabelling them as being part of Israel. TripAdvisor also lists tourist attractions, many of which are drivers behind some of the human rights violations of Palestinian communities in Qaryut, Jalud, and Khirbet Susiya. The listing of these sites make TripAdvisor complicit in Israel’s human rights violations of the residents of these neighborhoods.

The responsibility to uphold international human rights and humanitarian law is not only the responsibility of the state – it is also the responsibility of businesses operating within the state. Companies operating in or with settlements must consider the standards relating to the protection of populations of occupied territories. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor are contributing to and profiting from the maintenance, development, and expansion of illegal settlements.  
The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights states that companies have a responsibility to respect all internationally recognized human rights wherever they operate. Companies must avoid causing or contributing to the violations of human rights in their operations. In cases where these violations cannot be prevented, companies must refrain from operating as the only course of action. Companies that fail to withdraw from these situations may stand in direct contradiction with their own corporate standards.  
It’s time for Canada to stop supporting Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land. We want the Canadian government and Canadian businesses to stop enabling the economy that keeps these illegal settlements growing and fuels the human rights violations of Palestinians.  
The forcible displacement, the confiscation of land and natural resources, the demolition of homes, property and infrastructure, and restrictions on movement continues to have a direct and devastating impact on Palestinian rights to adequate standards of living, work, housing, health and education.  
Amnesty’s Destination: Occupation campaign calls on digital tourism companies to stop providing listings in illegal settlements. We call on governments around the world to take regulatory action to prevent companies such as these from doing business in or with Israel’s illegal settlements in line with their legal commitments.   
Amnesty’s Occupation @50 campaign brings to light the more than half-century of these human rights abuses in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Join us in putting an end to these violations by demanding that the Canadian government ban settlement products from entering our markets, and stop companies domiciled in Canada from operating in illegal settlements.

Dear Friends at Amnesty International, 
Words cannot express how overwhelmed and thankful I am for the Urgent Action you initiated regarding the threats against me and the attacks against human rights defenders in the Philippines! Indeed, during the past months, several dreadful events occurred, including the killings of peasant leaders in the Negros province and the assassination of our dear colleague, city councillor Bernardino ‘Toto’ Patigas. Toto is the 58th Karapatan human rights worker who has been killed since we created the alliance. 
I and my fellow human rights workers of Karapatan have received an almost daily barrage of death threats, vilification and smear campaigns as we all navigate this increasing constriction of civil society space and the nagging sense of danger under the current administration. On May 6, 2019, we filed a petition for the writs of amparo and habeas data to seek legal protection from the Supreme Court and for the disclosure and destruction of all government files or records that may endanger us. Your voices made me/us feel that we are not alone, and that solidarity indeed knows no boundaries.  
As we brace for the results of the midterm Philippine elections on May 13, we take heart and strength from the support of the communities we serve, and the support of friends like you in the international community. It is our solemn pledge that we shall continue to defend and uphold human rights and people’s rights in the Philippines, despite the perils.

The organization has confirmed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution sought the death penalty for Murtaja Qureiris...","Saudi Arabia must not use the death penalty to punish a young man who was arrested at the age of 13 for participating in anti-government protests, said Amnesty International today.
The organization has confirmed that Saudi Arabia’s Public Prosecution sought the death penalty for Murtaja Qureiris in August 2018 for a series of offences, some of which date back to when he was just 10 years old. CNN this week revealed he was facing the death penalty and published video footage showing him participating in bike protests in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province as a young boy in 2011.
“There should be no doubt that the Saudi Arabian authorities are ready to go to any length to crack down on dissent against their own citizens, including by resorting to the death penalty for men who were merely boys at the time of their arrest,” said Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf.
“It is appalling that Murtaja Qureiris is facing execution for offences that include taking part in protests while he was just 10 years old.”
The use of the death penalty for offences committed by people below 18 years of age is strictly prohibited by international law.
Mainly populated by Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority, the Eastern Province saw waves of protests in the aftermath of the 2011 Arab uprisings which the authorities have cracked down over the years, including through prosecutions.
Murtaja Qureiris, now aged 18, was arrested in September 2014 and detained at Dar al-Mulahaza at the juvenile detention centre in al-Dammam city. He was held in solitary confinement for a month and subjected to beatings and intimidation during his interrogation. His interrogators promised to release him if he confessed to the charges against him. In May 2017 he was moved to al-Mabaheth prison in al-Dammam, an adult prison, even though he was just 16 years old. Throughout his detention he was denied access to a lawyer until after his first court session in August 2018 at the Specialized Criminal Court, an anti-terror court set up in 2008, that has increasingly been used for cases involving human rights activists and protesters. 
The charges against him include participating in anti-government protests, attending the funeral of his brother Ali Qureiris who was killed in a protest in 2011, joining a “terrorist organization,” throwing Molotov cocktails at a police station, and firing at security forces. He is currently awaiting his next trial session.
“The Saudi Arabian authorities have a chilling track record of using the death penalty as a weapon to crush political dissent and punish anti-government protesters -including children- from the country’s persecuted Shi’a minority,” said Lynn Maalouf.
In April, Amnesty International confirmed the execution of Abdulkareem al-Hawaj, another Shi’a young man arrested aged 16 and convicted of offences related to his involvement in anti-government protests. He was among 37 men put to death in one day as part of a gruesome execution spree earlier this year.
Three other Shi’a men Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon, who were arrested individually in 2012 aged 17, 16 and 17 respectively, in connection with their involvement in anti-government protests, are at risk of being executed at any time.
“Instead of stepping up their use of the death penalty to silence critics Saudi Arabia’s authorities should immediately revoke the death sentences against Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon and save these young men’s lives. The international community also has a crucial role – they must take a public stand on these cases and demand that the Saudi authorities end their use of the death penalty once and for all,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Saudi Arabia has an appalling record of using the death penalty – including against children – after grossly unfair trials that rely on confessions extracted through torture. Use of the death penalty is appalling in all circumstances but it is even more so when it is applied after an unfair trial. Amnesty International opposes the use of the death penalty in all circumstances without exception.

Background
Since 2014 more than 100 Shi’a Saudi Arabians have been tried before the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) on vague and wide-ranging charges arising from their opposition to the government, including peaceful criticism of the authorities.
Amnesty International has documented that a number of cases of Shi’a activists tried before the SCC have faced grossly unfair trials with defendants convicted and, in many cases, sentenced to death on vague charges that criminalise peaceful opposition and on the basis of “confessions” extracted through torture or other coercive means.

Police in Addis Ababa this morning prevented journalist and former Amnesty International Prisoner of Conscience, Eskinder Nega, from holding a press conference to announce plans for his new TV station, Senai. Police officers blocked the entrance to the Hilton hotel turning journalists and other attendees away. 
This follows a similar move on 3 June when the police barred a previous press conference organized by Eskinder to announce his plans for his TV channel at the Ethiopia Hotel, also in Addis Ababa.
“This harassment is solely aimed at frustrating the outspoken Eskinder Nega and curtailing his right to freedom of expression. It is unacceptable and must be stopped because Ethiopia’s laws do not require press conferences to be approved or licensed. The police have no right to stop press conferences,” said Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
In March this year, Eskinder tried to hold another press conference on the administration of Addis Ababa but it was cancelled by the police for “security reasons”.
Eskinder also uses Twitter to voice his opinions on a variety of issues, where he has also faced hostility, including threats to his life.
“This week’s interference with Eskinder’s press conferences show that the police and other authorities are not fulfilling their role in upholding freedom of expression in Ethiopia,” said Joan Nyanyuki.
“While Eskinder’s statements may be offensive to some, they fall under the right to freedom of expression permitted under international law and must therefore be respected.”
The Ethiopian authorities must consider training the police on human rights and their role in upholding and protecting everyone’s rights, as well as designing a national awareness campaign to sensitize the public on human rights as the country emerges from decades of repression.
Background
Eskinder Nega, a journalist and blogger, was released from prison in February 2018 after serving seven years of an 18-year prison sentence. Since his release, he has been publishing the weekly Ethiopis newspaper. He has been leading discussions on issues such as democracy, ethnic nationalism, and the administration of Addis Ababa.

“The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International’s highest honour, celebrating people who have shown unique leadership and courage in standing up for human rights. I can think of no better recipients this year than Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future climate strike movement,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“We are humbled and inspired by the determination with which youth activists across the world are challenging us all to confront the realities of the climate crisis. Every young person taking part in Fridays for Future embodies what it means to act on your conscience. They remind us that we are more powerful than we know and that we all have a role to play in protecting human rights against climate catastrophe.”
The Ambassador of Conscience Award was founded in 2002 to celebrate individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by acting on their conscience, confronting injustice and using their talents to inspire others.  Previous awardees include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, Harry Belafonte, Ai Weiwei, the Youth Groups of West and Central Africa, Angélique Kidjo, the Indigenous rights movement in Canada, Alicia Keys and Colin Kaepernick.
A youth movement determined to change the world
The Fridays for Future movement was started by Greta Thunberg, a teenager from Sweden who in August 2018 decided to miss school every Friday and instead protest outside the Swedish parliament until it took more serious action to tackle climate change.
Her efforts to raise awareness of the climate crisis quickly went global. More than 1 million young people from all over the world took part in the most recent global day of Fridays for Future school strikes on 24 May. Demonstrations were held in more than 100 countries, including Australia, Brazil, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, the Philippines and Uganda.
“It is a huge honour to receive Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award on behalf of Fridays for Future. This is not my award, this is everyone’s award. It is amazing to see the recognition we are getting and know that we are fighting for something that is having an impact,” said Greta Thunberg.
“To act on your conscience means that you fight for what you think is right. I think all those who are part of this movement are doing that, because we have a duty to try and improve the world. The blatant injustice we all need to fight against is that people in the global south are the ones who are and will be most affected by climate change while they are the least responsible for causing it.”
A human rights crisis
While the climate crisis is usually understood through the impacts it is having on our natural environment, the devastating consequences of these impacts on people, both now and in the future, make it an urgent human rights issue as well. Climate change compounds and magnifies existing inequalities. And its effects will continue to grow and worsen over time, creating ruin for current and future generations.
Amnesty International has said that the failure of governments to act on climate change may well be the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.
“Human rights and the climate crisis go hand in hand. We can’t solve one without solving the other. Climate change means people won’t be able to grow food, their homes will come under threat and their health will be compromised. Governments have a duty to protect us, so why are they doing nothing to stop climate change from devastating our lives?” said Greta Thunberg.
Amnesty International calls on states to scale up climate action substantially and to do so in a manner consistent with human rights. One of the crucial ways this can happen is if the people most affected by climate change, such as children and young people, are able to engage in efforts to address and mitigate climate change. They should be provided with the necessary information and education to participate meaningfully in discussions and should be included in decision-making that directly affects them.
“Sometimes I feel really sad because some of the people I try to talk to won’t listen. Some people insult us, others think we are politicians, and others ignore us entirely, they tell us maybe we won’t finish what we’ve started.  But I can assure everyone that we are really determined to finish what we have started, because our futures are on the line,” said Kananura Irene, a Fridays for Future activist from Kampala, Uganda.
The youth activists behind Fridays for Future are now calling on adults to join them. On Friday 20 September, ahead of the United Nation Climate Action Summit in New York, activists will commence a week of climate action with a worldwide strike for the climate. Amnesty International supports the call for all adults who are able to join the strike and show solidarity.
“Young people are often told they are the leaders of tomorrow. I am so glad that Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future activists ignored that message. If they wait until tomorrow, there will be no future for any of us. They have proved that they are already leaders, and now it’s time for adults to follow their lead,” said Kumi Naidoo.

“To act on your conscience means that you fight for what you think is right. I think all those who are part of this movement are doing that, because we have a duty to try and improve the world. The blatant injustice we all need to fight against is that people in the global south are the ones who are and will be most affected by climate change while they are the least responsible for causing it.”
A human rights crisis
While the climate crisis is usually understood through the impacts it is having on our natural environment, the devastating consequences of these impacts on people, both now and in the future, make it an urgent human rights issue as well. Climate change compounds and magnifies existing inequalities. And its effects will continue to grow and worsen over time, creating ruin for current and future generations.
Amnesty International has said that the failure of governments to act on climate change may well be the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.
“Human rights and the climate crisis go hand in hand. We can’t solve one without solving the other. Climate change means people won’t be able to grow food, their homes will come under threat and their health will be compromised. Governments have a duty to protect us, so why are they doing nothing to stop climate change from devastating our lives?” said Greta Thunberg.
Amnesty International calls on states to scale up climate action substantially and to do so in a manner consistent with human rights. One of the crucial ways this can happen is if the people most affected by climate change, such as children and young people, are able to engage in efforts to address and mitigate climate change. They should be provided with the necessary information and education to participate meaningfully in discussions and should be included in decision-making that directly affects them.
“Sometimes I feel really sad because some of the people I try to talk to won’t listen. Some people insult us, others think we are politicians, and others ignore us entirely, they tell us maybe we won’t finish what we’ve started.  But I can assure everyone that we are really determined to finish what we have started, because our futures are on the line,” said Kananura Irene, a Fridays for Future activist from Kampala, Uganda.
The youth activists behind Fridays for Future are now calling on adults to join them. On Friday 20 September, ahead of the United Nation Climate Action Summit in New York, activists will commence a week of climate action with a worldwide strike for the climate. Amnesty International supports the call for all adults who are able to join the strike and show solidarity.
“Young people are often told they are the leaders of tomorrow. I am so glad that Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future activists ignored that message. If they wait until tomorrow, there will be no future for any of us. They have proved that they are already leaders, and now it’s time for adults to follow their lead,” said Kumi Naidoo.

Panos photographer Andrea DiCenzo accompanied Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Advisor Donatella Rovera on a visit to Raqqa in February 2019, documenting her investigation. Images by DiCenzo and Rovera are combined with audio commentary with Rovera giving an intimate description of the people she met and the reality she exposed. 
Rovera and her fellow researchers – including a team of specialists in remote sensing and open-source investigation – investigated the Raqqa military campaign for over 18 months. They visited more than 200 strike sites, interviewed more than 400 survivors and witnesses, and released several reports, culminating in an unprecedented investigation in partnership with Airwars that documented the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians as a result of Coalition attacks – which dwarves the 180 deaths it has admitted.
“On the ground in Raqqa I witnessed a level of destruction not comparable to anything I’ve seen in decades of covering the impact of war,” said Donatella Rovera.
“This site brings home the reality of the suffering I encountered and explains why I kept returning: to seek justice for civilians trying to piece together their lives. Two years on, the US-led Coalition must investigate the full scale of civilian casualties it caused, and ensure victims and their families receive full reparation and compensation.”
Background
The US-led Coalition’s campaign to oust so-called “Islamic State” from Raqqa was among the most destructive in modern warfare. The offensive, lasting from 6 June to 17 October 2017 and led by US, UK and French forces, killed and injured thousands of residents and reduced homes, businesses and infrastructure to rubble.
Civilians trapped by the fighting were prevented from fleeing by IS snipers and mines. Many were killed in their homes by the Coalition’s air bombardments and indiscriminate artillery strikes.
Then Coalition commander Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend claimed the offensive had been “the most precise air campaign in history”, but field investigations conducted by Amnesty International reveal this is a far cry from reality.

Tuncak made his preliminary observations – which will be followed by a report about the government’s steps to protect human rights implicated by the management of hazardous wastes – following an eight-stop trip across Canada that included a visit with those who have been impacted by mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows First Nation.  
In response, Craig Benjamin, Amnesty International Canada’s Indigenous Rights Campaigner, said:
“We welcome these comments by an independent United Nations expert and hope that they will shine a light on the urgent need for swift and full compensation to those who have been dealing with mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows. For five decades, the federal and provincial governments have all but ignored the mercury crisis that has contaminated the First Nation’s traditional food, devastated its local economy and caused serious physical and mental health impacts. We urge Canada to properly remediate the English and Wabigoon Rivers, establish a trust fund to build and operate a health treatment facility and adequately compensate the people of Grassy Narrows.”
Further, the Special Rapporteur’s concerns about mercury contamination in Grassy Narrows are consistent with a broader pattern of discrimination noted in his preliminary observations. As he concluded in his statement published online today: “There exists a pattern in Canada where marginalized groups, Indigenous peoples in particular, find themselves on the wrong side of a toxic divide, subject to conditions that would not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada.”

Netsanet Belay, Africa Director at Amnesty International, said:
“This should be a week of celebration in Khartoum, as residents mark the first Eid-al-Fitr since the end of Omar al-Bashir’s 30-year reign of terror. |nstead, as security forces roam the streets killing and attacking people, the holiday has become a time of fear, shock and grief.
“Doctors in Khartoum have reported that as many as 100 people have been killed since Monday, when forces including RSF members swept into protest sites and opened fire on unarmed people. The death toll is now soaring as the RSF, the special military force which killed, raped and tortured thousands in Darfur, brings its murderous rampage to the capital. Reports that bodies have been dumped in the river demonstrate the utter depravity of these so-called security forces.
“Sudan’s recent history has been defined by impunity for war crimes and other serious human rights violations. We are urging the African Union Peace and Security Council and the UN Security Council to break this cycle of impunity and take immediate action to hold the perpetrators of this violence accountable.” 
Background
The RSF was created in 2013 under the command of Sudan’s National Intelligence and Security Services (NISS). Amnesty International and many other human rights groups have documented serious crimes committed by RSF in the past, including in the context of counterinsurgency campaigns in Darfur.

“The sham charges levelled against Nguyen Ngoc Anh show that no one is safe on Facebook in Vietnam anymore. Anh is only the last case in a growing list of netizens prosecuted, arrested or detained solely for peacefully discussing public affairs or criticizing the government.
“The authorities in Hanoi are now extending, online, the chokehold they have put on civic and political rights in the country for decades, using Facebook as a tool to further their repression of dissenting voices.
“The court should drop these politically-motivated charges and release him immediately and unconditionally.”
Background
Nguyen Ngoc Anh is an aquatic engineer from Ben Tre province. He is active in political debates on social media and especially used Facebook to express his opinions and share content from other Facebook users.
In June 2018, the Vietnamese National Assembly tabled a draft law to establish new special economic zones (SEZs), raising the prospect of significant amounts of land coming under foreign ownership for up to 99 years. The law sparked a nation-wide outcry and led to mass demonstrations across the country. The authorities responded by cracking down on peaceful protestors in Ho Chi Minh City and other provinces in southern Vietnam.
Nguyen Ngoc Anh was arrested on 30 August 2018 on charges of ‘making, storing, disseminating or propagandizing materials and products that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam’, an offense under article 117 of the 2015 Penal Code. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

The National Inquiry’s final report states, “Colonial violence, as well as racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia against Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people, has become embedded in everyday life – whether this is through interpersonal forms of violence, through institutions like the health care system and the justice system, or in the laws, policies and structures of Canadian society. The result has been that many Indigenous people have grown up normalized to violence, while Canadian society shows an appalling apathy to addressing the issue.”
The report further states, “Nothing will improve the current situation unless there is will to address the root cause of this ongoing crisis, the profound multi-institutional indifference toward violence directed at Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people.”
Amnesty International welcomes Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s comments, which commit the government of Canada to “develop and implement a National Action Plan to address violence against Indigenous women, girls, and LGBTQ and two-spirit people.”
Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English) said, “Governments in Canada, indeed Canadian society as a whole, have ignored and downplayed the shocking levels of violence faced by Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons. We hope the Inquiry report will be the catalyst for all governments to finally commit to the kind of comprehensive, systematic, and coordinated national response necessitated by what is truly a human rights emergency. As a crucial step in that direction, as we look ahead to the federal election in October, we call on all federal political parties to similarly commit to a National Action Plan in keeping with Call for Justice 1.1.”
The report’s “Calls for Justice” require both broad and specific changes to numerous institutions, programs, and policies, as well as increased funding across all jurisdictions in Canada, to truly address the root causes of violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people. Amnesty International welcomes the recommendation for “long-term sustainable funding of Indigenous-led, low-barrier shelters, safe spaces, transition homes, second-stage housing and services for Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people” such that all Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons have access to culturally-appropriate services wherever they reside.
The Calls for Justice in the National Inquiry’s final report also include: 
Indigenous governments and institutions, and federal, provincial, territorial, and municipal governments, to develop and implement a national action plan to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons; 
The design and delivery of social services to Indigenous peoples to be carried out on a basis of respect for human rights, with no barriers to accessibility based on where people live; 
Long-term, sustained, and equitable funding to address the large gaps in government services that deny substantive equality to First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit persons, including those who have experienced violence; 
Elimination of all sex-based discrimination in the Indian Act; 
The creation of task force empowered to review and potentially re-open police investigations where there are concerns that cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons have not been properly handled; 
Consistent collection and public release of disaggregated data concerning levels of violence against Métis, First Nations, and Inuit women, girls, and two-spirit persons, including numbers of missing persons and homicides; 
Measures to address the rapid turnover of police personnel assigned to northern and remote communities; and 
Consideration of gender impacts and identification of mitigation strategies at all stages in the planning, assessment, implementation, and monitoring of resource development projects. 
One month ago, Amnesty International, Indigenous peoples’ organizations, women’s rights, and other equality-seeking organizations submitted a joint open letter to Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Carolyn Bennett setting out the critical importance of a clear federal commitment to action before the current session of Parliament ends later this month.
The National Inquiry is the second commission of inquiry to find that Canada is responsible for genocide against Indigenous peoples. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission established that colonial laws and policies had the expressed intent of destroying Indigenous societies in Canada. The National Inquiry links violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons to the legacy of these genocidal laws and policies and the continuation of the same social attitudes.
“Like the Truth and Reconciliation Commission before it, the National Inquiry has invited all concerned individuals to help end this grave human rights crisis by confronting sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, and colonialism and demanding more and better of our governments and public institutions,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, directrice générale of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “Amnesty International acknowledges the decades of grassroots activism led by Indigenous women that have brought us to where we are now. We commit to continued solidarity with these activists to ensure that Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons in Canada can live in safety and dignity, free from violence and discrimination.”
As a Party with Standing to the National Inquiry, Amnesty International had advance access to the National Inquiry’s final report. We will be in a position to comment further in the coming days as we have a chance to fully review the report’s findings and recommendations.

The organization also called for an immediate end to the violent attacks by the Rapid Support Forces and other security forces against protestors and for those responsible for the brutal attacks, which left at least 13 people dead, to be held accountable.
At around 4:30 am on 3 June, armed forces under the command of the Transitional Military Council (TMC) attacked peaceful protestors in Khartoum State, firing live bullets and tear gas, setting tents on fire and beating protestors.
“Many of those attacked this morning were sleeping when the Rapid Support Forces and other Sudanese security agencies began unleashing deadly violence. With this senseless slaughter the TMC has completely destroyed the trust of the Sudanese people and crushed the people’s hope for a new era of respect for human rights and respect for the right to protest without fear,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The United Nations Security Council should immediately put pressure on the interim military authorities to end these attacks against peaceful protestors, and must consider targeted sanctions on members of the TMC and others involved in the attack.
“The Sudanese people suffered for decades under the repressive rule of Omar al-Bashir, and his ousting should have represented a new chapter of respect for human rights. Today’s bloodshed shows that the transitional authorities have utterly failed to turn the page on Sudan’s appalling human rights record, and the international community must take immediate action to show this will not be tolerated.”
Amnesty International is also calling on the African Union Peace and Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to address the situation in the country and ensure respect for human rights and the right to peaceful protest.
The number of people reported dead currently stands at 13 and is growing as more succumb to injuries. More than 100 people are being treated for various injuries, according to the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD). Amnesty International received reports that security forces attacked at least two hospitals close to the sit-in area in Khartoum – Almoalim and Royal Care hospitals – in pursuit of the injured. 
Background
At around 3am local time, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), who led the organization of the protests since December 2018, issued warnings of an imminent attack by security forces aimed at breaking the sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum, where protestors have been camped since 9 April.
At about 4:30 am, around 100 security vehicles without number plates and laden with heavy weapons and hundreds of soldiers, parked in front of the sit-in area. Within 30 minutes, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and other security forces attacked sleeping protestors, firing live bullets and tear gas, setting tents on fire and brutally beating protestors.
On 30 May, the TMC issued a statement claiming the protestor sit-in had been infiltrated by “uncontrollable elements” and had therefore become a hotspot for crime and a threat to the protesters. On the same day, the TMC wrote to diplomatic missions asking them to stay away from the protest site.
In an interview with Sky News on 3 June, TMC spokesman Lieutenant-General Shams al-Din Kabashi confirmed that the security forces attacked “some saboteurs” in the nearby Colombia area along Nile Street but denied attacking the sit-in area.
Protestors in Port Sudan, Gadarif and Sinja were also attacked by security officers, according to Nazim Seraj, a leading member of a civilian committee responsible for the treatment of injured. Security forces have also been beating protesters, stealing their phones and money and then releasing them.

“This shockingly harsh sentence is an outrageous injustice. Amirsalar Davoudi is blatantly being punished for his work defending human rights.
“Setting up a Telegram channel to expose human rights violations is not a crime. The Iranian authorities must release Armisalar Davoudi immediately and unconditionally.
“Amirsalar Davoudi is the latest victim of a vicious crackdown waged by the Iranian authorities against human rights lawyers over the past two years, which has seen Iranian courts hand out increasingly harsh sentences to stop them
from being able to carry out their work.
“With this sentence, Iran’s authorities have demonstrated that human rights lawyers in Iran today are effectively treated as enemies of the state and that the authorities will go to any lengths to deny individuals in detention access to justice.”
Under Iran’s sentencing guidelines, Amirsalar Davoudi will have to serve 15 years of his prison sentence.
The news of his case follows the sentencing of prominent lawyer and women’s rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes, prompting an international outcry. In accordance with Iran’s sentencing guidelines, the actual term she has to serve is 17 years.
Amnesty International is calling for the international community, including EU states, which have an ongoing dialogue with Iran, to demand the authorities immediately stop targeting human rights lawyers. 
Background:
Amirsalar Davoudi was arrested on 20 November 2018 and has been detained in Tehran’s Evin prison with extremely limited access to his family and lawyer.
On 1 June 2019, his wife, Tannaz Kolahchian, announced on Twitter that he had been convicted by Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran on multiple charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison and 111 lashes. The punishment of flogging violates the prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment under international law.
The charges on which he has been convicted include “insulting officials”, “insulting the Supreme Leader” and “spreading propaganda against the system”. In accordance with Article 134 of the penal code, which stipulates that, when individuals are convicted on three or more charges, they shall serve the lengthiest single sentence imposed for the most serious charge, the actual term he is due to serve is 15 years. The single lengthiest charge on which he was convicted was “forming a group with the purpose of disrupting national security”, relating to his Telegram channel.
Amirsalar Davoudi is well known for representing human rights activists and other individuals detained for their social and political activities.
In recent years, Iranian courts have handed out increasingly harsh sentences against human rights lawyers. Another lawyer, Mohammad Najafi, was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison and 74 lashes in three separate cases.
Other lawyers who have either been arrested or have faced prosecution since January 2018 include Arash Keykhosravi, Ghassem Sholeh-Sa’di, Farokh Forouzan, Mostafa Daneshjoo, Mostafa Tork Hamadani, Payam Derafshan and Zeynab Taheri.

The Trump administration is reportedly considering barring anyone who transits through a third country from seeking asylum at the US southern border. Such a policy would effectively block anyone other than Mexicans and Canadians from seeking asylum in the United States. In response, Charanya Krishnaswami, Advocacy Director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA, made the following statement:
“Seeking asylum is a human right, full stop.  This latest policy is a disgusting example of the lengths the Trump administration will go to deny people protection. Instead of taking sensible steps to fix this crisis of their own making, they choose to further their agenda of hate and fear against mothers, fathers, children, and anyone else who has been forced to flee their homes and who have no other way to seek safety. To effectively close the border to Central Americans and the vast majority of people seeking asylum not only violates human rights obligations, but is also fundamentally cruel.”
Background:
Amnesty International has made several missions to the border to document firsthand the human costs of the many barriers already in place against asylum-seekers. These include the practice of “metering,” which illegally keeps asylum-seekers waiting in Mexico for their turn to apply for asylum at ports-of-entry; and the dangerous “Remain in Mexico” policy, which forcibly returns them to harm’s way in Mexico while they fight for their right to seek asylum in the United States. Amnesty International has called for these harmful policies to end immediately.

Our organizations are deeply disappointed that the federal government has failed to take decisive action to guarantee that survivors of mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows will get the medical care they need and deserve. 
Although the federal Indigenous Services department had announced that Minister Seamus O’Regan would sign a memorandum of understanding with Grassy Narrows when he visited the northwestern Ontario First Nation yesterday, no such agreement was reached.
According to a statement released by the Grassy Narrows Chief and Council, negotiations are continuing around key needs of the community. This includes a call for the federal government to put the necessary funds for the construction and operation of a treatment centre into trust so that health of mercury survivors will be protected from shifting political winds.
In an open letter released on the eve of the Minister’s visit, Amnesty International Canada, the Council of Canadians and CUPE Ontario all supported the creation of such a trust fund as necessary step toward justice for Grassy Narrows.
Mercury contamination of the river system at Grassy Narrows has created one of the worst health crises facing any community in Canada. This health crisis has been prolonged and exacerbated by a half century of denial and delay by governments of all political stripes.
As negotiations proceed, our organizations want to remind the federal government that the urgency of providing quality, specialized health care for mercury survivors grows with each passing day.
It is essential that the Trudeau government make good on its promise to deal with the mercury crisis “once and for all.”
Our organizations will continue to stand with the people of Grassy Narrows until their rights to health and a healthy environment are finally respected and fulfilled.

While Israel rejects that it’s the occupying power, there is a virtual wall-to-wall consensus among the international community — including the United Nations, the European Union, the International Court of Justice, the International Committee of the Red Cross and Canada — that the laws of occupation, including the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, apply in full to the Palestinian territory.

The leaders announced their commitments at the launch of Up for Debate, a non-partisan campaign calling for women’s rights and gender equality to be front and centre in the federal election campaign.
“We are thrilled that two party leaders have committed to a leaders’ debate,” said Paulette Senior, CEO of the Canadian Women’s Foundation, a member of the Up for Debate coalition. “We welcome the commitment made by the Bloc Québécois today to discussing women’s rights and gender equality during the election campaign. We hope they will strengthen their commitment by agreeing to participate in a leaders’ debate on these issues.”
The Liberal and Conservative parties have not yet committed to participate in the Up for Debate campaign.
“Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed to participating in a federal leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality in the 2015 election campaign,” said Sandeep Prasad, Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “We hope that the Prime Minister, who self-identifies as a feminist, and Conservative Party of Canada Leader Andrew Scheer, will commit to a federal leaders’ debate on these issues without delay.”
Up for Debate, a non-partisan alliance of prominent national organizations promoting women’s rights and gender equality, urges all federal political party leaders to participate in this national debate, and to adopt strong women’s rights and gender equality policy statements in their party platforms including to: 
Remove barriers to economic equality by funding public services and social programs in Canada that help lift women and gender diverse people out of poverty;
Create a national action plan to prevent and address all forms of violence against women, girls and gender diverse people, including the extreme levels of violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people; and
Increase long-term core funding for women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations as well as to grassroots activist organizations, to enable them to carry out their vital work, which is proven to have a positive impact on the lives of women and gender diverse people. 
You can read more details in the Up for Debate Platform for Action here.
In 2015, the Up for Debate coalition called for a national leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality. After securing commitments to debate from the leaders of the Liberal Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party, Up for Debate switched strategies, and invited all party leaders to film one-on-one video interviews with leading feminist journalist, Francine Pelletier. The Conservatives declined to participate, but Up for Debate’s interviews with the other four federal party leaders were released nationally. The 2015 federal election produced a strong agenda on women’s rights and gender equality. There has been no leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality since 1984.

Peter Benenson had heard of the cases of two university students – arrested, tried and sentenced during what was at that time a cruel military dictatorship in Portugal – locked up simply because they had dared to raise their glasses of wine in a toast to freedom. 
Peter knew that what had befallen those two students was by no means exceptional, and that there were people in every corner of the world, jailed because of their political beliefs, their religious faith or the colour of their skin; prisoners of conscience as they came to be known.  Vitally, he also knew that he would not be alone in his sense of outrage.  
So Peter Benenson set out to harness that collective concern and turn it into a force for change; a force for justice. In 1961 he did not set out to found a global human rights movement.  Less ambitiously, but with a force of determination that soon involved countless others, he launched a year-long campaign for “amnesty” for those he called the forgotten prisoners, encouraging people to write polite letters to political leaders around the world, calling for freedom for women, men and young people who never should have been detained in the first place. 
Critics and naysayers thought that Peter Benenson was delusional. Why would people want to take time to write letters on behalf of people they had never met and never would, who lived in countries they would never visit?  And why would cruel despots care what a plumber in Manchester, office worker in Helsinki, grandmother in Melbourne or college student in Vancouver had to say? 
But Peter Benenson was not delusional; he and every activist who flocked to his campaign were in fact visionary.  People do care enough about the rights of others to write a letter; care deeply in fact.  And even tyrants worry about world opinion; not always, but frequently enough that we know that global pressure can and does make a difference in the face of grave human rights violations. 
Peter’s modest ambition of sustaining a year long campaign did grow into Amnesty International, which has grown to become the world’s largest human rights movement, has been honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize, and is present on the ground today in all corners of our globe.  
Here in Canada Amnesty International has 400,000 supporters who actively take up cases close to home, notably the pervasive human rights violations experienced by Indigenous peoples in the country; and campaign for an end to atrocities in countries such as Yemen and Myanmar and protection for courageous human rights defenders in countries like Colombia and Honduras. 
And 58 years later, sadly, Amnesty International has, in many respects, never been more important.  
Far too many countries continue to be devasted by the ravages of war and armed conflict, with an agonizing list in 2019 that includes Yemen, South Sudan, Syria, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Libya. 
Far too many politicians – including in the United States, Brazil, the Philippines and a growing number of European countries – win elections by promoting policies of hate, fear and division; with the most marginalized in our societies being targeted for threats and violence. 
Additionally, we know that the rapidly spiraling impacts of climate change pose what is fast becoming the most urgent human rights challenge of our time; yet continues to be met by denial and resistance by far too many governments and powerful economic interests. 
It may seem overwhelming.  It may very understandably lead to the question, what difference could I possibly make? Just as it did in 1961. 
And that is why the Amnesty International vision still holds true.  The problems are immense and may seem insurmountable.  But there is always one thing you can do right now to make a difference for one person, or for one community, or for one country.  And there is a friend, co-worker, neighbour, relative or fellow student who you can urge to join you in that effort; and another and another…  
That is where change comes from; it always has and always will. That is also the vision of the Sisters of St. Joseph community, a spirit of solidarity and collective responsibility that has been of such immense support to Amnesty International’s human rights efforts over the years. 
Today, we cherish that close connection; and together we renew our commitment.  Together, tomorrow and all the tomorrows to come: we will press on and we will not relent until the glorious promise of universal human rights protection is a reality for everyone, everywhere.

With less than five months until the fall election, supporters of the 2019 Up for Debate campaign are also urging federal party leaders to make real commitments to end poverty, end gender-based violence, and support women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations.
“We are back once again to ask each federal party leader, ‘Are you up for debate?’” said Paulette Senior, President and CEO of the Canadian Women’s Foundation, speaking on behalf of the Up for Debate coalition, which includes Amnesty International Canada, the Canadian Labour Congress, Oxfam Canada and YWCA Canada. “While we have seen some positive steps towards advancing gender rights, women and gender diverse people are still more likely to live in poverty and experience violence. We are calling on all leaders to put women’s rights and gender equality front and centre of this year’s election campaign.”
The last time a debate focused on women took place was in the federal election of 1984.
Despite increased attention to women’s rights and gender equality in recent years, First Nations, Métis and Inuit women are still six times more likely to be murdered than non-Indigenous women. Globally, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.  The Up for Debate coalition is calling on all federal political parties to commit to creating a National Action Plan to prevent and address all forms of violence against women, girls and gender diverse people, including Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.
“As we witness a crackdown on abortion rights in the United States, we must remember that we are not immune to the erosion of reproductive rights here in Canada,” said Sandeep Prasad, Executive Director of Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “Too many women and gender diverse people in Canada lack access to comprehensive sexuality education and sexual health services, including abortion. We need every political party to make strong commitments to women’s health rights in their election platforms.”
Further, women and gender diverse people are more likely to live in poverty and experience social and economic inequality, including the gender wage gap and other barriers to participating in the labour force. The Up for Debate coalition is calling on federal party leaders to adopt platforms that include universal childcare, affordable housing, and progressive immigration policies. This must be coupled by a commitment to increase long-term, core funding for women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations.
“Don’t get me wrong, we have welcomed the Canadian government’s funding increases to women’s rights and gender equality causes over the past four years. But unfortunately, it’s not enough,” said Julie Delahanty, Executive Director of Oxfam Canada. “Women’s rights and feminist organizations are still left scrambling to provide services to women and gender diverse people.”

Military units responsible for past atrocities are committing war crimes, while deployment of additional units suggests involvement of senior generals
International community is failing – ICC referral urgently needed 
Following a recent investigation in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, Amnesty International has gathered new evidence that the Myanmar military is committing war crimes and other human rights violations. The military operation is ongoing, raising the prospect of additional crimes being committed.
The new report, “No one can protect us”: War crimes and abuses in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, details how the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadaw, have killed and injured civilians in indiscriminate attacks since January 2019. The Tatmadaw forces have also carried out extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, torture and other ill-treatment, and enforced disappearances.
The report examines the period of intense military operations that followed coordinated attacks on police posts by the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic Rakhine armed group, on 4 January 2019. The new operation followed a government instruction to ‘crush’ the AA.
“Less than two years since the world outrage over the mass atrocities committed against the Rohingya population, the Myanmar military is again committing horrific abuses against ethnic groups in Rakhine State” said Nicholas Bequelin, Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia at Amnesty International. “The new operations in Rakhine State show an unrepentant, unreformed and unaccountable military terrorizing civilians and committing widespread violations as a deliberate tactic.”
Amnesty International conducted 81interviews, including 54 interviews on the ground in Rakhine State in late March 2019 and 27 remote interviews with people living in conflict-affected areas. They included ethnic Rakhine, Mro, Rohingya and Khami villagers, belonging to the Buddhist, Christian and Muslim faiths. The organization also reviewed photographs, videos and satellite imagery, and interviewed humanitarian officials, human rights activists and other experts.
While ethnic Rakhine communities have long fostered political grievances against Myanmar’s central government, the AA is led by a younger generation of ethnic Rakhine nationalists. Today the AA is estimated to have a fighting force of up to 7,000 troops. Established in 2009, it has fought alongside other thnic armed organizations in northern Myanmar and in recent years has clashed sporadically with the military in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin State. Fighting intensified in late 2018.
Newly-deployed units, same pattern of atrocities
Amnesty International’s new report uncovers evidence of abuses committed by military troops implicated in past atrocity crimes, including specific divisions and battalions under the Western Command. Amnesty International has further confirmed that newly-deployed units from the 22nd and 55th Light Infantry Divisions (LIDs) are responsible for many of these fresh violations.
From interviews and other evidence, including satellite imagery, Amnesty International documented seven unlawful attacks which killed 14 civilians and injured at least 29 more. Most of these attacks were indiscriminate, and some may have been direct attacks on civilians. In one incident in late January, a seven-year-old ethnic Rakhine boy died after a mortar that almost certainly was fired by the Myanmar military exploded in Tha Mee Hla village, Rathedaung Township, during fighting between the military and the AA. Although the boy was severely injured, it took several hours before Myanmar soldiers gave his family permission to take him to a hospital. He died the following day.
In another incident in mid-March, a Myanmar military mortar exploded in Ywar Haung Taw village, Mrauk-U Township, injuring at least four people and destroying a house belonging to Hla Shwe Maung, a 37-year-old ethnic Rakhine man. He recalled, “I heard an explosion. It was very loud and there was a big fireball that fell around us… I grabbed my daughter in my arms… [when] we looked back half of our house’s roof was gone.”
Review of satellite imagery confirms the destruction of a building in Ywar Haung Taw village, as well as the presence of new artillery at the police base close by.
While ethnic Rakhine communities have borne the brunt of violations committed by the Myanmar military in this campaign, other communities, including the Rohingya, have also suffered. On 3 April 2019, a military helicopter opened fire on Rohingya labourers cutting bamboo, killing at least six men and boys and injuring at least 13 others. “The helicopter came from behind the mountain,” a survivor of the attack told Amnesty International. “Within minutes it fired rockets. I was running for my life thinking about my family and how I would survive.” Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians are war crimes.
Amnesty International also documented how the military has taken positions within ancient temple complexes of Mrauk-U and fired recklessly in the area. Satellite imagery confirms the presence of artillery close to the temples, and photographs show destruction of temple sites. While the organization has not been able to determine who was responsible for the attacks, by basing themselves close to the monuments, the Myanmar Army exposed historical and cultural property to destruction and damage, which violates international humanitarian law.
Amnesty International further documented seven cases of arbitrary arrest in Rakhine State since January 2019. These arrests were exclusively of men, usually ethnic Rakhine men of fighting age, and were often accompanied by torture and other ill-treatment aimed at obtaining information about the AA. A 33-year-old ethnic Rakhine man recalled, “[The soldier] asked, ‘Where do the AA keep their weapons?’ I replied ‘I don’t know, I’m not AA’… I remember a punch and a kick, then they hit my head with a rifle… I tried to cover my head with my hands but they started kicking and beating [me]. There was blood on my hands, face and head.”
Amnesty International also documented the enforced disappearance of six men – one ethnic Mro and five ethnic Rakhine – in mid-February. A witness said she last saw one of the men in military custody. Since then, families have had no information about their loved ones’ fate and whereabouts.
More than 30,000 people have been displaced in this latest violence, however the Myanmar authorities have blocked humanitarian access to the affected areas.
“The authorities are compounding the misery of civilians by blocking the supply of medicine, food and humanitarian relief to those in need, including children,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Civilians in Rakhine State are paying the heaviest price from the military’s assaults and their aftermath – yet the government continues to choose to remain silent about this spiralling crisis.”
Arakan Army abuses
While the Myanmar military was responsible for the overwhelming majority of violations documented by Amnesty International, the AA has also committed abuses against civilians, including abductions, the report shows. On 3 May AA fighters abducted four ethnic Rohingya men from Sin Khone Taing village, Rathedaung Township. According to a source with direct knowledge of the incident, four were taken to a remote location in the forest. In early February, the AA abducted 53 people from a village in neighbouring Chin State. According to a credible source, the group of women, men, and children were taken to an AA base near the Myanmar-Bangladesh border, where men were forced to porter and build shelters. Two subsequently escaped, however the fate and whereabouts of the others remains unknown.
AA soldiers have endangered civilians, at times conducting operations in a manner that has placed civilian villagers at risk of harm. The AA has also threatened and intimidated village administrators and local businesspeople, warning them in letters against interfering with the group’s activities. The letters were each accompanied by a bullet and bore the AA’s official seal.
Threats to freedom of expression
As reports of military violations mount, the security forces have resorted to tried and tested tactics to silence critical reporting, filing criminal complaints in recent months against the editors of three local Myanmar-language news outlets.
“While earlier this month the authorities finally released Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo after arbitrarily detaining them for more than 500 days, the global indignation over their case hasn’t stopped the authorities using the same fear tactics to make an example of others,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
“The NLD-led government has the power to change this. It holds a parliamentary majority and must use it to repeal or reform the repressive laws so often used against journalists.”
Time to step up international pressure
The latest military operation in Rakhine State was launched less than 18 months after the Myanmar security forces perpetrated crimes against humanity against the Rohingya population. More than 900,000 Rohingya refugees are still living in camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, and Amnesty’s new report provides yet more evidence that it is not safe for them to return.
This fresh evidence lends even greater urgency for the UN to act on the full range of atrocity crimes committed by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State and in northern Myanmar’s Kachin and Shan States. A UN Fact Finding Mission has called for senior military officials to be investigated and tried for crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.
In the absence of any domestic accountability, Amnesty International is calling on the UN Security Council to urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court and impose a comprehensive arms embargo. Myanmar’s international partners must also rethink their relations with the Myanmar military leadership and implement targeted sanctions against senior officials through multilateral bodies like the European Union and the Association of South East Asian Nations.
“With Myanmar’s military committing atrocities as brazenly as ever, it’s clear international pressure needs to intensify,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Again and again, the international community has failed to stop the Myanmar military’s crimes and protect the civilian population. The Security Council was established to respond to exactly these kinds of situations, it’s time it took its responsibility seriously.”

The organization has gathered evidence including testimony from three eyewitnesses, a first-aid volunteer, two family members, two lawyers and a doctor which suggests Ramzi’s death on 19 April resulted from the injuries he sustained after being beaten by the police with baton sticks.
According to the information available to Amnesty International, Ramzi was beaten on the head by police as he was about to head home after attending anti-government protests in central Algiers that were dispersed by security forces using teargas and water cannons on 12 April 2019.
“Eyewitness accounts strongly suggest that Ramzi Yettou was brutally beaten on the head by police, causing injuries that appear to have led to his death. Algeria’s authorities have a dire track record of not holding members of the security forces to account for human rights violations, which makes it all the more crucial for them to ensure that the investigation into Ramzi’s death is meaningful,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International reviewed a copy of a police report authorizing Ramzi’s burial which cited the cause of death as “undetermined”, prompting Algeria’s prosecutor to order an investigation into the circumstances of his death.
“Ordering an investigation into Ramzi Yettou’s death is only the first step towards justice. It is crucial that the investigation is independent, impartial and effective and that police officers involved are suspended while the investigation is ongoing. Failing to hold the perpetrators behind Ramzi Yettou’s death to account will only embolden the police and send the message that they are free to operate above the law and that they can commit crimes without facing any consequences.”
Ramzi was about to head home to the town of Bougara (Blida) after attending a protest in Algiers on the afternoon of 12 April with approximately five friends. Police stopped the truck they were travelling in after the driver attempted to drive down a street in the wrong direction. when the police attacked them, some of the group managed to flee and others were beaten with sticks.
Before he lost consciousness, Ramzi told a first aid volunteer who found him lying on the ground with blood on his jacket that he had been beaten by police. 
According to the volunteer, his nose was bruised, and he had a small superficial injury measuring around a centimeter under his eyebrows that was not bleeding. The first aid volunteer asked police to call an ambulance, which arrived around 30 minutes later and transferred him to the Mustapha Bacha hospital where he underwent head surgery because of internal bleeding. He never regained consciousness and died on Friday 19 April.
Ramzi and his friends made the 50 km trip to Algiers every Friday to protest since demonstrations against the country’s ruling elite and political system started earlier this year.

Over recent weeks, police have detained, placed under house arrest or threatened dozens of activists who are seeking to mark the June 4 anniversary, as well as relatives of those killed.
Hundreds, if not thousands, of unarmed protesters and civilians were killed when soldiers opened fire in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square on 3–4 June 1989, as they sought to crush widespread protests calling for political reform.
“Thirty years on from the Tiananmen bloodshed the very least the victims and their families deserve is justice. However, President Xi continues to read from the same tired political playbook, cruelly persecuting those seeking the truth about the tragedy in a concerted effort to wipe the June 4 crackdown from memory,” said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director of Amnesty International.
“The Chinese government must accept that no amount of suppression will ever erase the horror of the wholesale slaughter that took place in and around Tiananmen Square. A first step towards justice would be to finally allow people in China, including elderly parents whose children were killed in the crackdown, to commemorate the victims of June 4.”
Censorship
Any references to the Tiananmen crackdown continue to be systematically censored in China. Anyone who seeks to commemorate the victims does so at great personal risk and is likely to be harassed or detained. 
In April, activist Chen Bing was sentenced to three and a half years in jail after he and three other activists – Fu Hailu, Luo Fuyu and Zhang Junyong – were found guilty of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” for their unique commemoration of the Tiananmen anniversary on special bottles of a Chinese liquor.
Sichuan activist Deng Chuanbin was placed under criminal detention on suspicion of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” on 18 May. His detention is believed to relate to a tweet he posted commemorating the Tiananmen protests.
On 20 May, police ordered 82-year old Ding Zilin, whose then-17-year-old son Jiang Jielian was killed by troops during the June 4 crackdown, to leave her home in Beijing and travel more than 1,100km to her hometown Wuxi, Jiangsu Province. This is a common tactic the authorities use against activists in an effort to silence them during politically sensitive periods and to make it less likely they will speak with foreign media.
Ding Zilin is a founding member of Tiananmen Mothers, a group of families of victims who are seeking an investigation into the June 4 bloodshed. Other members of the group have also been placed under police surveillance in recent weeks.
The suppression of those seeking to publicly mark the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown is the latest in a wider assault against activists in China. Under President Xi’s rule, the Chinese authorities have decimated the ranks of human rights lawyers and activists calling for political and legal reforms. The relentless crackdown has been marked by arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, torture and other ill-treatment.
“Time is running out for the elderly parents whose children were murdered to see truth and justice. We urge the Chinese authorities to do the decent thing and launch an open and independent investigation into the violent crackdown of 1989,” said Roseann Rife.
Amnesty International reiterates its calls on the Chinese government to:
– Publicly acknowledge the human rights violations which occurred in the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989; 
– Launch an open and independent inquiry and hold those responsible for human rights violations accountable;
– Provide compensation to victims of the 1989 crackdown and their families;
– Cease harassment and prosecution of those commemorating or speaking out about the 1989 Tiananmen protests and those more generally exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.

Maude Barlow, Honourary Chairperson of the Council of Canadians, said, “The people of Grassy Narrows have already had to wait decades too long for the medical care they need and deserve. It is unconscionable that they should continue to wait for the government to fulfill its promise while their family members die or languish without adequate care.”
More than two years ago, in January 2017, the Prime Minister’s office said that the Trudeau government would deal with the mercury crisis at Grassy Narrows “once and for all.”  In November 2017, the federal government promised to build and operate a care home and treatment facility for mercury survivors in Grassy Narrows. More than 500 days later, only 1% of the promised money has been spent to build the facility, the ground has not been broken, and the Chief and Council of Grassy Narrows reports that the project is at a stand still.
The Open Letter supports the Grassy Narrows First Nation’s call for funds for the care home and treatment centre to be put in trust for the community as the only way to ensure that Trudeau government’s promise is kept no matter the outcome of the upcoming federal election.
“What the people of Grassy Narrows are asking for is a matter of justice and basic human rights,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada. “For decades, the federal and provincial government have simply denied the consequences of the poisoning of the waters on the health of Grass Narrows people. It’s past time that proper care for Grassy Narrows elders and other mercury survivors be treated as a matter of urgent national priority.”
On March 29, Minister O’Regan is visiting the First Nation, a promise he made in March, shortly after Prime Minister Trudeau apologized for a dismissive remark to a Grassy Narrows supporter that was widely circulated on social media.
“At this point, the onus is on the Trudeau government to demonstrate that this trip is about more than repairing the Liberal brand,” said Fred Hahn, President of CUPE Ontario. “A half-century of neglect and cover-up promotes cynicism. So long as the government fails to deliver decisively on its promises, that cynicism can only deepen with each day that passes.”
Quality, specialized care for mercury survivors is among the recommendations of a detailed health assessment that has been carried out by Dr. Donna Mergler, a renowned expert on mercury poisoning and community health.
The people of Grassy Narrows have been very clear that they need specialized facilities to care for the survivors of mercury poisoning in their community. This is what the Trudeau government promised. This is what Minister O’Regan needs to deliver.

We must demand their protection and rights now. 
Amnesty International documented the stories of women that have been subjected to these abuses in “If they can have her, why can’t we?,” a report published in April 2019. 
In this video, Luna explains how transphobia and homophobia in the Dominican Republic influence particular forms of gender-based violence against people like her, engaged in sex work, and how their activism has helped to bring about change. 
 
Gender-based violence in Latin America and the Caribbean is an epidemic. In 2017 alone, in the Dominican Republic there were 6,300 reports of sexual offences, 1,290 were rapes. In 2018 at least 100 women were killed because of their gender (femicide), making this one of the highest rates in the region. 
Women who engage in sex work are particularly vulnerable to gender-based abuse by state and private actors. 
According to our research, police in the Dominican Republic routinely rape, humiliate, torture and otherwise mistreat women engaged in sex work. 
“If you do sex work, they (the police) consider you as the worst kind of woman…They (the police) pull your hair, they hit you, and push you. They treat you like a dog. As if we are dogs in the street, with four paws… They call you ‘dirty whore’, that’s normal.” 
This is a situation frequently experienced by sex workers across the country and occurs due to a deeply engrained culture of machismo within the National Police, in addition to discrimination and stigma against sex workers in a conservative society. 
Despite the fact that the attacks perpetrated against sex workers by the police in the Dominican Republic may qualify as torture or ill-treatment – crimes under international law – police are rarely punished for these acts. 
Many women engaged in sex work don’t report crimes against them because they fear humiliation or retribution. 
“Accusing a police (officer) is to do nothing, because they (the authorities) don’t do anything.” 
Those that do file reports against police are rarely taken seriously. 
Women engaged in sex work with multiple discriminated identities, such as transgender or afro-descendent sex workers, suffer particularly brutal forms of abuse, as punishment for not conforming to traditional social norms. 
Transgender sex workers, for example, report that police often remove and burn their wigs as a form of humiliation, while others report that they have been forced to clean prison toilets covered in excrement. 
“They said I was a man, ‘a damn fag, a fag from hell’. With obscene words they said: ‘Look at those tits of sponge, take off her hair, take away those cloths that she has on her tits.’ They took down my pants to see if I had a vulva or a penis.” -A transgender sex worker describing an interaction with police in Santo Domingo. 
Women who engage in sex work in the Dominican Republic are at the receiving end of violence and discrimination, but many of them also find the courage to lead groups and organizations finding strength in unity to stand up for their humanity and against these attacks. Even then, they find themselves questioned as women human rights defenders based on their gender and their occupation as sex workers causing them to be excluded from broader movements across the globe. Still, organizations like Otrasex, CONTRAVETD, and TRANSSA continue to fight to transform the world around them in Dominican Republic. 
“This country has the most violence against women, because if you report a man who mistreats us, they don’t do anything. He could even kill us. This should change. There shouldn’t be so much violence against women and sex workers, because I do it because I like it, and besides that’s my livelihood for my children, and it’s my only source of work.”  
To ensure respect for the rights of women engaged in sex work, the Dominican Republic must: 
Publicly recognize rape by police as torture and make clear that all those responsible for such acts will be brought to justice; 
Ensure the investigation, prosecution and punishment of police that are accused and found guilty of these crimes; and 
Pass anti-discrimination legislation and adopt other measures to protect and promote the rights of marginalized groups.

NDP MP Romeo Saganash introduced Bill C-262 in 2016 and is still waiting for it to pass. It would set a framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Hill Times photograph by Andrew Meade 
There is an enormous amount of consequential human rights legislation approaching the parliamentary finish line. The time to get it across shrinks daily. 
Only four sitting weeks remain in this session of Parliament for MPs, five for Senators. Rather than return to Parliament in the fall, MPs will be out hustling for votes. That means parliamentary business not concluded by the House of Commons and Senate’s last sitting days, currently June 21 and 28 respectively, will, as is said, “die on the order paper.” Bills not adopted, orders-in-council not approved, and ministerial decisions not authorized will await whatever the next Parliament holds. 
Here are 12 bills and decisions being watched closely by Indigenous peoples, human rights groups, and communities across the country. 
Bill C-262 would set a framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission stated provides “the necessary principles, norms, and standards for reconciliation to flourish in 21st-century Canada.” It was introduced in April 2016 by NDP MP Romeo Saganash and embraced by the government in November 2017. It has been in the Senate for the past year and faced delays from several Conservative Senators. There is enough time for Senators to pass C-262, but it is tight. 
Also facing a rough ride in the Senate is Bill C-69, which includes important provisions to assess the positive and negative human rights impacts of resource development projects on Indigenous peoples and people of different genders. It has become a flashpoint in the politicized debate about pipelines and climate change. After extensive cross-country Senate hearings and hundreds of amendments proposed by Senators, it is unclear if enough time remains for the bill to be reviewed and become law. 
The Senate is seized with C-59 and C-83, reforms to national security and solitary confinement. Each one fixes long-standing human rights concerns to a degree, but leaves major shortcomings unaddressed and introduces new human rights problems. Human rights groups have proposed amendments, but with pressure on Senators to get bills done, worries mount that any improvements will be limited. 
That was the fate of Bill C-85, updating the Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement, quickly passed by the Senate May 9 and awaiting the Governor General’s signature. It remains without crucial amendments to exempt goods and services originating in illegal Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territory.

The Hill Times photograph by Andrew Meade 
Bills C-91 and C-92, while neither perfect, would institute sorely needed human rights protections with respect to Indigenous languages and Indigenous children. They were introduced in the House in February and will require exemplary co-operation from MPs and Senators to be adopted. 
Bill C-97, omnibus budget implementation legislation, is a mixed human rights story. It includes a proposal to curtail access to independent hearings for refugee claimants who have made previous claims in a number of countries, including the United States, which is hardly a safe country for refugees under Donald Trump’s administration. The government has rebuffed calls to withdraw that provision. 
Bill C-97 also promises a long-awaited human rights-based national housing strategy. Advocates have proposed amendments to strengthen that strategy. If adopted, this would be groundbreaking recognition of homelessness and housing as the human rights issue it is. 
On May 7, the government introduced Bill C-98, to establish independent review and oversight of the Canada Border Services Agency’s considerable arrest and detention powers. Without unanimous agreement, it is unlikely C-98 can be adopted before Parliament concludes. 
Then there is cabinet business. In January 2018, the government announced the establishment of a new ombudsperson to investigate alleged human rights abuses associated with Canadian companies operating abroad. The first ombudsperson, Sheri Meyerhoffer, was appointed last month. Whether she will be granted powers needed to investigate awaits a cabinet decision. 
The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women’s final report will be released on June 3. As a next step, Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett should implement the national inquiry’s call to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the federal election, to end sex discrimination in the Indian Act. There must also be comprehensive action underway before Parliament winds down. Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people cannot endure further uncertain waiting for the government to uphold their rights. 
It is crucial that ministers, MPs, and Senators use each hour of every day of these remaining weeks to the maximum advantage and advance these crucial human rights reforms.

The two, Stabile Dewah (35) and Rita Nyamupinga (61), bring to seven the number of human rights defenders arrested at Robert Mugabe International Airport in the past seven days as they returned from a capacity-building workshop on non-violent protest tactics in the Maldives.
“The first five human rights defenders arrested are facing trumped up charges for exercising their human rights. They should be released immediately and unconditionally. The charges against them fit into a much wider pattern of repression we have documented in Zimbabwe,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
The first batch of activists – George Makoni, Tatenda Mombeyarara, Gamuchirai Mukura, Nyasha Mpahlo and Farirai Gumbonzvanda – have been accused of “plotting to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government”. The two activists arrested today are also likely to be charged with subverting a constitutional government.
“Since January’s protests we have witnessed a mounting crackdown on human rights defenders and activists. Lawyers, journalists and even medical doctors have not been spared. Zimbabwe’s authorities have declared anyone who exercises their right to freedom expression and association an enemy of the state. This witch-hunt must stop,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
The first four of the human rights defenders were arrested as they disembarked from their flight on 20 May. Farirai Gumbonzvanda was also arrested at the Harare airport on 21 May at around 16:00 hours local time.
Authorities accused them of attending a workshop organised by a Serbian NGO in the Maldives called the Centre for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies (CANVAS).
They were formally charged with plotting to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government on 21 May and remanded to Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison.
Police confiscated their laptops and mobile phones, which were reportedly handed over to the Postal and Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe “for extraction of evidence”. The evidence, including some notes recorded during the meeting, will be produced in court as evidence against the activists.
“Zimbabwean authorities must stop using trumped-up charges to intimidate and harass human rights defenders and civil society leaders. The rights to freedom of expression and association are not just ‘nice to have’ constitutional requirements; they are legal human rights that all Zimbabweans must live and enjoy every day,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
Background
On Wednesday 17 May, the government used the state-owned and controlled Herald Newspaper to accuse civil society organizations of “plotting to unleash violent protest” in Zimbabwe, citing the meeting that the activists had attended.
The rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression have been under attack in the country since January, after fuel price hikes saw the cost of living skyrocket with basic commodities becoming too expensive for the ordinary man.

Two parliamentarians affiliated to the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) were leading a procession of activists to the Khar Kamar area of North Waziristan, along the Afghan border, when firing broke out, leading to the deaths.
One of the parliamentarians, Ali Wazir, is currently in custody of the Pakistani military. There are conflicting accounts of the incident, with the military claiming that PTM activists assaulted a checkpoint and PTM activists insisting that no shots were fired from their side. Phone and internet services were shut down after this incident, adding to the confusion.
“The Pakistan government must immediately order an independent and effective investigation into the killing of activists on Sunday in North Waziristan. If the reports are correct that the army killed protestors by unlawfully using live ammunition, this would be a very serious violation of international law,” said Rabia Mehmood, South Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Under international law, lethal force can only ever be used by law enforcement authorities when strictly necessary to protect life. When lethal force has been used, every incident should be fully investigated to determine if there was any use of excessive force and if any resulting killing was unlawful. Those found responsible for the use of excessive force or for unlawful killings should be brought to justice through fair trials without resort to the death penalty.”
 
Background
The PTM is a movement that says it uses non-violent means to campaign against extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations suffered by Pakistan’s Pashtun ethnic minority. In the past, senior government officials – including Prime Minister Imran Khan and army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa – have said they recognize and sympathize with the PTM’s grievances.
Despite these statements, however, the Pakistani authorities have intensified a crackdown against the group. Dozens of its supporters have been arrested, arbitrarily detained, subject to surveillance and intimidation, and even threatened with violence. Across the country, their rallies have been banned or disrupted, denying them the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.
On 2 February 2019, Arman Luni, a PTM activist from Baluchistan, was killed at a protest in Lorelai. Eyewitnesses say that he was in police custody at the time. Luni’s family struggled to have a police complaint filed about his murder.

Responding to reports that President Trump will attempt to exploit loopholes to continue sending arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE without Congressional approval, Philippe Nassif, the advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International USA said:
“The Trump administration must stop supplying arms to the Saudi-led coalition, which has repeatedly committed horrific violations in Yemen, some amounting to war crimes, devastating the lives of thousands.
“This administration has made clear its desire to sell more weapons without concern for human rights. We know arms manufactured in the United States have been used in deadly strikes against civilians. U.S. munitions have been found in the remains of bombed homes, hospitals and hotels throughout Yemen’s devastating war, killing almost 7,000 people.”
Amnesty International USA is calling on Congress to end U.S support for the Saudi-led Coalition’s conduct in Yemen and demand a pre-delivery notification before any weapons are transferred to Saudi Arabia. Congress should immediately consider measures to halt arms deliveries to Saudi Arabia and other countries that have already demonstrated a record of misusing them in Yemen.
Background:
Since the Saudi-led coalition’s campaign of airstrikes against the Huthi armed group began on March 25, 2015, Amnesty International has documented how all parties to the conflict have repeatedly violated international law. There is extensive evidence that irresponsible arms flows to the Saudi Arabia-led coalition have resulted in enormous harm to Yemeni civilians

Spotlight on the ‘unjustifiable neglect’ of Northern Ireland – still governed by one of the world’s strictest abortion laws
New short film ‘Story of Repeal’ tells story of campaigners, politicians, and women who have bravely spoken out in Ireland 
 Trailer for film available here, pictures and b-roll available to download here.
 One year on since Ireland’s vote to end its abortion ban, Amnesty International is paying tribute to the brave campaigners who spoke out for reproductive rights and sending messages of hope to people in Northern Ireland who are still subject to one of the strictest abortion bans in the world.
Today Amnesty International has released a powerful short film, ‘Story of Repeal’; featuring leading activists, campaigners, politicians, and women who had bravely spoken out.
The film coincides with giant ‘Now For Northern Ireland’ projections which lit up buildings across London, Belfast, Dublin, and Glasgow last night. 
Northern Ireland abortion ban
The ‘Now For Northern Ireland’ projections across London, Belfast, Dublin, and Glasgow shone a spotlight on the injustice of Northern Ireland’s strict near-total abortion ban, one year since Ireland’ voted to repeal the 8th Amendment (25-26 May).
The Amnesty International stunt drew attention to the UK Government’s inaction on reforming Northern Ireland’s abortion law, which remains one of the most restrictive in the world and carries the harshest criminal penalties in Europe. 
Today, the Isle of Man’s abortion reform is due to come into force, and this weekend marks one year since Ireland voted to end its near-total abortion ban. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland continues to be governed by a strict abortion law, which is more restrictive than most abortion laws currently being proposed and causing outrage across US states.
A giant heart – part of an Amnesty collaboration with Irish artist Maser, who re-worked his ‘Repeal the 8th’ artwork which became symbolic of the repeal campaign in Ireland to say ‘Now for Northern Ireland’ – was projected onto the Northern Ireland Office in Westminster, The Mac building in Belfast, the Mary Barbour statue in Glasgow, and the Project Art Centre in Dublin – where the original repeal mural was painted.  
Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International UK’s Northern Ireland campaign manager, said:
“It’s been a year since the incredible win for reproductive rights in Ireland. One year on, Northern Ireland remains isolated as the only part of the UK and Ireland without access to basic healthcare. 
“After Ireland’s vote there was so much hope that the UK Government would then act to change things in the North, but a year later we’re still waiting.
“These projections shine a spotlight on the unjustifiable neglect of people in Northern Ireland.
“Whilst dangerous roll-backs on reproductive rights are happening across US states, we must remember that our own Government is forcing its own citizens to live with these cruel laws.
“It’s time for the Government to end the harm and hurt caused by our inhumane and discriminatory near-total abortion ban.”
Artist Maser said: “By consciously making the Repeal artwork copyright free, the public were empowered to take ownership of it, I was a messenger watching from the side lines. With the people’s fierce collective energy, the artwork built huge momentum and spread across the state.
“Our friends in the north are now on their journey to revoke their outdated abortion laws. I am here to show my alliance, I am your defender.”
Repeal the 8th in Ireland
The powerful short film, ‘Story of Repeal’; is a timeline of the Eighth Amendment from 1983 to 2018, and tells the story of political and cultural change and the struggle for human rights.
Sorcha Tunney, Amnesty International Ireland’s It’s Time campaign coordinator, said:
“This historic referendum victory was the outcome of decades of campaigning by civil society. We are honoured to have played a part in recent years, and this film pays tribute to those that made it happen.
“Above all, the Yes vote happened because of women refusing to be silent anymore. Because Amanda Mellet and Siobhán Whelan took Ireland to a UN human rights body, and won. They shouldn’t have had to speak out about the pain and anguish they experienced, but they bravely did.
“Though the Yes vote was a huge victory, there is still so much more to do here and around the world. Changing the Irish constitution required a referendum but human rights shouldn’t come down to a vote. Northern Ireland is an example of where a government should take action for women’s rights but hasn’t. We say very clearly today – the North is next.”

Whilst people in Ireland and in most of the UK now have access to free, safe and legal abortion, women in Northern Ireland are still subject to one of the strictest abortion bans in the world – punishable by life in prison. The UK Government has responsibility to ensure the human rights of all UK citizens, including those in Northern Ireland, are upheld yet has taken no action to reform Northern Ireland’s inhumane abortion law.
There is huge support for Westminster to reform Northern Ireland’s abortion law across UK and Northern Irish political parties, amongst the Northern Irish public and from human rights, medical and legal bodies. UN Committees and UK Supreme Court judges have said that Northern Ireland’s abortion law puts the UK in breach of its human rights commitments.
Last month, the Women and Equalities Committee launched the findings from their inquiry into Northern Ireland’s abortion law and urged the Government to take urgent action.

The organisation’s positions have been addressed to Bolsonaro in an open letter that the executive director of Amnesty International Brazil, Jurema Werneck, and the Amnesty International Americas director, Erika Guevara-Rosas, intend to deliver to the president personally in Brasilia, where they will be seeking an audience with government representatives until Thursday 23 May. On Monday afternoon, the Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a joint statement saying they were open to dialogue with Amnesty International.
Jurema Werneck said: “We were hoping the authorities would be more receptive and we also hope that the willingness to engage in dialogue expressed in the inter-ministerial statement becomes reality. We asked for a meeting with President Jair Bolsonaro, and he forwarded our request to the Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves. Of the six meetings we requested with the authorities, only two have been confirmed, and the Minister for Women, Family and Human Rights, Damares Alves, told us we would be received by the Deputy National Secretary for General Protection, Dr Alexandre Magno, this week.”
“We also requested an audience with the minister Sergio Moro, and the President’s Chief of Staff, Onix Lorenzoni. Moro told us that he would not be available to see us, and we are still waiting to hear back from the Chief of Staff’s office. The only person who has agreed to speak with us is General Carlos Alberto dos Santos Cruz, head of the Secretariat of Government. We hope the meetings with Alexandre Magno and Santos Cruz will be beneficial in building a positive dialogue for human rights. We still hope that some other authorities, especially President Jair Bolsonaro, will be able to receive us to talk about issues relevant to the current situation in Brazil.”
Erika Guevara-Rosas reiterates the importance of governments engaging in dialogue with civil society.
“I think it is important for Bolsonaro and other authorities to show their willingness to talk about the human rights issues we raised yesterday, which are not only our concerns, but concerns shared by many organisations working to promote human rights and by Brazilian citizens. These are measures that threaten the rights of millions of people, especially indigenous and Quilombola people, women, black people, LGBTI people and human rights defenders. Our concerns and recommendations are all based on analysis of decrees and measures adopted or proposed by the government, in the light of the international commitments Brazil has made to defend human rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“What we are proposing are possible paths to a more inclusive country: a country for everyone. Demonstrating an openness to dialogue would be an important signal from the government of Brazil, South America’s largest country, in this period of major threats to and violations of human rights in the Americas”.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
This case involved two groups of people: one group had status under the Indian Act which they could not pass on to their children. The second group were not eligible for status at all. This situation resulted from provisions in the Indian Act that imposed rules on acquisition and conferral of status that were discriminatory.  
The first group is the Matson siblings, whose grandmother lost her status when she married a non-status man. While legislation later gave them section 6(2) status, they are currently unable to pass status on to children they have with a non-status person. Had their grandmother never lost her status through the discriminatory policy based on sex, they would have had section 6(1) status. That type of status could be passed on to their children without restriction. 
The second group is the Andrews family. Mr. Andrews’ father was voluntarily enfranchised before Mr. Andrews was born which meant Mr. Andrews was born without status. Although legislation introduced later tried to fix that problem, the changes left Mr. Andrews with section 6(2) status and his daughter without any status at all. Had Mr. Andrews’ father never lost status, Mr. Andrews would have been eligible for section 6(1) status and his daughter for section 6(2) status. 
The Canadian Human Rights Commission brought a challenge to the legislation to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on the Matsons’ and the Andrews’ behalf. The Commission argued that the law was discriminatory. The Tribunal ruled that it did not have the power to decide whether a law itself was discriminatory, but rather only whether a service was delivered in a discriminatory manner. The Commission applied for judicial review of the Tribunal’s decision. The Tribunal’s decision was upheld by both, the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal.  
On appeal at the Supreme Court of Canada, the decision was once again upheld. The Court agreed with the Tribunal that they were not empowered to adjudicate challenges to the validity of legislation, only claims of human rights-impairing service provision. The act of creating legislation, the Supreme Court held, is not a “service” within the meaning of section 5(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE 
In its factum, Amnesty International submitted that Canada’s international obligations must be respected in the interpretation and application of section 5(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the “CHRA”). A broad interpretation of the jurisdiction of human rights tribunals is essential to upholding Canada’s international obligations to provide effective remedies for human rights violations. In other words, Amnesty argued that the Tribunal should be found to have the jurisdiction to consider the validity of the legislation itself. Amnesty also submitted that the proper interpretation of s. 5(a) must respect the seriousness of the prohibition against both formal and substantive discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status, and the need for effective remedies where such discrimination occurs.  In addition, Amnesty International submitted that discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status in registration under the Indian Act violates Canada’s international human rights obligations. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
The Supreme Court found that the Tribunal’s decisions to dismiss the challenges were reasonable. The Court deferred to the Tribunal’s expertise over its home statute, the Canadian Human Rights Act,  determining whether the decisions made by the Tribunal were reasonable. The Tribunal had interpreted its power as being limited to decide if a “service” was being delivered in an unequal way, not whether the law itself was discriminatory. The applicants had brought a challenge to the Indian Act itself, charging that it was discriminatory. The Supreme Court found the Tribunal’s interpretation reasonable, and agreed that the applicants could still challenge the Indian Act under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

“If Congress passes this legislation, the National Guard will become an all-powerful security force, without independent scrutiny and with dangerous powers, such as the authority to detain migrants and to use force against public demonstrations it does not deem to be legitimate,” said Tania Reneaum, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico.
On Tuesday, 21 May, the Mexican Senate approved four laws on security as part of a legislative arrangement to create a new National Guard supported by the federal government. Although the new laws contain some positive measures on human rights protection, they also include a series of challenges and serious flaws that could lead to an increase in abuses in a country that has been plagued for more than a decade by security crises and human rights violations.
“Members of the Senate publicly stated that Amnesty International’s recommendations were incorporated into the drafts they were discussing and which had remained secret until now. However, there are flaws in the legislation that Amnesty International could have pointed out if the Senate had allowed the effective participation of civil society organizations,” said Tania Reneaum.
Amnesty International is concerned that several provisions included in the legislation are contrary to human rights law and standards. Among these are the absence of independent mechanisms to monitor the actions of the police and the National Guard and the lack of safeguards restricting the use of force during demonstrations. For example, the law would authorize the use of force against protests that do not have a “legitimate purpose” (“objeto licito”) and gives the security forces themselves, including the National Guard, the power to assess whether or not a protest is legitimate.
The presentation of the long-awaited law on the use of force has been overshadowed by contradictions in the text and technical errors that range from incorrect definitions of the use of force and types of weapons to insufficient preconditions for the authorization of the use of lethal force. The law has a dangerous list of types of conduct that would authorize the use of lethal force without higher oversight and without requiring that the decision take into account the circumstances of each case.
Amnesty International notes with concern that, while the legislation mentions the principles that should govern the use of force – namely, legality, absolute necessity, proportionality and accountability – their definition is not consistent with international standards and their application is problematic and contradictory as some articles of the law appear to set a lower level of protection of human rights.
The organization welcomes the creation of a register of detentions, which could be an important step in preventing arbitrary detentions and other human rights violations, such as torture and enforced disappearances. The organization will continue to monitor closely both its implementation and the creation, provided for in the same law, of a record of detentions of migrants, which must be in line with international standards for their protection.
“We regret the haste and lack of transparency with which the Senate approved these laws, without making the drafts public, which prevented human rights defenders, civil society organizations, international human rights organizations and other experts from providing timely contributions. This is an error that the Chamber of Deputies can rectify to ensure the greatest protection for human rights and, to that end, Amnesty International is willing to provide technical input to the legislative process,” said Tania Reneaum.
The laws approved by the Senate are the Law on the National Guard, the National Law on the Use of Force, the National Law on the Register of Detentions and amendments to the General Law on the National Public Security System. These laws must be discussed by the Chamber of Deputies before final approval. Amnesty International urges members of the Chamber of Deputies to adopt the necessary amendments so that these laws are in line with international human rights law.

“The U.S. government is legally required to prevent the arbitrary deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in border areas. Yet instead, authorities have willfully destroyed humanitarian aid provisions in deadly desert terrain and are criminally prosecuting humanitarian volunteers in order to deter them from saving lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The U.S. government is prosecuting Dr. Warren for allegedly “harbouring” two undocumented migrants by providing them with humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, and clean clothing, in the desert town of Ajo, Arizona, where he lives. If convicted on all three criminal charges against him, Dr. Warren could face up to 20 years in prison. His felony trial is scheduled to begin on 29 May.
Amnesty International has sent an open letter to U.S. authorities as part of an international campaign calling for the charges against Dr. Warren to be dropped.
“Providing humanitarian aid is never a crime. If Dr. Warren were convicted and imprisoned on these absurd charges, he would be a prisoner of conscience, detained for his volunteer activities motivated by humanitarian principles and his religious beliefs,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“Amnesty International opposed similar criminal prosecutions of humanitarian volunteers in Arizona 15 years ago, and we will continue to do so as long as necessary, until the government stops abusing its power. The U.S. government should immediately adopt and implement exemptions from criminal prosecution under ‘smuggling’ and ‘harboring’ charges, for the provision of humanitarian aid.”
Earlier in 2019, Dr. Warren and eight other volunteers with the organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes were also prosecuted for misdemeanor charges of littering and trespassing, specifically for leaving water and other humanitarian aid in desert areas where migrants have frequently died.
Arizona has the deadliest border area in the USA, accounting for 38.3 percent of the 7,242 border deaths recorded by U.S. border authorities over the last 20 years. The actual number of deaths is likely higher, as local media and organizations have sometimes counted more than official statistics, and border authorities have not always registered or collected the remains of bodies reported to them by volunteers.
Amnesty International acknowledges the volunteer activities of Dr. Warren and his associated organization No More Deaths/No Más Muertes, as vital humanitarian aid directed at upholding the right to life and preventing the deaths of migrants and asylum seekers in the Sonoran Desert.

Ahead of the inauguration, Shenilla Mohamed, Executive Director of Amnesty International South Africa said:
“As his African National Congress prepares to lead the country for the next five years, Cyril Ramaphosa must place human rights at the centre of the government’s domestic and foreign policy priorities. This begins with ensuring justice for victims of the events in Marikana, who are still waiting for answers almost seven years on.
“Cyril Ramaphosa should publicly commit to ensuring full respect for the human rights, dignity and equality of all South Africans – the principles on which the country was founded as enshrined in the bill of rights.
“He should draw inspiration from Nelson Mandela who stood with human rights even when it was unpopular to do so, and did not shy away from calling out leaders who found themselves on the wrong side of humanity.”
Background
The ruling Africa National Congress (ANC) emerged victorious following the general elections that were held on 8 May 2019. Cyril Ramaphosa will lead the country for the next five years as the leader of the party.
In its human rights  manifesto for political parties and candidates who contested the election, Amnesty International South Africa called for human rights to form the basis of the incoming  government.
On 16 August 2012, the South Africa Police Service fatally shot 34 men at Marikana. 10 others died in the preceding days, including policemen.  More than 70 others sustained serious injuries. The men were Lonmin employees and had been engaged in strike and protest action over pay and conditions at the mine.

“Today’s inexplicable decision by Turkey’s highest court rubs salt into the wound of injustice. Osman Kavala’s rights have been abused. He should not have spent a single day behind bars, let alone nearly 600 days. The charges against him must be dropped and he must be immediately released.”
“The outlandish allegations against Osman Kavala are an attempt to rewrite history and to silence one of Turkey’s most prominent civil society figures.
“Yet again, following a decision earlier this month to reject the applications of jailed journalists Ahmet Altan and Nazlı Ilıcak, the Constitutional Court’s decision has prolonged the detention of someone who should never have been imprisoned in the first place.
“All eyes now turn to the European Court of Human Rights, which is currently considering Osman Kavala’s case and must urgently remedy this travesty of justice.”

Background
Osman Kavala was detained by the police in Istanbul on 18 October 2017 and then remanded in prison pending trial by a court decision on 1 November for ‘attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, attempting to overthrow the government of the Turkish republic or to prevent it from performing its duties’. In the following days and weeks, a smear campaign was mounted against him in the pro-government media using details leaked from the investigation. These media reports alleged that Osman Kavala was questioned about having links with the alleged organizers of the July 2016 failed coup attempt.
After 2 years in detention, the smear campaign in the pro-government media focused on Kavala’s contribution to the Gezi Park protests and claimed that he financed the protest and tried to spread it to other cities in Turkey.
Osman Kavala is among 16 defendants who are facing serious charges that carry the most severe sentence in Turkey criminal law – life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The indictment in the case dated 19 February 2019 was accepted on 4 March 2019 by the Istanbul Heavy Penal Court No. 30. The first hearing in the case is scheduled to take place on 24 and 25 June 2019 at Silivri prison where he and another defendant, Yigit Aksakoglu are being held.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
Tusif Ur Rehman Chhina is a man of Pakistani origin who was held for over 2 years in immigration detention, since November 2015. During that time, his detention was reviewed 12 times under the mechanism put in place by the federal Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, yet he was kept in detention because the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) believed that detention was necessary in order to eventually deport him even though there were alternatives to detention presented. 
When Mr. Chhina, who was being held in Alberta, applied to Court to have the legality of his detention reviewed, the Court declined to hear the case stating that the existing federal statutory mechanism was sufficient. The Alberta Court of Appeal subsequently overturned that decision, underscoring the importance of the right to habeas corpus, which requires a judge or Court to review the detention. The federal government has appealed this decision before the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (“IRPA”) provides a review of immigration detention that is complete, comprehensive and expert and as such, that there is no basis in law to find that habeas corpus is a route by which immigration detainees can, as of right, challenge the legality of their detention in a superior court. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S INTERVENTION 
Amnesty International argued that the broad right to challenge one’s detention by way of habeas corpus extends to immigration detention, that this challenge must be heard before a court, not a ministerial official, and that Canada is under international legal obligations to guarantee this right. Amnesty International Canada submitted that: (1) there is a right to habeas corpus in international law; (2) the entitlement to challenge detention extends to all contexts of detention, including administrative detention and therefore immigration detention; (3) the court responsible for habeas corpus reviews should be a different body from the one that initially ordered the detention; and (4) the right to habeas corpus is of particular relevance to stateless individuals due to their vulnerability to long-term administrative detention. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
The Supreme Court granted a leave to appeal on May 3, 2018. The Court heard the case on 14 November 2018, and the judgement was rendered on 10 May 2019.  
In their decision, the Court dismissed the Minister’s appeal and affirmed that there must be a complete, comprehensive, and expert scheme that is as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus when the legality of detention is being challenged in a habeas corpus application. The Court ruled that the statutory scheme in the IRPA does not meet this criterion, as IRPA proceedings do not provide for review as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus with respect to the bases upon which Mr. Chhina challenged his detention: the length, uncertain duration, and conditions of detention. Ultimately, the IRPA’s scheme is less advantageous to detainees in terms of the onus in detention review than a habeas corpus proceeding, the scope of review is narrower, and the remedy is less timely than that which would be provided by a habeas corpus application. For these reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

0,UN: Catastrophic failure as civilians ravaged by war violations 70 years after Geneva Conventions,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/un-catastrophic-failure-as-civilians-ravaged-by-war-violations-70-years-after-geneva-conventions/,"The UN Security Council must mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year by ending its catastrophic failure to protect millions of civilians around the world whose lives and livelihoods are routinely ravaged by violations of the laws of war, Amnesty International said today....","The UN Security Council must mark the 70th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions this year by ending its catastrophic failure to protect millions of civilians around the world whose lives and livelihoods are routinely ravaged by violations of the laws of war, Amnesty International said today.
Tomorrow (23 May), the Security Council will hold an open debate on the protection of civilians in armed conflict – 20 years after this goal was first added to its agenda.
“Twenty years after the UN Security Council pledged to do its utmost to protect civilians in armed conflict, and 70 years since the Geneva Conventions sought to shield civilians and others from the types of atrocities committed during the Second World War, the picture is incredibly grim,” said Tirana Hassan, Crisis Response Director at Amnesty International.
“The great military powers cynically boast about ‘precision’ warfare and ‘surgical’ strikes that distinguish between fighters and civilians. But the reality on the ground is that civilians are routinely targeted where they live, work, study, worship and seek medical care. Parties to armed conflict unlawfully kill, maim and forcibly displace millions of civilians while world leaders shirk their responsibility and turn their backs on war crimes and immense suffering.
“Russia, China and the United States continue to abuse their veto power by blocking draft resolutions that aim to prevent or stop atrocities from taking place. Every time this happens, they are putting innocent people living in these danger zones at grave risk.”
In recent years alone, Amnesty International has documented a blatant disregard for civilian protection and international humanitarian law in armed conflicts where four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council are parties – Russia, the USA, the UK and France. The fifth, China, has actively shielded neighbouring Myanmar as it carried out war crimes, crimes against humanity and possibly genocide.
The disastrous failure to protect civilians has been evident in the US-led Coalition’s blitzing of Raqqa, Syria, that left more than 1,600 civilians dead; in Russian and Syrian forces’ wanton destruction of civilian infrastructure and lives in Aleppo, Idlib and elsewhere – forcing mass displacement of millions and amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity; and in the war in Yemen where the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led coalition, backed by Western arms, has killed  and injured thousands of civilians in unlawful attacks and fuelled one of the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
Somalia remains another of the world’s worst human rights and humanitarian crises. All parties to the conflict, including the USA, have violated both international human rights and humanitarian law. Despite ramping up air strikes in its secretive war in Somalia over the past two years, the USA failed to admit a single civilian casualty until an Amnesty International investigation prompted it to.
Israel has repeatedly targeted civilians and civilian objects during military operations in Gaza since 2008, causing great destruction and loss of human life. Between March 2018 and March 2019, Israel used lethal force against Palestinian protesters, killing at least 195 people, including medics, journalists, and children. Palestinian armed groups have fired indiscriminate rockets into civilian neighbourhoods in Israel, causing several fatalities.
In South Sudan and elsewhere, conflict-related sexual violence and gender-based violence are occurring at shocking levels. Witnesses and victims of a brutal government-led offensive in April-July 2018 in the north of the country described how civilians, including women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities were deliberately killed by gunfire, burnt alive in their homes, hung from trees and rafters and run over with armoured vehicles. Civilians were hunted down while fleeing into nearby wetlands, or rivers, as soldiers shot indiscriminately into areas where people were hiding and carried out attacks on islands where they had sought refuge.
The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported a record high number of civilian casualties in 2018, with 10,993 people killed or injured
Just last week, in Libya, Amnesty International documented how a fresh offensive on Tripoli has been marked by indiscriminate attacks and assaults putting the lives of civilians, including vulnerable detained refugees and migrants, at risk.
Nor is the record of the United Nations itself unblemished. In South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and elsewhere, UN peacekeepers have failed, on multiple occasions, to protect civilians facing deadly violence. A particularly reprehensible problem is that of sexual exploitation and abuse, with civilian women and girls being raped and assaulted by the very peacekeepers who are supposed to protect them.
Especially vulnerable people like children, older persons and persons with disabilities have also been targeted in particular ways in conflict – such as militaries and armed groups recruiting child soldiers or brutally assaulting those less able to flee during attacks on civilian populations.
Despite international treaties prohibiting their use, some states and armed groups continue to use inherently indiscriminate weapons like cluster munitions and landmines, which have been banned under international law for their impact on civilians. Others, such as Syria and Sudan have also used chemical weapons, which have no place in warfare.
Last year, the UN Refugee Agency decried the record-breaking figure of 68.5 million people displaced worldwide by armed conflict and other forms of violence.
“Seventy years on from the Geneva Conventions, to have almost 70 million human beings displaced by wars and other violence reflects the catastrophic failure of world leaders to protect them,” said Tirana Hassan.
“World leaders have all but abandoned civilians to the ravages of war. This week’s open debate in the Security Council must yield more than just posturing and empty promises. Concrete action is needed to reverse course, effectively protect civilians, stop war crimes and end impunity.”

“Some of the measures adopted or proposed by this government over the past five months raise many concerns,” said Jurema Werneck. “They could increase the risk of homicides with firearms. They legitimise a public security policy based on the use of lethal force. They violate the rights of indigenous peoples and Quilombolas. They base drug policy on punitive and ineffective practices. They could increase monitoring of NGOs without justification. They deny victims of the military regime the right to truth, justice and reparations. All of this is accompanied by an overtly anti-human-rights rhetoric which only adds to Amnesty International’s concerns about the human rights situation in Brazil.”
Erika Guevera-Rosas said: “It is an extremely delicate time in the Americas, with governments that, instead of protecting the human rights of the people in their countries, are promoting measures and policies that have devastating effects on those people (the Central Americans in need of protection in the United States, for example), or promoting violence and persecuting their opponents, as is happening in Venezuela and Nicaragua. In the past few months, we have seen how this regressive trend is affecting Brazil, with President Bolsonaro’s government taking some worrying stances.” 
“In 2017, Amnesty International showed that Brazil was one of the most dangerous countries in the Americas for human rights defenders, and Global Witness revealed that it was the riskiest in the world for defenders of human rights relating to land or the environment. President Jair Bolsonaro must take urgent measures to turn the situation around, comply with the international treaties Brazil has ratified, guarantee freedom of action for people and organisations working to creating a better society in the country, and abandon his anti-human-rights rhetoric, which legitimises violations against certain groups.”
Erika Guevara-Rosas, is worried by the shrinking space for civil society across the world, with the adoption of many laws seeking to control or hamper the work of non-governmental organisations.
“Unfortunately, more and more countries are trying to control non-governmental organisations and to hinder the work of organisations that play a crucial role in drawing attention to errors, crimes and human rights violations committed by the state. We are concerned that the measures taken by the current Brazilian government on the monitoring of NGOs are steps in that same direction,” said Beltrán. “The international community will continue to keep a close eye on Bolsonaro and his government’s compliance with their obligation to protect and guarantee human rights”.
This measure, like many others, comes in the context of a toxic, overtly anti-human-rights rhetoric. Erika Guevara-Rosas added: “Recently, we have seen political leaders in many countries campaigning with an overtly anti-human-rights agenda and rhetoric. In Brazil, this rhetoric is beginning to be turned into concrete actions. We therefore urge Bolsonaro to adopt firm and decisive measures to protect and guarantee human rights throughout the country and to ensure that the people who defend and campaign for such rights can do so without fear of reprisals”.

“The authorities in Indonesia must let people demonstrate freely and peacefully. Security forces must refrain from using unnecessary or excessive force or intimidating demonstrators,” said Amnesty International Indonesia’s Executive Director Usman Hamid.
Prior to the announcement by the Election Commission (KPU)  tomorrow, civil society organizations and prominent opposition political activists have announced plans to stage mass protests in Jakarta on 22 May, saying they would reject the 17th April presidential election results.
On Sunday 19 May, media reported that police were intimidating groups travelling on busses to Jakarta,  instructing them to turn back and not join the rally.
“Preventing people from joining a peaceful protest is a violation of their human rights. Everyone has the right to join others and express their thoughts peacefully,” Usman Hamid added.
Amnesty International Indonesia also urges the Indonesian government not to involve the military in the handling of public assemblies, since they are neither trained nor equipped to handle such situations which are completely alien to their mandate and fighting mission. If – exceptionally – they are to be deployed they must be fully trained and equipped to fulfil this task in compliance with international human rights law and standards, especially the “protect life” principle,  be subject to the same rules as regular police and, and should be placed under the oversight/command of a civilian authority.
Background
The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (Basic Principles) which were adopted domestically in Indonesia by a Chief of National Police’s Regulation (Perkap No.1/2009) clearly establish that law enforcement officials can use force only if non-violent means are unlikely to be effective.In the use of force, law enforcement officials must seek to minimize harm and injury.The Basic Principles require that in the dispersal of peaceful assemblies which are unlawful under domestic legislation law enforcement officials must exercise utmost restraint.
In any case, priority must be given to voluntary dispersal without the use of force, and if force has to be used, it needs to be necessary and proportionate to the level of resistance by the demonstrators; force that is likely to cause harm should be directed only at those individuals who are engaged in violence, and force with indiscriminate effects can only be justified in cases of widespread violence against persons, when it is no longer possible to contain the violence by dealing only with the individuals engaged in violence.

0,Mexico: First known child death in Mexican migration custody under new president suggests eerie parallels with US policy,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/mexico-first-known-child-death-in-mexican-migration-custody-under-new-president-suggests-eerie-parallels-with-us-policy/,"The first known death of a child detained by Mexican migration authorities under the current presidential administration is a sickening tragedy that demands answers from a government that promised to be more humane to migrants and refugees, said Amnesty International today. “At a time when...","The first known death of a child detained by Mexican migration authorities under the current presidential administration is a sickening tragedy that demands answers from a government that promised to be more humane to migrants and refugees, said Amnesty International today.
“At a time when children are dying in United States migration custody on the other side of the border, President López Obrador’s government is overseeing a crackdown on migrants and refugees that is resulting in the careless treatment of human lives. This suggests an alarming parallel with the current approach of the Trump government,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
On 16 May, Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) announced that a 10-year-old Guatemalan girl died in hospital, where she was transferred after arriving at Mexico City’s migration detention centre in the company of her mother two days earlier, complaining of a sore throat. INM had brought her back from the northern border state of Chihuahua via bus, a trip of nearly 20 hours.
Amnesty International has documented at length the grave risks migrants and asylum-seekers are already facing along the US-Mexico border due to the policies of the US and the acquiescence of Mexico.  For its part, on 29 January, the US government commenced the “Remain in Mexico” policy, also known as the “migrant protection protocols”, under which US authorities have forcibly returned thousands of asylum seekers to Mexico while they await the final adjudication of their asylum claims in the USA. This policy violates international refugee law. The Mexican government did not refuse to cooperate with this policy.
Hundreds of people who are still waiting in Mexico for their court hearings in the United States on their asylum proceedings are stuck in legal limbo – and potentially dangerous situations. Chihuahua is one of the states where hundreds of asylum seekers are being forced to wait under this policy. In addition to the “Remain in Mexico” policy, US and Mexican authorities are also forcing asylum seekers to wait for weeks or months on an illegal asylum waitlist before allowing them to request protection, which some said has put them in danger.
In April 2019, Amnesty International met with Mexican municipal, state and federal agencies in Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, who confirmed that the Mexican government had not provided any significant funding or coordinated relief efforts for the thousands of asylum seekers who are returned to Mexico. Border areas in Chihuahua state such as Ciudad Juárez are currently experiencing a high number of migrants and asylum seekers without significant additional resources from Mexican authorities to provide for their adequate shelter and care.
The INM has a responsibility to inform as to whether this 10-year-old girl was apprehended by Mexican migration agents in this border area, as well as other circumstances surrounding her detention that ultimately ended in her death. 
According to Mexican government data, 31,675 foreigners were placed in migration detention centres between January and March 2019, including 8,569 children under 18. In this same period, Mexican authorities have deported 22,614 people back to their countries of origin, 5,997 of whom were under 18.
Mexico’s laws on children’s rights expressly prohibit authorities from holding children in migration detention centres. Nevertheless, INM detains thousands of children on a yearly basis. The majority come from Central American countries such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, which in recent years has been experiencing high levels of violence that have forced many people to leave in search of protection.
Based on the information available to Amnesty International during the last five to ten years, deaths of children in immigration detention in Mexico are extremely rare.

The DCO regime violates the rights of refugee protection claimants to a fair hearing by imposing shorter timelines and other measures for no reason other than the claimant’s country of origin. Furthermore, delays in accessing the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) for claimants from DCO countries have been found to be unconstitutional.
In March 2019, the Federal Court struck down the distinction between the DCO and non-DCO claimants’ access to the PRRA. While DCO claimants were ineligible to apply for a PRRA for 36 months from the date of rejection of their claims, non-DCO refugee claimants were ineligible for 12 months after rejection of their claims. This difference in treatment was considered unconstitutional. Similarly, in July 2015, the Federal Court found that differential treatment in accessing the Refugee Appeal Division between DCO and non-DCO claimants was contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
“On multiple occasions, the DCO has been recognized by the courts for what it is: a discriminatory and arbitrary measure which disadvantages certain refugee protection claimants on the basis of nothing other than country of origin,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “UN human rights bodies have also criticized these measures. We are pleased to see that the government is now doing the same, and has further acknowledged that it was an unjust and misguided policy measure.”
Amnesty International had opposed the introduction of the DCO regime into the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2012 as discriminatory and arbitrary. Amnesty International was doubly concerned that a number of countries included on the list faced situations of widespread and very serious human rights violations, including Mexico and the situation of the Roma community in a number of designated Central European countries. UN human rights bodies had repeatedly called on Canada to repeal the DCO measures.
In today’s announcement, the government further signalled its intention to repeal the DCO regime through legislative amendment. “The government must now finish the job by repealing DCO provisions from the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,” Neve added.
Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, said the following: “today’s decision will meaningfully advance the equality of treatment that must exist for all people seeking Canada’s protection. However, the parallel between today’s decision, which advances that equality, and the ineligibility measure that is contemplated by Bill C-97, which undermines it, is impossible to miss. Not unlike the DCO regime, the ineligibility criteria introduced by Bill C-97 is both entirely subjective and arbitrary. We hope that the government will acknowledge the discriminatory nature of the measure that is proposed in Bill C-97 and withdraw this amendment.”

While both men and women politicians face online abuse, women politicians face abuse that is often gendered due to their political participation. Women from religious and ethnic minorities, transwomen, queer women, and Dalit women are further targeted due to their marginalized status.
“Online abuse silences women – it leads to self-censorship, limiting what women post, or leads to them leaving Twitter altogether”, said Reena Tete, Manager, Gender and Identity, Amnesty India. “It also has a strong negative impact on mental well-being and perceptions of offline safety.”
However, the exact nature and scale of abuse in the Indian context is under-researched. This project seeks to build an evidence base on the extent and nature of online abuse faced by prominent women politicians in India and its effect on their freedom of expression.
This project will engage 2000 Decoders drawn from across the country to analyse thousands of tweets before, during and after elections. In 2017, Amnesty International conducted Troll Patrol in eight countries including the US and the UK where it found that 7.1% or 1.1 million tweets sent to women across political spectrum were “problematic” or “abusive”. In light of this, Amnesty International recommended Twitter to usher in more transparency by putting out disaggregated data on the categories of abuse reported by women and the nature of Twitter’s response to such abuse. This project seeks to apply the same methodology to examine tweets in India.
 “Twitter is an important online space for women to express themselves. And all efforts must be taken to prevent the spread of toxicity, hate and violence against women on the platform”, said Reena Tete.
Troll Patrol India has been launched with a call for engaging volunteers for the decoding project here: https://decoders.amnesty.org/projects/troll-patrol-india

“These latest arrests have reignited a climate of fear amongst independent activists and human rights organizations about a renewed assault by the Egyptian authorities on the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International. 
“The Egyptian authorities have an appalling record of arbitrarily detaining peaceful activists over unfounded charges for months and sometimes for years, without ever referring them to trial, before releasing them under harsh probation measures. Instead of stepping up their repression with a fresh round of arbitrary detentions, the authorities should stop harassing peaceful critics and ensure all those detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association or assembly are immediately and unconditionally released.”
Amnesty International is calling on the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Mostafa Maher and Haytham Mohamdeen as their detention is arbitrary, and the charge against them is overly vague and has no credible basis. They appear to have been targeted solely because of their history of peaceful activism. The authorities also violated their fair trial rights during arrest, detention and questioning.  
Background
On 13 May, Haytham Mohamdeen was summoned to Saf police station, in Giza governate, south of Cairo, after being wrongfully accused of violating his probation terms. When he went to the police station, the police arrested him and held him without access to his lawyer or family until 16 May. Haytham Mohamdeen had been under probation since his release on 30 October 2018 from five months of arbitrary  detention over trumped up charges of inciting peaceful protests against austerity measures.
On 14 May, plainclothes police forces went to Mostafa Maher’s house in Qatameya, Cairo and arrested him, without showing an arrest warrant. The authorities kept him in incommunicado detention until 16 May.
On 16 May, prosecutors from the Supreme State Security Prosecution ordered the detention of both men for 15 days on the charge of “aiding a terrorist group in achieving its goals”. They were not able to meet with their lawyers ahead of the interrogation and Haytham was interrogated without a lawyer.

An analysis of...","A contemptible amendment to Iran’s code of criminal procedure could effectively strip detainees who are facing punishments such as the death penalty, life imprisonment and amputation, of the right to access a lawyer while they are under investigation, said Amnesty International.
An analysis of the bill published by the organization today details how, if passed, the amended law would permit the prosecution to immediately deprive individuals arrested on “national security” and certain other serious criminal charges of access to a lawyer for 20 days, which could be extended to cover the whole investigation phase. In Iran, those charged with “national security” offences include human rights defenders, journalists and political dissidents targeted solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights.
“This is a regressive piece of draft legislation which would effectively remove the right to a lawyer in a wide range of criminal investigations and contravene Iran’s obligations under international law. If passed by MPs it would be a crushing blow to Iran’s already deeply defective justice system and could further consolidate patterns of torture and other ill-treatment against detainees to extract forced confessions during interrogations,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at ‎Amnesty International.
“Denial of prompt access to a lawyer is a serious violation of the right to a fair trial in all circumstances, but it is particularly shocking in cases where individuals are at risk of being sentenced to severe or irreversible punishments such as execution, amputation and life imprisonment.”
For decades Iranian authorities have failed to ensure that the right to access a lawyer is respected, particularly during the investigation phase.
The proposed amendment is intended to replace an already flawed provision in the Note to Article 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This provision requires individuals facing charges related to “national security” and certain organized crimes to select their lawyer from a list of names approved by the head of the judiciary.
Iranian lawmakers involved with the legal and judicial parliamentary commission had announced in June 2018 that they would look into reforming this law to grant detainees access to a lawyer of their choosing, but instead they have taken a huge step backwards.
“Iranian lawmakers should focus their attention on introducing legal reforms that would strengthen rather than further undermine the right to a fair trial. The Iranian parliament must urgently revise this proposed amendment to bring it into line with Iran’s obligations under international human rights law and guarantee the right of all detainees to access a lawyer of their choice from the time of arrest and at all stages of judicial proceedings, including pre-trial detention, questioning and investigation,” said Philip Luther.
 Background
Iran’s legal and judicial parliamentary commission announced on 6 May 2019 that it had a prepared a draft amendment to the Note to Article 48 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which came into force in its current form in 2015.
The proposed amendment is expected to be scheduled for a vote in Iran’s parliament in the coming weeks.

“Taiwan has today made history in the fight for equality for LGBTI people. Love has won over hate, and equality has won over discrimination. This is a moment to cherish and celebrate, but it has been a long and arduous campaign for Taiwan to become the first in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage.
“We hope this landmark vote will generate waves across Asia and offer a much-needed boost in the struggle for equality for LGBTI people in the region.
“We are filled with pride and joy that from next Friday same-sex couples in Taiwan will be able to marry and finally have their love and relationships recognized as equal under the law. But the Taiwanese government must not stop here; it needs to act to eliminate all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identities and intersex status.”
Background
On 17 May, Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan voted in majority to pass the draft law called “The Enforcement Act of the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748”. The law is due to take effect on 24 May 2019.
Under the new law, same-sex couples are granted the same right to legally marry as opposite-sex couples, and many of the same rights and obligations applied to opposite-sex couples under the existing regulations in the Civil Code will be applied to same-sex couples.
However, the law falls short of genuine and full marriage equality in some areas. For example, it does not provide equal adoption rights for same-sex couples. The law only allows spouses in same-sex marriages to adopt the biological children of their partners, but not joint adoption of non-biological children, as permitted for opposite-sex married couples.
In May 2017, Taiwan’s Constitutional Court ruled that the existing law covering marriage discriminated against same-sex couples. The court gave the legislature two years to amend existing laws or pass new legislation to legalize same-sex unions.
After the government submitted the now adopted proposal, two “compromise” same-sex union bills granting lesser rights by legalizing “cohabitation” or “partnership” were proposed by anti-LGBTI groups and politicians and submitted to the parliament for adoption. The two bills were rejected.
Amnesty International believes that the human rights to dignity and equality require that marriage rights for same-sex couples are guaranteed on the same basis and with all the same rights as marriages between couples of opposite sex.

The city of Ottawa has a new resident: Aasia Bibi. The Christian woman was employed as a farm worker in Pakistan. One day she offered a fellow farm worker some water. The worker replied that it was “unclean” because Aasia is not a Muslim. Aasia was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and received a death sentence for blasphemy. Her case went to Pakistan’s Supreme Court. On October 31, 2018, the Court acquitted her. She lived in protective custody until Canada granted her asylum. She arrived in Canada on May 8. 
  
 
Urgent Action writers were happy to learn that Merzoug Touati is free. The Algerian blogger and prisoner of conscience should never have been detained in January 2017 after publishing a post on Facebook. He should never have been sentenced to seven years behind bars. Mercifully, he served just two before he was released. Amnesty International believes that the pressure we added to the efforts of other organizations was crucial to achieving this result 
  
  
 
  
On May 3, members of the Urgent Action Network in Toronto joined the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Citizen Lab to mark World Press Freedom Day at the United Arab Emirates consulate on Bloor Street. The rally drew the attention of consulate staff to the continued and unjustifiable detention in the United Arab Emirates of Ahmed Mansoor. The prominent human rights defender and blogger was well into a hunger strike in protest at his unfair trial and his conditions of detention which include lack of access to water, a bed and family visits. Hours later, rally participants welcome rumours that Ahmed had ended his hunger strike. Now for a bed! 
  
Did you participate in Write for Rights 2016? If so, you may remember Bayram Mammadov. He is one of two students who dared to criticize Azerbaijan’s former president in the most public way they could — by painting a defiant message on his statue and doing it on the eve of his birthday. For that graffiti, they both received sentenes of 10 years in prison. Well, he served more than three years but, for the Nowruz new year holiday, a presidential pardon secured his early release on March 16, 2019. Barely two weeks later, he was back in prison on new, fabricated charges, held at high risk of ill-treatment, and sentenced to 30 days in administrative detention. Amnesty International issued UA 47/19 to support him. The international attention may well have ensured his physical safety during that month and prevented the possible extension of his term which is common practice in Azerbaijan. Bayram was released on April 29 April.  
  
For protesting peacefully, Mikhail Tsakunov should have never been arrested in Russia’s port city of St Petersburg on May 5, 2018. He should never have been imprisoned while he waits for his trial and potential sentence of five years behind bars. Happily, authorities released him on April 26 although they slapped restrictions on travel and the criminal proceedings continue so he remains at risk of conviction. 
  
A peaceful rally to oppose Vladimir Putin’s re-election as president was the scene of Mikhail’s arrest. He was accused of hitting a police officer in the face and knocking out a tooth. But video footage of the arrest and additional available evidence contradicted the riot police’s claims. This material confirmed that Mikhail Tsakunov was a prisoner of conscience, prosecuted solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and assembly. 
  
Amnesty International believes that the publi campaign on Mikhail’s case, which included appeals from Urgent Action participants in Canada, contributed to ensuring his early release.

The city of Ottawa has a new resident: Aasia Bibi. The Christian woman was employed as a farm worker in Pakistan. One day she offered a fellow farm worker some water. The worker replied that it was “unclean” because Aasia is not a Muslim. Aasia was accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad and received a death sentence for blasphemy. Her case went to Pakistan’s Supreme Court. On October 31, 2018, the Court acquitted her. She lived in protective custody until Canada granted her asylum. She arrived in Canada on May 8. 
  
 
Urgent Action writers were happy to learn that Merzoug Touati is free. The Algerian blogger and prisoner of conscience should never have been detained in January 2017 after publishing a post on Facebook. He should never have been sentenced to seven years behind bars. Mercifully, he served just two before he was released. Amnesty International believes that the pressure we added to the efforts of other organizations was crucial to achieving this result 
  
  
 
  
On May 3, members of the Urgent Action Network in Toronto joined the Gulf Centre for Human Rights, International Freedom of Expression Exchange and Citizen Lab to mark World Press Freedom Day at the United Arab Emirates consulate on Bloor Street. The rally drew the attention of consulate staff to the continued and unjustifiable detention in the United Arab Emirates of Ahmed Mansoor. The prominent human rights defender and blogger was well into a hunger strike in protest at his unfair trial and his conditions of detention which include lack of access to water, a bed and family visits. Hours later, rally participants welcome rumours that Ahmed had ended his hunger strike. Now for a bed! 
  
Did you participate in Write for Rights 2016? If so, you may remember Bayram Mammadov. He is one of two students who dared to criticize Azerbaijan’s former president in the most public way they could — by painting a defiant message on his statue and doing it on the eve of his birthday. For that graffiti, they both received sentenes of 10 years in prison. Well, he served more than three years but, for the Nowruz new year holiday, a presidential pardon secured his early release on March 16, 2019. Barely two weeks later, he was back in prison on new, fabricated charges, held at high risk of ill-treatment, and sentenced to 30 days in administrative detention. Amnesty International issued UA 47/19 to support him. The international attention may well have ensured his physical safety during that month and prevented the possible extension of his term which is common practice in Azerbaijan. Bayram was released on April 29 April.  
  
For protesting peacefully, Mikhail Tsakunov should have never been arrested in Russia’s port city of St Petersburg on May 5, 2018. He should never have been imprisoned while he waits for his trial and potential sentence of five years behind bars. Happily, authorities released him on April 26 although they slapped restrictions on travel and the criminal proceedings continue so he remains at risk of conviction. 
  
A peaceful rally to oppose Vladimir Putin’s re-election as president was the scene of Mikhail’s arrest. He was accused of hitting a police officer in the face and knocking out a tooth. But video footage of the arrest and additional available evidence contradicted the riot police’s claims. This material confirmed that Mikhail Tsakunov was a prisoner of conscience, prosecuted solely for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and assembly. 
  
Amnesty International believes that the publi campaign on Mikhail’s case, which included appeals from Urgent Action participants in Canada, contributed to ensuring his early release.

Amnesty International...","Amnesty International’s goal is to ensure that the human rights of everyone, everywhere are respected, protected, and upheld. We conduct research and generate action to prevent and halt human rights violations and demand justice for those whose rights have been violated.
Amnesty International recognizes that lesbian, gay, transgender, queer, and two-spirit (LGBTQ2S), Indigenous, Black, and other people of colour in Canada and around the world disproportionately experience human rights violations perpetrated by the police, state actors, and non-state actors because of systems of oppression.
State and police violence against LGBTQ2S, Indigenous, Black, and other people of colour violate the right to life; the rights to liberty and security of the person; the right to safety and to live free from violence  and discrimination; the rights to protest, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and peaceful assembly; and the right to live free from torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the uprising against state and police violence led by transgender women activists, many of whom were Black or people of colour, and some of whom were sex workers. The Stonewall riots mobilized LGBTQ2S people against police harassment and brutality in New York City and are now celebrated worldwide as a cornerstone of the liberation movements for LGBTQ2S communities, leading to the founding of the first Pride marches.
Pride is fundamentally about the liberation of LGBTQ2S people and intentionally including people who have been disenfranchised and pushed to the margins of society. The intention and spirit of Pride must be to prioritize the inclusion and safety of the most marginalized LGBTQ2S people over the inclusion of institutions that violate the human rights of Black people, Indigenous people, and people of colour.
Many sex workers are LGBTQ2S, Indigenous, Black, and/or people of colour. Canada’s laws on sex work—which is the exchange of sex between consenting adults for remuneration—place sex workers in isolated and unsafe situations where they are at a heightened risk of harassment and violence. Police are tasked with enforcing those sex work laws which threaten the safety of sex workers. Amnesty International advocates for the protection of the rights of sex workers and calls for the repeal of the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, which criminalizes many aspects of sex work.
As a human rights organization, Amnesty International recognizes the diversity of LGBTQ2S communities. We support the rights of communities to peacefully protest police violence, including the right to decide whether or how to include police participation in Pride festivals.
We encourage Amnesty International members and supporters to make their own decisions about whether to participate in Pride festivals that include police participation.
We recognize that Pride is not the only place to recognize and raise concerns about police violence against marginalized groups, nor is it the only place to show support for LGBTQ2S communities.
To that end, Amnesty International is committed to building on our efforts to address police violence in Canada, and supporting communities pressing for the rights of marginalized groups across the country to be respected, protected, and upheld.

“El Salvador’s legislators cannot turn their backs on the victims of crimes under international law and grave human rights violations committed during the armed conflict. The Salvadoran authorities are obliged to bring to justice anyone suspected of being responsible for the extrajudicial executions, torture and enforced disappearances that took place during the armed conflict. To do otherwise would risk becoming complicit in heinous crimes.”
“If the legislators approve a new law that grants amnesty and guarantees impunity for human rights violations, far from ensuring the victims’ rights to truth, justice and reparation, they would be mocking their pain and trampling on their rights. It is unacceptable that in El Salvador, almost 30 years after the signing of the Peace Accords, attempts are still being made to allow those responsible for the crimes committed in the armed conflict to escape justice and enjoy impunity.”
Additional information:
According to the United Nations Truth Commission, more than 75,000 people were tortured, extrajudicially executed or forcibly disappeared during the internal armed conflict in El Salvador between 1980 and 1992.
The Salvadoran army was responsible for many massacres in communities accused of supporting guerrilla groups. Armed opposition groups also committed crimes under international law and human rights abuses.
Five days after the United Nations Truth Commission published its recommendations in 1993, the Salvadoran authorities passed an Amnesty Law that contravenes the country’s obligations under international law and is an affront to the thousands of victims of human rights abuses and their families.
In 2016, the Supreme Court of El Salvador declared the Amnesty Law unconstitutional in a long-awaited and historic ruling.

“The absence of basic requirements of a fair trial – such as having access to a lawyer – strips today’s verdict of any reliability or credibility.
“The eight men were held in solitary confinement for over a year – this in itself can amount to torture. They were also denied access to their lawyers from the beginning of the trial; a number of the men claimed they had been tortured to sign so-called confessions but there have been no investigations into these claims. These details leave us with no confidence in the process that led to the conviction of the three men.
“It is welcome news that five men were acquitted; however, the authorities must now effectively investigate allegations of torture and quash the unreliable convictions of the remaining three. If there is not sufficient evidence against them and they cannot be prosecuted fairly, they too should be acquitted and released.”
“The flagrant disregard for human rights in this case is incongruous with the global image of a state-of-the-art, open and inclusive state that the authorities in the UAE seek to project.”
Background:
The eight Lebanese citizens were detained in the UAE between December 2017 and February 2018. They lived and worked in UAE for more than 15 years, seven of them worked with Emirates Airline.
All have been held in solitary confinement, charged with terrorism-related offences, and denied access to legal representation. A number of them have reported having been tortured in order to sign “confessions,” which they were not allowed to read. The charges they face include “forming a terrorist cell” and planning “terrorist” attacks in the UAE on orders of Hezbollah, a Shi’a political party and armed group based in Lebanon.

In June last year, one of my colleagues at Amnesty International received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number. It contained details about a protest supposedly taking place at the Saudi embassy in Washington DC, and my colleague was instantly suspicious. The message came at a time when Amnesty International was campaigning for the release of six jailed activists in Saudi Arabia, and something didn’t feel right.
An analysis of the links in the message proved these suspicions to be well-founded. Amnesty’s Tech team found that clicking the link would have secretly installed potent spyware on the phone, obtaining total access to calls, messages, photos and GPS location. A closer look enabled us to trace the attack back to a secretive Israeli company: NSO Group.
NSO Group sells surveillance software to governments and has been linked to digital attacks on human rights activists all over the world. The attempt to spy on Amnesty was the final straw for us. Today I am providing evidence to support 30 plaintiffs taking legal action in Israel, petitioning the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to revoke NSO’s export license. As I have set out in an affidavit to the court, NSO’s software is a threat to activists and journalists all over the world. Digital rights group Citizen Lab has linked the company to attacks against civil society in Bahrein, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We cannot sit back and watch while NSO becomes a go-to for repressive governments.
Like many previously documented attacks, the message sent to Amnesty had all the hallmarks of Pegasus, a dystopian piece of NSO software which can gain control of a phone’s keypad, camera and microphone. Pegasus was the tool used to track Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati human rights defender who is currently serving a ten-year jail sentence. Citizen Lab has also exposed Pegasus’s role in a spyware scheme targeting Mexican activists and journalists, including those investigating corruption and drug cartels.
It’s worth reiterating here that NSO itself states it only sells to governments. But governments, of course, are not necessarily more benign than cyber criminals, and some are significantly worse. By now, NSO surely knows what kind of hands its products end up in.
Last year the company came under new scrutiny following allegations its software was used to track murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi – an accusation the company has denied. But despite the ever-growing pool of evidence, the Israeli government has continued to give NSO the green light to export its products. Specific details of how the export licencing works and what kind of security or ethics checks it entails are difficult to find. The process is shrouded in secrecy; but it is clearly not stringent enough to keep NSO’s products out of the hands of human rights abusers. We don’t know if NSO has been used by the Israeli government in the context of surveillance of Palestinians.
The Israeli MoD has ignored multiple requests from Amnesty and others to revoke the company’s license, which is why we’re providing evidence in this legal action.
If the world’s largest human rights organization, which has technology experts among its staff, can be targeted, it’s probably the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NSO’s reach. Attacks like the one on Amnesty also show just how brazen the international surveillance industry has become. Earlier this year, Citizen Lab researchers looking into NSO were reportedly targeted by private operatives, in what seemed to be an attempt to silence and intimidate them.
But this case also is about more than human rights work – it highlights the threat to privacy for all of us. Today it was reported that a vulnerability in WhatsApp could expose billions of users to attacks by NSO spyware. Amnesty has not yet been able to verify these reports but if true they exemplify fully our claim to the Israeli courts: NSO has gone rogue and the Israeli MoD holds no proper oversight, control or regulation.
While NSO is allowed to market and sell its products without proper oversight, it’s essentially growing into a private international intelligence agency guided solely by profit and seemingly accountable to no one. Its spyware is so potent that most people would never know if their phone or computer had been infected.
NSO has repeatedly denied that Pegasus has been misused to target human rights defenders. Since a change of ownership in February this year the company has been trying to clean up its image, buying Google search ads and launching a new website where it claims to take “a pioneering approach to applying rigorous, ethical standards to everything we do.” No further details are provided, which hardly lends credibility to the claims. For those whose safety is jeopardized by NSO’s reckless sales, this kind of platitudes isn’t enough. Our petition today is a first step which we hope will eventually put a stop to NSO’s web of global surveillance.

It restricts the ability to farm their land, attend a protest, improve their homes, raise families, travel for medical purposes, or access essential services such as electricity and clean water. 
A Palestinian prisoner’s experience is even more dire: they must not only withstand all the above, but also arbitrary detention from Israeli and Palestinian forces, cruel and unlawful treatment, the repression of fundamental human rights, and the ongoing unlawful detention of children. 
For both, life is made all the more insufferable by Israel’s ever-expanding settlement operation. 
Palestinians in the occupied territories are subject to military law, which excludes the most fundamental human rights – such as the right to legal counsel during interrogation – while Israeli settlers enjoy the protections of Israeli civil law. 
Administrative detention allows Israeli authorities to arbitrarily detain prisoners without providing reasons for arrest, delay their trials for six months and then renew their detentions indefinitely without charge. At the end of 2018, over 5,500 Palestinian prisoners remained in Israeli prisons, including nearly 500 administrative detainees. 
Documented detention conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons include cruel and unlawful punishment, such as the deprivation of family visits and disallowing detained mothers to hold their children. 
On April 17, 2017, Palestinian prisoners launched a mass hunger strike to protest their conditions and historic ill treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities. A relative of one prisoner testified, “The Israeli authorities play with our emotions, they torture and punish us.” 
It is not only the Israeli authorities who subject the Palestinian people to such violations. The Palestinian Authority habitually detains Palestinians in an attempt to repress freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and social justice organizing. One Ramallah-based NGO reported that Palestinian authorities attacked media freedom 77 times during 2018, often through arbitrary arrests and physical assault. 
This abuse of power is reinforced by Israeli Military Order 101, enabling Israeli authorities to regularly imprison or fine Palestinians for peaceful expression of political dissent. This dual-sided censorship is intended to crush all forms of political engagement and strip Palestinians of their fundamental right to peaceful assembly. 
One example is the case of Issa Amro. Founder of the Youth Against Settlements and the “Open Shuhada Street” campaign, Issa has spoken at the United Nations about his peaceful efforts to stand against Israel’s military rule, demanding an end to Israel’s settlements in the city of Hebron and other places in the occupied West Bank. 
Despite international recognition, he is routinely punished and faces criminal charges. Issa stated: “I have been arrested more times than I can count for non-violent human rights work.” On March 28, 2019, Issa was again detained, this time for criticizing the Palestinian government in a Facebook post. 
Palestinians need to be able to stand up for their rights without the threat of imprisonment, and the world needs to know what is happening to them. It can’t happen without activists like Issa. The charges against him and other human rights defenders like him must be dropped. 
Despite ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child nearly 30 years ago, Israeli forces routinely detain children and subject them to degrading treatment. Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have endured the fear, intimidation, physical violence and humiliation that occurs during arrest. 
Israel prosecutes up to 700 Palestinian children via the military court system annually. According to Defense for Children International – Palestine, 96% of the children prosecuted between 2013-2018 did not have family present during interrogations. They arrive at interrogations blindfolded and sleep-deprived, and their confessions are often made after verbal and physical abuse – the likes of which often amount to torture. 
Because these children live under Israeli military law, the common act of stone-throwing is a criminal offense – for which Israel arrested over 200 children as of October 2018. 
Palestinians who build or improve their homes without difficult-to-obtain permits face jail time as well. For the Hashimeh brothers, who built an addition on their childhood home in Wadi Qadoum, there were only two options: demolish the home they built for themselves, or watch Israel demolish their home, and face jail time and punitive fines for failing to demolish it themselves. 
These restrictive Israeli policies on home construction in East Jerusalem are part of a wider two-tiered discriminatory Israeli plan aimed at solidifying a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, and are directly responsible for countless arbitrary arrests. 
This systemic dispossession of land, power, and human rights is enough to lead communities to despair, and Palestinian children whose homes have been demolished to make way for Israeli settlers experience depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and sleep disruption. 
The compounded effects of displacement and dispossession of land, coupled with the constant threat of arbitrary detention, forces Palestinians to live an unendurable situation.   
Over 600,000 Israelis settlers have occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank alone, resulting in the more than 50,000 demolished Palestinian homes and the restricted movement of nearly 5 million people. In 2017, Israel committed to accelerating its expansion of settlements, causing a recent United Nations Forum to discuss the threat of de facto annexation. 
The Israeli settlement operation is recognized as illegal under international law, yet only those standing against it suffer imprisonment. 
The international community must not only speak up for the rights of the occupied, but stand against those who profit from occupation. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, the Canadian government and Canadian companies contribute to – and profit from – their maintenance, development and expansion, which amount to war crimes under international criminal law. This acquiescence normalizes and legitimizes to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation.

Administrative detention allows Israeli authorities to arbitrarily detain prisoners without providing reasons for arrest, delay their trials for six months and then renew their detentions indefinitely without charge. At the end of 2018, over 5,500 Palestinian prisoners remained in Israeli prisons, including nearly 500 administrative detainees. 
Documented detention conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons include cruel and unlawful punishment, such as the deprivation of family visits and disallowing detained mothers to hold their children. 
On April 17, 2017, Palestinian prisoners launched a mass hunger strike to protest their conditions and historic ill treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities. A relative of one prisoner testified, “The Israeli authorities play with our emotions, they torture and punish us.” 
It is not only the Israeli authorities who subject the Palestinian people to such violations. The Palestinian Authority habitually detains Palestinians in an attempt to repress freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and social justice organizing. One Ramallah-based NGO reported that Palestinian authorities attacked media freedom 77 times during 2018, often through arbitrary arrests and physical assault. 
This abuse of power is reinforced by Israeli Military Order 101, enabling Israeli authorities to regularly imprison or fine Palestinians for peaceful expression of political dissent. This dual-sided censorship is intended to crush all forms of political engagement and strip Palestinians of their fundamental right to peaceful assembly. 
One example is the case of Issa Amro. Founder of the Youth Against Settlements and the “Open Shuhada Street” campaign, Issa has spoken at the United Nations about his peaceful efforts to stand against Israel’s military rule, demanding an end to Israel’s settlements in the city of Hebron and other places in the occupied West Bank. 
Despite international recognition, he is routinely punished and faces criminal charges. Issa stated: “I have been arrested more times than I can count for non-violent human rights work.” On March 28, 2019, Issa was again detained, this time for criticizing the Palestinian government in a Facebook post. 
Palestinians need to be able to stand up for their rights without the threat of imprisonment, and the world needs to know what is happening to them. It can’t happen without activists like Issa. The charges against him and other human rights defenders like him must be dropped.

Despite ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child nearly 30 years ago, Israeli forces routinely detain children and subject them to degrading treatment. Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have endured the fear, intimidation, physical violence and humiliation that occurs during arrest. 
Israel prosecutes up to 700 Palestinian children via the military court system annually. According to Defense for Children International – Palestine, 96% of the children prosecuted between 2013-2018 did not have family present during interrogations. They arrive at interrogations blindfolded and sleep-deprived, and their confessions are often made after verbal and physical abuse – the likes of which often amount to torture. 
Because these children live under Israeli military law, the common act of stone-throwing is a criminal offense – for which Israel arrested over 200 children as of October 2018.

Palestinians who build or improve their homes without difficult-to-obtain permits face jail time as well. For the Hashimeh brothers, who built an addition on their childhood home in Wadi Qadoum, there were only two options: demolish the home they built for themselves, or watch Israel demolish their home, and face jail time and punitive fines for failing to demolish it themselves. 
These restrictive Israeli policies on home construction in East Jerusalem are part of a wider two-tiered discriminatory Israeli plan aimed at solidifying a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, and are directly responsible for countless arbitrary arrests. 
This systemic dispossession of land, power, and human rights is enough to lead communities to despair, and Palestinian children whose homes have been demolished to make way for Israeli settlers experience depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and sleep disruption.

The compounded effects of displacement and dispossession of land, coupled with the constant threat of arbitrary detention, forces Palestinians to live an unendurable situation.   
Over 600,000 Israelis settlers have occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank alone, resulting in the more than 50,000 demolished Palestinian homes and the restricted movement of nearly 5 million people. In 2017, Israel committed to accelerating its expansion of settlements, causing a recent United Nations Forum to discuss the threat of de facto annexation. 
The Israeli settlement operation is recognized as illegal under international law, yet only those standing against it suffer imprisonment. 
The international community must not only speak up for the rights of the occupied, but stand against those who profit from occupation. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, the Canadian government and Canadian companies contribute to – and profit from – their maintenance, development and expansion, which amount to war crimes under international criminal law. This acquiescence normalizes and legitimizes to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation. 
Amnesty International calls upon the international community to sign petitions to stop enabling illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The petitions can be found here: Occupation at 50 and Destination: Occupation.

“While this promises to be a first step towards holding al-Bashir accountable for his heinous crimes, the Sudan authorities must hand him over to the International Criminal Court to answer charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Al-Bashir must face justice not only for recent crimes, but also for the crimes under international law he allegedly committed while he was in power.
“This announcement is all the more significant coming off the back of yet another night of bloody violence in Sudan during which at least four people were killed, and about 90 sustained gunshot injuries. The prosecutor must also investigate and charge everyone else responsible for the continued use of excessive lethal force against peaceful protestors.
“It should not be forgotten that the Sudan Transitional Military Council also bears responsibility for failing to protect peaceful protestors. They must hold to account any security officer who fired live bullets on the protestors camped out at the military headquarters and in other parts of the country.”
Background
At around midday on 13 May uniformed security officers were captured on a widely circulated social media video whipping protestors. The onslaught escalated from around 6pm when live shots were fired resulting in at least four deaths, one of whom was a military officer, and more than 90 people injured, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. The doctors said they had also treated 40 injuries arising from whipping and suffocation by tear gas.

In the past year, Saudi Arabian activists, including several women human rights defenders, have suffered the terrible ordeal of arbitrary detention, unable to speak to or see their loved ones for long months and with no access to legal representation. Women activists also detailed accounts of their torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse to the court, and many of them now face a prison term for their peaceful activism and speech.  
“Today marks a year of shame for Saudi Arabia. A year ago, the authorities started locking up some of Saudi Arabia’s bravest women activists, instead of celebrating hand in hand steps that should have served to advance the rights of women in the country,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
“Then they went on to detain those who still dared to stand up for these women, advocate for women’s rights in the country, or even express any questioning of the authorities’ policies.”
Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, Saudi Arabia’s leading women’s rights campaigners, were detained on 15 May 2018 and have been facing trial for their human rights work since March 2019.
While Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef were amongst seven women provisionally released in the past two months, Loujain al-Hathloul and several other women activists remain in prison. Women human rights defenders, Nassima al-Sada and Samar Badawi, have been detained since July 2018 without charge with tens of other fellow activists. In April 2019, the authorities escalated their crackdown on critics, arbitrarily detaining at least 14 journalists, writers, academics and family members of women’s rights defenders.
In November 2018, Amnesty International revealed reports of torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse of at least 10 activists arbitrarily detained since May 2018, which included several women human rights defenders. The organization called on the authorities to allow independent monitors access to detained activists.
“This is also a shameful day for Saudi Arabia’s closest allies in the West, namely the USA, the UK and France. Instead of prioritising business deals and arms sales, they should be intransigent – and publicly so – in pressuring the Saudi Arabian authorities for the immediate and unconditional release of all individuals who are being punished for expressing their views peacefully,” said Lynn Maalouf.
A few months following the wave of arrests targeting women’s rights activists, the Saudi Arabian authorities escalated their crackdown on dissent, as manifested in the Public Prosecution’s calls for the execution of religious clerics and Shi’a activists on trial before the counter-terror court for charges related to exercising their peaceful rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. This includes prominent religious cleric Sheikh Salman al-Awda, who was accused of 37 charges, including his affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood and calls for government reforms.
In late April 2019, the authorities also carried out a mass execution of 37 men, the majority of them from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority and executed after unfair trials. At least 15 men executed last month were sentenced to death based on “confessions” they said were extracted through torture, including a young man who was convicted of a crime that allegedly took place while he was under the age of 18.
In 2019 alone, the Saudi authorities have executed at least 110 people.
Background:
On the first anniversary of the arrests, Amnesty International repeats its call on supporters worldwide to continue taking action for the detained activists until they are unconditionally free.
Over the past year, over 280,000 people have stood in solidarity with Saudi Arabia’s women human rights defenders and activists through signing petitions and writing to the Saudi Arabian authorities demanding their release.
On Wednesday 15 May, Amnesty International UK and the Saudi Arabia-focused campaign organization ALQST are hosting an event to mark one year since the group of women’s rights activists were arrested. For more details, please contact: www.amnesty.org.uk/amnesty-media-team

“The Sri Lankan authorities must protect the country’s Muslim minority as it is being targeted by mobs in horrific attacks on their homes, mosques and businesses in the wake of the Easter Sunday massacre. The authorities must take steps to promote unity in diversity against the forces of hatred, those promoting fear and violence, and pitting communities against each other.
“The authorities must put the protection of human rights at the heart of its response and prevent further violence, including holding the suspected perpetrators of earlier attacks accountable. In particular, prosecutions must also meet international fair trial standards.
“It is alarming to see reports that those suspected to be involved in the March 2018 anti-Muslim violence may have been involved in these recent attacks as well.
“These attacks did not emerge out of a vacuum. There were clear signs that a backlash against Muslims was underway and the authorities could have acted on reports of threats earlier, potentially preventing much of the violence over recent days.”
Background
On 21 April, more than 250 people were killed and hundreds injured when bombers from a local Islamist armed group affiliated to the so-called Islamic State targeted three churches and three hotels on Easter Sunday.
Despite heightened security measures in the country, including intermittent bans on social media and a discriminatory ban on face-veils, there have been frequent reports of anti-Muslim attacks in many parts in the country.
On 13 May, the government imposed a countrywide curfew following reports of widespread attacks against Muslim-owned businesses, homes and mosques. Amith Weerasinghe who has been arrested on 14 May in connection to the attacks was also one of the people previously arrested, and later released on bail in 2018 for his role in anti-Muslim attacks in Digana.

By Grand Chief Dr. Abel Bosum and Alex Neve
In 2010, former prime minister Stephen Harper publicly reversed his government’s opposition to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In a formal “statement of support,” the Harper government said that it had listened to Indigenous leaders in Canada and “learned from the experience of other countries” and was now “confident” that Canada could move ahead with implementation of the Declaration “in a manner that is consistent with our Constitution and legal framework.”
So why wouldn’t Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators support legislation intended to finally move ahead with the work of implementing the Declaration in Canada?
Bill C-262 is the private member’s bill introduced by NDP MP Romeo Saganash. Passage of C-262 would create a legal framework requiring the federal government to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples on the measures needed to bring Canadian law and policy into line with the minimum global standards set out in the Declaration. 
Critically, passage of the Bill C-262 would not suddenly change the legal status of the Declaration in Canada. Courts would continue to use the Declaration in the interpretation of Canada, just as they are already doing. However, passage of C-262 would establish an ongoing process of federal implementation that could not be easily abandoned by future governments.
The Bill enjoys widespread support. Out of 71 witnesses who appeared before a Parliamentary Committee examining the Bill last year, only one opposed adoption of C-262. 
Yet, when it came to a vote in the House of Commons, Conservative MPs refused to join the other parties in supporting the Bill. Video widely circulated online even showed Conservative MPs giving each other a high five after they voted against the Bill.
Now the Bill is before the Senate where its fate will be decided. The Bill is being sponsored in the Senate by independent Senator Murray Sinclair. The support of the former Chief Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a powerful symbol that the Bill is an opportunity to advance reconciliation in Canada. Unfortunately, however, the limited time remaining to adopt C-262 before the current session ends means that even a small minority opposing the Bill could threaten its passage into law.  
A number of Conservative Senators have already gone on the record opposing the Bill. Their main concern seems to be that the UN Declaration could have far-reaching and unpredictable impacts in Canada. Some have already used procedural tactics to attempt to stall debate over the Bill.
These Senators seem to forget that the Declaration is not new – that it was developed over a period of more than twenty years and adopted by the United Nations more than a decade ago. They also seem to forget that a Conservative government studied the Declaration and came to the conclusion that it could and should support its implementation. And they are clearly ignoring the fact that the very purpose of the Bill is to ensure ongoing dialogue between government and Indigenous peoples over how the Declaration will be interpreted and applied in the future.
With an election looming, we are at a point where every issue on Parliament is seen as an opportunity to score points over political opponents. The cause of reconciliation, however, must not be dragged down by partisan politics. 
Bill C-262 is something that every federal party could and should support. In doing so, they have an opportunity to send a clear message to the public about the importance they place on reconciliation.

RE: Ending Sex Discrimination in the Indian Act
Dear Minister Bennett,
On April 12, 2019, the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls took the unique step of issuing a statement prior to issuing its Final Report. The statement called on the Government of Canada to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the 2019 federal election to end sex discrimination in the Indian Act. The Commissioners stated that “The gendered discrimination over decades has disenfranchised women from their communities, broken up families, and caused great disparity in rights and benefits as between First Nation women and men.” The National Inquiry statement echoed the same call made by First Nations women leaders on April 9, 2019 in Ottawa.
As Parties with Standing to the National Inquiry, and organizations and individuals who have been closely following the National Inquiry’s work, we are writing now to urge you to respond swiftly and immediately to this first recommendation from the National Inquiry by bringing the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the upcoming federal election. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women have all identified sex discrimination in the Indian Act as a root cause of the violence that First Nations women, girls, and two-spirit people experience.
The UN Human Rights Committee ruled in January 2019 that the sex-based hierarchy between s. 6(1)(a) and s. 6(1)(c), introduced by the 1985 Indian Act, and continued by the amendments of 2011 and 2017, violates the right to the equal protection of the law without discrimination based on sex, and violates the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of Indigenous culture, guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the National Inquiry said in its statement “Indigenous women are independent right-holders and Canada should uphold their rights.” Recognizing Indigenous women as equal in dignity and rights is a threshold requirement for moving forward to end the crisis of violence.
This ruling from the UN Human Rights Committee comes as a result of almost fifty years of struggle by First Nation women to be recognized as equal in law. Jeannette Corbiere Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Sandra Lovelace-Nicholas, Sharon McIvor, Dr. Lynn Gehl have all fought for equality for Indigenous women in the registration provisions of the Indian Act; it is surely time for Canada to recognize this right.
On May 3, 31 organizations and a prominent academic wrote to you requesting an official response to the National Inquiry’s final report before the House of Commons rises in June. We call on you, as a key part of this official response, to take action to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before June 21. This action by your Government will show that you intend to treat seriously the National Inquiry’s recommendations. It will demonstrate to people in Canada, and especially to Indigenous women, that they have value in the eyes of your Government and are worthy of the dignity and respect that equal rights in law convey. It will empower Indigenous women in their own struggle to stop the violence.
We urge you to respond swiftly to the National Inquiry’s report by ending the sex discrimination in the Indian Act, and bringing the outstanding sections of Bill S-3 into force before the election.
