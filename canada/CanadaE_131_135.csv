“We are struck by the existence of a network of people involved in the killing of a human rights defender such as Marielle Franco, who worked for the common good, to benefit the citizens of Rio de Janeiro. We continue to follow the development of the investigations and remain deeply concerned about the delay in identifying who ordered the crime. We hope that everyone involved in the killing will be identified and brought to justice.”
“We believe this stage of the investigation is crucial in terms of clarifying this brutal crime and we hope that these people will have access to due process in fair and expeditious proceedings. We remain committed to Marielle’s family, Brazilian society and the global community as they demand answers to the question: ‘who ordered Marielle killed and why?’”
“We demand justice in this emblematic case of the killing of a human rights defender who has always fought for the most vulnerable and was killed while serving her term as city councilor, for which she was democratically elected. The message is clear: no human rights defender is safe in Brazil as long as this case remains unpunished. Marielle’s case shows us the importance of protecting the human rights defenders in this country who fight daily and unfailingly for a more just and egalitarian world.”
In September, Amnesty International sent letters to the Rio de Janeiro Public Prosecution Service and state governor Wilson Witzel, demanding the resolution of the case 18 months after the killing of Marielle and Anderson. Last week, the Rio de Janeiro Public Prosecutor’s Office responded, saying Amnesty International’s letter will be incorporated into the case file to show the international repercussion of the crime, which highlights the importance of continued mobilization around the case.
In March 2019, Amnesty International delivered a petition to the Governor of Rio de Janeiro and State Attorney General Eduardo Gussem with 780,000 signatures from people around the world asking for justice for Marielle.
There is another petition on the Amnesty International Brazil website calling for further investigations until all those involved in the killing are identified and brought to justice. The current petition has already collected more than 80,000 signatures.

THANK YOU! Your time and enthusiasm means more people are taking action for human rights on December 10! (Haven’t signed up yet? You can still sign up HERE!) Planning to write on your own? Register to view our online webinar here...," 
So you’ve signed up to host a Write for Rights event. THANK YOU! Your time and enthusiasm means more people are taking action for human rights on December 10! (Haven’t signed up yet? You can still sign up HERE!) 
Planning to write on your own? Register to view our online webinar here >>  
 
We’ve put together a few tips to help you make the most of your event, whether it’s just a few people in your living room or a big event downtown! 
If you were selling tickets for your Write for Rights event, how would you publicize in advance? Those strategies will work for building up your presence on the day. Feature a Write for Rights case a day on your blogs or Facebook page. Poster the local libraries and telephone poles with news of the event. Spread the word on social media using our social media shareables.  
If you’ve registered your event, you’ll receive an email with a link to your unique event page that you can use to gather RSVPs. You can also use the “Recruit attendees on paper” tool on your event page to gather RSVPs in person. Coming Soon! Use our guide to the events website to learn more.  
We’d also love to hear your ideas for getting the word out!    
See some examples from local Amnesty organizers of how they spread the word about their Write for Rights events below. 
 
 
Facebook is great for spreading news about an event – BUT FIRST, that event needs to exist in this platform. It’s simple to create a Facebook event, and have all the details of the event available. You can use this to invite friends and family, and encourage them to invite others as well. Plus, during the event and afterwards, people can share their photos easily on the event page! 
You can also invite Amnesty Canada to be a co-host of your event to help spread the word.  
  
Contacting your local paper or television station to share about your event is easy with our Write for Rights Media Guide! Working with your local media is a great way to increase the impact of your event by telling your community about the human rights cases you care about and spurring others to take action. This guide will offer you some quick tips and materials to help you get the attention of your local media! 
Some of our local groups have had great success with building relationships with local media – see an example from our Stratford Community group below! 
 
“Oh look, it’s Amnesty!” That’s what you want people to say when they see your event. Amnesty’s signature bright yellow colour has immediate recognition. If you have Amnesty t-shirts, be sure to wear them. If you have a pull up poster, bring it along! Props get attention too – so be creative for Write for Rights. Maybe someone has a giant pencil they can lend!?For more ideas, check out photos from past events! 
 
Take time to consider your space – how can you best set it up? Have some stations for letter writing, and stations for petition signatures. This way, whether a person has 10 minutes or 2 seconds, they can easily support Write for Rights. 
When letter-writers arrive at your event, don’t leave them to wander and get lost. Put up posters and direction signs so folks can find you. (bonus tip: make the signs Amnesty yellow!) Have someone near the door to welcome people as they come, and help them get started writing letters. 
Make sure it’s obvious where people can leave their letters when they’re done. Consider decorated “mailboxes” – one domestic and one international! 
See some examples of creative mailboxes local Amnesty groups have made for Write for Rights events below for inspiration! 
(Amnesty group – Regina – mailbox) 
(Amnesty group – Toronto – mailbox) 
There are many ways you can get creative and use your space to engage new audiences and raise awareness – make sure to share your creative endeavors with us! 
 
Make it easy to write for rights! Have addressed envelopes ready or even use our printable address labels. Make sure there are plenty of Amnesty pens available. Create print-outs of the cases so people can read about who they are supporting. Have letter-writing tips and sample letters available. And finally, get your petitions ready for those who only have time for a quick signature. If possible, set up a few laptops or tablets to allow people to sign online versions of the actions. 
 
Photos are essential because they show the power of people taking action for change together. Also, it shows your community how they can get involved. Here are some tips for taking and sharing photos: 
 
Consider creating a space where participants can show their solidarity with human rights defenders. 
You could set up a simple solidarity photobooth or create a selfie photo space with props for people to write their own solidarity messages. You could also bring an old sheet and some markers/ pens/ paint brushes and encourage people to add to a solidarity banner to send to the human rights defenders.  
  
 
This idea won’t work for everyone, but if you can have a place where parents and children can both get involved – go for it! A kids’ station can be simple: paper, pencils and crayons. You could create lanterns from the drawings made and use them to decorate your space (using a simple string and peg approach!). Add a few stickers and you’re on a roll! We have created Case Sheets that are specifically for kids 9+ for the Iran, Nigeria, and Philippines cases.  
Most Write for Rights cases also include an option for sending a solidarity message to an individual or community, which is perfect for kids. They can create cards or drawings to send directly to people we’re supporting on Human Rights Day.  
 
Letter writing is great – but it can be quiet. Can you invite a local musician to play along as people gather to write? Or maybe there’s a great spoken word poet in your area you could invite out? What about your local radio station – maybe they’re interested in coming out for the event? Is your event at a school or university? Ask the debate team along, or the pep squad, or the school band.  
 
  
Keep people motivated to write with the Success Stories Slideshow, Write for Rights Videos, and Case Videos in the background. Keep a visible tally of the letters generated at your event as you go! 
  
No matter what time your event is at post a message to Twitter, Instagram, or the Facebook Event page. Amnesty activists are taking part during every hour of the day through every time zone around the globe. We’ll be retweeting and sharing your posts to capture the wave of activity as events happen across the world. Be sure to use the hashtags #write4rights and #W4R19.

Responding to the news that Ahmed – who had been jailed in Hungary in 2015, would return home, Giorgos Kosmopoulos, Director of Amnesty International Greece, said: 
“After four long years of separation Ahmed has finally been reunited with his family, just in time for his elder daughter’s tenth birthday. His return home to Cyprus is an overwhelming relief for the family, but he should never have been prosecuted, let alone convicted on those trumped up charges in the first place.” 
“Ahmed’s wish to bring his Syrian family to safety was what led him to be in Hungary in 2015. It is a scandal that the Hungarian government kept him away from his wife and children for so long, but after Cyprus did the right thing, today we celebrate that they are now reunited.” 
Over 24,000 people joined Amnesty International’s #BringAhmedHome campaign calling on Cyprus to permit his return 
For more information or to arrange an interview please contact: Lucy Scholey, Media Relations, Amnesty International Canada (English branch), 613-744-7667 ext. 236, lscholey@amnesty.ca
Background  
In August 2015, Ahmed left his family home in Cyprus to go and help his elderly parents and six other family members flee Syria and find safety in Europe. One month later, they found themselves among hundreds of refugees stranded at the Hungarian border after police fenced off the crossing with Serbia. 
Clashes broke out as some refugees attempted to get through. Hungary’s police responded with tear gas and water cannon, injuring dozens. Ahmed was arrested and a Hungarian court found him guilty of involvement in an “act of terror”, under Hungary’s extremely vague counter-terrorism laws, and sentenced him to 10 years in prison, later reduced to 7 years and then 5 with eligibility for early release. Amnesty International firmly believes that the application of terrorism-related charges and Ahmed’s subsequent conviction were manifestly unfounded.

“The shooting of a protester marks an alarming development in the Hong Kong police’s response to protests. The Hong Kong authorities must launch a prompt and effective investigation into the sequence of events that left a teenager fighting for his life in hospital. Police should only use lethal force in response to an imminent threat of death or serious injury and only as a last resort. 
“We are urging the Hong Kong authorities to urgently review their approach in policing the protests in order to de-escalate the situation and prevent more lives being put at risk.” 
Amnesty International analyzed videos of the shooting and pinpointed the location as Hau Tei Square in Hong Kong’s Tsuen Wan area. In a short video statement the Hong Kong Police Force defended the shooting by stating that the officer felt his life was under threat: 
“As an officer felt his life was under serious threat, he fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues’ lives.” 
Amnesty has repeatedly called for an independent and effective investigation into the police use of force over the course of the last few months of the Extradition Bill protests, including alleged torture and other ill-treatment in detention. Failure to address previous excessive use of force contributed to the current escalation in violence. Under UN guidelines, firearms may only be used to protect against an imminent threat to life or of serious injury.

But he worried about his elderly parents and six other family members who were still inside Syria’s border. In August 2015, he left his young family at home in Cyprus and traveled to Turkey, intending to help the rest of his family escape from Syria too. They made their way to the Hungarian border only to find themselves stranded along with hundreds of refugees after President Orban closed the crossing from Serbia. 
Tensions rose and clashes broke out. Hungary’s police responded with tear gas and water cannon, injuring dozens. Some threw stones, including Ahmed, but news footage also clearly shows him using a megaphone to call on both sides to remain calm. Of eleven people arrested, he was the only one charged under the counter-terrorism law.  
In September 2018, a Hungarian court found him guilty of “complicity in an act of terror” and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. A retrial reduced the term to 5 years despite a glaring lack of evidence to back up the extremely serious charge. The United Nations, the European Parliament and the US State Department all expressed concern about Hungary’s deliberate misapplication of terrorism charges in Ahmed’s case. 
More than 100,000 people took action against his conviction. 
On January 19 of this year, Hungary released him from prison and asked Cyprus to take him back. He waited in a detention centre for eight months during which time Hungary threatened to return him to Syria. 
24,000 people joined a #BringAhmedHome campaign urging Cyprus to allow him to return to his family. His daughter drew the “Ahmed’s wings” picture you see here. 
On September 27, four years since he was separated from his family, the news we had been waiting for came through: he had been cleared to return home to Cyprus. He arrived at Larnaca airport early the next day for an emotional reunion with his family — and just in time for his eldest daughter’s tenth birthday.

One year since the extrajudicial execution of Jamal Khashoggi, Saudi citizens are honouring Khashoggi’s legacy by pursuing the fight for their inalienable right to freely express themselves, despite the authorities’ continuing crackdown and the absence of any meaningful signal to hold accountable those responsible for Jamal Khashoggi’s killing, Amnesty International said today.
“Any talk of assuming responsibility for Jamal Khashoggi’s killing is meaningless if not met with the immediate and unconditional release of dozens of individuals who continue to languish in prison, and who continue to be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment, solely for having expressed their opinion in a peaceful manner,” said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International.
To date, Amnesty International has documented the cases of at least 30 prisoners of conscience who are behind bars serving prison sentences of between five and 30 years solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. Amongst those currently detained are Mohammad al-Qahtani, a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association who called for the protection and promotion of human rights and provided legal support to families of detainees, and Waleed Abu al-Khair, a lawyer who defended human rights defenders before his imprisonment. Mohammad al-Qahtani and Waleed Abu al-Khair were tried and sentenced before the counter-terror court to 10 and 15 years in prison, respectively, for their peaceful human rights work.
Marking the first anniversary since Jamal Khashoggi’s extrajudicial execution, Saudi Arabian activists abroad – supported by Amnesty International – are launching a podcast series called “The Great Saudi Arabia”, focusing on different human rights issues affecting the country. The first series focuses on the story of Jamal Khashoggi. At the heart of this initiative is the activists’ desire to demonstrate to everyone in Saudi Arabia and the world at large that extreme measures of repression will not stop them from expressing their views, tell their own stories and continue their fight for the release of other human rights defenders who are paying a hefty price for speaking out.
“The podcast will present a powerful platform for Saudi journalists, scholars and activists to counter the state-led propaganda and misinformation campaign. It will engage the Saudi people in a rare and free discussion on issues such as public participation, rule of law, feminism and other issues related to human rights,” said Hala al-Dosari, a Saudi Arabian scholar and human rights defender.  
According to media reports last week on a documentary aired on Sunday 29 September, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohamed bin Salman admitted for the first time that he bears responsibility for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi “because it happened under my watch”.               
“Mohamed bin Salman’s taking responsibility for Jamal Khashoggi’s killing will just be yet another failed PR stunt if it is not met with meaningful, concrete and immediate action. This must include an immediate end to the crackdown and the release of all human rights defenders on the one hand; and the prompt and unrestricted access to independent human rights monitors into the country, including to observe and publicly report on the ongoing trial into the case of Jamal Khashoggi’s killing,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Lack of transparency
Jamal Khashoggi was reportedly strangled moments after entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey on 2 October 2018. A UN report released by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Agnes Callamard, in June 2019 concluded that the journalist was the victim of “an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under human rights law”. Saudi Arabia failed to cooperate with Special Rapporteur Callamard during her investigation.
An ongoing trial in Saudi Arabia of 11 suspects charged for their involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, which began in January 2019, has been closed to the public and lacking any form of transparency. Other than the attendance of diplomats, Saudi officials have not permitted independent monitoring of the proceedings. Five suspects face the death penalty as per the Prosecution’s request.
To date, no information has emerged relating to the manner in which the investigation was carried out, whether those accused have had adequate access to legal counsel and other fair trial guarantees and more importantly, about the location of Jamal Khashoggi’s remains and whether these were returned to his family.
Amnesty International has long documented severe shortcomings plaguing the Saudi criminal justice system, including long periods of detention without charge or trial, lack of access to legal counsel during investigation, use of vague and uncodified charges that do not resemble recognizable crimes, and pressure on detainees to sign “confessions” and accept predetermined prison sentences to avoid prolonged arbitrary detention. The lack of independence, transparency, and fairness of the judiciary has meant that the Saudi criminal justice system falls well below international human rights law and standards.
“In light of standing, very serious concerns around due process and fair trials in Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Arabian authorities must immediately allow access to independent monitors into this trial, without which it would simply be another sham trial that fails to hold accountable all those responsible for the order and implementation of the killing, and a violation of the right of the family and the wider Saudi public to know what happened to Jamal Khashoggi ‘under the watch’ of Mohamed bin Salman,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Research.
Continuing violations                           
Since Khashoggi’s murder, a crackdown on human rights defenders, journalists and civil society organizations has continued unabated. Women human rights defenders were charged and tried for their peaceful human rights campaigning and advocacy for women’s rights in the country. While several women activists were temporarily released in recent months, Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada and Nouf Abdulaziz remain in arbitrary detention since May 2018. At least 14 civil society activists, writers and family members of detained activists were also arbitrarily detained almost six months ago and remain in detention without charges.
The death penalty has been used as a political weapon against the Shi’a minority in a chilling mass execution of 37 men, the majority from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority, earlier this year. At least 14 others executed were convicted of offences related to their participation in anti-government demonstrations in Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a majority Eastern Province between 2011 and 2012. The 14 men were subjected to prolonged pre-trial detention and told the court that they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated during their interrogation in order to have ‘confessions’ extracted from them. Also among those executed is Abdulkareem al-Hawaj – a young Shi’a man who was arrested at the age of 16 and convicted of offences related to his involvement in anti-government protests.
Amnesty International continues to campaign for three young men, Ali al-Nimr, Dawood al-Marhoon and Abdullah al-Zaher who remain on death row and at imminent risk of execution. They were all under the age of 18 at the time of their alleged offences. Under international law, the use of the death penalty against people who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime is strictly prohibited.

Argentina, Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico, Panama, Peru, St. Lucia, and Uruguay all signed the treaty at the first opportunity today as the UN General Assembly started in New York, while the Dominican Republic and Haiti have also committed to signing in the coming hours. 
“The leadership of the dozen countries who signed the Escazú Agreement today should serve as inspiration for the rest of the region and beyond,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. “We urge all other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to promptly follow their example for the survival and wellbeing of current and future generations.”  
The Escazú Agreement aims to promote the right of present and future generations to a healthy environment and to sustainable development. It is the first binding treaty in the Americas region aimed at protecting the right of individuals and groups to access public information and to access justice in environmental matters. Crucially, the Agreement also enshrines the protection of environmental defenders—a vital step forward in a region where protection of the environment has resulted in killings, attacks and unfounded legal proceedings.

Such measures also need to be replicated in the cases of the thousands of other disappearances in the country.
“During the first four years of struggle, Amnesty International continually denounced the cover-up by the authorities in the Ayotzinapa case. Today we have seen initial efforts by the new government to resolve the case and we welcome this, although much remains to be done,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“There will be no justice until those who obstructed the search for truth are investigated, since they are also responsible for the fact that to this day the whereabouts of the students have not been clarified. Amnesty International is committed, together with the families and other organizations, to continue monitoring this emblematic case and hopes that the commitments announced by the new government will be fulfilled until the truth is revealed and justice is done.”
In its first 10 months, the government created a special commission to follow up on the case, as well as a special unit in the Attorney General’s Office. In addition, the Undersecretary for Human Rights announced that Mexico will accept the competence of the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances to examine cases of disappearance in Mexico.
In a recent meeting with the relatives, President López Obrador and his government pledged to ask all institutions to support the investigations and to have regular meetings with the families and the Attorney General’s Office.
However, not all experiences under the new government have been positive. The investigation has not been transparent and the new initiatives set up regarding this case have not yet produced positive results.
In recent weeks, different judges have determined that much of the evidence presented by the former Public Prosecutor’s Office – now the Attorney General’s Office – was illegal and, consequently, they have ordered the provisional release of several of those detained. The authorities must address this situation by ensuring that only lawful evidence is used in the cases and that the independence of judges is respected.
“Five years after the forced disappearance of the 43 young students at Ayotzinapa, the Mexican authorities still owe a great outstanding debt to the victims, their families and society in terms of guaranteeing their rights to the truth, justice and reparation for the harm done,” said Tania Reneaum Panszi, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico.
“The flaws of the investigative process in the Ayotzinapa case are an impediment that has made it difficult to clarify the facts. There are also important lessons that should not be repeated in this or other emblematic cases. The truth can only be based on an impartial investigation that is verifiable and genuine.”
Amnesty International also notes with concern that the fate of those who have disappeared in the country has not been clarified. The authorities have reported that currently more than 40,000 people remain missing in Mexico.
“The government must ensure that all the necessary resources are put in place to solve not only the case of the 43 students, but all the cases of the more than 40,000 disappeared people in the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

In the report, Beijing’s Red Line in Hong Kong, the organization highlights how increasing restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly culminated in this summer’s protests.  
“The steady erosion of rights and freedoms in Hong Kong began long before the announcement of the Extradition Bill. The Chinese authorities, in tandem with the Hong Kong leadership, have for years been chipping away at the special status that Hong Kong is supposed to enjoy regarding the protection of human rights,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, Head of Amnesty International’s East Asia Regional Office. 
“The outrageous police response to the Extradition Bill protests has heightened fears that Hong Kong is sliding into the repressive style of rule seen in mainland China. We are urging the Hong Kong authorities to listen to the demands of millions of protesters and protect their right to peaceful assembly, in line with international and domestic obligations. Ordering an independent and effective investigation into police actions would be a vital first step.” 
Amnesty International’s report, based on interviews with journalists, activists, academics, students, NGO workers and lawmakers, details how the Hong Kong authorities, taking their lead from Beijing, have been implementing increasingly repressive policies since the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. The rights to freedom of expression and association have come under attack, with more than 100 people prosecuted for peaceful activism since 2014. Along with increasingly heavy-handed policing tactics and police inaction to protect protesters from violence by others, Hong Kong authorities have misused laws and regulations to harass and prosecute individuals and groups accused of crossing Beijing’s “red line”. 
An encroaching red line 
Amnesty International’s report looks at the period between two critical protests – Occupy Central and the Umbrella Movement in 2014, and the Extradition Bill protests that started in June 2019. It sets out how the Chinese authorities have used their vague and all-encompassing definition of “national security” – which has been employed to devastating effect against activists and others in China – to target journalists, activists and critics in Hong Kong.  
In 2017 President Xi Jinping set out a “red line” on Hong Kong aimed at “any attempt to endanger China’s sovereignty or security, challenge the power of the Chinese government, or use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration and sabotage activities against the mainland”. The Chinese authorities have increasingly interpreted the ordinary exercise of rights as crossing this “red line”. The Hong Kong government has adopted these tactics, breaching the tenets of its international human rights obligations and Hong Kong’s Basic Law.  
Many people Amnesty International interviewed said that their peaceful advocacy for human rights and democracy had made them targets of the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities.  
One journalist said he received weekly calls from Beijing government officials pressuring him to play down criticism of President Xi Jinping and issues like Taiwanese independence. NGO workers said they had been repeatedly harassed by Hong Kong and Beijing officials and forced to self-censor in order to protect their funding.  
Lack of accountability for unlawful use of force by police during protests also emerged as a key concern for the activists Amnesty interviewed. One activist who was beaten up by police during a 2014 protest told Amnesty: 
“It is useless to complain about the police. The success rate of accusing police of assault is almost zero.”  
During the recent protests sparked by the Extradition Bill proposed in March 2019, Amnesty and others documented repeated instances of police using unnecessary and excessive force in violation of international law and standards. Following the announcement of the withdrawal of the Extradition Bill on 4 September, Amnesty International continues to call on the Hong Kong authorities to thoroughly and independently investigate inappropriate use of force or other abuse by police during the protests, as well as to stop using politically motivated prosecutions against peaceful protesters. 
The Hong Kong authorities must also demonstrate their commitment to respecting, protecting and fulfilling the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly by stopping undue restrictions on these rights under the guise of ‘national security’.” 
“For the millions who took to Hong Kong’s streets this summer, the Extradition Bill is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Beijing’s assault on their human rights,” said Joshua Rosenzweig. 
“Authorities need to show they are willing to protect human rights in Hong Kong, even if this means pushing back against Beijing’s “red line”.”

After...","A new Amnesty International field investigation has documented an alarming pattern of the Hong Kong Police Force deploying reckless and indiscriminate tactics, including while arresting people at protests, as well as exclusive evidence of torture and other ill-treatment in detention.
After interviewing nearly two dozen arrested persons and gathering corroborating evidence and testimonies from lawyers, health workers and others, the organization is demanding a prompt and independent investigation into the violations, which appear to have escalated in severity since the mass protests began in June. 
“The Hong Kong police’s heavy-handed crowd-control response on the streets has been livestreamed for the world to see. Much less visible is the plethora of police abuses against protesters that take place out of sight,” said Nicholas Bequelin, East Asia Director at Amnesty International.
“The evidence leaves little room for doubt – in an apparent thirst for retaliation, Hong Kong’s security forces have engaged in a disturbing pattern of reckless and unlawful tactics against people during the protests. This has included arbitrary arrests and retaliatory violence against arrested persons in custody, some of which has amounted to torture.” 
More than 1,300 people have been arrested in the context of the mass protests that started over proposed legislative amendments that would have allowed for extradition to mainland China. While the vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, there has been violence, which appears to be escalating alongside excessive use of force by the police. Most people who spoke to Amnesty International requested anonymity, citing fears of reprisals from the authorities amid a climate of impunity.
Interviews of arrested persons and lawyers by Amnesty International show that police violence most commonly occurred before and during arrest. In several cases, detained protesters have also been severely beaten in custody and suffered other ill-treatment amounting to torture. In multiple instances, the abuse appears to have been meted out as “punishment” for talking back or appearing uncooperative.
A man detained at a police station following his arrest at a protest in the New Territories in August told Amnesty International that after he refused to answer a police intake question, several officers took him to another room. There, they beat him severely and threatened to break his hands if he tried to protect himself.  
“I felt my legs hit with something really hard. Then one [officer] flipped me over and put his knees on my chest. I felt the pain in my bones and couldn’t breathe. I tried to shout but I couldn’t breathe and couldn’t talk,” he said. 
As the man was pinned to the ground, a police officer forced open the man’s eye and shined a laser pen into it, asking, “Don’t you like to point this at people?” This was an apparent reprisal for some protesters’ use of laser pens amid the protests. The man was later hospitalized for several days with a bone fracture and internal bleeding.  
Amnesty International interviewed a different man who was arrested on another day in August in Sham Shui Po. The arresting officer repeatedly asked him to unlock his phone for inspection; angry at the refusals, the officer threatened to electrocute the man’s genitals. The man told Amnesty International he was “scared” the officer might follow through, “as the times are so crazy, I suppose anything is possible.”
While detained in a police station common room, the same man witnessed police officers force a boy to shine a laser pen into his own eye for about 20 seconds. “It seems he used the laser pen to shine at the police station,” the man recalled. “They said, ‘If you like to point the pen at us so much, why don’t you do it to yourself?’”
Amnesty International also documented a clear pattern of police officers using unnecessary and excessive force during arrests of protesters, with anti-riot police and a Special Tactical Squad (STS), commonly known as “raptors”, responsible for the worst violence. Almost every arrested person interviewed described being beaten with batons and fists during their arrest, even when they posed no resistance. 
A young woman arrested at a protest in Sheung Wan in July was one of many protesters who described being clubbed from behind with a police baton as she was running away from a police charge; she was knocked to the ground and police officers continued to beat her after her hands were zip-tied.
Similarly, a man arrested at a protest in Tsim Sha Tsui in August described retreating and then running as police charged at the assembled protesters. He told Amnesty International that “raptors” caught up to him and hit him from behind with their batons on his neck and shoulder. He said: 
“Immediately I was beaten to the ground. Three of them got on me and pressed my face hard to the ground. A second later, they kicked my face … The same three STS kept putting pressure on my body. I started to have difficulty breathing, and I felt severe pain in my left ribcage … They said to me, ‘Just shut up, stop making noise.’”
According to medical records, he was hospitalized for two days and treated for a fractured rib and other injuries. In more than 85% of cases investigated by Amnesty International (18 out of 21), the arrested person was hospitalized as a result of their beating, with three of them spending at least five days in a hospital. 
“Time and again, police officers meted out violence prior to and during arrests, even when the individual had been restrained or detained. The use of force was therefore clearly excessive, violating international human rights law,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
Amnesty International also documented multiple instances of arbitrary and unlawful arrests, as well as numerous cases where police denied or delayed access to lawyers and medical care to detainees. Providing timely access to lawyers, family members and medical professionals for persons in custody is an important safeguard against torture and other ill-treatment.
The findings come after a group of UN experts expressed alarm about the Hong Kong police’s pattern of attacks on and arrests of protesters.
“Given the pervasiveness of the abuses we found, it is clear that the Hong Kong Police Force is no longer in a position to investigate itself and remedy the widespread unlawful suppression of protesters. Amnesty International is urgently calling for an independent, impartial investigation aimed at delivering prosecutions, justice and reparation, as there is little trust in existing internal mechanisms such as the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC),” said Nicholas Bequelin.
Notes to editors 
Please see additional background and analysis related to this investigation below.
On 24 September Amnesty International will be following this field investigation with a new report analyzing the root causes of the Extradition Bill protests. 
ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS
From 5 to 12 September, Amnesty International delegates carried out 38 interviews, including with 21 people arrested in the context of protests, as well as with lawyers representing arrested persons; medical professionals who had treated arrested persons; and other first-responders working the front lines of the protests. Amnesty International reviewed photographic and video evidence of many specific events described during interviews, in addition to video, including livestream, of other protests and police actions in response to them. Delegates also observed firsthand an often indiscriminate and reckless police response to protesters, onlookers and members of the media during incidents in Mong Kok on the night of 7 September and in Causeway Bay on the night of 8 September. 
Excessive Force During Arrest
Amnesty International documented a clear pattern of police officers using excessive force while arresting people at protests. The worst abuses were typically carried out by anti-riot police and members of the Special Tactical Squad (STS), the latter referred to commonly as “raptors”. Almost every arrested person interviewed described being beaten with batons and fists during the arrest, even when they were not resisting and often already restrained. 
A young woman arrested at a protest in Sheung Wan in July described, like many others, police clubbing her from behind with a baton as she ran away from a police charge; she was knocked to the ground and police officers continued to beat her after her hands were zip-tied.   
Similarly, a man arrested at a protest in Tsim Sha Tsui in August described retreating and then running away as police charged at the assembled protesters. He told Amnesty International that STS police caught up to him and hit him from behind with their batons on his neck and shoulder. He recalled:
Immediately I was beaten to the ground. Three of them got on me and pressed my face hard to the ground. A second later, they kicked my face; everything I had on my face, including my glasses, flew off … The same three STU kept putting pressure on my body. I started to have difficulty breathing, and I felt severe pain in my left ribcage … They said to me, “Just shut up, stop making noise. You came out; you’re a hero, right?”
The man eventually spent two days in the hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured rib, among other injuries, according to medical records seen by Amnesty International.
Other arrested persons interviewed by Amnesty International had injuries including multiple fractures to an arm; a fractured bone on the face; a cracked tooth; and bleeding from one or more head wounds that required sutures. One protester fell unconscious during his arrest as a bystander yelled at the police to calm down, according to video reviewed by Amnesty International. Another protester was hit in the eye with a baton while being arrested, and then a different police officer pepper-sprayed the injured eye after the man was restrained. In most documented cases, arrested persons provided photographs, video evidence, and/or hospital papers to corroborate the reported injuries. 
Of the 21 arrested persons interviewed, 18 were admitted to a hospital either for injuries or illness related to their arrest and detention. (Amnesty International did not collect data on the overall rate of hospitalization and was specifically investigating incidents of police abuse, and therefore draws no inference about the overall rate of serious injury among those arrested). Most spent about one or two days in the hospital. Five spent three or more days, including three who spent at least five days. Medical staff independently described to Amnesty International treating many of the same injuries that arrested persons had described in interviews.
Police have had a reasonable basis to arrest some protesters, including for throwing bricks, bottles and Molotov cocktails at police; for property damage; and, in at least a few instances, for assaulting a police officer. But under international human rights law and standards, police are permitted to only use force where absolutely necessary and proportionate to the legitimate objective they are trying to achieve. The use of force should be aimed at stopping violence, while minimizing injury and preserving the right to life.
In the cases described above, police officers instead caused physical injury before, during and after arrests. The use of force prior to and during arrest in many cases amounted to excessive use of force, violating international human rights law. The use of beatings and pepper spray on individuals who are already in custody amounts to torture and other ill-treatment. Arrested persons, lawyers, medical personnel and other witnesses to protests all said the level of police violence has worsened steadily since the mass protests began in June; that deterioration is likewise borne out by a review of video evidence. 
Cases of Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment in Detention
Most of the arrested persons interviewed by Amnesty International said that, after the initial beating before or during the period of arrest, the police did not commit further physical violence against them or against others with whom they were held. In a few cases, however, police abuse continued in detention, including in police vehicles, police stations and other holding facilities. Several such cases amount to torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, absolutely forbidden under international law. 
A man detained at a police station following his arrest at a protest in the New Territories in August told Amnesty International that after he refused to answer a police intake question, several officers took him to another room. There, they beat him severely and threatened to break his hands if he tried to cover himself where they were striking. He recalled:
I felt my legs hit with something really hard. Then one flipped me over and put his knees on my chest. I felt the pain in my bones and couldn’t breathe. I tried to shout but I couldn’t breathe and couldn’t talk.
As the man was pinned to the ground, a police officer then used his fingers to force open the man’s eye and shine a laser pen into it, asking, “Don’t you like to point this at people?” The man was later hospitalized for several days with a bone fracture and internal bleeding. 
Amnesty International interviewed a different man who was arrested on another day in August in in Sham Shui Po. The arresting officer requested repeatedly that the man unlock his phone for inspection; angry at the refusals, the officer threatened to electrocute the man’s genitals. The man told Amnesty International he was “scared” the officer might follow through, “as the times are so crazy, I suppose anything is possible.”
Detained in a police station common room, the same man witnessed police officers force a boy to shine a laser pen into his own eye for about 20 seconds. “It seems he used the laser pen to shine at the police station,” the man recalled. “They said, ‘If you like to point the pen at us so much, why don’t you do it to yourself?’”
Two people described separate incidents in which they were zip-tied and detained on the street in a small group. They said they had to inhale tear gas for an extended period, as police officers had removed their masks during the arrest and other police nearby continued to fire tear gas indiscriminately at other protesters. In another case, an arrested person said he requested to go to the hospital for an arm injury suffered during the arrest. A police officer grabbed hard where the man indicated pain, saying, “Is this the spot?” 
Lawyers interviewed by Amnesty International provided a similar account of the situation, saying that while most of their clients arrested at protests had not been physically mistreated after the initial arrest, there were exceptions. Two lawyers each mentioned a client, separate from those referenced above, whom police officers had beaten in a station severely enough that the person was hospitalized for several days. 
In several instances, as in the first case described above, police officers appear to have inflicted ill-treatment in detention as punishment for talking back or for being perceived as particularly uncooperative.
Body Searches
In one incident documented by Amnesty International, a female police officer forced a woman to strip completely and go through a full body search after she talked back to the officer; the officer mocked and belittled the woman. 
The vast majority of arrested persons interviewed by Amnesty International had not had to go through a comparable search during the same phase of their detention, and several criminal lawyers in Hong Kong described such a strip search as inconsistent with procedure. The woman forced to go through the strip search felt degraded and continued, weeks later, to suffer distress. 
Body searches affect the right to privacy and the inherent dignity of the person and therefore should not be carried out lightly by law enforcement officials. Police should only carry out body searches professionally, by a person of the same sex and in the least intrusive manner possible, thus limiting as far as possible the inherently humiliating character of the search.
Delayed Access to Medical Care
Despite the serious injuries some arrested persons have suffered, police often denied prompt access to medical care. Among those interviewed by Amnesty International, it was common for police to delay calling or securing an ambulance until five to 10 hours after the injury and after the person first requested to go to a hospital.
In general, arrested persons described police officers telling them that they needed to go through processing – including fingerprinting, being photographed and having a statement taken – before going to the hospital. Police appeared to use people’s need for medical care to pressure them into giving a statement without a lawyer present, as discussed more below. 
One man arrested at a protest in Causeway Bay in August recalled bleeding from his nose and mouth, as a result of being beaten during his arrest, as police held him in a detention facility. He told Amnesty International, “I was spitting blood, constantly. They said, ‘If you help me take the statement quickly, you can go [to the hospital].’ … Four or five hours later, after I assisted their work, I was taken.” He spent two days in the hospital. 
Another man, who ultimately spent more than a week in the hospital for multiple injuries to his face and body sustained during his arrest, was held in a police station for around seven or eight hours before being transferred to a hospital. He, too, was first required to give a statement to police. He said the police would not let him wipe off blood and dirt from his buttocks, a result of several officers dragging him across pavement during his arrest, as another officer struck the man with a baton.  
In the most egregious such case documented by Amnesty International, a man suffered multiple fractures to his arm during his arrest in August. He immediately asked to be taken to the hospital, but it was more than five hours later before police did so – only after they had transported him for more than an hour to a detention facility and processed him. 
During the arrest, police officers zip-tied the man’s hands behind his back. “It was extremely painful,” he recalled. “I told them I had broken my arm, but they didn’t bother.” He remained zip-tied for several hours, as he complained of intense pain. Two medical professionals told Amnesty International that the nature of the injury is extremely severe and rare, and possible only from severe and intense beating. 
Denying or unreasonably delaying prompt and adequate medical care to a person who is ill or seriously injured is a clear violation of a person’s right to health. In some cases, the denial of medical care itself may amount to torture and other forms of ill-treatment, especially if delayed or denied for the purposes of extracting a statement or confession from the injured detainee.
In a few cases documented by Amnesty International, police officers did send arrested persons who were injured or ill to the hospital prior to taking them to detention and processing them – demonstrating the police can do so when willing. As with other abuses, delays in accessing medical care appear to be worsening, as the police grow more frustrated and resort to increasing violence
Finally, many arrested protesters described police officers refusing to leave them alone when speaking with medical staff about their pain and what happened. Due to the lack of privacy, several told Amnesty International that they had lied to doctors about what caused their injuries – ascribing serious injuries to falling rather than to police beatings, for example – because they were afraid of repercussions for discussing police abuse in front of officers. 
Delayed Access to Counsel
In cases of arrest linked to the protests, the police often delay or deny people’s access to counsel. Similar to medical care, the delays tend to range from several hours up to half a day, despite repeated requests from arrested persons to see or call a lawyer – and repeated requests from lawyers at places of detention to have access to those arrested.  
Arrested protesters almost all told Amnesty International that they requested to contact a lawyer immediately upon arrest. They said police ignored the requests, telling the person to wait or that it would happen later, after the initial processing. At times, police officers gave other excuses. For example, several people held on 11 and 12 August at the San Uk Lang detention facility near the border with mainland China independently recalled police officers there saying they could not contact a lawyer because there was no phone network. 
One person held at North Point police station after being arrested at a protest in August said he repeatedly asked to call a lawyer. He said a police officer told him the phone was busy, even though the arrested person could see the phone and that no one was using it. He ultimately was not able to see a lawyer until around 12 hours after his arrest – eight hours after his request by the phone, and after police took a statement and did a search of his home.
Lawyers interviewed by Amnesty International similarly described delayed access to arrested persons. They said the delays are fundamentally different from how the criminal justice system in Hong Kong normally works when people are arrested for crimes, including violent crimes. Several believed the police’s aim was to delay access to counsel until after taking an arrested person’s statement and that police officers were employing different strategies to achieve that. 
Several lawyers said they were spending hours driving around Hong Kong trying to find where arrested persons were taken on any given night, as they often are not being detained in the nearest police station. The police force is stretched thin by the scale of the protests and, on many nights, the number of people arrested in a given location is beyond the normal holding capacity of one police station. But while that might justify detaining people in sites other than the police station nearest to the arrest, lawyers said the real problem is that the police are at times not forthcoming with information about where a detainee is, even when the lawyer calls or goes to a police station. 
Two lawyers also said that, as of late July and August, the police have taken to declaring a police station an “operations area” or under “station defence”. They said the designation often lasts for three hours and means no one – including lawyers – is allowed in, even when people are detained there. While there may be circumstances in which restricting the public’s access to a police station is warranted – many protests in August and September have taken place outside police stations and include some use of violence by protesters – it cannot be used as a ploy to deny people’s right to counsel. The police could, for example, continue granting access to a lawyer during such periods; take arrested persons to other stations not under restriction and inform counsel; or not ask further questions of a detainee once he or she has requested counsel, no matter how long “station defence” continues. 
Access to lawyers is an important safeguard for many human rights, such as the right to a fair trial and ensuring the detainee’s rights are respected in custody, including the right to access medical care when needed as well as protection from coerced confessions and torture and other ill-treatment. Denial of this right amounts to incommunicado detention and is in itself a form of ill-treatment. Lawyers and family members of detained persons are entitled to be promptly informed of where the detained person is being held and lawyers and independent medical professionals should have unrestricted access to detainees.
Policing Assemblies and Arbitrary Arrests
The vast majority of individuals who have participated in the Hong Kong protests have acted peacefully, and the police must find ways of facilitating the assembly for those who want to assemble peacefully, while stopping those who engage in violence. The Hong Kong police may have a legitimate and lawful basis to arrest individuals who are engaging in violence toward others, including police officers, or who are damaging or destroying property. No person should be arrested solely for exercising rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression. In cases where there are grounds to arrest people engaging in violence, law enforcement officials must only use such force as is necessary, reasonable and proportionate.
Local residents and curious bystanders who are neither participating in a protest nor engaging in any violence have often been caught up in the police response in a given area. At protests on 7 and 8 September that Amnesty International monitored, normal life continued less than a block from a heavy police presence in response to protests. Nearly 100 journalists, first-aid providers and other self-identified responders, all wearing distinctive bright yellow vests, stood near the “frontline”. They often greatly outnumbered the protesters engaging the police. In several instances, no protesters appeared present, only police and the marked observers. When the police left the scene, normal life immediately resumed.
When violence or property damage has occurred, the police have responded with use of force that has been at times excessive and indiscriminate. For example, Amnesty researchers directly observed police use pepper spray and fire “pepper balls” at journalists wearing identifying badges and fire tear gas grenades into largely empty streets where no protesters were present. The tear gas clouds drifted into areas with large concentrations of pedestrians. Even when tear gas is deployed against protesters, some of who might be engaging in violence, such tactics are indiscriminate and often affect people with no connection to the protests. In another observed case, the police raised a warning flag, indicating they would fire tear gas, after already launching the tear gas grenades.
The use of these indiscriminate, less lethal weapons may be counter-productive if the aim is to disperse a crowd or de-escalate violence. According to the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms, the deployment of non-lethal incapacitating weapons should be carefully evaluated in order to minimize the risk of endangering uninvolved persons, and the use of such weapons should be carefully controlled. This principle needs to be taken into account when authorities are determining what equipment should be used in public assemblies that may affect all persons in an area, including for the purpose of dispersing an assembly. Police also have a responsibility to engage in dialogue and to communicate with protesters, with an aim to facilitate peaceful assemblies and to minimize the use of force.
Amnesty International interviewed two young women arrested arbitrarily in separate incidents in August when out to get food. In another incident in August, a young man went into a public bathroom while out with his girlfriend; when he emerged, anti-riot police were nearby. They arrested and beat him when he ran out of fear. He said he felt he was treated better than others detained at the police station because he was wearing white – not the all-black that many protesters have taken to wearing, including after several suicides and other deaths during the time of the protest movement.
Most of the arrested people interviewed by Amnesty International did not know what behaviour they were engaging in that was considered suspicious or criminal at the time of arrest.
Arbitrary detention is prohibited in all circumstances. Detention is arbitrary when individuals are deprived of their liberty without a clear basis in law; where persons are detained solely for the peaceful exercise of certain human rights such as freedom of expression or association; or in cases of sufficiently serious violations of the right to fair trial.
Law enforcement officials often have discretion whether to intervene in breaches of minor provisions of the law. This discretion needs to be applied carefully when policing assemblies. If police take action against certain minor offences, or arbitrarily detain persons not committing offences, it might provoke counter-reaction on behalf of individuals concerned and/or the rest of the public and ultimately contribute to a rapidly escalating and uncontrollable reaction by participants. The most appropriate approach might therefore be not to act immediately against the offender, possibly while taking measures that might allow for later prosecution of offences. At the same time, some minor offences, such as burning dustbins, may lead to agitation of the participants and provoke other people to do something similar or worse. Striking the right balance between enforcing the law and preventing a deterioration of public order presents an important challenge to the police.

The 1990 confrontation triggered by planned expansion of a golf course on a sacred site within the Nation’s ancestral territory was a watershed moment in Canadian history, focusing long overdue attention on the profound injustice at the heart of Canada’s persistent failure to recognize and uphold Indigenous land rights.
Yet almost three decades later, dispute ongoing negotiations between the federal government and the colonial created, band council Chief and Council, the underlying land question remains unresolved. This has resulted in ongoing tension, frustration and anxiety over the fact that municipal officials and private developers continue to hold the power to decide the future of lands crucial to the history and future of Kanehsatà:ke.
On the 29th anniversary of the confrontation, the traditional government – Rotinonhseshá:ka ne Kanehsatà:ke (People of the Longhouse) — issued a public call for a halt to development on the ancestral land, unless free, prior and informed consent is given.
This statement, which went largely unreported in Canadian media, goes to the heart of the matter.
Canadian law recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to manage and benefit from their ancestral lands and that this right was not extinguished by Canada’s assertion of assumed sovereignty. The federal government acknowledges an obligation to provide redress for the long history of theft and erosion of Indigenous lands.
However the processes set up by the federal government to address these historic injustices have been undermined by the government’s entrenched negotiating position of trying to minimize its own obligations. In fact, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has concluded that the options to obtain redress for violations of Indigenous land rights in Canada are so lengthy and adversarial that they do not meet international standards for access to justice.
To make matters worse, federal and provincial government too often take a “business as usual approach” to private development on the disputed lands even as efforts to restore Indigenous control wind their way through the claim processes or the courts. The fact that governments can largely ignore Indigenous interests pending final resolution of land disputes actually creates a disincentive for a timely settlement.
The Trudeau government promised to change all that.
Prime Minister Trudeau told the United Nations General Assembly that Canada would “strictly adhere” to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The published “Principles Respecting the Government of Canada’s Relationship with Indigenous Peoples” states that “all relations with Indigenous peoples need to be based on the recognition and implementation of their right to self-determination”.
Whatever party forms the federal government after the upcoming election, these promises need to be put into practice. And justice for the people of Kanehsatà:ke must, finally, be a real priority.
The Longhouse reports that government officials have told them that the federal government does not have the jurisdiction to provide interim protection for their ancestral lands as this is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. This is not an adequate response.
Consistent with Canadian and international law, the federal government has a responsibility to ensure that the rights of the Kanien’kehá:ka people of Kanehsatà:ke are rigorously protected in respect to any development decisions until final agreements are reached to resolve the land dispute. The federal government must acknowledge this responsibility and take decisive and constructive action to engage with all rights holders to ensure these rights are recognized and protected.
It is also crucial that the federal government end its practice of routinely excluding the traditional Longhouse government – the Rotinonhseshá:ka of Kanehsatà:ke, of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation — in its engagement with the long standing Kanehsatà:ke land dispute.
The federal government’s forcible overthrow of traditional Indigenous government structures and imposition of elected band councils under the Indian Act in 9124 is one of the defining characteristics of Canada’s historic assault on Indigenous self-determination and identity. When the federal government now refuses to engage with traditional governance structures it is manipulating and benefiting from the very divisions it created.
A clear, unequivocal commitment to human rights, including implementation of the interim land protections called for by the Rotinonhseshá:ka of Kanehsatà:ke, would allow any discussion to conducted in an atmosphere of peace and respect. Canada must uphold its human rights obligations and bring justice to the Kanien’kehá:ka of Kanehsatà:ke.
Update: On October 11, 2019 a resident of Kanehsatake began a hunger strike in support of the struggle to fight land fraud dispossession and threats to their security.

Climate change activist Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement of school-children have been honoured with Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award for 2019. 
 
The awards ceremony took place in Washington D.C., USA, while further events were held in cities around the world, honouring Fridays for Future activists who represent the movement. 
Upon receiving the award, Greta Thunberg said: 
“This award is for all of those millions of people, young people, around the world who together make up the movement called Fridays for Future. All these fearless youth, fighting for their future. A future they should be able to take for granted. But as it looks now, they cannot. 
“We, who together are the movement Fridays for Future, we are fighting for our lives. But not only that, we are also fighting for our future children and grandchildren, for future generations, for every single living being on earth, whose biosphere we share, whose biosphere we are stealing, whose biosphere we are ruining. We are fighting for everyone.” 
“Activism works. So, what I’m telling you to do now, is to act. Because no one is too small to make a difference. I’m urging all of you to take part in the global climate strikes on September 20th and September 27th.” 
 
The Ambassador of Conscience Award is Amnesty International’s highest honour, celebrating people who have shown unique leadership and courage in standing up for human rights – people who have acted on their conscience and used their talents to inspire others. 
Amnesty International chose to give the 2019 award to Greta because of her efforts to raise awareness of the climate crisis. Her decision to miss school every Friday starting in August 2018 and instead protest outside the Swedish parliament until it took more serious action to tackle the climate emergency kicked off the Fridays for Future movement. It has since mobilized more than one million young people from all over the world.  
This award was presented ahead of the Peoples’ Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival Summit, co-organized by Amnesty International. The event will welcome a considerable number of youth leaders and aims to galvanize the human rights community to urgently scale-up its efforts on climate justice. And with youth activists from 115 countries planning to stage climate protests from September 20-27, these young leaders aren’t about to let up the pressure. 
 
“Millions of people are already suffering the catastrophic effects of disasters whose impacts have been made far worse by climate change. It is young people like Greta and those involved in the Fridays for Future school climate strike movement, who are proving that it is possible to change our ways,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo. 
“These young leaders have laid down the challenge. In an apathetic world drifting towards calamity, they have stood up as our collective conscience and said, ‘enough is enough’. They have demanded that we stop ignoring the magnitude of the crisis and stop making excuses, and instead start mobilizing. Now it’s time for every single one of us to follow them. A mass movement is needed if we want to force governments and corporations into long-overdue action.” 
The Ambassador of Conscience Award was founded in 2002 to celebrate individuals and groups who have furthered the cause of human rights by acting on their conscience, confronting injustice and using their talents to inspire others. Previous awardees include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, Harry Belafonte, Ai Weiwei, the Youth Groups of West and Central Africa, Angélique Kidjo, the Indigenous rights movement in Canada, Alicia Keys and Colin Kaepernick.

Responding to news that Google has agreed to pay a record US$170 million to settle a complaint filed by US regulators, alleging that Google illegally harvested personal data of children on its YouTube platform, Joe Westby, Big Data and AI Researcher at Amnesty Tech, said: 
“Today’s record fine exposes the rotten core at the heart of Google’s business model, which relies on the harvesting and monetisation of personal data, in brazen contempt for privacy. A major problem is that online advertising practices are complex and secretive, so people are not able to give meaningful consent as to how their personal data is used.  
“Big Tech is profiting by abusing an individual’s right to privacy. We’ve previously seen it with Facebook and now Google, with both embroiled in revelations of targeting of children and reports of secretive hidden websites to harvest data. This is a systemic problem with surveillance-driven Big Tech firms, and companies have got away with it for too long. 
“Today’s fines, while welcome, are a drop in the ocean for a company that made US$136 billion in revenue in 2018. There needs to be tougher efforts by governments to address the underlying human rights risks posed by such large-scale corporate surveillance.” 
Background 
On Wednesday, US regulators agreed a settlement with Google of US$170 million and ordered changes to privacy on YouTube, after the tech giant was found to have harvested personal information from children without their parents’ consent. 
In response to the FTC settlement, YouTube’s CEO stated the company will now limit data collection and use for children’s content on the platform, and stop serving personalised advertising on such content. 
The fine came on the same day the firm was accused of using secret hidden websites to harvest personal information, according to a report in the Financial Times. 
In response to the Financial Times report, a spokesperson for Google said, “We do not serve personalised ads or send bid requests to bidders without user consent.” The spokesperson also said that Google is co-operating with investigations in Ireland and the UK into its advertising business. 
States have an obligation to protect human rights in the context of corporate activities, including through regulation and oversight. All companies have a responsibility to respect human rights throughout their operations. This means that they must avoid causing or contributing to human rights abuses and take steps to identify and address human rights risks in their operations.

Gathered for the Peoples’ Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival, their goal is to unleash new power, energy, and resources to supercharge a connected, diverse, and action-oriented mass movement to overcome the climate crisis, by putting people and human rights at the core of  its solutions.
These leaders and their groups seek to put pressure on governments and corporations to ramp up climate commitments. Among other initiatives, they plan to pursue more concerted climate litigation efforts, target the financial sector’s funding of fossil fuels, make more effective use of human rights accountability mechanisms, and coordinate more mass mobilization campaigns at national and regional levels. They also expect to agree on the implementation of a set of related action plans in the following months.
The Peoples’ Summit was organized by the United Nations Human Rights Office, Greenpeace International, Amnesty International, Center for International Environmental Law, Wallace Global Fund, and the New York University School of Law Center for Human Rights and Global Justice. The event is taking place on September 18 and 19, ahead of the United Nations Secretary General’s Climate Action Summit.
Craig Mokhiber, New York Office Director at the United Nations Human Rights Office, said:
“For those on the frontlines, climate change is already eroding the rights to food, water and sanitation, decent shelter, health, personal security, and even life itself. Many on small island states, in coastal communities, and in areas subject to creeping desertification are watching their right to self-determination slip away. Large-scale climate displacement threatens to force millions to undertake journeys of vulnerability and uncertainty. Ultimately, the adverse effects of climate change tear at the very fabric of human society. Every country must take urgent and meaningful action to address this threat to human rights. By bringing together the many strands of the climate justice movement, we seek to mobilize transformative, rights-based and inclusive climate action now.”
Jennifer Morgan, International Executive Director at Greenpeace International, said:
“The climate crisis is a human rights crisis. The human consequences of extreme weather disasters can be staggering, as we can see by the profound devastation and destruction left in the wake of Hurricane Dorian.
This declaration marks a new era of climate activism. Lead by the youth and together with our allies, we will all take action and confront those responsible. Weak governments and toxic corporate power will have nowhere to hide as we put people at the center of our demands, and seek climate justice for the communities least responsible but most vulnerable to this climate emergency.”
Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General at Amnesty International, said:
“The world’s most urgent struggle needs the power and diversity that the global people’s movement for human rights can bring. We come with key constituencies, energy, and skills to the fight for climate justice. But we have been punching way below our weight so far. 
 “Amnesty intends to do its part to change this. We want the Summit to help unleash the potential of the global human rights movement to protect present and future generations. United, we win.”
Carroll Muffett, President and CEO at the Center for International Environmental Law, said:
“The costs of continued inaction in the face of the climate crisis are measured in human rights, human livelihoods, and human lives. As Hurricane Dorian reminds us all too painfully, those costs are real and they are rising. Today’s declaration reflects a common commitment within the human rights community to put human rights at the center of the climate crisis, to phase out the fossil fuels that are driving that crisis, and to hold governments and companies accountable when they stand in the way.”
Ellen Dorsey, Executive Director at Wallace Global Fund, said:
“The human rights sector and movements from around the world are bringing new resources, a powerful global constituency of supporters, and unique human rights advocacy to the climate movement, calling for actions by governments and corporations commensurate with the scale and rapid pace of climate change to ensure the survival of humanity.”
Philip Alston, Center for Human Rights and Global Justice Chair at New York University School of Law, said:
“Climate change has been called a ‘false alarm’, but it is an alarm that will end up killing many of our children, and at least some of us. We read daily about large numbers of people dying of heat exposure, being drowned in floods or burned in wildfires, or just forced to flee their homes, but we fool ourselves that it won’t happen to us. While many of us are distracted on social media or determined to get on with normal life, the future disasters flowing from climate change are moving from possibilities to certainties. Human rights as we know them will be rendered increasingly meaningless unless we act immediately.”

“In the words of Mr Guterres himself, human rights are universal regardless of race, beliefs or location. We are asking him to apply that principle to the one million Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims who continue to be arbitrarily detained by the Chinese authorities in so-called ‘political education camps’ in Xinjiang,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“Mr Guterres’ private diplomacy on this issue is clearly not working. He must immediately speak out publicly against the persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang or he will forever be remembered for failing hundreds of thousands of people in this crucial moment.”
On Monday, Amnesty International together with the International Federation for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists and the World Uyghur Congress, wrote to Guterres urging him to speak out against the Chinese government.
The coalition’s letter calls on Guterres to support the creation of a fact-finding mission to assess the scale and nature of crimes under international law and human rights violations in Xinjiang, and to meet with representatives from the Uyghur community. It also urges the UN Head to refrain from praising, without qualification, Beijing’s ‘Belt and Road’ investment initiative, in which Xinjiang is a centerpiece.
“There are many causes for serious concern about the state of human rights in China, but the egregious scale and severity of the situation in Xinjiang demands urgent global attention as more and more predominantly Muslim minorities are unlawfully detained,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“The mere fact that we are forced to make a public call on the UN Secretary-General to speak out about an abuse of this magnitude is a damning indictment of his leadership.”
Since 2017 the Chinese authorities has overseen an intensifying campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang province, northwest China.
Those sent to detention camps are not put on trial, have no access to lawyers or right to challenge the decision.
The Chinese authorities claim their campaign of unlawful detention in Xinjiang is a necessary measure to ‘counter terrorism’.

Letter of thanks written by Alejandra for all the support on her case. It reads; “Hello everyone, My name is Alejandra. Thanks for all the support I received and that our voice was heard, I finally have the freedom that I desired so much. Thanks to all the supporters that worked long days so that all of this was possible. I´d like to thank all the organizations that united to make all this possible, finally my chains have been broken. Thanks to God, I thank my lawyer who fought so hard to achieve my dream. Thank you to all the people who marched to tell the government that they were committing a great injustice by detaining me. Thanks be to God because for Him there is nothing impossible. Thank you to all my friends for helping me stay calm and survive my detention. I´m grateful that life gave me this great gift of freedom. I love you all and send my blessings. Thank you very much.” 
“Through letters of support, people from around the world gave me the strength to continue in this struggle that was so hard for me. I’m here to keep fighting” said Alejandra in response to advocacy efforts on her behalf. 
Denise Bell, researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA said: “People have the right to seek safety from persecution. There was no reason why Alejandra should have been locked up for seeking protection. Alejandra’s story is not an isolated case, there are many more trans people seeking asylum in the United States stuck waiting for months in detention centers where they are at risk of ill-treatment because of their gender identity and medical needs. It is cruel and unnecessary for U.S. immigration authorities to detain people fleeing to the U.S. in search of safety from persecution and violence, including brave women like Alejandra.” 
Alejandra was detained at the Cibola County Correctional Center in New Mexico for twenty months, where she reported inadequate and unresponsive medical care. Authorities unfairly denied her requests for parole five times and at one point, Alejandra faced imminent deportation. In August 2019, Alejandra’s lawyers from the National Immigrant Justice Center filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus on Alejandra’s behalf, arguing that her prolonged detention violated due process protections against indefinite detention under the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment. In response to the habeas, Alejandra was released by ICE. 
Tania Linares Garcia, senior attorney with NIJC’s LGBTQ Immigrant Rights Initiative said: “People who flee persecution have a right to seek asylum and no one should have to endure abuse while they pursue that right. While we celebrate that Alejandra now is free, we continue to fight for other transgender women who remain in ICE custody, including our client Kelly* who has been detained for over two years.” 
Amnesty International is calling for a fair and full hearing and assessment of Alejandra’s asylum claim, as all people seeking safety in the United States should receive. Amnesty International remains gravely concerned that Alejandra’s life is at great risk if she is denied protection and returned to El Salvador. Amnesty International maintains that transgender and all asylum seekers must be protected at all costs their forcible return. What’s more, those seeking protection should never be detained based solely on their migration status. 
Background 
Alejandra fought for transgender rights for more than a decade in El Salvador. She was forced to flee after repeated attacks by a criminal gang, as well as abuses by the Salvadoran military. Alejandra was sexually assaulted by both the gang and military personnel because of her transgender identity.

This request, previously...","Today, as Canada formally accedes to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), a coalition of Canadian civil society organizations (CSOs) are once again calling on the Government of Canada to definitively end the export of Light Armored Vehicles (LAV) to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
This request, previously expressed in two open letters addressed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, asks Canada to honour the spirit and intent of the ATT, which is now legally binding under international law. University de Montréal law professor Daniel Turp has added his voice to those of the coalition’s member organizations, calling on the Government of Canada to terminate these exports to the Saudi Kingdom. If the transfers continue, he intends to personally take legal action. While accession to the ATT is a positive step, it must be supported by decisive action.
WAR CRIMES
As numerous credible media reports have suggested, Canadian military equipment – including light armoured vehicles – has been used in the war currently ravaging Yemen and decimating its population. The most recent report on this conflict, prepared by the United Nations Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, confirms that over the past five years, this conflict has given rise to a multitude of war crimes. Air strikes, indiscriminate shelling, acts of torture and sexual violence are only some of the many violations suffered by Yemen’s civilian population on a daily basis.
In light of these alarming findings, Canada must act rapidly to avoid fuelling, in any way whatsoever, this devastating conflict and prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people. In this recent report, the UN Experts challenged the international community, warning that States funnelling arms to the parties to the conflict may be held accountable for their role in aiding or abetting the commission of human rights violations. 
“Amnesty International welcomes Canada’s accession to the Arms Trade Treaty, an important international legal instrument which has the potential to curb the excesses of the unbridled global trade in arms and weapons that has, for too long, devastated civilian populations around the globe. Canada’s continued export of Light Armoured Vehicles to Saudi Arabia is but one area in which its compliance with the treaty already raises serious questions. The spirit and the letter of the ATT make it incumbent upon the Government of Canada to fully examine the risks that Canadian arms exports could be used to commit serious violations of international human rights or international humanitarian law. In light of the conflict in Yemen, the Saudi LAV deal is an obvious place to start.” – Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, Amnesty International Canada.
	  
“The war in Yemen has set the country’s development back by two decades, and has had a devastating impact on women and children. The notion that Canada is fuelling such a deadly conflict because of economic imperatives is simply intolerable.” Anne Duhamel, Director of Policy and Campaigns, Oxfam-Québec. 
“Canada’s accession to the Arms Trade Treaty comes at a time when ever more dire news of the armed conflict in Yemen continues to emerge. Canada must seize this opportunity to break from the status quo, and set the highest requirements regarding the export of arms and military equipment.” – Thomas Woodley, Executive Director, Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East. 
“The incompatibility of Canada’s military exports to Saudi Arabia with national and international military export controls has long been apparent; yet Ottawa has dismissed every warning. Accession to the Arms Trade Treaty is a good first step, but it is not enough. With every arms shipment to Saudi Arabia, our country’s humanitarian credentials continue to crumble.” – Cesar Jaramillo, Executive Director, Project Ploughshares. 
UNDERMINING INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY
It is not just that there is a new legal regime in place with “hard legal limits” on the discretion of the Foreign Minister, obligating her to deny an arms export permit where there is a substantial risk of the weapons being used to cause or to facilitate serious human rights abuses. There is an additional legal obligation at issue. 
“Now that there is a UN-led peace process underway, that is being actively undermined by the Saudi-led coalition and other parties to the conflict, continued supply of weapons to any of the parties to the conflict not only prolongs the conflict and the suffering of innocent civilians as explicitly observed by the UN Expert Group, but it also unequivocally undermines regional security.” – Peggy Mason, President of the Rideau Institute. 
ELEVEN MONTHS – WHY?
Eleven months ago, the Government of Canada announced its decision to review military export permits to Saudi Arabia, during which time no new export permits would be approved. Since then, no news regarding progress on this review has been reported. As a State Party to the ATT and a nation claiming to be respectful of international rights and international treaty obligations, Canada must now assume its responsibilities and make its decision known.
Canada must further contribute to international efforts to end the plight of Yemenis and follow the lead set by the many countries which have elected to suspend their arms exports to Saudi Arabia. For its part, the United States Congress has repeatedly voted in favour of forbidding arms exports to Saudi Arabia.
All Canadians deserve to know their current government’s position on this issue, which is a matter of basic respect for human life. For their part, the Yemeni people want to believe in a future without the looming threat of attacks, starvation as a tactic of war and other unspeakable suffering.
“Today, as the Arms Trade Treaty comes into force in Canada, I have sent a formal notice to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs requesting that she cancel permits to export Light Armoured Vehicles (LAV) to Saudi Arabia,” stated Professor Daniel Turp of Université de Montréal. Should this notice be ignored, Professor Turp intends to go before the courts again; “Bill C-47 amendments to the Export and Import Permits Act enabling accession to the Arms Trade Treaty, provides new grounds for a law suit and a reminder that as of today, the Government of Canada must cancel all arms licenses.”

Ongoing adverse impacts include denial of Indigenous systems of governance, jurisdiction and laws; dispossession of lands, territories and resources; the ongoing tragedy of Indigenous lives brutally cut short; essential opportunities denied to Indigenous children and youth; and the lack of adequate financial and other assistance to maintain and revitalize Indigenous cultures, traditions and languages in the face of continued threats.
All these bodies have called on federal and other governments to heal the harm and build positive relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. Canada must act now to fully safeguard and implement the fundamental human rights and protections affirmed in the United Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
In the last session of Parliament, Senate filibustering prevented the passage of Bill C-262, a private member’s Bill that would have established a legislative framework to guide the work of implementing the Declaration. This was despite the fact that Bill C-262 had been debated and adopted by the House of Commons in 2018 and that all parties in the House had subsequently joined in a unanimous, non-partisan motion calling on the Senate to pass Bill C-262 into law.
While our Nations and organizations were profoundly disappointed that the opportunity to adopt this crucial legislation was so cavalierly squandered, an important foundation has been established. The next session of Parliament must build on this foundation by prioritizing the earliest possible adoption of government legislation that fully reflects or exceeds Bill C-262. Key elements would include: 
Repudiation of colonial laws, policies and doctrines.
A commitment to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples in every aspect of implementation of the Declaration.
A process to reform federal laws, policies and regulations to ensure they meet or exceed the minimum standards set out in the Declaration.
A commitment to develop a national action plan for collaborative implementation of the Declaration’s provisions.
A requirement for regular reporting to Parliament so that there is transparency and accountability for the progress made. 
The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly 12 years ago, on September 13, 2007. The Declaration’s provisions reflect the way that existing human rights protections, including legally binding international treaties, have been interpreted and applied by international and regional human rights bodies. In other words, Canada’s obligation to respect, protect and fulfill the rights affirmed in the Declaration is well-established and concrete measures to implement these provisions are long overdue.
The Declaration is not abstract or merely aspirational. It affirms the minimum standards urgently needed to address and heal the harms inflicted on Indigenous peoples by a long history of racist and discriminatory laws, policies, and practices.
2019 is the International Year of Indigenous Languages. In this important year, we can look to the Declaration for guidance on language rights:
Article 13 affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to “revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, language, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places and persons.” Article 14 states that “Indigenous peoples have the right to establish and control their educational systems and institutions providing education in their own languages, in a manner appropriate to their cultural methods of teaching and learning.” The Declaration also calls on states to take effective measures, including through funding and other assistance, to ensure the “full realization” of these rights.
This is merely one example of using the Declaration effectively to guide the promotion and protection of Indigenous peoples’ human rights.
Accordingly, our Nations and Organizations are calling on all candidates in the federal election to commit to: 
Supporting the earliest possible adoption of a federal legislative framework for implementation of the Declaration that, at a minimum, provides the essential implementation measures set out in C-262
Advocating for adequate, sustained funding for Indigenous peoples’ organizations, including cultural centres working at the community level, to support, reclaim, revitalize and maintain Indigenous languages.

The caravan included adults, youth, and children who were inspired to meet with land and water defenders fighting to protect the environment and to share our solidarity and gratitude for their work on all our behalf.  
On August 1st, we visited with Sto:lo water defenders on Cheam First Nation lands on the banks of the Fraser River in BC’s Lower Mainland. Rick and June Quipp spoke to our delegation about the stressors affecting migrating salmon, such as deforestation from logging pine beetle killed wood, climate heating which raises the temperature of the river, and commercial over-fishing. They talked about how their community sent precious cans of salmon to Indigenous communities who were prevented by the disaster from carrying out their annual fish harvest. Salmon is a crucial part of a healthy diet in Indigenous communities around Quesnel Lake. [insert photo of June Quipp or Rick Quipp] 
We spent that night in Kamloops, BC, in the southern Secwepemc territory, and met with Amnesty activists who had travelled from Kelowna to share their solidarity with those harmed by the disaster and a beautiful handpainted banner. [photo of banner] 
The following day, the caravan travelled up to Blue River, near Wells Grey Provincial Park, to meet with the Tiny House Warriors and learn about their unique campaign to draw attention to their opposition to the TransMountain Pipeline. The group has built a tiny house village across the road from the proposed site of a worker camp to highlight theways in which resource development increases violence against Indigenous women and girls.  
The families that make up the Tiny House Warriors village have been subjected to despicable online attacks and threats for their stance on the TransMountain pipeline. Fears for their safety are growing and the risks they face have increased since the Alberta government announced it would fund a ‘war room’ to expose environmentalists as ‘liars’ who receive foreign funding aimed at destroying Canada’s own oil and gas industry. In an open letter, Amnesty International called on Premier Jason Kenney to abandon this strategy and ensure environmental defenders are able to freely express their views without fear of harm or human rights abuse.  
We are concerned about the well-being of environmental human rights defenders who are subjected to on-line and in person abuse because they oppose Canadian extractives industries. Canada must protect the rights of Indigenous and environmental human rights defenders to freedom of expression. 
On the evening of August 2, the caravan arrived in Williams Lake amidst a major rainstorm. We were unable to pitch our tents that night, but were all taken in by a good Samaritan. After a delicious breakfast the following morning, we left for the tiny, picturesque community of Mitchell Bay on Quesnel Lake where we met with the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake (CCQL). The CCQL is made up of full and part-time residents of the lake who were harmed by the 2014 disaster. The CCQL works with Indigenous and other community members to raise awareness about the impact of the disaster and ongoing discharges of filtered mine waste into Quesnel Lake. In May 2019, Imperial Metals’ Mount Polley mine suspended its operations and laid off hundreds of workers but even so, continues to discharge waste-water into Quesnel Lake.  
In 2018, the group launched an environmental appeal of Imperial Metals’ water discharge permit.  In 2017, the province of BC permitted the company to use Quesnel Lake as part of its water treatment process. The permit allows the company to discharge mine waste water that is filtered – but not treated – into the lake. [link to video]. Earlier this year, to the outrage of residents, the company  filed for an amendment to its permit to allow it to discharge in perpetuity. That decision is pending.  
Support the CCQL’s environmental appeal by purchasing one of our beautiful commemorative posters [hyperlink]. [photo of poster] 
In April, a lengthy criminal investigation into the disaster concluded and investigators submitted their recommendations for charges to the Crown.  The deadline for charges related to violations of the Federal Fisheries Act was August 4. 
Throughout the August long-weekend we waited to hear whether the Crown would press charges against Imperial Metals and others responsible for the Mount Polley disaster. Disappointingly, charges were not announced. While there remains faint hope that criminal charges may still be possible, the lack of a statutory deadline for indictable offenses means that we don’t know when charges could be laid. The frustration and feeling of abandonment among residents was palpable during our visit.   
However, on August 5 the CCQL went ahead with its celebration of resilience and unity in the face of disaster.  Amnesty presented residents with a colourful banner of wild salmon solidarity messages we had gathered from Amnesty members. They were delighted to read the beautiful, heartfelt messages of justice and solidarity from Amnesty activists and the public and to see the gorgeous art work BC’s wild salmon inspired.  
[Photo Community members and caravan participants pose with the wild salmon solidarity banner in Mitchell Bay.]

Later that the afternoon, we travelled to Hazeltine Creek, formerly a tiny creek hidden in the brush,  but now exposed within a barren landscape where, in 2014, 25 billion cubic litres of mine waste and water carved a 9 kilometre canyon out of the land as it gushed out of the tailings dam. [insert photo] 
Youth caravan participants described the clean-up efforts by the company around Hazeltine Creek as ‘unimpressive’ and said they felt sad, angry and upset to witness the damage caused by the disaster. They said that other youth will be shocked and have a hard time believing that a disaster like this could have happened in BC. [insert photo] 
At the end of the visit, we delivered a heartfelt message from Amnesty members to the CCQL: You are not alone and we will support you in your fight to protect Quesnel Lake.

Canadian organizations call on political leaders to respect dignity of refugees and migrants during federal election campaign
Organizations and community leaders across Canada are calling on the leaders of federal political parties to respect the dignity of refugees and vulnerable migrants during the upcoming election campaign. Over 150 Canadian organizations from diverse sectors have signed an open letter.
Sent to all federal parties in June, the letter was drafted by the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International, the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers and The Canadian Council of Churches as an expression of the organizations’ concern about how refugees and migrants in Canada may be characterized during the 2019 federal election campaign. The letter calls on leaders to engage in discussions about migration in ways that recognize: 
our shared humanity
that Canada finds opportunity through diversity
that refugees strengthen our communities and help build our economy, and
that Canada has legal obligations to respect and uphold the human rights of those fleeing persecution. 
The organizations who signed on from across Canada (credit unions, faith-based organizations, labour unions, newcomer serving organizations and many other organizations) shared their fear that Canada might see an increase in racist, xenophobic and toxic anti-refugee language in the political debates.
“It is a worldwide phenomenon, using vulnerable migrants and refugees as political ammunition – especially during election campaigns. We are disturbed that we are now seeing it in Canada as well. This is a destructive approach which feeds xenophobia and racism and we can not allow that to happen”, said Claire Roque, President of the Canadian Council for Refugees. “All our leaders, our candidates and our political parties have a role to play in preventing this from happening here, in Canada.”
“We are encouraged to see the magnitude and diversity of organizations across Canada that are united in rejecting of the politics of hate and fear,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada. “It is always incumbent upon our political leaders to engage in a respectful, responsible dialogue about migrants and refugees, but it will be particularly important to do so throughout the upcoming federal election campaign.”
“Today, organizations from coast to coast – representing tens of thousands of people –are calling on candidates and party leaders to commit to civil discourse when discussing refugees and migrants in the upcoming election. Canadians expect the ideas and words expressed to reflect respect for our shared humanity,” said Maureen Silcoff, President of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers.
“Refugees and migrants are leaving homes that have been destroyed, communities where they are under constant threat, economies where they cannot feed their families, or lands where climate catastrophes have destroyed their livelihood. The least we can do is to speak about them and their lives with respect and dignity, and to honour their humanity,” said Peter Noteboom, General Secretary of The Canadian Council of Churches.
“We know that newcomers, including refugees, are strong contributors to local economies, and that the fabric of our society is strengthened by the new ideas and diverse experiences they bring. As a sponsor of refugees to Canada, Vancity encourages other business leaders to join us in this work, and for everyone across the country to welcome refugees as our newest neighbours,” said Catherine Ludgate, Vancity Senior manager of community investment.
“Canada’s labour movement has a long and proud history of welcoming and settling refugees. With the rise in racism and xenophobia in Canada and around the world, we are calling on Canadians to continue to open their hearts and homes to the world’s most vulnerable. We must stand strong and united against hatred and fear,” said Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress.
“Canada is at its best when we welcome people of different religious and cultural backgrounds and it is a point of our collective pride. We must stand with refugees and for our Canadian value of generosity over politics,” said Sharmarke Dubow, City Councillor, City of Victoria, BC.

Open letter: discourse on refugees and migrants in upcoming elections
4 June 2019
To the leaders of all federal political parties
We are writing because we are concerned about how refugees and migrants in Canada may be characterized during the upcoming federal election campaign.
We welcome thoughtful discussion on complex issues related to migration, and recognize that there are many legitimate perspectives.
We are also conscious that refugees and migrants are easily victimized in political debates. In many countries around the world, especially during election campaigns, refugees and migrants have been talked about in ways that insult their dignity and humanity, contribute to xenophobia and racism, and are frequently grounded in distortion and misinformation.
We believe that every leader, every candidate, and every political party, has a role to play in preventing this from happening in Canada. We therefore ask you to engage in discussions about migration in ways that recognize: 
Our shared humanity,
That Canada finds opportunity through diversity,
That refugees strengthen our communities,
That refugees help build our economy,
That Canada has legal obligations to respect and uphold the human rights of those fleeing persecution 
We believe that how we respond to refugees, and how we talk about vulnerable migrants, is an important part of our collective identity.
We want to be a country that welcomes refugees, that respects the dignity and human rights of vulnerable migrants, and that treats them fairly.
We know Canadians value compassion, equality and safety for all.
In the upcoming federal election campaign, we call on you to demonstrate your leadership by respecting these principles and speaking out when they are undermined by others.

De nombreux organismes canadiens demandent aux dirigeants politiques de respecter la dignité des réfugiés et des migrants lors de la campagne électorale fédérale
De nombreux organismes et dirigeants de la société civile canadienne demandent aux chefs des partis politiques fédéraux de respecter la dignité des réfugiés et des migrants vulnérables lors de la prochaine campagne électorale. Plus de 150 organismes canadiens de divers secteurs ont signé une lettre ouverte.
Envoyée à tous les partis fédéraux en juin, la lettre a été rédigée par le Conseil canadien pour les réfugiés, Amnesty International, l’Association canadienne des avocats et avocates en droit des réfugiés (ACAADR) et le Conseil canadien des Églises, exprimant ainsi l’inquiétude des organismes quant à la manière dont les réfugiés et les migrants au Canada pourraient être caractérisés lors de la campagne électorale fédérale de 2019. La lettre appelle les leaders à participer aux discussions sur les migrations en reconnaissant :
•             notre humanité partagée,
•             que la diversité représente une chance pour le Canada,
•             que les réfugiés renforcent nos collectivités et aident à construire notre économie, et
•             que le Canada a l’obligation légale de respecter et de faire respecter les droits humains des personnes qui fuient la persécution.
Les organismes qui ont signé de partout au Canada (coopératives de crédit, organisations confessionnelles, syndicats, organismes au service des nouveaux arrivants et de nombreux autres organismes) ont exprimé leurs craintes de voir une augmentation du langage anti-réfugiés raciste, xénophobe et toxique lors des débats politiques.
« C’est un phénomène mondial, utiliser des migrants et des réfugiés vulnérables comme munition politique, en particulier pendant les campagnes électorales. Nous sommes perturbés par le fait que nous le voyons aussi au Canada. C’est une approche destructive qui alimente la xénophobie et le racisme et nous ne pouvons pas permettre que cela se produise », a déclaré Claire Roque, présidente du Conseil canadien pour les réfugiés. « Tous nos leaders, nos candidats et nos partis politiques ont un rôle à jouer pour empêcher que cela ne se produise ici, au Canada. »
« Nous sommes heureux de constater l’ampleur et la diversité des organismes du Canada, unies dans leur refus total des politiques de haine et de peur », a déclaré Justin Mohammed, responsable des campagnes, lois et politiques sur les droits de la personne, Amnistie internationale Canada – section anglophone. « Il incombe toujours à nos dirigeants politiques d’entreprendre un dialogue respectueux et responsable sur les migrants et les réfugiés, mais cela sera particulièrement important tout au long de la prochaine campagne électorale fédérale. » 
« Aujourd’hui, des organisations d’un océan à l’autre – représentant des dizaines de milliers de personnes – appellent les candidats et les chefs de partis à s’engager dans un discours civil lors de discussions sur les réfugiés et les migrants pendant les prochaines élections. Les Canadiens s’attendent à ce que les idées et les paroles exprimées reflètent le respect de notre humanité commune », a déclaré Maureen Silcoff, présidente de l’Association canadienne des avocats et avocates en droit des réfugiés.
« Les réfugiés et les migrants quittent des maisons qui ont été détruites, des communautés où ils sont constamment menacés, des économies où ils ne peuvent pas nourrir leur famille ou encore des terres où les catastrophes climatiques ont détruit leurs moyens de subsistance. Le moins que nous puissions faire c’est de parler d’eux et de leur vie avec respect et dignité et d’honorer leur humanité », a déclaré Peter Noteboom, secrétaire général du Conseil canadien des Églises.
« Nous savons que les nouveaux arrivants, y compris les réfugiés, contribuent fortement à l’économie locale et que le tissu de notre société est renforcé par les nouvelles idées et les expériences diverses qu’ils apportent. En tant que parrain des réfugiés au Canada, Vancity encourage les autres chefs d’entreprise à se joindre à nous pour ce travail et souhaite à tout le monde d’accueillir les réfugiés comme nos nouveaux voisins », a déclaré Catherine Ludgate, directrice principale des investissements dans la communauté de Vancity.
« Le mouvement syndical canadien a une longue et fière histoire d’accueil et d’installation des réfugiés. Avec la montée du racisme et de la xénophobie au Canada et dans le monde, nous demandons aux Canadiennes et aux Canadiens de continuer à ouvrir leurs cœurs et leurs maisons aux plus vulnérables du monde. Nous devons être forts et unis contre la haine et la peur », a déclaré Hassan Yussuff, président du Congrès du travail du Canada.
« Le Canada est à son meilleur lorsque nous accueillons des personnes de différentes traditions religieuses et culturelles et ceci fait partie de notre fierté collective. Nous devons nous tenir aux côtés des réfugiés et de notre valeur canadienne de générosité avant la politique », a déclaré Sharmarke Dubow, conseiller municipal, Ville de Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique.

Lettre ouverte : discours concernant les réfugiés et les migrants au cours de la campagne électorale
Le 4 juin 2019
À tous les leaders des partis politiques fédéraux
Nous vous écrivons aujourd’hui en raison de nos préoccupations quant à la manière dont les réfugiés et les migrants au Canada pourraient être décrits lors de la prochaine campagne électorale fédérale.
Une discussion sérieuse sur les questions complexes liées aux migrations sera la bienvenue et nous reconnaissons qu’il existe de nombreuses perspectives légitimes.
Nous sommes également conscients que les réfugiés et les migrants deviennent facilement des cibles dans les débats politiques. Dans de nombreux pays autour du monde, en particulier pendant les campagnes électorales, la façon dont on parle des réfugiés et des migrants porte atteinte à leur dignité et à leur humanité, contribue à la xénophobie et au racisme et repose sur des distorsions de la réalité et des informations erronées.
Nous croyons que chaque chef, chaque candidat et candidate et chaque parti politique a un rôle à jouer pour empêcher que cela se produise au Canada. Nous vous demandons donc de participer aux discussions sur les migrations de façon à reconnaitre : 
notre humanité partagée,
que la diversité représente une chance pour le Canada,
que les réfugiés renforcent nos collectivités,
que les réfugiés aident à construire notre économie,
que le Canada a l’obligation légale de respecter et de faire respecter les droits humains des personnes qui fuient la persécution 
Nous croyons que la manière dont nous réagissons aux réfugiés et dont nous nous parlons des migrants vulnérables constitue un élément important de notre identité collective.
Nous voulons être un pays qui accueille les réfugiés, qui respecte la dignité et les droits fondamentaux des migrants vulnérables, et qui les traite de façon juste.
Nous savons que les Canadiens sont fiers des valeurs de compassion, d’égalité et de sécurité pour tous et pour toutes portées par leur pays.
Lors de la prochaine campagne électorale fédérale, nous vous demandons de faire preuve de leadership en respectant ces principes et en condamnant les atteintes que d’autres pourraient y porter.

11th September 2019 
To school leaders around the world, 
My name is Kumi Naidoo and I am the Secretary General of Amnesty International, the world’s largest human rights organisation. I am writing to you today about what I believe to be the single most important issue facing our current generation of children and how you can play a key role in enabling them to take action. 
As you will know well, the past year has seen an unprecedented wave of activism from children across the world in response to the climate emergency facing our planet. Inspired by the example of Greta Thunberg, more than a million young people from dozens of countries have joined the Fridays for Future movement and other youth-led groups, participating in demonstrations that have often meant skipping school. 
The fact that children are missing classes to take part in this movement has, understandably, provoked strong reactions and concerns. I understand the pressures you face as school leaders in navigating this challenge. Indeed, Amnesty International has campaigned on the right of all children to receive a quality education. 
But, I believe that the cause for which these children are fighting is of such historic significance that I am writing to you today with a request to neither prevent nor punish your pupils from taking part in the global days of strikes planned for 20 and 27 September. 
The climate emergency is the defining human rights issue for this generation of children. Its consequences will shape their lives in almost every way imaginable. The failure of most governments to act in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence is arguably the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history.  
Human rights exist to help us live together in freedom, justice and peace. But none of that is possible without a liveable planet. 
The right to a healthy environment, including a safe climate, is essential for the enjoyment of so many other rights. It is a right that sadly, children today have been forced to take the lead in asserting. 
By taking part in these protests, children are exercising their human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and to have a say in decisions and matters that affect their lives. In doing so, they are teaching us all a valuable lesson: the importance of coming together to campaign for a better future. 
Participants in the climate strike are human rights defenders. The Fridays for Future movement of schoolchildren have been named as winners of Amnesty International’s ‘Ambassador of Conscience’ award for 2019. Past awardees include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai, Ai Weiwei, Harry Belafonte, Joan Baez and Colin Kaepernick. 
While watching these protests gather pace, I can’t help but be reminded of my own past. Aged 15, while at school in my native South Africa, I organised a protest against the apartheid system. I was expelled for this. It was a devastating moment for me. It was a very difficult moment for me and brought an overwhelming fear about how it might affect my future. 
This setback redoubled my commitment to learning, and thankfully I was able to complete my studies and ultimately take up the role I have the honour of holding today. But I also had something that children of this generation do not have: the chance to imagine a future that is not overshadowed by the prospect of a climate emergency. 
My experience also informed my strong belief that children should not be punished for speaking out about the great injustices of our age. In fact, when it has fallen on young people to show the leadership that many adults who hold great positions of power have failed to, it is not young people’s behaviour we should be questioning. It is ours. 
Thank you for considering my plea and I hope that, working with students, parents and your staff, you will be able to support this critical moment in history. 
With respect, 
Kumi Naidoo

The human rights organization is deeply concerned that Kenney’s proposed “Fight Back Strategy” undermines and violates a range of Alberta’s human rights obligations, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international law. Further, his approach exposes human rights defenders – particularly Indigenous, women, and environmental human rights defenders – to intimidation and threats.
Apart from a call to abandon the Fight Back Strategy, Amnesty International urges Kenney to: 
Ensure that any initiatives to promote the oil and gas industry in Alberta are fully consistent with Alberta’s international human rights obligations and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Actively and consistently promote and uphold the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of association and peaceful protest. 
Retract any inflammatory statements made about human rights defenders and refrain from any accusations that directly or indirectly smear, stigmatize or could lead to threats and violence against them. 
Make clear that the Alberta government will hold all actors involved in the province’s oil and gas industry – including companies, industry associations and advocacy groups supportive of the industry – accountable for their human rights responsibilities, in particular respecting the rights and safety of human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples and persons of all genders. 
Ensure that public funds will not be used in any way that leads directly or indirectly to the harassment, surveillance or criminalization of human rights defenders who oppose or criticize the Alberta government’s energy agenda and its implications for the rights of Indigenous peoples and addressing the global climate crisis. 
Refer all cases involving threats against human rights defenders targeted for their opposition to or criticism of the oil and gas industry to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police or municipal police forces for investigation. 
Work with human rights defenders who have been threatened, to put in place measures they deem necessary for the protection of their human rights. 
Ensure that any government efforts to counter criticism of the oil industry in Alberta are consistent with the province’s responsibility to address the rapidly mounting human rights impacts of the global climate crisis. 
Further to the Open Letter, Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Alex Neve will be at the University of Alberta in Edmonton on Sept. 10 at 7 p.m. to participate in a panel discussion on Kenney’s initiatives to defend the oil and gas industry. The other panellists include Laurie Adkin, Professor of Political Science at the University of Alberta; Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, Executive Director of Indigenous Climate Action; Tim Gray, Executive Director of Environmental Defence; and moderator James L. Turk, Director of Ryerson University’s Centre for Free Expression.

“These outrageous sentences are just the latest to be meted out by Iran’s cruel justice system and expose the authorities’ complete disregard for journalists and workers’ rights. 
“These individuals are blatantly being targeted and punished for their work defending human rights and for publicizing human rights violations. This disgraceful injustice must be reversed. We call on the Iranian authorities to quash these unjust verdicts and cruel sentences and immediately and unconditionally release all seven individuals.
“The international community, including EU states, which have an ongoing dialogue with Iran, must step up its efforts and demand the Iranian authorities immediately stop targeting journalists and human rights defenders and end their increasingly ruthless campaign to quash what little remains of Iran’s civil society.”
Background
According to media reports, on 7 September, Branch 28 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran issued a verdict against seven individuals who had been arrested over the past year after taking part in peaceful protests for workers’ rights or documenting and publicizing them.
The seven individuals include labour rights activists Esmail Bakhshi and Sepideh Gholian, who have been arrested several times in the past year for participating in peaceful protests by workers over unpaid wages at Haft Tappeh sugar cane company in Khuzestan province and for stating that they were tortured after their first arrest in November 2018.
The court sentenced Esmail Bakhshi to a total of 13 and a half years in prison and 74 lashes after convicting him of charges including “spreading lies”, “insulting the Supreme Leader” and “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”. Sepideh Gholian and journalists Amirhossein Mohammadifard, Sanaz Alahyari, Asal Mohammadi and Amir Amirgholi were each sentenced to 18 years in prison after being convicted of charges including “membership of a group with the purpose of disrupting national security” for their work at an online magazine called Gam, which reports on social justice issues, including labour rights, as well as “spreading propaganda against the system” and “spreading lies”.
Under Iran’s sentencing guidelines, which state that individuals convicted of three or more offences are required to serve the heaviest single sentence for any one of the charges, they will each be required to serve seven years in prison. For the same reason, Esmail Bakhshi’s flogging sentence is not expected to be carried out.  
The court sentenced labour rights activist Mohammad Khanifar to six years in prison for “spreading propaganda against the system” and “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”.

While Amnesty does not take a position on the Referendum result or whether the UK leaves the EU with or without a deal, the human rights organization has pinpointed serious human rights issues.
These include a potential shortage of access to food and medicine, as well as concerns over the future of EU citizens in the UK, the right to immigration and asylum, and the future of the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.
Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK Director, said:
“The reassurances from the Government to date have simply not been good enough. Deal or no deal, Brexit poses serious human rights concerns to UK residents.
“The Government and politicians of all parties must do everything they can to ensure that the human rights of those living in the UK are protected and respected, not degraded or undermined.
“We’re calling on the leaders of all parties to make a statement to this effect, making clear what they’ll do to ensure our concerns are met.”
Amnesty has outlined five areas the UK Government must ensure happen as they approach the deadline for leaving the EU:
Northern Ireland – As a co-signatory to the Good Friday Agreement, the Westminster Government must ensure that it fully safeguards the vital human rights protections which it helps guarantee. This must include protection of the equal rights of all citizens, whether they identify as Irish or British. It is imperative that there are no restrictions on the freedom of movement to and from Northern Ireland so as to enable people to fully exercise their rights to education, healthcare, work and family life.
EU citizens in the UK – The Government must act to ensure that the rights of EU citizens and their family members in the UK are protected and respected, and take steps to secure the same for one-million plus UK citizens currently living in the EU. In doing so, the Government must ensure that children of EU citizens are not deprived of their rights by being treated as subject to immigration powers (under the Government’s EU Settlement Scheme) in circumstances where those children are, or have rights to register as, British citizens.
Access to food – It is vital that as the UK leaves the EU, the Government does all it can to ensure that food supplies aren’t disrupted and that everybody has access to adequate and affordable levels of food regardless of their circumstances. We are already witnessing an increasing reliance on food banks in the UK, and all efforts must be made to provide food security to all, including those in an already vulnerable situation.
Access to medicine – There must be no disruption to supplies of medicines which are crucial to ensuring that everybody enjoys their right to health. The Government must therefore take all necessary measures to overcome any obstacles to guarantee access to good quality and affordable medicine, and in a timely fashion.
Immigration and asylum system – As the Government seeks to revise the immigration system in the wake of ending EU free movement, it must ensure that any reforms promote and respect the rights to asylum, family and private life and the best interests of children whilst protecting people against wrongful and excessive use of immigration powers by the state and exploitation by third parties.

The multiple new ways in which the authorities trampled on freedom of assembly and expression ahead of the Moscow City Duma (local parliament) election on 8 September marks a new, deeply disturbing crackdown on human rights in Russia, said Amnesty International today.
“This summer, the authorities have done all they can to suppress human rights. In an atmosphere marked by a growing public discontent in both Moscow and across the country, they have not only used every trick in their book to persecute and intimidate a mounting chorus of dissent, they have gone way beyond the familiar script,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Russia Director.
“First, they took a patently discriminatory approach by disqualifying some electoral candidates on arbitrary grounds and with an inherently flawed process through which to appeal. When thousands took to the streets in protest, riot police were drafted in and used excessive force. The police clearly provoked violence, but the protests remained overwhelmingly peaceful. More than 2,600 people were detained, and dozens of peaceful protesters were beaten by police officers.”
Following demonstrations on 27 July and 3 August, thousands of peaceful protesters and bystanders were detained and issued with extortionate fines. Leaders of the protest, real and assumed, were arbitrarily detained for between 10 and 30 days under Russia’s unduly repressive administrative legislation, often on multiple occasions. One of the protest leaders, Ilya Yashin, the elected head of Krasnoselsky municipal district in Moscow, is now serving his fifth administrative sentence in a row. He was first arrested on 29 July.
To further isolate those arrested in the city centre, the authorities put some of them on trial in remote courts serving peripheral areas of Moscow and dispatched those sentenced to “administrative arrest” to prisons up to 70 kilometers outside Moscow.
Absurd criminal investigations against protesters
Despite the overwhelmingly peaceful character of the rallies, the authorities have opened criminal investigations against several participants – most of whom haven’t done anything remotely violent – using at least four different articles of the Criminal Code. These include the totally unfounded charge of “mass disorders”, as there were no mass disorders. Some protesters have been charged with using violence against police officers.
One of the accused, Yegor Zhukov, a 20 year-old student, was charged with instigating “mass disorders” on account of him allegedly telling people to keep away from the road and stay on the sidewalk. Due to their patently arbitrary nature, the “mass disorders” charges against him were dropped and immediately replaced with charges of “instigation of extremist activities” for his YouTube videos posted two years ago.
The Russian criminal justice system typically takes months or even years to conclude a case, but in this case some individuals were convicted and imprisoned with lightning speed. Among them is one of the peaceful protesters, Konstantin Kotov. It took the investigation just three days to complete his case; he was convicted and sentenced to four years in prison, his ‘crime’ being nothing more than repeatedly taking part in “unauthorized” assemblies. Remarkably, he has been convicted for something which, according to Russia’s own Constitutional Court, should not be criminalized.
“The authorities are engaged in a mass intimidation campaign. Scores of people faced intrusive house searches or were snatched from their homes or the streets at night. At least two couples were threatened with deprivation of parental rights for bringing their young children with them to the rallies. Using children as pawns against their parents is a despicable new low for the authorities, and one we hope we won’t see repeated,” said Natalia Zviagina.
Amnesty International is calling on the Russian authorities to terminate any criminal proceedings instigated under trumped-up charges, such as those brought under the unfair charge of ‘mass disorder’ which is being used to stifle the right to peaceful assembly. They must immediately and unconditionally release Konstantin Kotov and all those arrested for trying to peacefully exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The Russian government must demonstrate full respect for the rights of all people without discrimination, and in particular the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.
Background
People took to the streets of Moscow in numbers not seen in many years in peaceful assemblies to protest against the barring of independent candidates from running in the election. The Moscow electoral officials arbitrarily invalidated the candidacy of politicians challenging candidates backed by the ruling United Russia party and the Mayor of Moscow, staunch Kremlin supporters.

His early years as leader of Zimbabwe, following the transition from British colonial rule, saw some notable achievements through his heavy investment in social services. Areas including health and education saw dramatic improvements, with the country still enjoying one of the highest literacy rates in Africa. However, he later eroded his own track record.
During his 37 years in power, he presided over the brutal repression of political opponents and established a culture of impunity for himself and his cronies, while his government implemented a series of policies that have had disastrous consequences.
“While casting himself as the saviour of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe inflicted lasting damage upon its people and its reputation,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Southern Africa.
As a leader of the resistance to the white minority government of what was then known as Rhodesia, Mugabe began his political life fighting against injustice. Imprisoned and later exiled for his political activities, he was one of more than 900 prisoners of conscience adopted in Zimbabwe by Amnesty International between 1965 and 1979.
Boosted by his image as a champion of the victims of imperialism, Robert Mugabe became Zimbabwe’s first post-independence prime minister in 1980 on a platform of reconciliation.
However, shortly after taking office, he deployed the repressive machinery of the state against political opponents. During the 1980s, in a military crackdown, known as Gukurahundi – loosely translated as “the early rain which washes away the chaff before the spring rains”, that widely targeted suspected opposition supporters, some 20,000 people were killed in Matabeleland and Midlands provinces. Many of the dead were unarmed civilians.
Amnesty International’s calls for the prosecution of suspected crimes committed by his supporters and by the security services went unheeded. In a warning that would prove prophetic, the human rights organization said at the time that a failure to hold anyone accountable for the Matabeleland and Midlands violations would set a dangerous precedent.
Though he came to office on a wave of popular support, Mugabe’s tenure as prime minister, and then as president, was defined by a stubborn determination to hold on to power – an end to which he sacrificed Zimbabwe’s economy, institutions, and society.
Throughout his presidency, general elections were marred by spikes in serious human rights violations and abuses by state security agents and ZANU-PF activists. Opposition supporters suffered torture, harassment, intimidation and even death. Some were disappeared without a trace.
In 2008, following his first-round ballot loss to the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, the army unleashed a wave of violence in which more than 300 people were killed and thousands injured or tortured on suspicion of having voted for the opposition. The response saw opposition MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, withdrawing from the second round of voting.
Again, Amnesty International called for the crimes to be investigated. Again, the call went unheeded.
“Whenever Mugabe felt under pressure he defaulted to sanctioning human rights violations, publicly defending the actions of his officials’,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
The early progress made by Mugabe’s government on economic, social and cultural rights was wiped out by a series of disastrous government policy decisions.
In 2000, Mugabe sanctioned a violent land reform programme, ostensibly to redress skewed land distribution resulting from 90 years of colonial rule. While the need for land reform was legitimate, Mugabe used the redistribution programme as a system of patronage, rewarding his supporters with land while denying those considered political opponents. The programme was also used as a front to disguise the violent targeting of farm workers who had supported the opposition.
In 2005 Mugabe presided over one of the most disastrous forced eviction campaigns in African history. Known as Operation Murambatsvina – a Shona word meaning “drive out trash” – it targeted urban shack dwellers. The United Nations estimated that 700,000 people had their homes, livelihoods, or both, destroyed.  The evictions drove most of the affected people deeper into poverty, with many continuing to live without access to health, education and other basic services.
An increasing reliance on his security services to suppress dissenting voices within and outside his party became a hallmark of the latter years of his rule. Opponents including human rights defenders, journalists and opposition party activists were locked up on politically motivated charges or under draconian laws. The less fortunate were killed. Mugabe was also uncompromising in his opposition to LGBT rights, saying that they were “worse than dogs and pigs”, and favoured more anti-homosexual legislation.
Escaping repression and a shrinking economy, an estimated three million Zimbabweans have left the country since 2000.
Finally forced to resign in November 2017, his long-time lieutenant Emmerson Mnangagwa – later his political rival in the jostling for the control of Zimbabwe with the ruling ZANU-PF – engineered his exit from the presidency with the backing of the army.
“Mugabe leaves behind permanent scars of his brutal rule. Going forward, those who come after him must forge a national healing programme, beginning with accountability for the past human rights violations. Zimbabweans deserve the truth,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.

0,Morocco: Release journalist detained for ‘unlawful abortion’,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/morocco-release-journalist-detained-unlawful-abortion/,"The Moroccan authorities must immediately release and drop all charges against journalist Hajar Raissouni, who has been accused of having an abortion and having sex outside of marriage, said Amnesty International ahead of her trial session on 9 September in Rabat.  Hajar Raissouni, who works for...","The Moroccan authorities must immediately release and drop all charges against journalist Hajar Raissouni, who has been accused of having an abortion and having sex outside of marriage, said Amnesty International ahead of her trial session on 9 September in Rabat. 
Hajar Raissouni, who works for the independent daily newspaper Akhbar al-Yaoum, was arrested on 31 August along with her fiancé Amin Rifaat, as they left a doctor’s office in Rabat. The doctor and two others working at the clinic were also arrested on suspicion of carrying out an abortion.
“The arrest of Hajar Raissouni and four others is completely unjust and these allegations are an outrageous invasion of her privacy,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
Under Moroccan law sex outside of marriage is a criminal offence. Abortion is also criminalized in all circumstances unless the health of the pregnant woman is at risk and her spouse agrees. However, under international law women have a right to bodily and personal autonomy which includes being free to make their own sexual and reproductive decisions. Criminalization of health services needed only by women, such as an abortion, amounts to gender discrimination.
“This case is a stark reminder of the urgent need to repeal Morocco’s laws criminalizing sex outside marriage and abortion. These provisions violate a number of women’s rights, including the rights to bodily and personal autonomy, non-discrimination, privacy and health,” said Heba Morayef.
“Instead of intimidating Hajar Raissouni by prosecuting her on unjust charges, the authorities should immediately and unconditionally release her and drop all the charges against her and others involved in this case.”
Hajar Raissouni’s fiancé is held on the same charges as she is. The doctor and his two assistants also in detention, are accused of practicing and participating in abortion. The doctor is also accused of regularly providing abortion services and faces up to 10 years in prison.
After her arrest, Hajar Raissouni was detained at a police station in Rabat. On 2 September, she was brought before a prosecutor and charged with sex outside of marriage and “consenting to have an abortion”.     
Under Morocco’s Penal Code, couples who engage in sex outside of marriage can be jailed for up to one year. Likewise, a woman who has had an abortion can be punished with a prison term of between six months and two years and a fine.
On 5 September the Rabat prosecutor’s office revealed results of Hajar’s medical examinations in a shocking breach of her privacy and stated the clinic she had visited was under surveillance on suspicion of providing abortion services. Her lawyer Saad Sahli, had previously said medical tests had found no concrete evidence of an abortion.
The statement also declared that Hajar Raissouni’s arrest had nothing to do with her journalistic profession and is solely related to the criminal offences of abortion and sex outside marriage, which she denies.
On 4 September, in a letter sent by Hajar to her newspaper, she said that while in custody, she was interrogated about her political writings, one of her colleagues at Akhbar al-Yaoum and family including her uncle Ahmed Raissouni, a prominent theologist and the ex-president of the Mouvement de l’Unicité et de la Réforme (MUR), considered to be one of the largest Islamic movements in Morocco. This raises concerns that she may have been targeted for by the authorities in connection with her journalistic work.
In May 2019, Hajar Raissouni published a series of interviews with Ahmed Zefzafi, father of Nasser Zefzafi, the Hirak El-Rif protest movement leader. She has also published articles critical of Moroccan authorities. The editor of the newspaper she works for Akhbar al-Yaoum, Taoufik Bouachrine, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on politically motivated charges in November 2018.

The last session of Parliament fell just short of an essential and long overdue step in the protection of Indigenous rights. 
Bill C-262, a private member’s bill setting out a framework to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, was passed by the House of Commons in 2018. But when the Bill came to the Senate, it was blocked by the stalling tactics of a small group of Senators. 
As deeply frustrating as this was, the campaign for Bill C-262 nonetheless built an important foundation for the future. 
We saw a tremendous display of public support for implementation of the Declaration and we know that politicians took notice. In fact, even as that small group of Senators exploited the procedural rules of the Senate to delay and ultimately block Bill C-262, all parties in the House of Commons passed a motion expressing unanimous support for the Bill. 
When Parliament resumes after the election, Amnesty International wants to see implementation of the Declaration high on the agenda. 
This means finally passing into law the key elements originally set out in Bill C-262: a commitment to law reform, the creation of national implementation plan in collaboration with Indigenous peoples, and accountability for moving forward with such a plan. 
This also requires clear, unambiguous support from all Parties.

In particular, the organization again...","Following poet and activist Rita Wong’s release from prison on September 3, 2019, Amnesty International reiterates its call on the BC government and all governments across the country to take deliberate action to avoid unjustified criminalization of protest.
In particular, the organization again expressed concern about the use of criminal contempt prosecutions against individuals accused with defying the court injunction against protests connected with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.  
“There is no denying that Rita Wong, and other protesters who have defied the Trans Mountain protest injunction are acting out of conscience and are deeply concerned about the urgent global climate crisis, environmental degradation, disregard for the rights of Indigenous peoples and other related injustices,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “Those are imperatives that go to the very heart of why safeguarding rights associated with peaceful protest is so crucial. Protecting — not criminalizing — that right is a responsibility that all governments must take exceptionally seriously.”
On Aug. 16, BC Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Affleck sentenced Rita Wong to 28 days in prison for defying a court injunction against protests linked to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. She served two-thirds of her sentence before her statutory release on Sept. 3. Rita Wong describes the protest, which took place at the Westridge Marine Terminal on Aug. 24, 2018, as involving about 30 minutes of song, prayer and seated ceremony.
There have reportedly been over 200 arrests related to the injunction since a change last year from primarily relying on civil contempt proceedings to enforce the injunction and instead regularly pursuing criminal contempt prosecutions. Penalties in other cases have included hours of community service, fines of as much as $4,000 and prison sentences of up to fourteen days. The 28-day sentences received by Rita Wong and, in March of this year, lawyer David Gooderham, are the most severe punishments to date. Amnesty International is concerned about the apparent disproportionate nature of those sentences, particularly given that there were no acts of violence, threats of harm or any damage to property involved.
In her statement to the court before the sentencing decision, Rita Wong stressed that “by breaching the injunction, [she] had no intention of reducing respect for our courts.” She noted that she did “respect the court’s concern for the rule of law,” and did “appreciate that obeying court orders is part of the rule of law.” She asked the court, however, to consider that “there are more aspects of the rule of law” before imposing a sentence and highlighted a range of concerns related to the environment, the rights of Indigenous peoples and human rights. 
The right to peaceful protest is an internationally recognized and protected human right, enshrined in numerous international human rights treaties binding on Canada. All governments and all authorities in Canada are obliged to uphold this essential right, which can and should only be restricted when absolutely necessary. Enforcement of any such restrictions should avoid criminalization except where the actions of protesters have endangered lives or property.
“There is every reason to expect ongoing peaceful protests — at times in defiance of court injunctions — against the Trans Mountain expansion and other resource development projects that pose threats to the environment or violate the rights of Indigenous peoples,” said Neve. “It is incumbent upon all governments to set clear guidelines and direction for law enforcement and prosecutors that recognize their obligation to respect and protect such protests and refrain from excessive and undue use of criminal law penalties to punish and deter protesters.”
Background
Amnesty International has issued numerous reports documenting a deeply worrying worldwide trend of attacks and shrinking space for those who speak up to defend human rights, including the right to a healthy environment. According to Amnesty’s research, in country after country, defenders of land, Indigenous territory and the environment face stigmatization and criminalization in response to legitimate, peaceful protest against resource extraction projects and their impact. 
Amnesty International has also frequently pointed to the over-reaction of governments in Canada to land rights protests and protests perceived to threaten favoured resource development projects. Court rulings, including in such cases as Trans Mountain, Clyde River and Northern Gateway, have made it abundantly clear that government approvals of such projects often fail utterly to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples.
Noting that major resource development projects such as pipeline construction and expansion often have high political stakes, Amnesty International has underscored the need for even greater vigilance in such cases in ensuring that the right to protest is not sacrificed.

“This brutal act is a war crime. Even as the Taliban claims to be pursuing peace, it continues to kill people in the most gruesome way. Abdul Samad Amiri devoted his life to standing up for the rights of others, those who have no one else to speak for them. Our thoughts are with Abdul Samad’s family and his brave colleagues at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
“This tragedy underscores the grave dangers that human rights defenders in Afghanistan face. Threatened by all sides in a conflict that continues to claim civilian lives daily, they are left defenceless. The Afghan government and the international community must provide them with the protection they desperately need and not abandon them.”
Background
According to Shaharzad Akbar, Chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, said that Abdul Samad Amiri was kidnapped and then shot on 4 September 2019 by the Taliban while traveling back from from Kabul.
Earlier this month, Amnesty International published a report entitled Defenceless Defenders: Afghanistan’s Human Rights Community Under Attack, which details how human rights defenders in Afghanistan are under intensifying attacks from both the authorities and armed groups as they face intimidation, harassment, threats and violence.
As part of its international “BRAVE” campaign for the rights of human rights defenders, Amnesty International is calling on the Afghan government and the international community to establish a protection mechanism for human rights defenders working in the country.

“The governor of Baja California has an opportunity to leave a legacy before he ends his term, ensuring that Adrián Vásquez and his family do not have to wait any longer for the justice they are owed,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International documented and publicly denounced the case of Adrián Vásquez Lagunes when it occurred. He was detained by state police as he drove in Tijuana on 26 September 2012. During the 12 hours that he remained in police custody, he was subjected to threats, beatings, and near-asphyxiation – including by forcing water into his nose. Afterwards, police presented him to the media declaring that he was a known drug trafficker. Vásquez Lagunes spent three years in prison unjustly on false charges. He was released from prison in December 2015.
Seven years after his detention, comprehensive reparation for his case is urgently necessary. It should be noted that, as part of the obligation to compensate victims comprehensively, the United Nations Committee Against Torture has recommended that compensation for cases of torture must be prompt, just, and adequate. However, Vásquez Lagunes and his family have been forced to live in precarious economic conditions as the State of Baja California has failed to fulfill Recommendation No. 15/15, issued on 5 May 2015 by the then Human Rights and Citizen Protection Ombudsman’s Office, which stipulated that authorities should compensate him without delay.
Mexico is a country in which torture and abuse remain widespread. Given this context, Amnesty International urges the authorities of the State of Baja California to eliminate any obstacle that impedes or delays comprehensive compensation for damages suffered by Adrián Vásquez Lagunes and to promptly fulfill the state’s obligation to effect this compensation.
