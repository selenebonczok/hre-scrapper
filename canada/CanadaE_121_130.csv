By email:  president@yorku.ca
December 8, 2019
Dear Dr. Lenton,
Amnesty International is writing this Open Letter to request that you convene an independent review into all concerns associated with the “Reservists on Duty: Hear from former Israeli Defence Force soldiers” event, organized by the Herut Zionism Club at York University on November 20, 2019.
As you know, this controversial event was met with protests which descended into violent confrontations outside the venue. It was clearly foreseeable that there would be controversy and protest, given the history of human rights violations committed by Israeli Defence Force soldiers amidst the illegal occupation of the Palestinian Territories. That was exacerbated by the fact that members of the Jewish Defense League, a far-right group classified as a terrorist organization in the U.S. and with a record of violence and assaults at protests, were allowed on campus.
Amnesty International has an active and dynamic student group at York University that works on a range of campaigns, including our serious concerns about widespread and longstanding human rights violations associated with Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian Territories.  The group brings a positive voice for human rights to York, in keeping with the university’s encouragement of student agency and leadership. They actively defend and promote universal human rights protection for all people, including the freedoms of speech, expression and assembly and the obligation to condemn war crimes occurring anywhere in the world.
While Amnesty International at York had no official presence at the protest, a number of our members chose to participate in an individual capacity, as is clearly their right. We are very troubled to learn that some members were physically assaulted during the confrontations that occurred and have been receiving threatening messages on their cell phones. They are now fearful when they are on campus and have taken to limiting their movements, staying in groups, and ensuring that there are safe spaces to study in security.
It is evident that the considerable confusion, tension and fear associated with the November 20th event and its aftermath lingers. That is clear from the number and nature of statements and resolutions that have been issued by various student groups on campus. We have noted from your statement on November 21st that you have taken two steps in response, namely: (1) tasking the Vice President of Equity, People and Culture and your Division of Students to take the lead in developing a strategy for “fostering a more productive dialogue around these issues”; and (2) the launch of an upcoming Freedom of Speech Working Group to “make specific recommendations on how to create a more respectful climate on campus for the discussion of difficult topics.”
Given conflicting views about what happened that evening, the worrying ongoing impact on students at York and the important human rights considerations that are at stake, Amnesty International urges York University to go further and convene an independent review of all circumstances associated with the Herut Zionism Club event and its aftermath, with a mandate that includes examination of: 
considerations that were taken into account in approving the event, including the fact that the speakers were former members of a military with a clear record of responsibility for war crimes and other serious human rights violations;
decisions made with respect to the presence of members of the Jewish Defense League on campus;
measures put in place to uphold the freedoms of expression and assembly while ensuring public safety and the security of all protesters;
decisions and actions of security personnel and university officials as the protest proceeded and confrontations occurred;
the role of Toronto Police Service officers;
allegations of violence and other criminality perpetrated during the demonstration; and
measures taken to respond to ongoing concerns about threats and intimidation in the aftermath of the event. 
The independent review should also make any appropriate recommendations with respect to accountability, redress and reform. Amnesty International urges the administration at York University to pursue this review with the attention and seriousness it deserves, and to engage professionals and experts to assist with this.
Amnesty International firmly supports and, in fact, encourages peaceful debate on the Israeli / Palestinian conflict. It is our hope that this review will provide insights into ensuring that such debate can and will happen at York in a manner that respects and upholds the crucial human rights concerns at stake and will be consistent with the university’s commitment to inclusion and diversity.
We look forward to hearing from you Dr. Lenton with respect to the steps you take to establish an independent review.  I can be reached directly via my Executive Assistant Jina Rodas-Wright at jrodas-wright@amnesty.ca or by telephone at 613 744 7667 extension 263.
Sincerely,

This is happening because their families may not have the resources to meet all their needs, and because child welfare services in First Nations communities also don’t have the resources that are urgently needed to support these families. 
At the heart of the problem is the fact that the federal government’s budget for children’s services in First Nations communities is at least 22% less per child than what the provincial governments dedicate for child welfare services in other communities. This is despite often greater needs and the higher costs of delivering services in small and remote First Nations communities. As a result, the removal of children from their families – something that is only supposed to happen as a last resort – has become commonplace for underfunded child welfare services that lack the resources to intervene in other ways. 
The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has ordered the federal government to pay compensation to First Nations children, youth and families for its “willful and reckless” discriminatory practices in providing services to First Nations children and families. The federal government is seeking a judicial review before the Federal Court aimed at quashing the human rights tribunal compensation order. 
On February 14th, Amnesty International is joining the First Nations’ Child and Family Caring Society for their annual Have a Heart campaign. This is a child and youth-led reconciliation event that brings together caring Canadians to help ensure First Nations children have the services they need to grow up safely at home, get a good education, be healthy, and be proud of who they are.

The proposed Bill 207 in Alberta would limit access to sexual and reproductive health services including abortion and gender-affirming healthcare by allowing physicians to refuse to provide care they feel is contrary to their beliefs. The last free-standing abortion clinic in Fredericton, New Brunswick is up for sale. Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people continue to be sterilized without their free, full, and informed consent. 
It’s clear that people who can get pregnant in Canada are facing barriers accessing comprehensive sexual health information and services, and having their rights fully protected when they access such services. This is consistent with a global trend, which has seen increasing restrictions on access to abortions in the United States, and continued criminalization of abortion in countries like El Salvador and Argentina. 
This is why Amnesty is partnering with Women’s March Global, the International Planned Parenthood Federation, and She Decides to dedicate the 2020 Women’s March to protecting bodily autonomy. 
Women’s rights are human rights, and sexual and reproductive health and rights must be protected. Everyone has the right to make their own free decisions about their body, life, and future.

The youth-led campaign for mercury justice is one of the focal cases of this year’s global Write for Rights campaign, marking the beginning of a year-long campaign mobilizing Amnesty members and supporters in Canada and around the world. Sign up for Write for Rights now. 
The people of Grassy Narrows First Nation in northwest Ontario have been hard-hit by mercury poisoning, after the government allowed a pulp mill to dump 10 tons of waste into a river in the 1960s. The damaging effects are still seen today. 
Next year marks 50 years since the public first became aware of mercury poisoning at Asubpeeschoseewagong (Grassy Narrows). In all this time, the people of the Grassy Narrows First Nation have never received the help they need to deal with the devastating, and still ongoing, consequences of the poisoning of their river system and the fish on which they depend. 
While the campaign for mercury justice led by the youth of Grassy Narrows is gaining momentum, it’s clear that a lot more pressure is needed to break through the now deeply entrenched patterns of delay and deceit that have denied the people of Grassy Narrows their basic human rights for the last five decades. 
Beginning in the 1960s, an upstream pulp mill dumped an estimated 10 tons of mercury waste into the English and Wabigoon river system. The company is long gone, but deadly mercury remains in the river sediment and continues to accumulate in fish. 
Symptoms of mercury poisoning, including seizures and loss of motor control, are widespread at Grassy Narrows, including among young people born long after the community was assured that the mercury contamination would all be washed away. Despite ample evidence of the severe harms experienced by the people of Grassy Narrows, they have never received specialized health care and other supports needed to deal with the impacts. Community-led health studies have confirmed that the community’s overall health is now worse than other First Nations’ and much, much worse than the general public’s. 
In 2017, the Trudeau government promised that it would deal with the crisis of mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows “once and for all”. The federal minister responsible for health care and other basic services in First Nations communities promised to fund a specialized care facility for community members suffering from the debilitating effects of mercury poisoning. And last May, the Minister announced that he was travelling to Grassy Narrows to sign an agreement to allow construction of the care facility to finally begin. 
However, that’s not how things worked out. Although then Indigenous Services Minister Seamus O’Regan told reporters that the federal government was prepared to enter a long-term, legally binding commitment to fully fund the mercury home, the Toronto Star later reported that the proposed agreement was rejected by Grassy Narrows because it contained none of those commitments. Instead, what was actually offered by the federal government was partial funding that could be withdrawn at any time. 
Federal officials have said that their proposal simply reflected the standard terms for government agreements. However, business as usual is the opposite of what this unique and tragic situation requires. 
In the coming weeks and months, Amnesty will be doing everything we can to support the people of Grassy Narrows to finally achieve the justice they deserve. The youth-led campaign for mercury justice is one of the focal cases of this year’s global Write for Rights campaign. We’re hopeful that an outpouring of support from around the world will help put pressure on the federal government to finally turn promises into concrete actions consistent with the urgency of the situation. 
But we’re not stopping there. Write for Rights will mark the beginning of a year-long campaign mobilizing Amnesty members and supporters in Canada and around the world. At stake is the right of every young person at Grassy Narrows to grow up in a healthy environment and a thriving community. Also at issue is the deeper concern about the racism and indifference that has denied the people of Grassy Narrows their basic human rights for so long. 
Days before Minister O’Regan was in Grassy Narrows, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on toxic wastes, Baskut Tuncak, also visited Grassy Narrows. The UN expert’s conclusion: “There exists a pattern in Canada where marginalized groups, Indigenous peoples in particular, find themselves on the wrong side of a toxic divide, subject to conditions that would not be acceptable elsewhere in Canada.”

“After the visit of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, President Bukele’s government has an opportunity to accept its recommendations and carry out major changes to guarantee human rights for all El Salvador’s people. The new government must show its commitment to human rights by turning words into deeds and formulating and implementing public policies”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“The government’s consent to the IACHR’s visit was an important step in the right direction. We hope it will be accompanied by a firm commitment that extends beyond the visit and is reflected in a visible improvement in the life of the Salvadoran people. National organizations have robust and innovative proposals to improve the human rights situation in the country. The authorities must build channels to promote their participation and ensure that their valuable contributions will be considered”.
The agenda of the IACHR’s in loco visit comprised five key issues: public security, transitional justice, people deprived of their freedom, migrants’ rights, women’s rights and LGBTI people. The IACHR met state authorities and civil society organizations during its visit. 
Civil society organizations raised a series of human rights concerns. In particular, they advised the IACHR of the need to maintain and strengthen channels for participation and dialogue between organizations and state institutions. 
Regarding public security, the organizations said they were unaware of the content of the “Territorial Control Plan” that sets out the country’s national security policy. The organizations expressed concern about the continued repressive approach and the militarization of public security. 
As part of the discussion on the proposed bill before the Legislative Assembly’s Policy Commission, which could have implications for access to justice for victims of the armed conflict in El Salvador, the victims and survivors of grave human rights violations said their voices must be heard to ensure compliance with the demands of international law on this matter. They stressed the importance of providing national authorities and victims with access to the information in government archives, including the military archives covering the years of the conflict. They also asked that data be provided on crimes under international law committed during the armed conflict and any suspects.
The organizations also denounced violations of the rights of women and LGBTI people and asked the IACHR to mediate to ensure that government policies guarantee the human rights of these sectors of the population. In this context, a matter of special concern was the absolute prohibition on abortion, the criminalization of women suffering miscarriages and obstetric emergencies and the repeated denunciations of hate crimes suffered by LGBTI people. 
Relatives of migrants who died or disappeared while migrating expressed the importance of adopting specific legislation, in accordance with international standards, on the search for and identification of disappeared people and the development  of a forensic database on missing migrants.
An in loco visit is the most important official visit that the IACHR can undertake in plenary (with seven commissioners, special rapporteurs and the executive secretary) to a member state of the Organization of American States, to conduct a detailed assessment of the general human rights situation in the territory under its jurisdiction. This visit took place at the government’s invitation.

Waleed was placed in solitary confinement in Dhahban Prison near Jeddah on 26 November and for the past week, has been held incommunicado, putting him at heightened risk of torture and other ill-treatment. He has been on hunger strike since 29 November in protest against his ill-treatment. Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director, said:
“The fact that Waleed Abu al-Khair is in prison to begin with, let alone serving a 15-year prison sentence, is outrageous. He was imprisoned under bogus terrorism-related charges simply for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and defending human rights. He is one amongst scores of Saudi women and men being punished for standing up for their fellow citizens’ rights.
“Saudi Arabia just recently assumed the Presidency of the G20, and as it starts paving the way for it, it would serve it well to start matching words to action. It cannot claim to be committed to reforms to the outside world, when inside the Kingdom, it continues to brazenly treat its citizens this way.
“We call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to ensure that Waleed Abu al-Khair is protected from torture or other ill-treatment. They must allow him to contact his lawyer and family and provide him with access to medical care he may require without delay. We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Waleed Abu al-Khair and all other prisoners of conscience currently behind bars in Saudi prisons.”
Background
Waleed Abu al-Khair is a lawyer and human rights defender who has defended numerous victims of human rights violations, as well as other human rights defenders. He was the lawyer of Raif Badawi, a well-known Saudi Arabian blogger who was sentenced in July 2013 to seven years in prison and 600 lashes. Waleed Abu al-Khair was sentenced in 2014 to 15 years in prison, followed by a 15-year travel ban and a fine of approximately US $53,000 on charges which include “disobeying the ruler and seeking to remove his legitimacy”, “insulting the judiciary and questioning the integrity of judges”, “setting up an unlicensed organization”, “harming the reputation of the state by communicating with international organizations” and “preparing, storing and sending information that harms public order”.

His resignation has been accepted by the International Board and he will hand over his responsibilities on today, 5th December.
“I have long considered Amnesty International as one of humanity’s most important global assets, and it is with a heavy heart that I have taken the decision to step down from my position. Now more than ever, the organization needs a Secretary General who is fighting fit and can see through its mandate with vitality that this role, this institution, and the mission of universal human rights deserve,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“It has been a huge privilege to have worked with our excellent and committed staff and volunteers at the International Secretariat as well as with our Sections. I have been inspired by the important and courageous work being done by our movement. But due to my health, I have no choice but to take this painful decision and step down. I need to recover my health and figure out a more sustainable way to continue to contribute to the struggle for justice in the future.”
Kumi took the decision to step down following medical advice after a pre-existing medical condition worsened in recent months.
Amnesty International’s International Board has accepted his resignation and Kumi will hand over his responsibilities to the Deputy Secretary General, Julie Verhaar, with immediate effect. She will now take up the role of Acting Secretary General until a replacement is recruited.
“It is with reluctance, but understanding, that we have accepted Kumi’s resignation. During his tenure as Secretary General he has shown true leadership helping us shape our next global strategy and ensuring that we can meet the human rights challenges facing the world,” said Sarah Beamish, Chair of Amnesty International’s International Board.
Kumi intends to honour several longstanding commitments in his capacity as outgoing Secretary General in the month of December, as long as his state of health permits. He is determined that there should be a carefully phased transition – and he will step down in January when he will start a period of medical leave.

Background and Context
Amnesty International’s 2018 briefing ‘Where Are They?’ documented an intensifying government campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups living in Xinjiang. Most of the detainees’ families have been kept in the dark about the fate of their loved ones and are often too frightened to speak out themselves.
The internment of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang has intensified since March 2017, when a “Regulation on De-extremification” was adopted in the region. Open or even private displays of religious and cultural affiliation, including growing an “abnormal” beard, wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting or avoidance of alcohol, or possessing books or articles about Islam or Uyghur culture can be considered “extremist” under the regulation. The authorities have justified the extreme measures as necessary to counter what they claim to be “terrorism” and to ensure national security.
The case of Yiliyasijiang Reheman, who disappeared while studying in Egypt when the Chinese government pressured the Egyptian government to round up hundreds of Uyghur people in the country, is one of Amnesty’s Write for Rights cases this year.

Scant support for at least 4.5 million Yemenis with disabilities
International donor community falling short in its response 
Millions of people with disabilities in Yemen have not only endured years of armed conflict but are also among those most excluded amid what the United Nations has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, Amnesty International said today.
Excluded: Living with disabilities in Yemen’s armed conflict is being published on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities (3 December). It follows six months of research, including visits to three southern Yemeni governorates and interviews with almost 100 people – documenting the experience of 53 women, men and children with a wide spectrum of disabilities.
“Yemen’s war has been characterized by unlawful bombings, displacement and a dearth of basic services, leaving many struggling to survive. The humanitarian response is overstretched, but people with disabilities – who are already among those most at risk in armed conflict – should not face even greater challenges in accessing essential aid,” said Rawya Rageh, Senior Crisis Advisor at Amnesty International.
“International donors, the United Nations, and humanitarian organizations working with the Yemeni authorities must do more to overcome the barriers that prevent people with disabilities from meeting even their most basic needs.”
Violence and forced displacement
People with disabilities experience compounded difficulties fleeing violence. Many told Amnesty International they undertook exhausting displacement journeys without wheelchairs, crutches or other assistive devices. Almost all of them depended on their families or friends. “The journey was torturous… I was transferred from bus to bus – in total four buses… My neighbour carried me,” said Migdad Ali Abdullah, an 18-year-old with limited mobility and difficulties in communicating, describing the 18-hour trip he took in early 2018 alongside his family from Hodeidah to a displaced persons camp in Lahj.
Some people with disabilities were left behind as their families fled because they were separated in the chaos, or because the trip was too difficult for the person with a disability to undertake.
Where people with disabilities could escape, the journey would often worsen their health condition or impairment. Some acquired a disability, at times because warring parties failed to give effective notice of attacks impacting civilians. A 92-year-old woman who already had limited mobility said she fell, breaking multiple bones, as she was trying to flee fighting in her village in Ta’iz.
In camps for the displaced, Amnesty International observed design flaws affecting people with disabilities. This includes the design of latrines, as well as the location of aid distribution points – both of which strip people with disabilities of their independence and dignity by forcing them to rely on their families or others. A 75-year-old man with limited mobility said he needs to have his sons take him to the latrine: “They drag me. They can’t carry me.”
Staggering needs going unmet
Yemen is a state party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and has laws designed to protect the country’s at least 4.5 million people – 15% of the population – who have disabilities, according to World Health Organization estimates. Reliable data is scarce, and given the impact of the ongoing conflict, some experts believe the actual number is higher.
Public health care and social welfare have been hard hit by Yemen’s war and economic collapse, resulting in a systematic failure to guarantee the rights of people with disabilities. Many rely on handouts or fend for themselves – with some forced into poverty to pay for basic supplies like medicines or adult diapers. One man with a disability was forced to beg along the highway.
Family members said they sold belongings or delayed rent and other crucial payments to prioritize costs associated with supporting a loved one with a disability. The mother of a three-year-old girl with epilepsy and spinal muscular atrophy said:
“I sold the furniture in my house and took her to Sana’a to get her treatment there. … Four months later, I could see she was not moving or laughing or playing. I took her up [to Sana’a] again. … The other day I even asked my friend about selling my kidney. I would sell my kidney and buy her a year’s worth of medication, the shoes she needs and everything else.”
Assistive devices are also in very short supply. People with disabilities who do have them told Amnesty International they are often not fit for purpose – for example, wheelchairs that are no match for the rugged terrain of displacement camps, or ill-fitting prosthetic devices. Southern Yemen has only one prosthetic centre, which has to send some types of prosthetics abroad for repairs.
Yemen’s repeated conflicts have brought on a mental health crisis, with a significant proportion of the population – including many children – severely traumatized. An average 25-year-old Yemeni has lived through 14 armed conflicts in their lifetime. Yet there is hardly any psychosocial support; there are only 40 psychiatrists in the entire country, most of them based in cities.
Need for better inclusion
Amnesty International recognizes that humanitarian organizations are facing enormous challenges in Yemen. But they can take some straightforward actions to improve their response. For example, they should collect and analyse better disaggregated data on the full range of people with disabilities under their care. They should also include people with disabilities directly in the design and delivery of aid, thereby ensuring their right to participate in decisions affecting their lives.
“People with disabilities worldwide rightly demand that no decisions be made ‘about us, without us’ – and Yemen is no exception. International donors must step up to fully fund humanitarian pledges and do a better job of ensuring that people with disabilities in Yemen are not left behind,” said Rasha Mohamed, Yemen Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Relatively simple things can go a long way to address the gaps – like directly seeking input from people with disabilities, providing more and better-suited assistive devices, and providing latrines that meet their specific needs.”

The real figure is likely to be higher.
Dozens of the deaths have been recorded in Shahriar city in Tehran province – one of the cities with the highest death tolls.
“This alarming death toll is further evidence that Iran’s security forces went on a horrific killing spree, that left at least 208 people dead in less than a week. This shocking death toll displays the Iranian authorities’ shameful disregard for human life,” said
Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“Those responsible for this bloody clampdown on demonstrations must be held accountable for their actions. Since the Iranian authorities have previously shown they are unwilling to carry out independent, impartial and effective investigations into unlawful killings and other arbitrary use of force against protesters, we are calling on the international community to help ensure accountability.” 
According to information gathered by Amnesty International, families of victims have been threatened and warned not to speak to the media, or to hold funeral ceremonies for their loved ones. Some have been barred from printing and distributing funeral posters for their loved ones, a tradition in Iran. Some families are also being forced to make extortionate payments to have the bodies of their loved ones returned to them.
Extensive video footage verified and analysed by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps shows security forces shooting at unarmed protesters.
Amnesty International compiled the death toll from reports whose credibility it has ascertained by interviewing a range of sources inside and outside Iran including victims’ relatives, journalists and human rights activists involved in gathering the information. It then crosschecked the information.

Grassy Narrows Youth, Canada 
 
The people of Grassy Narrows, in Ontario, Canada, have been hard-hit by mercury poisoning, after the government allowed a pulp mill to dump 10 tonnes of waste into a river in the 1960s. The damaging effects are still seen today. 
Fishing is an essential part of their way of life. But for more than 50 years mercury has contaminated the fish, making them dangerous to eat. This has robbed the Grassy Narrows people of their health and eroded their culture and traditions. 
Rodney Bruce, aged 25, says, “I’ve always been taught that if you do something wrong, you have to fix it.” 
Jianne Turtle, 13, a member of the Indigenous Anishinaabe community of Grassy Narrows, in Ontario, Canada, agrees. While the community’s youth are fighting for a better future, she says the government “has been talking a lot but hasn’t done anything.” 
While the government has done very little to improve what is currently the country’s worst health crisis, the youth of Grassy Narrows won’t give up their fight until the government keeps its promises. 
Yasaman Aryani, Iran 
 
A flower generously shared, a scarf gently removed: two simple gestures that Yasaman Aryani dared to make on a public train in Iran. It was International Women’s Day 2019 and Yasaman stood up to Iran’s forced veiling laws in a brave act of defiance. She walked through a women-only train carriage, hair boldly uncovered as she handed out flowers. She spoke of her hopes for a future when all women would have the freedom to choose what to wear so that one day they could walk together “me without the hijab and you with the hijab”. 
These moments, captured on video, went viral in March 2019. On 10 April, Iran’s authorities arrested Yasaman, holding her alone in a cell for days while interrogators questioned her. They told her to “confess” that foreign elements were behind her activism and to “repent” her actions. If she didn’t, they would arrest her friends and family. On 31 July, Yasaman learned she had been sentenced to 16 years in prison – she must serve at least 10 years. 
Sarah Mardini and Seán Binder, Greece 
 
In Greece, you can go to jail for trying to save a life. It happened to Sarah Mardini, 24, and Seán Binder, 25, when they volunteered as rescue workers for an organization in Lesvos. Their job was to spot boats in distress at sea and help refugees. They are accused of spying, people-smuggling and belonging to a criminal organization. If found guilty, Sarah and Seán could go to prison for 25 years. They already spent more than 100 days in prison before being released on bail in December 2018. 
“It was horrendous to come to the realisation that we were in prison for having done nothing more but trying to assist people and it was even more frightening to realise that that was happening to many other people across the European Union,” said Seán, now living in Ireland.   
Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, Philippines 
 
Marinel Sumook Ubaldo was 16 when she knew she had to find a way to protect herself and her community from the disastrous effects of climate change. On 13 November 2013, she survived Typhoon Yolanda (known internationally as Typhoon Haiyan) – one of the deadliest typhoons on record. Six years later, Marinel got her degree in social work. A nature lover and well-known youth activist, she spends her spare time campaigning for her community’s rights. 
In September 2018, she went to New York City to give evidence to a landmark investigation into whether fossil fuel companies have violated the human rights of the citizens of the Philippines. The case was brought by survivors of Typhoon Yolanda. 
“I’m not just…a climate statistic,” she told a packed assembly hall. “My story is only one of many, and I’m here to speak on behalf of the vulnerable and the marginalized communities – may our voices be heard.” 
Today, Marinel is calling for climate justice and for the government to take steps to better protect her and her fellow citizens from natural disasters that are being made worse by climate change. 
Nasu Abdulaziz, Nigeria 
 
Nasu Abdulaziz loves cycling, a normal pastime for a young person in Nigeria. Except that Nasu’s circumstances are nowhere near normal. Right now, he’s fighting for his right to a home. 
When he was 23 and should have been enjoying life, men with guns and in bulldozers descended without warning on his community of Otodo Gbame in Nigeria’s, Lagos. Acting on the orders of the government, these men set upon the homes of this century-old community, crushing and burning down houses, shooting families, destroying livelihoods. 
In 2017, the night before the final eviction, Nasu was shot in the arm by hoodlums. The next day, the Lagos State Task force swarmed the community again, shooting at and teargassing them. Panicked residents fled, some jumping into the nearby lagoon and drowning. Nine people were believed to have been killed with another 15 are still missing. 
By the end, 30,000 people were homeless, forced to live in canoes, under bridges or with friends and family. Nasu lost his home but he still has hope. Today, he’s joined the Nigerian Slum/Informal Settlement Federation, a mass movement of people like him who won’t rest until they secure their right to a home. 
“Nobody’s against development. But development should have a human face. Housing is not a privilege. It’s our right,” said Nasu. 
Ibrahim Ezz El-Din, Egypt 
 
Ibrahim Ezz El-Din, 26, is a human rights researcher who lives in Cairo, Egypt. He loves his job, where he researches and reports on people’s access to safe and affordable housing in Egypt – a basic human right. On 11 June 2019, Ibrahim was walking home when four security officers dressed in plain clothes surrounded and arrested him. When his mum found out, she went straight to the local police station, but the police told her Ibrahim was not there, and denied he was detained at all. Ever since that night Ibrahim’s family have been trying to find out what happened to him. Ibrahim is the fifth person linked with his organization, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, to have been disappeared in just three years. 
UPDATE: On November 26th, 2019, after 167 days of enforced disappearance, Ibrahim appeared before the Supreme State Security Prosecution. He was questioned about his human rights work and no evidence was presented against him. Ibrahim, who appeared weak and having lost much weight, told the prosecutor that he was tortured during his detention to extract information about his relationship to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and its work, and was kept in inhumane and degrading conditions of detention, at several security agencies locations. The location of his current detention remains unknown. 
Emil Ostrovko, Belarus 
 
Emil Ostrovko was waiting for his girlfriend at a bus stop on the outskirts of Minsk in April 2018. They were going to spend the day together. Suddenly police officers arrived – they beat Emil and arrested him for distributing illicit drugs. He was just 17. 
Earlier in 2018, Emil had got an after-school job as a courier for an online company. His employer told him the parcels he was delivering contained legal smoking mixtures. After spending months detained, Emil received a 10-year prison sentence for drug trafficking, later reduced to eight years when some charges were dropped. Investigators never looked for the owner of the company, nor anyone else. Only Emil was prosecuted. Now in prison, he hasn’t been allowed to finish high school and his plans to go to university have been crushed. 
Yiliyasijiang Reheman, China 
 
Yiliyasijiang Reheman and his wife Mairinisha Abuduaini were expecting their second baby when he went missing. The young couple were building a new future for themselves. But their lives were shattered in July 2017 when China pressured the Egyptian government to round up hundreds of Uyghur people in the country. Yiliyasijiang was among them. 
Three weeks later, Mairinisha gave birth to their new baby alone. She was just 19. Since 2017, she has been searching for her husband, never losing hope that their family will one day be reunited. Mairinisha, who now lives in Turkey, learned through friends that Yiliyasijiang had been sent back to Xinjiang in China. She suspects he’s in one of China’s secret internment camps where Uyghurs are brainwashed with Chinese government propaganda. 
“My husband should be released as soon as possible,” she says. “Our children need their father. I will never give up until we can be reunited with my husband.” 
José Adrián, Mexico 
 
José Adrián was on his way home from school when police jumped him, threw him against their car and stomped on his neck. He was 14. Adrián had stumbled onto the aftermath of a clash between a group of youths that ended up damaging a police car. 
The police arrested Adrián, with no explanation. They didn’t call his parents and a hearing disability may well have prevented him from communicating well with police during his ordeal. The officers shoved Adrián into their car and drove him to the police station where they strung him up by handcuffs. “They left me for almost, like, half an hour there,” he says. “They hit me on my chest. Then they slapped me across the face.” 
Adrián was finally released after his family paid the fine and the cost of damage to the patrol car – money they couldn’t afford. Adrián dropped out of school because of what happened. After years of seeking justice, Adrián was finally given a hearing aid. He’s keen to leave this behind and start planning for the future, but the police who assaulted him remain unpunished. 
“I want them to clear my name,” he says. “My name which they put on their list. And I don’t want it to ever happen to another child again. That’s all I ask.” 
Magai Matiop Ngong, South Sudan 
 
When Magai Matiop Ngongwas was 15, he was in secondary school, with dreams of helping people when he grew up. But in 2017, he was convicted of murder. At his trial, he told the judge that he was 15 and tried to explain that the killing he was accused of was an accident, but he was sentenced to death by hanging. 
“The feeling is not good at all, to be informed that you are going to die, I am not happy for that…” said Magai. 
Two years after his sentencing, Magai is on death row in Juba central prison waiting for his appeal but he hasn’t lost his “hope…to be out and to continue…school.”

“Challenging power, fighting discrimination: A call to action to recognize and protect women human rights defenders” reveals that these activists continue to be assaulted, threatened, intimidated, criminalized and even killed for their campaigning. This is despite repeated commitments, including the passing of a UN resolution six years ago, to enhance their protection.
“Women human rights defenders are attacked because of who they are and what they do. The risks are even greater for those facing intersecting forms of discrimination – if you are a woman and from a racial minority, indigenous, poor, lesbian, bisexual or trans, a sex worker, you have to fight so much harder to have your voice heard by those in power,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“All over the world, women human rights defenders are speaking out against injustice, abuse and discrimination, often because they have experienced it first-hand. They are central to human progress: they fight for human rights and against patriarchy and racism, while pushing for ground-breaking reforms on so many fronts. Governments must live up to their commitment to ensure these activists can operate freely and safely.”
Politics of demonization
While the feminist human rights movement to protect the rights of women, LGBTI people and other marginalized groups is as robust as ever, it has come under growing pressure in recent years from politicians, religious leaders and violent groups spreading politics of demonization. Because women human rights defenders are often at the forefront of progress, they often are the first to be targeted in increasingly frequent backlashes against a more inclusive, fairer world.
For example, in Poland, women human rights defenders who have led massive street protests against efforts to restrict access to abortion have faced attacks and documented other violations of the rights of women and LGBTI people that are occurring in a climate where racist, anti-immigration sentiment has increased.
Sexual violence
Violence, including sexual violence as a form of torture, is often used against WHRDs to silence them.
In Bahrain, Ebtisam El-Saegh, a WHRD with the human rights organization SALAM for Democracy and Human Rights, was sexually assaulted, badly beaten, kicked in the stomach and kept standing for most of the seven hours she was being interrogated while in detention in 2017.
“I was threatened that they would harm my family and that they would bring my husband and torture and electrocute him. The men told me ‘no one can protect you’,” she told Amnesty International.
In Egypt, Malak al-Kashef, a 19-year-old transgender WHRD was arrested in March 2019 following her involvement in peaceful protests in Cairo. She faced trumped-up charges of “aiding a terrorist organization” and “misusing social media to commit a crime punishable by law”.
While in detention, she was subjected to a forced anal examination and other forms of sexual assault. Even though she was undergoing gender affirming treatment, Malak was placed in an all-male detention facility which put her at increased risk of sexual violence. She was eventually released in July 2019.
Unlike other defenders, WHRDs are more likely to suffer violence and other types of pressure from their partners and family members. They may face domestic violence and abuse based on cultural notions of “honour”, threats of divorce, or being forcibly separated from their children.
Smear campaigns
Women activists are often subjected to smear campaigns which vilify their “deviant behaviour” and are designed to fuel hostility against them.
After rescuing migrants from the central Mediterranean Sea in June 2019, Carola Rackete, the Italian captain of the Sea-Watch 3 rescue boat, was repeatedly insulted by the Italian Minister of Interior who called her a pirate and a criminal. His slurs were followed by vicious verbal attacks by others who incited sexual violence against her while also targeting her gender and appearance.
In Mauritania, Mekfoula Brahim, a WHRD who has campaigned for an end to female genital mutilation, was branded an apostate in 2016 Facebook posts after defending a blogger sentenced to death for criticising those who use religion to discriminate minorities. The slur exposed her to the risk of being prosecuted and sentenced to death.
Amnesty International is calling on states to investigate attacks on WHRDs and hold those responsible to account. States must also educate the public about people’s right to defend all human rights, as well as provide funding and protection mechanisms tailored to the needs of WHRDs. “Crucially, all  those  with power must recognize women human rights defenders as key agents of change in securing justice, equality, peace and sustainable development. These women need to be celebrated and protected for the courageous work they do to improve all our lives, but especially those of the most marginalised communities,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Background:
Women human rights defenders (WHRDs) is an inclusive term that represents the struggle for recognition of the specific challenges faced by women who engage in the defence of any human right, and people of all genders who defend women’s rights or work on a range of gender-related issues and sexuality.
Amnesty International has long worked alongside WHRDs and is part of the Women Human Rights Defenders International Coalition. For this report, published on 29 November to mark International Women Human Rights Defenders Day, the organization drew from its analysis and research and also that of other allies. Additionally, the report contains fresh input from 23 activists in 21 countries interviewed between February and April 2019.

World leaders must address the Kingdom’s heinous human rights record as Saudi Arabia assumes the presidency of the G20 global economic forum, said Amnesty International today. Saudi Arabia is set to assume the presidency of the G20 on 1 December and next year’s G20 summit will be held in Riyadh.
The organization urges G20 members, to pressure the Saudi Arabian authorities to commit to end the patterns of egregious human rights violations. Member states of the G20 that continue to profit from the arms trade with Saudi Arabia, including the USA, UK and France, must consider the extent to which they are complicit in human rights violations committed by the Saudi Arabia led coalition in the conflict in Yemen, and cease such transfers until these violations have been remedied.  
“Saudi Arabia steps up to the G20 presidency amid a new wave of arbitrary arrests of peaceful critics, with many human rights defenders still languishing behind bars, and just over a year since the horrifying killing of Jamal Khashoggi. World leaders in the G20 must pressure Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to ensure enjoyment of all human rights including freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s MENA Regional Director.
“The G20 leaders must not continue to ignore the Kingdom’s horrendous human rights record for the sake of lucrative business ties. As President of the G20, Saudi Arabia is responsible for ensuring the issues it has placed on the G20 agenda are addressed in ways which achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including fair economic growth, tackling climate change, energy, food and water security and women’s empowerment. How can a country with such an appalling human rights record at home ensure respect for human rights in such an important international process?”
Saudi Arabia has an appalling human rights record. The authorities have systematically carried out arbitrary arrests targeting peaceful activists, journalists, academics and women human rights defenders, as well as executions following unfair trials and routine torture and other ill-treatment in custody.
The country’s leading women human rights defenders remain on trial since March 2019 for their peaceful human rights activism and work to promote women’s rights in the country. The authorities also continue to detain without charges scores of individuals for their peaceful expression or support for reforms. Almost a year following the extrajudicial execution of Jamal Khashoggi there has been no accountability. In April 2019, the authorities carried out a mass execution of 37 men, the majority of whom were executed following grossly unfair trials. At least 15 of those executed told the court that their “confessions” extracted through torture, however, the court failed to investigate their allegations and convicted to death.

It is vital that all governments make commitments to intensify their efforts to address the climate emergency, and that human rights are made central to this. Action taken to combat climate change must not come at the cost of human rights, including Indigenous rights, or deepen inequalities. 
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has raised the alarm that in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, global greenhouse gas emissions must be halved by 2030. It is critical that rich countries, including Canada, which bear the greatest responsibility for causing the climate crisis and have the most resources, take swift and urgent action to: reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions in a fast and fair way that respects human rights; provide support to affected communities and individuals to address loss and damage caused by the climate crisis; and provide financial and technological resources to countries in the global south to facilitate their efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to the climate emergency. 
The Canadian government must also ensure: human rights defenders, including climate activists, are able to defend and promote human rights without fear of punishment and intimidation; climate policies do not increase gender and intersecting forms of inequality; and the full participation of Indigenous peoples in the design and implementation of climate solutions, while ensuring that all climate policies conform to the UN Declaration on Indigenous Peoples and the principle of free, prior informed consent.

0,Mexico: Amnesty International issues warning about lack of progress on human rights after one year of the new government,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/mexico-amnesty-international-issues-warning-about-lack-progress-human-rights-after-one-year-new/,"Nearly one year after Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office as president, his government has failed to make substantial progress on resolving the human rights crisis in Mexico, said Amnesty International today, when presenting an assessment of some of the most important issues on the national...","Nearly one year after Andrés Manuel López Obrador took office as president, his government has failed to make substantial progress on resolving the human rights crisis in Mexico, said Amnesty International today, when presenting an assessment of some of the most important issues on the national agenda, in the report “When words are not enough”.
“President López Obrador’s government has shown it is willing to take some measures on some issues, especially on disappearances in the country. However, after one year in government, there has been no substantial change in the lives of the millions of people facing an extremely serious human rights crisis that has now lasted for more than a decade. The extremely high levels of violence that threaten the right to life, the widespread use of torture, the alarming levels of violence against women and a militarized public security strategy that is as present as ever are all signs of the tragic situation in Mexico,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
In August, the government took a positive step when it confirmed that Mexico would accept the competence of the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances to examine reports on individual cases, addressing one of the repeated demands made by families of disappeared persons and human rights organizations. However, the government has not yet implemented this measure.
“There is an enormous inconsistency between what the government says and what it does. It promises more humane treatment for migrants who need international protection but sends the National Guard to pursue and detain them. It says it will protect human rights defenders and journalists, but publicly discredits them. It is worrying that human rights violations continue to be the rule in Mexico rather than the exception”, added Erika Guevara-Rosas.
President López Obrador’s government has not moved far from the highly militarized security strategy of his predecessors, it has refused to recognize that torture is commonplace and has hardened the country’s stance on migration. It has also unduly restricted and put at risk the freedom of peaceful assembly and has consistently stigmatized journalists and civil society organizations that have criticized its policies, maintaining the hostile environment against journalists and human rights defenders and their organizations.
Furthermore, gender-based violence against women and girls remains widespread in Mexico. Government policies and the introduction of legislation have not been enough to deal with the growing number of killings, disappearances and other grave human rights violations of the rights of women and girls throughout the country. Although the government took a positive step in September, when it introduced a parliamentary bill that could pave the way for an amnesty for women who have had an abortion, there is still much to do to guarantee sexual and reproductive rights in the country.
“Many challenges remain on the issue of gender-based violence. The most urgent is to eradicate femicides. Between January and 30 September this year, there were 748 victims of femicide in Mexico, with the monthly number rising. There is no sign of practical short- or medium-term measures that would overcome the reluctance to correctly investigate cases of femicide and end impunity”, said Tania Reneaum Panszi, executive director at Amnesty International Mexico.
Amnesty International believes that substantial progress on human rights requires the government to stop blaming previous governments for the situation, accept responsibility for what is happening right now, seek solutions to the serious problems in this field and make human rights and Mexico’s international obligations an essential component of all its policies.
The organization’s recommendations to the López Obrador administration call on it to: demilitarize the National Guard; formulate a comprehensive public policy to prevent and protect human rights defenders and journalists who focus on public interest and community issues; end the illegal practice of turning back irregular migrants and provide asylum to people whose life is at risk; and conduct thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the gender-based killing of women.
Other issues that the government must urgently address include the rights of indigenous peoples and the protection of their territories, violence against LGBTI people, sexual and reproductive rights and social and economic rights.
“President López Obrador’s government has a strong mandate and a historical opportunity to change the country’s direction. We urge it to step up to the challenge of beginning a new stage in the country’s history, one that respects the human rights of all people”, said Tania Reneaum Panszi.

On 17 September 2019, the day Canada formally acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), the Deputy Ministers of International Trade and Foreign Affairs signed off on a redacted memorandum which indicates that, while Saudi Arabia’s overall human rights record remains “problematic,” federal officials “did not identify any existing permits or pending applications that would be of concern under the standard robust risk assessment framework.”
GAC appears to have concluded that, because it could not identify any credible evidence linking prior Canadian exports to contraventions of international law, future arms exports do not pose a substantial risk of being used to commit such crimes.  This leap in logic is not supported by any evidence in the unredacted portions of the memo.  Alarmingly, the report is entirely dismissive of the findings of the United Nations Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen report, which confirmed that over the past five years, the conflict in Yemen has given rise to a multitude of war crimes. Importantly, the report specifically raises concerns about the involvement of parties to the Arms Trade Treaty in perpetuating the conflict, characterizing ongoing transfers by Arms Trade Treaty parties as “questionable.” 
The memo notes that a further 48 permit applications for controlled exports to Saudi Arabia have been deemed ready for approval, which means the ball is now squarely in Minister François-Philippe Champagne’s court. Under the law, he must consider whether these exports would undermine peace and security, or could be used to facilitate serious violations of international law. Moreover, Article 6 of the Arms Trade Treaty contains an absolute prohibition on transfers where there is knowledge that the weapons would be used to commit attacks against the civilians or civilian objects – the very acts which have taken place regularly in the conflict in Yemen. With the death toll in this war reportedly surpassing 100,000 last month, we think the answer should be more than clear. – Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, Amnesty International Canada.
“The Canadian government says there is no evidence that previously exported Canadian material was used to commit war crimes or serious violations of international humanitarian law. There is therefore no significant risk that Canadian material will be used in such crimes in the future. This is an extremely narrow and erroneous interpretation of the ATT. There is ample evidence that a wide variety of Saudi military equipment has been systematically used in fighting in Yemen, in violation of IHL. There is therefore a significant risk that Canadian equipment will be used in the same way. Having joined the ATT, Canada must now indicate whether it will become a leader in strengthening global arms control and reducing human suffering through stricter standards of IHL compliance.” Anne Duhamel, Director of Policy and Campaigns, Oxfam-Québec.
“Despite heavy redactions and crucial omissions, the memorandum paints a grim, troubling picture of Saudi Arabia’s human-rights record, both within its borders and in neighbouring Yemen. It specifically acknowledges grave human rights violations, such as unlawful killings, including executions for non-violent offenses, as well as restrictions on women’s rights and basic freedoms. It further acknowledges “gross violations” of international human rights and humanitarian law by Saudi Arabia in the context of the Yemen conflict. In fact, the memorandum makes a strong case for the immediate cancellation of Canadian arms exports to Saudi Arabia, yet it disconcertingly reaches the opposite conclusion and lays the groundwork for Canada’s continued complicity with a known human-rights pariah. This review constituted a major test of Canada’s promises of increased rigour around the arms trade since it joined the international Arms Trade Treaty in September—and it is failing miserably.” – Cesar Jaramillo, Executive Director, Project Ploughshares.

“Today’s vindictive request by the State Prosecutor for jail terms of up to 15 years ignores the evidence and defies all logic.
“The terrorist allegations made against Taner, İdil and four others have been repeatedly disproven over the course of nine previous hearings and it is clear today, as it has been from the start, that the Istanbul 10 and Taner are on trial for nothing more than their human rights work. They must be acquitted.”
If convicted, they risk up to 15 years imprisonment. The next, and presumably final trial hearing, is set to take place on 19 February 2020.

BACKGROUND 
The State Prosecutor requested the conviction of Taner Kılıç on the allegation of “membership of a terrorist organization” and İdil Eser, Günal Kurşun, Özlem Dalkıran, Nejat Taştan and Veli Acu on “assisting a terrorist organization without being a member”. The State Prosecutor requested that Ali Gharavi, İlknur Üstün, Nalan Erkem, Peter Steudtner and Şeyhmus Özbekli be acquitted.
Three of the human rights defenders on trial who are lawyers (Taner Kılıç, Nalan Erkem and Şeyhmus Özbekli) could also lose their licences to practice law after a conviction for a terrorism-related offence.

Gary was a lifelong champion of human rights and was always the first person in any room to find ways to engage, empower, and defend youth advocates. The NYAAC hopes to channel Gary’s fighting spirit and caring disposition in all our future endeavours.* 
Young people around the world are leading the charge against oppression, poverty, climate change, colonialism, sexism, racism, inequality, and repression. But they are also disproportionately vulnerable to persecution and violence. This year, all 10 cases for Write for Rights champions cases of young people across the world – including Canada – who fight for justice and have had their human rights attacked.  
It has been over 50 years since a mill in Dryden, Ontario, dumped more than 10 metric tons of mercury into the Wabigoon-English river system, which was a primary source of food, water, livelihood and cultural identity for the people of Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation (also known as Grassy Narrows First Nation). It has been over 50 years of federal and provincial governments ignoring their cries for justice and fundamental human rights. It has been over 50 years of resilience from the Grassy Narrows community that has produced generation after generation of activists who continue to fight for a better future for themselves and their descendants to come. 
 
No longer can the young people of Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation be ignored. It is up to every single one of us – right now – to create positive change by acting on our conscience with hope for a better future for everyone.  
Hear from Amnesty International Canada’s National Youth Action and Advisory Committee (NYAAC) members on why now, more than ever, it is essential to stand in solidarity with youth activists around the world and practice active allyship.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Youth have a place in the resistance. We always have, this has been highlighted through the cases chosen this year for Write for Rights. Youth living in the geopolitical state of Canada have been organizing for change this past year around climate strikes, mercury poisoning in Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation in response to provincial cuts made to education and healthcare in Ontario, and during the campaigning season of the recent federal election.  
Seeing youth highlighted this year for Write for Rights demonstrated to the NYAAC that borders cannot separate us, and oppressive forces seeking to keep us quiet and complicit, will not stop us. The current rhetoric that surrounds the Global North is an ‘us vs. them’ ideology as a result of on-going colonialism, capitalism, and globalization. The NYAAC, as young people, call on other youth to actively problematize and organize against these discourses.  
We are the future of the world, and we need to take action now to rectify human rights abuses against other youth internationally, in order to move forward together. We wish to live in a world where youth are given a fair trial, able to defend our communities and the Earth against abuses, freely and openly practice our faiths, advocate for the rights of others, help who we want to help, and wear what we want to wear.  
Youth have strong voices, ideas, and thoughts, and they deserve to be heard. This Write for Rights season, we fight for all!

Three men claimed that Nigerian government officials and Shell staff offered them money and promises of jobs and houses to testify against the Ogoni Nine. They said that, together with other prosecution witnesses, they were asked to sign statements that had been prepared for them and instructed to make specific statements during the Ogoni Nine court hearing aimed at incriminating the men. Renowned activist Ken Saro-Wiwa, Barinem Kiobel and the others had been accused of involvement in the murder of four traditional rulers, who were opposed to Saro-Wiwa’s campaign against the oil industry. 
Esther Kiobel and three other women – Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula – accuse Shell of being complicit in the unlawful arrest, detention and execution of their husbands. The men were hanged in 1995 along with Ken Saro-Wiwa and four other men after they were convicted in a blatantly unfair trial. For more than twenty years Shell has escaped scrutiny over its role in these tragic events. 
At the case’s first hearing in February 2019, Esther and Victoria were both allowed to speak to the court and gave moving testimonies regarding their late husbands and subsequent struggles for justice. It was the first time either had had such an opportunity. Esther described it as very emotional and powerful for her. 
We applaud the courage and persistence of Esther, Victoria, Blessing and Charity. Amnesty has shared over 30,000 solidarity messages with Esther, and is supporting her case.

2002: Esther Kiobel first sued Shell in the USA, where she had been granted asylum. 
2013: US Supreme Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over the case, meaning US courts never got to examine the facts of the case. 
2017: Esther Kiobel filed a new civil case against Shell in The Netherlands, Shell’s home state, together with Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula. 
February 2019: The District Court of The Hague heard the first arguments in Esther’s case against Shell. This was also the first time Esther Kiobel and Victoria Bera were allowed to speak to the court. Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula, who still live in Nigeria, were refused visas to travel to Europe. 
May 2019: Court ruled that the case was not time-barred and that the court did have jurisdiction over the case. It ordered that the plaintiffs’ lawyers hear witnesses and provide further evidence as to whether Shell bribed people to testify against the Ogoni Nine. The court also ruled that Shell hand over some internal documents concerning communication within Shell about the trial of the Ogoni Nine. However, it did not order the release of other confidential internal documents requested by the plaintiffs’ legal team.

“China’s continued denial of the existence of detention centres in Xinjiang grows ever more futile in the face of ever-mounting evidence. This latest leak is yet further proof of its systematic persecution of ethnic and religious minorities in China on a sickeningly vast scale.
“The abuses described in these leaked documents match the harrowing testimony Amnesty International has received from former detainees of mass internment camps in Xinjiang, as well as from relatives of those still missing.
“With each passing week, the world learns more about the horror China is unleashing on its own citizens in Xinjiang. It is time for the Chinese government to ditch its feeble counter-narrative, including the claim of providing ‘vocational training’ to people in the camps. Instead they should provide immediate answers to the hundreds of thousands of people desperate for information about their loved ones.
“If China has nothing to hide, it should allow truly independent human rights monitors immediate and unfettered access to Xinjiang – something it has steadfastly refused to do so far, despite repeated requests from Amnesty International and others.
“These damning leaks should be the catalyst for the international community to increase pressure on the Chinese authorities to end this human rights catastrophe.”
Background
Amnesty International’s 2018 briefing ‘Where Are They?’ documented an intensifying government campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups living in Xinjiang.
Most of the detainees’ families have been kept in the dark about the fate of their loved ones and are often too frightened to speak out themselves.
The internment of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang has intensified since March 2017, when a “Regulation on De-extremification” was adopted in the region. Open or even private displays of religious and cultural affiliation, including growing an “abnormal” beard, wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting or avoidance of alcohol, or possessing books or articles about Islam or Uyghur culture can be considered “extremist” under the regulation.
The authorities have justified the extreme measures as necessary to counter what they claim to be “terrorism” and to ensure national security. 
Leaked documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) – and shared with 17 international media partners – on Sunday revealed the framework that the Chinese government set up to build the facilities that led to abuse of hundreds of thousands of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups who are being subjected to brainwashing and other ill-treatment in detention camps in Xinjiang. This followed the leak of 400 pages of internal documents to the New York Times last week.

Others have spoken out on condition of anonymity, alleging that they were inappropriately groped or strip-searched during arrest or detention. Ng told a press conference that a police officer hit her breasts while she was in detention after being arrested at a protest. She later told a packed university hall, “I am not the only one,” alleging that many other protesters had been subjected to different forms of sexual violence. She then removed her face mask to reveal her identity. Amnesty International is calling for an independent investigation into the use of force by Hong Kong police.
Here is Sonia’s story in her own words:
Before this movement, I hated Hong Kong. I used to feel like I didn’t have much in common with people here and the lack of progress in the fight for democracy made me feel like we were weak.
But after everything I’ve experienced, I am very proud to call myself a Hong Konger.
After I spoke out about my experience of sexual violence at the hands of the police, many strangers have given me strength. They sent me cards, gave me teddy bears, or made me soup or cake. Every bit of their love supports me to keep on going.
People stood up for me in other ways, too. When I was detained at Sun Uk Ling Detention Center on Aug. 31, the duty officer put me under a level two strip search, which meant I had to remove my clothes. I will always remember the kindness of a social worker who was present and argued with the police. She got them to adjust the search so I that I didn’t have to strip. It showed me the importance of asserting yourself and making sure that people around you — vulnerable people, and people who are being arrested — know their rights.
I have also faced a backlash for speaking out. People have said things about me like “She is promiscuous,” or they’ve tried to smear me by saying that I provide sex for money. I’ve had people ask things like “how much do you charge a night?”
Others have questioned whether I’m telling the truth, and they’ve said things about my family background and my mental health. People don’t want to acknowledge the issues I raised — they’d rather take out the person who raises them.
In the first few days after I spoke out, I thought about running away. But I decided to face this head on — a lifetime of running away means a lifetime of not breaking the cycle.
I also know that other people have experienced far worse. I was not physically beaten up by the police, and I did not lose an eye or a tooth. Compared with the injuries others have suffered, mine were nothing. If these people can find such a strong will to live, I can as well.
Some people are suggesting that female protesters shouldn’t go to the front line because of the risk of being sexually assaulted by the police. This decision is up to individuals, but I wouldn’t advise women against going to the front. The protests need people.
We all know that Hong Kong is our home, and we have to stand up bravely regardless of our gender.
Women’s groups in Hong Kong are working very hard advocating for women’s rights. A group called Rainlily is doing a great job getting the message out that women don’t need to feel timid about speaking out about sexual violence and should not pay attention remarks that are shaming. They’re also showing people where they can go to get professional support.
After this movement, you can see there is an enormous change that is taking place in our society. It’s really challenging the negative perceptions that people have about Hong Kong.
When they say Hong Kongers only care about money — look at all the people who are donating. When they say Hong Kongers do not care about others — look how they shed tears for a stranger who has died. When they say Hong Kongers kowtow to whoever holds power — look how people are getting together to strike.
It is true that for Hong Kong to stand up to the Chinese Communist Party is like throwing straws into the wind. But this is our home and we must put up a good fight to the end. After this movement, I truly feel Hong Kong is my home. I love this place and I love the people here even more. I still believe there can be a change. As long as there is still a movement, as long as this fire remains in our hearts, we still have a chance.

According to credible reports received by the organization, those killed include at least 143 people. The deaths have resulted almost entirely from the use of firearms. One man was reported to have died after inhaling tear gas, another after being beaten. Amnesty International believes that the death toll is significantly higher and is continuing to investigate.
“The rising death toll is an alarming indication of just how ruthless the treatment of unarmed protesters has been by the Iranian authorities and reveals their appalling assault on human life,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
So far, while the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the EU and a number of states have condemned what they have described as apparent use of excessive force, these responses have failed to explicitly acknowledge the use of lethal force to kill protesters, despite mounting evidence.
“The international community’s cautious and muted response to the unlawful killing of protesters is woefully inadequate. They must condemn these killings in the strongest possible terms and describe these events for what they are – the deadly and wholly unwarranted use of force to crush dissent,” said Philip Luther.
Horrific accounts from eyewitnesses and victims’ relatives on the ground, information gathered from human rights activists and journalists outside Iran and extensive video footage analysed by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps provide clear evidence that Iranian security forces have been intentionally using firearms against unarmed protesters who posed no threat to life.
Verified videos show security forces deliberately shooting unarmed protesters from a short distance. In some cases, protesters were shot while they were running away and clearly posed no threat to the security forces. Other videos show security forces shooting towards protesters from rooftops of state buildings including a justice department building.
Security forces responsible for the crackdown include Iran’s police force, the Revolutionary Guards and plain-clothes agents from the Basij paramilitary force and others.
Amnesty International has received information indicating that, in many cases, the Iranian authorities have refused to return victims’ bodies to their families and, in some, security forces have removed dead bodies from morgues and transferred them to unknown locations.
In some cases, there are shocking reports that, when the authorities have returned victims’ bodies to their families, they have demanded payment citing several reasons, including the cost of the bullet that killed their loved one or compensation for property destroyed during the protests; these allegations have been denied by at least one official in Khuzestan province. In a pattern consistent with previous protester killings, the authorities have threatened victims’ families with arrest if they hold funerals for their loved ones or to speak to media.
Amnesty International has also received reports of the authorities moving injured protesters from hospitals to detention facilities, putting their lives at risk by denying them potentially life-saving medical care.
Under international law, security forces may only resort to the use of lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect against imminent threat of death or serious injury.
Even if a small minority of protesters resort to violence, security forces must always exercise restraint and use no more force than is strictly necessary, proportionate and lawful in response to the violence they are facing.
Background:
Below is a breakdown, by province, of the 143 deaths reported so far to Amnesty International. The organization obtained the information from reports whose credibility and reliability it has ascertained by interviewing victim’s relatives, journalists and human rights activists involved in gathering them. It has then crosschecked the information. 
Alborz province: 9
East Azerbaijan province: 1
Esfahan province: 7
Fars province: 15
Kerman province: 1

Police officers successfully protected the event, known as Trans March, allowing up to one hundred activists to peacefully exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. We believe that the actions taken by Amnesty activists as a result of an Amnesty Urgent Action as well as advocacy by Amnesty Ukraine contributed significantly towards ensuring the protection of the 2019 Trans March. Organizers of the Trans March have thanked activists for their support. 
The successful protection of the Trans March comes in striking contrast to a similar event in 2018, when police failed to protect participants, did not take action against members of violent groups who attacked the march, and instead forced transgender rights activists into a nearby metro station effectively terminating their peaceful assembly. 
This year the Trans March began at Mykhailivska Square in central Kyiv with a minute of silence and followed with speeches by transgender rights activists. The participants of the Trans March were protected by a police cordon from members of groups openly advocating hatred and discrimination, who had assembled nearby. The police successfully curbed at least one attempt to breach the cordon. 
Twenty minutes after the beginning of the gathering, transgender rights activists proceeded to march through the central streets of Kyiv. The marchers’ column was protected by dozens of police officers. There were also dozens of police officers patrolling nearby streets and areas from which the marchers could be potentially attacked, including on their way back from the event. The march ended at Poshtova Square and all participants were able to safely leave the area using a nearby metro station.

The Ukrainian authorities must ensure the safety and security of all participants in the Trans March taking place in Kyiv tomorrow, Amnesty International said, warning that participants are at serious risk of violent attacks. In 2018 the police failed to protect participants in a similar peaceful rally from violent groups who hurled abuse and threw smoke grenades.
“Last year the Ukrainian police showed inexcusable inaction in the face of homophobic and transphobic attacks. Groups advocating hatred and discrimination took full advantage of the police’s failure and subjected peaceful marchers to severe abuse,” said Oksana Pokalchuk, Amnesty International Ukraine’s Director.
“Tomorrow we are calling on the Ukrainian authorities to send a clear message that they will stand up for the LGBTI community. During the most recent Pride marches in Kyiv the police demonstrated that they are able to effectively protect LGBTI events, and we urge them to follow their own example tomorrow. They must create a safe space for transgender rights activists to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.
“Last year was an important lesson for the authorities in Ukraine. Tomorrow they have a chance to demonstrate that they are committed to protecting the rights of everyone in the country, and send a message that hatred will not be tolerated.”
Background
The Trans March will take place on Mykhailivska Square in central Kyiv at 12.00 pm on 23 November to mark Transgender Day of Remembrance.

Marketers are presented with all sorts of problems with their work, but being on a platform predicated on human rights abuses isn’t normally one of them. 
This is exactly what has happened to an industry reliant on Facebook and Google with the publication of Amnesty International’s latest report, Surveillance Giants. 
These platforms allow people to access them supposedly for free, but instead of charging them a fee they require people to give up their personal data. This is then analysed to aggregate people into groups, and to make predictions about their interests and characteristics – primarily so they can use these insights to generate advertising revenue. The report found that the scale of harvesting and monetising of personal data by these platforms is incompatible with people’s right to privacy. 
Even though the main calls in the report are to governments and how they must regulate the industry, it behoves us all to look at the roles we play. 
At Amnesty, we are just as dependent on these platforms as big corporations, political parties, and local businesses in order to reach, engage and grow our audiences. The pervasive power of these platforms is exactly why Amnesty has brought out a report on them. 
What are our options? We cannot vacate them. They aren’t just the public square any more. They are the main street and business district. They could become your doctor’s surgery and your bank. They are the whole darn town and village. 
Taking our work off Facebook and Google right now would therefore be bad for human rights as it would hamper our ability to spread our message. There simply is no other viable alternative to reach the public. 
For the time being then, the most ethical thing we can do is be open about our dilemma and what we are doing about it. We’ll keep talking with our audiences about this.   
I’ve heard people within the advertising industry say that no alternative can emerge to Facebook and Googles’ hegemony. What this ignores is that Silicon Valley is built on the romance of entrepreneurs starting in their garages. Something else may well be built in the months and years to come, especially if government creates the right environment for it. 
That should be a spur to the tech giants to reform. They were once catalysts for freedom, playing major roles in the toppling of dictators. They played on this upstart quality for a long time. Now they are seen as part of a nexus of big corporate and political interests. This will bring in the cash in the short-term, but it does also open up the possibility for new entrants. 
There will be many like Amnesty who are grappling with this conundrum. We are trying to pull off the difficult balancing act of carrying out our duty to spread our human rights message while spending money with companies profiting from problematic surveillance. The reputational risk grows with every scandal. 
There are a lot of vested interests in how big tech currently works. Given they also operate extensive lobbying efforts on the very governments that should take action on them, there is every reason to think they can’t self-regulate. This is why we have also set up a taskforce to look at what future options may exist to reach and engage communities. We want to speak with people across the sector to think big. Please get in touch if you think you can help. 
This is a tough hill to climb. We do it while holding our nose with one hand and holding a placard calling for reform with the other.

Amnesty International issues first “Urgent Action” for entire population of a major city
Pakistan government accused of downplaying crisis 
In an unprecedented step, Amnesty International has issued an Urgent Action for the people of Lahore in a bid to mobilize its supporters around the world to campaign on behalf of the entire population due to the hazardous smog engulfing Pakistan’s second largest city.
The “Urgent Action” raises concerns about how the poor air quality poses a risk to the health of every person in the Pakistani city of more than 10 million people.
“The government’s inadequate response to the smog in Lahore raises significant human rights concerns. The hazardous air is putting everyone’s right to health at risk,” said Rimmel Mohydin, South Asia Campaigner at Amnesty International.
“The issue is so serious that we are calling on our members around the world to write to the Pakistani authorities to tell them to stop downplaying the crisis and take urgent action to protect people’s health and lives.”
For one in every two days this month, the air quality here has been classified as “hazardous” by air quality monitors installed by the United States Consulate in Lahore and the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative. 
The government shut schools down on at least three days this month.
Urgent Actions are a campaigning tool that Amnesty International has used for decades to mobilise support internationally for victims of human rights violations and for prisoners of conscience. Previous subjects have included former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the last Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel, members of the Russian feminist punk group Pussy Riot, Guantanamo Bay prisoners, and Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman falsely accused of blasphemy and sentenced to death for it.
Not a single day of healthy air this year
The air quality in Lahore has deteriorated to “hazardous” levels in November this year. Air quality measuring systems advise people to avoid all outdoor activity when that happens.
Air becomes unhealthy when the AQI level reaches 100. At 300 and above, the air is considered “hazardous”.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Lahore reached 580 at 11pm on 7 November. Since the beginning of the month, at least seven days have seen air quality reach hazardous levels.
Reports have shown how prolonged or heavy exposure to hazardous air can result in severe health issues including asthma, lung damage, bronchial infections, heart problems and shortened life expectancy – putting in danger people’s rights to life and to health.
The so-called “smog season” – which runs from October to February – is where poor fuel quality, uncontrolled emissions and crop burning worsens the quality of the already unhealthy air in Punjab.
Lahore has not had a single day of healthy air this year, according to the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a citizen-led effort that crowdsources and collates data on air quality. 
According to a 2015 report published by the UK medical journal, Lancet, more than 310,000 people die each year in Pakistan because of poor air quality.
Teenagers sue government for violating rights to life and health
On 4 November, three teenage girls – Laiba Siddiqi, Leila Alam and Mishael Hayat– filed a suit against the government of Punjab for the “violation of their fundamental right to a clean and healthy environment.”
In the petition, the three students said the government had been downplaying the scale of crisis because its standards of measurement differ from what is used in other countries and accepted internationally. An AQI of 185, the petition adds, at the Meteorological Department station in Lahore is classified as “satisfactory” on the EPD website but counts as “Moderately Polluted” in China and India, and “Unhealthy” in Singapore, South Korea and the United States.
“Today, people are not aware of just how much danger they are in because of the air they breathe. If the expertise is available, if the consequences are dire, if the evidence of the damage is mounting, then the government must not waste time. A good starting point would be to acknowledge the risks of the quality of air and initiate smog protection protocol as recommended by the court-appointed Smog Commission,” said Rimmel Mohydin.
Background
Health is a key human right indispensable to exercise other human rights and is recognized in numerous international treaties that Pakistan has ratified, including, Article 12.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 11.1 (f) and 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women of 1979 and Article 24 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child of 1989. Failing to adequately resect, protect and fulfil the right to health would amount to a human rights violation.
In his March 2019 report, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment described the components of the “right to breathe clean air”, which included monitoring air quality and impacts on human health; and making information about air quality publicly available. 
Cities across South Asia are consistently reporting ‘unhealthy’ or ‘hazardous’ air quality levels. Delhi has been cloaked in smog that has consistently surpassed the range that is measurable by air quality monitors of 999. In Pakistan, Karachi, Peshawar and other cities in Punjab also show signs of worsening air quality.
Low income workers, such as labourers, construction workers and farmhands, and marginalized groups are particularly vulnerable as the nature of their work forces them to be exposed to hazardous air throughout the day. The fact that health care is not easily affordable to all means that only those who can afford it will be able to access health care and other preventative measures to mitigate the effects of breathing in hazardous air.

Almaas was hit by a bullet on 20 November while she was travelling in a car inside the Halane compound in the capital Mogadishu. She died later in hospital as the result of the injuries she sustained. The circumstances of her killing remain unclear.
“We send our deepest condolences to Almaas’ family and the entire human rights community in Somalia who continue to fight injustice and push for respect for human rights despite the risks,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“While the authorities have launched an investigation into Almaas’ killing, they must ensure that it is impartial, thorough, and effective, and that anyone suspected to be responsible is brought to justice in a fair trial. The authorities must also make the findings of the investigation public as soon as it is concluded.”
Almaas was a prominent and dedicated activist. She worked on social justice, women’s rights and the rehabilitation of children affected by conflict in Somalia. She was also associated with the Elman Peace Centre, an organization working to promote peace in Somalia. Her sister, Ilwad Elman, was nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting peace in Somalia.
Her father, Elman Ali Ahmed, also a peace activist, was assassinated for his work in Mogadishu in 1996.

On his first day as Canada’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General, the Honourable David Lametti should drop its application for judicial review and stay of the ruling and work with the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society to develop a plan for children, youth, and families to access compensation.
As organizations committed to the well-being of all children and to the respect of children’s rights, we have been witnesses to the CHRT case of First Nations child welfare and Jordan’s Principle.
We witnessed as Canada’s conduct was found to be wilful and reckless in discriminating against First Nations children in care.
We witnessed when Canada was ordered to pay compensation for those who were wrongly removed from their families or denied essential services.
And we witnessed Canada file for judicial review, opting to continue to fight First Nations children in court.
In our work, we have witnessed the effects of the harm of Canada’s discrimination in child and family services.
We are prepared to be a witness again on November 25th and 26th, when children head back to court to ask that the government respect their right to safety, family, and culture.
But we would rather witness justice.
Today, on your first day as Minister of Justice and Attorney General, we ask that you act in the best interest of children. Please honour the CHRT ruling, drop Canada’s judicial review, and act without delay to compensate the First Nations children, youth and families Canada has harmed.

Amnesty International Canada and Above Ground are accompanying Isabel Zuleta, a spokesperson for the coalition Movimiento Ríos Vivos, in her meetings with officials.
EDC’s president and CEO recently acknowledged that the Hidroituango project, which was financed in part by EDC, led to “an environmental, economic and human catastrophe” after the dam nearly collapsed in 2018, forcing the evacuation of 25,000 people. Another financier, the Inter-American Development Bank, announced last month an investigation into its support for the dam.
The damage caused by the project to Colombia’s second-largest river has placed the health, subsistence and livelihoods of tens of thousands of people at risk. Community leaders also warn of mounting security threats faced by people who’ve spoken out against the project.
“This mega-project has not only destroyed families’ homes, ways of life and food sources, it has been imposed through violence and the forced displacement of the population, who are victims of the armed conflict,” says Zuleta.
“Amnesty International warned in 2013 that opponents of Hidroituango were being threatened and attacked,” says Kathy Price, Colombia campaigner at Amnesty International Canada. “Since then, more than 150 security incidents have been reported, including brutal assassinations of people who spoke out against the environmental and human rights impacts of the megaproject. Canada can no longer look away.”
A report by Above Ground shows that EDC provided a $466-million loan to the company developing the dam despite longstanding warnings of corruption in the tendering process and impending harm to communities downstream. Doubts about the dam’s design had been raised years before EDC approved the loan, with experts warning of a disaster like the one that occurred last year.
The company is now under criminal investigation for alleged corruption and environmental damage tied to its development of the dam.
 
“When will Ottawa hold its export bank to account?” asks Above Ground program officer Karen Hamilton. “EDC says it screens the business it supports to ensure it is socially and environmentally responsible, but it repeatedly finances companies accused of grave misconduct. The Canadian government must assume its responsibilities and make this Crown corporation legally accountable for the costs of its decisions.”

Surveillance Giants lays out how the surveillance-based business model of Facebook and Google is inherently incompatible with the right to privacy and poses a systemic threat to a range of other rights including freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination.
“Google and Facebook dominate our modern lives – amassing unparalleled power over the digital world by harvesting and monetizing the personal data of billions of people. Their insidious control of our digital lives undermines the very essence of privacy and is one of the defining human rights challenges of our era,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“To protect our core human values in the digital age – dignity, autonomy, privacy – there needs to be a radical overhaul of the way Big Tech operates, and to move to an internet that has human rights at its core.”
Google and Facebook have established dominance over the primary channels that most of the world – outside of China – relies on to realize their rights online. The various platforms they own – including Facebook, Instagram, Google Search, YouTube and WhatsApp –facilitate the ways people seek and share information, engage in debate and participate in society. Google’s Android also underpins most of the world’s smartphones.
While other Big Tech companies – including Apple, Amazon and Microsoft – have accrued significant power in other areas, it is the platforms owned by Facebook and Google that have become fundamental to how people engage and interact with each other – effectively a new global public square.
The tech giants offer these services to billions without charging users a fee. Instead, individuals pay for the services with their intimate personal data, being constantly tracked across the web and in the physical world as well, for example, through connected devices.
“The internet is vital for people to enjoy many of their rights, yet billions of people have no meaningful choice but to access this public space on terms dictated by Facebook and Google,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“To make it worse this isn’t the internet people signed up for when these platforms started out. Google and Facebook chipped away at our privacy over time. We are now trapped. Either we must submit to this pervasive surveillance machinery – where our data is easily weaponized to manipulate and influence us – or forego the benefits of the digital world. This can never be a legitimate choice. We must reclaim this essential public square, so we can participate without having our rights abused.”
This extraction and analysis of people’s personal data on such an unprecedented scale is incompatible with every element of the right to privacy, including the freedom from intrusion into our private lives, the right to control information about ourselves, and the right to a space in which we can freely express our identities.
Exploitative algorithms
Google and Facebook’s platforms are underpinned by algorithmic systems that process huge volumes of data to infer incredibly detailed characteristics about people and shape their online experience. Advertisers then pay Facebook and Google to be able to target people with advertising or specific messages.
The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed how easily people’s data can be misused in unforeseen ways with the aim of manipulating and influencing them.
“We have already seen that Google and Facebook’s vast architecture for advertising is a potent weapon in the wrong hands. Not only can it be misused for political ends, with potentially disastrous consequences for society, but it allows all kinds of new exploitative advertising tactics such as preying on vulnerable people struggling with illness, mental health or addiction. Because these ads are tailored to us as individuals, they are hidden from public scrutiny,” said Kumi Naidoo.
A new internet
Governments must urgently take action to overhaul the surveillance-based business model and protect us from corporate human rights abuses, including through the enforcement of robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech in line with human rights law.
As a first step, governments must enact laws to ensure companies including Google and Facebook are prevented from making access to their service conditional on individuals “consenting” to the collection, processing or sharing of their personal data for marketing or advertising. Companies including Google and Facebook also have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever and however they operate.
“Facebook and Google must not be allowed to dictate how we live online. These companies have chosen a specific surveillance-business model that impacts on privacy, freedom of expression and other human rights. The technology behind the internet is not incompatible with our rights, but the business model Facebook and Google have chosen is,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“Now it is time to reclaim this vital public space for everyone rather than a few powerful unaccountable companies in Silicon Valley.”
Facebook and Google disputed the findings. The companies’ responses are included in the report.

0,Bolivia: Jeanine Añez must immediately repeal decree giving impunity to Armed Forces personnel,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/bolivia-jeanine-a%c3%b1ez-must-immediately-repeal-decree-giving-impunity-armed-forces-personnel/,"The Bolivian authorities must immediately repeal Decree 4078 of 14 November 2019 and ensure that the security forces act in accordance with international rules and standards on the use of force and protect the human rights of all protesters irrespective of their political opinions, Amnesty...","The Bolivian authorities must immediately repeal Decree 4078 of 14 November 2019 and ensure that the security forces act in accordance with international rules and standards on the use of force and protect the human rights of all protesters irrespective of their political opinions, Amnesty International said today.
“The grave human rights crisis that Bolivia has experienced since the elections of 20 October has been aggravated by the intervention and action of the security forces. Any message giving carte blanche for impunity is extremely serious. The disastrous historical precedents of intervention by the Armed Forces in the region require maximum observance and commitment to respect and protect human rights”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International Americas.
Decree 4078, which has not yet been published in the country’s Official Gazette, provides for the participation of the Armed Forces in “the defence of society and maintenance of public order, in support of the National Police forces” and exempts from criminal responsibility Armed Forces personnel participating in operations to re-establish internal order and public security “when, in carrying out their constitutional duties, they act in legitimate defence or out of necessity, while observing the principles of legality, absolute necessity and proportionality”.
Amnesty International expresses its concern about this decree, which allows possible human rights violations and crimes under international law committed by members of the Armed Forces to go unpunished. The same decree states that the situation “is tending to deteriorate and move towards civil war.” This opens the way for acts of violence to be treated with impunity. 
The organization recalls that security force personnel are not only required to account for their actions and omissions individually, but that superior officers may be held criminally responsible if they issue illegal orders, supervise, instruct or control them in any other way, or are responsible for planning and preparing operations that result in human rights violations and crimes under international law.
The current social, political and human rights crisis in Bolivia runs the risk of deteriorating if the authorities continue to respond in a violent manner to criticism, protests, media scrutiny and violence by third parties.
“The extremely tense social situation cannot be an excuse for the security forces to act contrary to International human rights standards, nor to encourage the wave of hate and racial discrimination that has hit the country in recent days. Jeanine Añez, who has proclaimed herself interim president, is duty-bound to immediately stop human rights violations or be ready to be held accountable by national and international mechanisms”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
In this context, the authorities must guarantee access to public, accurate and up-to-date information about people who have been killed, wounded or deprived of their freedom during the crisis that began on 20 October of this year. According to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, 23 people have died and 715 have been injured since that date.
Amnesty International calls on the authorities to conduct prompt, thorough and impartial investigations of these deaths as well as of allegations of human rights violations by the security forces and acts of violence against individuals. It is also essential to ensure that journalists and human rights defenders can carry out their important and legitimate work free of censorship, stigmatization and attacks.
The organization is concerned about the attacks and harassment denounced by journalists and human rights defenders, as well as by accusations of “inciting unrest” made by the Minister of Communications against journalists. We remind the government that only the judiciary has the power to determine criminal responsibilities.
Finally, Amnesty International notes that the current situation is directly interfering with the population’s means of subsistence. The organization has received reliable information indicating that the city of La Paz is surrounded without access to petrol or gas, resulting in a scarcity of food and intensifying the crisis.

At least 106 protesters in 21 cities have been killed, according to credible reports received by Amnesty International. The organization believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed. State media have reported only a handful of protester deaths, as well as the deaths of at least four members of the security forces.
Video footage shows security forces using firearms, water cannons and tear gas to disperse protests and beating demonstrators with batons. Images of bullet casings left on the ground afterwards, as well as the resulting high death toll, indicate that they used live ammunition.
“The authorities must end this brutal and deadly crackdown immediately and show respect for human life,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“The frequency and persistence of lethal force used against peaceful protesters in these and previous mass protests, as well as the systematic impunity for security forces who kill protesters, raise serious fears that the intentional lethal use of firearms to crush protests has become a matter of state policy.”
Top government officials including Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei have issued statements describing protesters as “villains” and giving security forces a green light to crush demonstrations.
Under international law, security forces may only resort to the use of lethal force when strictly unavoidable to protect against imminent threat of death or serious injury.
Amnesty International is also calling on the Iranian authorities to respect the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression, including through lifting the near-total block on internet access designed to restrict the flow of information about the crackdown to the outside world.
Hundreds of demonstrators blocked roads, using their parked cars as a form of protest. Verified video footage reviewed by Amnesty International shows riot police smashing windows of cars with drivers still inside.
According to eyewitness accounts corroborated by video footage reviewed by Amnesty International, snipers have also shot into crowds of people from rooftops and, in one case, a helicopter.
While most of the demonstrations appear to have been peaceful, in some instances, as the crackdown by security forces escalated, a small number of protesters turned to stone-throwing and acts of arson and damage to banks and seminaries.
“Even if a small minority of protesters have resorted to violence, police must always exercise restraint and use no more force than is strictly necessary, proportionate and lawful in response to the violence they are facing. Violence by a few individuals does not justify a widespread reckless response,” said Philip Luther.
Several eyewitnesses have said that security forces have been taking away dead bodies and injured people from roads and hospitals. In a pattern consistent with past practices, intelligence and security forces have refused to return the bodies of many of the victims to their families or have forced families to bury their loved ones in a rushed manner and without an independent autopsy to establish the causes and circumstances surrounding the deaths. This is contrary to international law and standards on the investigation of unlawful killings.
State media reported that, as of 17 November, more than 1,000 protesters had been arrested since the protests began.
Among those detained is human rights defender Sepideh Gholian, who was arrested on 17 November after taking part in the protests by peacefully holding up a sign about the petrol prices. Her whereabouts are currently unknown and Amnesty International fears that she is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment, in light of the authorities appalling track record of torturing detained human rights defenders.
“Anyone detained solely for peacefully taking part in demonstrations, expressing support for them or criticizing the authorities must be immediately and unconditionally released. All detainees must be protected from torture and other ill-treatment,” said Philip Luther.
The organization is calling for immediate action from the international community, including the UN and the EU, to hold the Iranian authorities to account for carrying out unlawful killings and violently repressing the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
Internet shutdown
On 16 November, less than a day after the protests began, the authorities implemented an ongoing near-total shutdown of the internet, shutting off nearly all means of online communications for people inside Iran. The resulting information blackout is a deliberate attempt by the authorities to prevent people from sharing images and videos of the deadly force being used by security forces.
According to the NGO NetBlocks, Iran’s connectivity to the outside world has fallen to 4% of ordinary levels since the protests began. All mobile networks have been disconnected and there is a near-total national internet and telecommunication blackout, although some users have still been able to access the internet through the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and other means.
“Shutting down communications over the internet is a systematic assault on the right to freedom of expression and suggests that the authorities have something to hide. Iranian authorities must immediately lift all restrictions on access to the internet and social media to allow people to share information and freely express their opinions,” said Philip Luther.
Systematic and co-ordinated crackdown
Various government officials including the Supreme Leader, president and head of the judiciary have demonized the protesters and warned that security forces will confront protesters with force.
On 16 November, Iran’s interior minister said that the authorities will no longer show “tolerance” and “self-control” towards the protesters, despite mounting reports of protester casualties.
During a speech on 17 November, Iran’s Supreme Leader described the protesters as “villains” who were incited to violence by counter-revolutionaries and foreign enemies of Iran. He ordered security forces to “implement their duties” to end the protests, effectively giving the green light for the brutality to continue.
Judicial and security bodies have also sent threatening mass text messages warning people to stay away from “illegal gatherings” or face legal action.
“Instead of giving a green light to brutality, the Iranian authorities must rein in their security forces to prevent further bloodshed. The long-standing pattern of impunity for unlawful killings and injuries in Iran is bound to continue unless independent impartial investigations are conducted into all suspected instances of arbitrary and abusive use of force, and those who commit such serious crimes and violations are held to account,” said Philip Luther.
“The UN and individual member states must publicly denounce Iran’s bloody crackdown. They should press the Iranian authorities to give access to independent human rights observers to hospitals and detention centres in the country, lift the blocking of the internet and invite UN mandate holders to conduct fact-finding visits.”
Background
Protests erupted on 15 November following a sudden government announcement about a fuel price hike which will have a detrimental impact on people who are already struggling amid Iran’s economic crisis. Some demonstrators have chanted slogans calling for a radical overhaul of the political system and some have burned posters of Iran’s current and former Supreme Leaders.

Amnesty International recalls that the security forces must refrain from excessive use of force in controlling demonstrations. Faced with allegations of violence perpetrated by demonstrators in some protests, the authorities must take all necessary and conducive measures to bring these episodes to an end, while ensuring that those who peacefully protest can continue to do so.
The authorities also have an obligation to promptly, independently and impartially investigate allegations of violent deaths and to provide clear and accurate information about the context in which they occurred.
In the current context, the role of individuals and human rights organizations is essential. Therefore, the Bolivian authorities have an obligation to publicly recognize the legitimacy and importance of the work of human rights defenders, to protect them and to guarantee an enabling environment that allows them to carry out their work without risk. The authorities must also respect the freedom of the press and ensure that those who exercise journalism can cover the events in a safe manner.
Finally, we point out that it is up to the Judicial Branch to establish the individual criminal responsibilities of any person suspected to have committed a crime, and it is not up to the authorities of other branches of the State to make public accusations without evidence. Criminal complaints should be investigated independently and impartially and must not affect the right to due process and judicial guarantees of the persons investigated.

OTTAWA – Today, two days before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveils his new cabinet, Amnesty International is publishing an open letter urging the Prime Minister to prioritize human rights in the mandates of all ministers.
In the letter, Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Alex Neve and Amnistie internationale Canada francophone Executive Director France-Isabelle Langlois say upholding and promoting human rights “must be a hallmark” of the Liberal Party’s second term of government.
“It is vital that your government at all times puts human rights first in international diplomacy, and does not allow economic or other strategic considerations to create double standards,” the letter states. “It is also vital that human rights not be compromised or sidelined in any of the laws you propose, policies you adopt or decisions you take.”
Amnesty International is recommending the Liberal Party work with all federal parties to: 
Advance bold action to address the global climate crisis by halving carbon emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions as soon as possible thereafter.
Prioritize adoption of legislation to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Address mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows First Nation, including by immediately building a specialized health care facility in the community.
Develop a national action plan to prevent and address gender-based violence as well as a separate action plan on violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.         
Implement the United Nations Committee against Torture’s recommendations to end and address sterilization of Indigenous women without their consent.
Suspend the Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement with respect to refugee protection.
Establish a maximum time limit on the duration of immigration detention.
Strengthen corporate accountability for human rights by granting full investigative powers to the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise and by adopting mandatory human rights due diligence legislation.
Address racism in policing, including by ending racial profiling and carding.
Ensure that the use of solitary confinement in Canadian prisons conforms to the UN’s Mandela Rules. 
Please see the attached letter for a full explanation of Amnesty International’s 10 recommendations.
The federal cabinet will be announced on Nov. 20.

“By laying siege to Polytechnic University and firing tear gas and rubber bullets at people trying to flee, the Hong Kong Police are yet again fanning the flames of violence when they should be trying to defuse it.
“It is the police’s responsibility to de-escalate this situation, but instead of assisting injured protesters trapped at the University they are unlawfully arresting the medics attempting to treat the wounded.
“The increasingly violent nature of the Hong Kong protests and the resultant injuries to bystanders and others is alarming, but the heavy-handed police response to largely peaceful demonstrations over the past months is the main cause of this escalation. Their threat today that protesters could face live ammunition is a further aggressive move that heightens the risk of tragedy on the streets.
“At a time when Hong Kong needs level-headedness and humanity from those in power, it is instead getting tear gas, beatings and threats of lethal force.”
Background
Since Sunday, the police have laid siege to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus in an ongoing standoff. They have deployed tear gas and water cannon, including in an apparent attempt to keep people from leaving the scene, while protesters have retaliated with petrol bombs.
The Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students’ Union has said hundreds of protesters, volunteer medics, journalists and social workers are still on campus, many of them injured. The police have rounded up medical volunteers and reporters attempting to leave campus and reportedly arrested more than 100 people in the neighbourhood.
In the early hours of Monday morning, a police spokesman said in a Facebook Live post that protesters using lethal weapons to attack officers could possibly face live bullets in response. According to media reports, the police have since fired warning shots.
Amnesty International has called for an independent and effective investigation into the use of force by the police since the start of large-scale anti-Extradition Bill protests in April. This includes excessive use of force by police in the largely peaceful protest on 12 June and allegations of torture and other ill-treatment in detention.

“This year Write for Rights, Amnesty’s flagship human rights campaign, champions youth activists who are taking on the world’s biggest crises,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“From those campaigning for climate and environmental justice, to those challenging inequality, poverty, discrimination and political repression, young people have emerged as a powerful force for change who deserve the world’s support.”
Every December people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts and postcards for those whose human rights are under attack, in what has become the world’s biggest human rights event.
Amnesty International is hoping to break last year’s Write for Rights record of nearly six million messages of support for activists and individuals from 10 countries whose human rights are under attack.
Youth activism in the spotlight
Youth activists have played a prominent role in major protest movements and human rights campaigns during 2019, such as the Fridays for Future climate strike movement founded by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg, as well as protest movements in many countries around the world.
Write for Rights 2019 features youth human rights defenders and individuals from in Belarus, Canada, China, Egypt, Greece, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines and South Sudan.
Launching two days ahead of Universal Children’s Day on 20 November, a day to promote children’s rights, several of the featured activists had their rights violated as children.
They include Grassy Narrows Youth, a group of youth activists from an Indigenous community in north-western Ontario who have suffered one of Canada’s worst health crises. Their community has been devastated by 50 years of mercury contamination of their fish and river system. The Grassy Narrows youth are urging the government to address the mercury crisis once and for all, including by providing specialized health care and compensation for all.
Among the other cases are: 
José Adrián, who was 14 when he was brutally beaten by police on his way home from school in Mexico. He is now demanding reparations for his treatment and for the police to stop arbitrary detentions in the state of Yucatán;
Sarah Mardini and Seán Binder, two volunteer rescue workers from in Lesvos, Greece, who face up to 25 years in prison for their humanitarian work helping spot refugee boats in distress;
Yasaman Aryani, who defied her country’s discriminatory forced veiling laws and now must serve 10 years behind bars. Amnesty is campaigning for her immediate release;
Marinel Ubaldo, a youth activist from the Philippines who is urging her government to declare a climate emergency and protect future generations from the devastating impacts of climate change after her home was destroyed by typhoon Haiyan.  
“The Write for Rights campaign epitomizes the ideals that Amnesty International was founded on – it’s about individuals helping other individuals. We are urging people to get behind these incredible young people who are campaigning for justice, equality and freedom,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“As we know from our work over the past five decades, writing letters works. Not only can it help free prisoners of conscience, but it makes a huge emotional difference to the people we support and to their loved ones.”
Monica Benício, the partner of Marielle Franco, a local politician in Brazil who was killed last year and was featured as part of the last Write for Rights, said of the campaign:
“It helps me to get up in the morning and see some meaning, knowing that there is this big global network of affection.
“All these demonstrations of love and affection are helping us to mobilize, to demand justice, to pressure for investigation and above all to fight so that there will be no more Marielles.”

For 50 years, members of the First Nation in northwestern Ontario, also known as Asubpeeschoseewagong, have been facing mercury poisoning. A pulp mill dumped roughly 10 tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system from 1962 until 1970, contaminating the community’s vital waterways and walleye fish. Due to government inaction, young people living in Grassy Narrows continue to face devastating health and social impacts, including the loss of the community’s jobs and the erosion of their cultural traditions.
Sabrina is unveiling the banner as part of Amnesty International’s annual Write for Rights campaign, the organization’s largest letter-writing event that encourages people around the world to write letters on behalf of those who are experiencing human rights violations. This year’s Write for Rights is highlighting Grassy Narrows youth who are now fighting for justice after 50 years of government failing to address their community’s mercury crisis. Those attending the event will be invited to decorate their own walleye fish images and include messages of support for Grassy youth.
Write for Rights events will take place across Canada from late November until mid-December. For more information, visit www.writeathon.ca.

Alice and Grant Burton, long-time philanthropists from Toronto, will evenly split the $3 million between these organizations, allowing them each to significantly increase their capacity to fight local poverty, provide medical assistance to people affected by conflict, and promote an end to worldwide human rights violations, respectively.
Grant Burton is president of Starcan Corporation and director emeritus at the National Arts Centre while Alice Burton is an artist whose works have principally been exhibited in Toronto, Montreal, and New York.
“Alice and I have been donating to many causes since our marriage almost 50 years ago,” said Grant Burton. “Initially, these were smaller gifts closer to home. As our finances improved, we were able to increase the gift size and to broaden the geographic scope of our activities. Supporting the United Way was an easy decision due to the many causes, the organization funds in the Toronto area. Médecins Sans Frontières and Amnesty International appealed to us for the critical services and work they provide.”
Alice and Grant Burton’s donation marks the largest-ever gift for Amnesty International Canada, allowing the human rights organization to establish the new Burton Human Rights Impact Fund, 100 per cent of which will go towards crucial human rights work. The gift also comes with the invitation to all donors to come together and jointly match the funds by the end of 2020.
“We’re deeply appreciative of Alice and Grant Burton’s incredible generosity, which enables us to significantly increase our vital human rights work in Canada and around the world,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada.
“We are deeply grateful for this incredibly generous gift that will help us bring medical care to vulnerable people who have been caught up in some of the world’s worst humanitarian crises,” said Joe Belliveau, Executive Director of Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Canada.
“It is thanks to the generosity of private donors like Alice and Grant Burton that our teams can act independently and can respond quickly to emergencies around the globe.”
United Way’s Alice and Grant Burton Challenge Gift is matching up to $1 million in first-time donations over $1,200, as well as donation increases made by current United Way Greater Toronto Leadership donors. This support powers United Way’s network of 270 community agencies across Greater Toronto, and reinforces a crucial community safety net.
“Alice and Grant Burton’s dedication to strengthening the region they love to call home is inspiring a new generation of donors to lead the fight against local poverty,” said Daniele Zanotti, President and CEO of United Way Greater Toronto. “We are grateful for the Burtons’ leadership and generosity for 50 years — supporting a network of agencies that ensure everyone has access to the programs and services they need to thrive today.”

The applicants in this case – Amnesty International, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches, as well as other individual litigants – are represented by nine exceptional lawyers. Throughout the entire process, these advocates have approached their work with eloquence, tact and remarkable empathy. For over two years, they put in countless hours of work: collecting testimonies, questioning and cross-examining experts, and refining their legal arguments. To get a sense of the extent of their commitment, five babies were born within the legal team during the build-up to the STCA challenge! Their dedication to this work is remarkable, and it is worth repeating their names and thanking them for all the time and energy they have contributed to this court challenge: Prasanna Balasundaram, Joshua Blum, Michael Bossin, Andrew Brouwer, Heather Neufeld, Leigh Salsberg, Erin Simpson, Kate Webster and Jared Will. 
The unenviable task of deciding what will happen with the STCA rests with Federal Court Justice Ann Marie McDonald, who will have to sift through thousands of pages of arguments, expertise, and evidence to make her decision. And although it is eagerly anticipated by many, it is difficult to predict when a decision will be released. 
Beyond the legal arguments, what will remain engraved in our memories from this week are the personal stories shared throughout the hearing. Stories like those of the Syrian family who were separated once detained in the U.S., the parents forbidden from consoling their children (ages 2 and 3) when they woke up frightened and confused in the detention center. Or when counsel for the applicants, Prasanna Balasundaram, drew on his own experience from years before when he and his family passed through the U.S. to Canada at the same port of entry as one of the individual litigants in this case. He recalled, “in that moment, what you seek to traverse is a border between hope and despair, and as you straddle that line, everything is an act of overcoming fear.” In sharing his own account, he urged the court to exercise empathy as it considers the testimonies of those who have been impacted by the STCA. 
These stories not only form the backbone of this case, but they also reflect a reality in North America that can no longer be ignored. 
So where to go from here?  
Despite the significance of this court challenge, the fight against policies like the STCA must continue to radiate outside of courtrooms. As it stands, we currently have a minority federal government that could potentially draw on support from three political parties that stated their opposition to the STCA during the election campaign. The current circumstances seem ripe for such a suspension. And yet, given how zealously and vigorously the Canadian government’s lawyers defended the STCA in court last week, we cannot take for granted any particular outcome. 
And so, we call on Amnesty supporters, advocates, activists and citizens to use the platforms available to amplify the voices and stories of refugee claimants unjustly affected by the STCA. By engaging and lobbying our elected representatives and those in positions of power to encourage the Government of Canada to suspend the STCA, we show that we refuse to recognize the U.S. as a safe place for refugees and refuse to be complicit in the harm faced by refugee-claimants impacted by the STCA.

“The Saudi state security agency’s announcement which labels feminism, atheism and homosexuality as extremist ideas punishable by jail and flogging is outrageous – clearly contradicting the Kingdom’s bogus reformist image which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman continues to flaunt internationally.
“Feminism, atheism and homosexuality are not criminal acts. This announcement is extremely dangerous and has serious implications for the rights to freedom of expression and life, liberty and security in the country. It peels away the veneer of progress under Mohammed bin Salman and reveals the Kingdom’s true intolerant face which criminalizes people’s identities, as well as progressive and reformist thoughts and ideas at home.
“International silence in the face of the imprisonment of dozens of peaceful Saudi dissidents for their expression is also alarming. Key allies such as the US, UK and EU must pressure the Kingdom and highlight the urgent need to protect freedom of expression in the country starting with the release of imprisoned human rights defenders and anyone detained for their peaceful expression.”
Background:
Atheism is illegal and is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. While punishments for same sex relations are not codified under the law in Saudi Arabia, they are strictly prohibited under Shari’a (Islamic law) which Saudi Arabia draws from for its legal framework.
Recent reforms of the male guardianship system and other laws which discriminated against women – such as the lifting of a ban on female drivers – are a testament to the tireless work of feminists and long-standing activist voices who are now locked up or who continue to be prosecuted in the country.
Since May 2018, 13 women activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi and Naseema al-Sada who remain in detention, have been on trial for their human rights activism and their work to promote women’s rights. Fourteen other writers, activists and family members of women’s rights activists remain in detention without trial since April 2019. Many of them are supporters of the women’s rights movement.

They will be posting updates about the Safe Third Country Agreement hearing throughout the week. 
The brief and frustrating answer: it’s unclear what it takes.   
Submissions in the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) challenge continued to be delivered from November 4-8th at the Federal Court in Toronto. Earlier this week, counsel for the applicants – representing Amnesty International, the Canadian Council for Refugees and the Canadian Council of Churches, and other individual litigants – provided a general overview of the requirements for a safe third country designation, why it is unlawful, and why the operation of the agreement violates the security and equality rights of STCA returnees. 
At its core, the STCA is a responsibility-sharing agreement for the protection of refugees. By designating the U.S. as a ‘safe’ country, the law requires that Canada ensure that the U.S. continues to protect refugees in a way that aligns with international human rights law standards, and that the situation in the U.S. is continuously reviewed. 
In their submissions to Justice Ann Marie McDonald, counsel for the Government of Canada (the respondents) argued that STCA requirements have been met because Canada has conducted reviews of the U.S. based on an overall assessment of the situation and a “qualitative balancing”. But a balancing of what? 
Without getting too deep in the weeds of administrative law, the big take-away from the arguments put forward by the applicants is that the current review process has no measurable tipping point: Canada has provided no defined standard of how bad the situation in the U.S. needs to get in order for the U.S. to no longer be considered a ‘safe’ country under the STCA.  
During his submissions, Mr. Jared Will (counsel for the applicants), considered the evidence that the government did review, including the mandatory detention of refugee claimants returned under the STCA, the separation of children from their parents at the border, and the shameful and inhumane detention conditions faced by all returnees, including children. 
Despite all the information in front of them – particularly as the situation went from bad to worse to unimaginable under President Trump’s administration – the Government of Canada still chose to maintain the status quo, refusing to acknowledge that the negative evidence has tipped the scales. 
On top of this, nothing has been done to monitor what actually happens when refugee claimants are returned to the U.S. under the STCA: refugee claimants are sent back, and no questions are asked about what becomes of them. As Mr. Will noted, the overall approach of the Government of Canada “can be described as see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”. 
On Wednesday afternoon, counsel for the government went so far as to say that even if faced with the hypothetical situation of the U.S. withdrawing from the Refugee Convention or the Convention Against Torture, Canada would not necessarily see this as a determinative reason to remove the designation of the U.S. as a safe country, since they could still in practice be meeting their international human rights law obligations. 
Integrity is at stake here. How many detentions, family separations, incidents of violence or accounts of assaults are needed to see that this agreement is failing some of society’s most vulnerable individuals? Canadians deserve more from a government that claims to prioritize refugee rights. 
The arguments presented in court this week suggest that, with no clear benchmark, and no way to gauge how “bad” is “too bad”, Canada’s reviews of the situation in the U.S. are meaningless and turn a blind eye to the fates of those returned to the U.S. under the STCA.

Mesa, which concerns the killing of fifteen-year-old Sergio Hernández, by Jesus Mesa, Jr., a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent, Amnesty International USA, along with the Center for Constitutional Rights, Human Rights First, and the Rutherford Institute, submitted an amicus brief in support of the Hernández family.
Justin Mazzola, deputy director of research at Amnesty International USA said:
“This case concerns the very cornerstone of fundamental human rights: access to justice. No family should suffer the killing of a child and live with the pain of impunity, as Sergio’s family has been forced to do. The U.S. government fired bullets across the border, killing a child, but now takes the indefensible position that justice cannot land where those bullets did. Sergio’s family deserves to see a U.S. agent held accountable for this crime, and every CBP agent must heed the message that they can no longer be absolved for abuses along the Mexico-U.S. border. The U.S. government must finally be held to account for the lives its agents have taken at the border – regardless of which side of the line its victims happened to be standing on when they were killed.”
“Access to a remedy is not a privilege: it is a basic right that Sergio’s family has. U.S. efforts to block it shamefully prevent accountability, respect, and redress.”
The amicus brief argues that, under both international and U.S. law, the Hernández family should be compensated for Sergio’s death. Because the agent who fatally shot Sergio is a U.S. citizen whose unlawful act took place on U.S. soil, the court should conclude that the family can seek a constitutional remedy for the unlawful killing of their child. The brief states that Mesa committed an extrajudicial killing, in violation of treaty obligations to which both the U.S. and Mexico have agreed and which obligate the U.S. to provide remedy. Without a remedy in the U.S., the Hernández family will be left without any recourse for the killing of their son, at odds with the treaty obligations by which the U.S. is bound. The brief concludes that extraterritorial application of the U.S. Constitution in this case is not only possible, but necessary.

They will be posting updates about the Safe Third Country Agreement hearing throughout the week.  
Shame. Frustration. Rage. Disappointment.   
Court hearings can be dry, but when we listen to the facts and stories presented over the past two days in the challenge to the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA), it is hard not to have an emotional reaction. 
On the second day of the hearings in Toronto, counsel for the applicants – Amnesty International, the Canadian Council for Refugees, the Canadian Council of Churches and individual refugee claimants – continued to present their legal arguments and reviewed how the STCA violates equality rights under section 15 of the Canadian Charter, and the rights to liberty and security of the person under section 7. 
As a party to the United Nations Refugee Convention, Canada has an obligation to not return refugees to countries where their lives or freedom would be in danger. Under the STCA framework, Canada can designate a country as ‘safe’ for refugees if that country is fulfilling its international law obligations under the Refugee Convention and has an acceptable human rights record. The applicants have demonstrated that the US is no longer living up to its international obligations, and that returning refugee claimants to the US violates the Charter. 
In particular, the section 15 equality rights of women who are returned under the STCA are disproportionately impacted by US policies. In the applicants’ submissions, counsel Leigh Salsberg asked the hard-hitting question: are refugee women fleeing gender-based violence in their own homes unworthy of Canada’s protection? 
Under the current US legal framework, women are effectively prevented from making refugee claims based on a fear of gender-based violence – a ground which has long been recognized in both Canadian and international jurisprudence. Because of this, victims of gender-based violence who are returned to the US are disproportionately impacted by the STCA and face a greater risk of being returned to the very countries they are fleeing. Meanwhile, Canada is naively waiting for the US system to self-correct itself, despite requirements under international law to keep these refugee claimants safe. 
Woven through the Charter arguments were the human stories at the heart of this case: 
The mother of two from El-Salvador who, upon fleeing gender-based violence at the hands of the M-13 gang in El-Salvador, discovered her claim would not likely succeed in the US, only to then be turned back when she looked to Canada for protection; 
The refugee claimant returned to the US under the STCA who was detained for 20 months while he waited a decision on his claim, only to be forcibly returned to his county where he experienced serious violence; 
Or the young woman who was prevented from making a refugee claim in Canada and detained in the US for 51 days in a glass room where she was forced to sleep with the lights on and use the toilet with no privacy.  
As these stories – and those of many others – show, the current legal framework punishes refugee claimants for doing something all individuals have a right to do under international law: seek protection against persecution. They have committed no crime in asking for Canada’s protection. And yet, for those who are returned to the US under the STCA after attempting to make refugee claims in Canada, automatic detention is the rule and not the exception.  
For the many reasons stressed by the applicants, the detention of STCA returnees in the US engages the rights to liberty and security of the person under section 7 of the Charter.  As counsel Andrew Brouwer emphasized, “it is incredibly difficult to make an asylum claim from a jail cell,” particularly when access to legal support and interpretation services are limited. 
On top of this, the detention conditions faced by STCA returnees are shameful. Treated like prisoners, those detained face inadequate access to health and mental care, high rates of sexual assaults and physical violence, inadequate supplies of food and water and several have spent time in solitary confinement. The psychological and physical impacts of these conditions are completely out of sync with international human rights standards and the Canadian Charter.   
Over the last couple days, counsel for the applicants have skillfully delivered arguments and shared stories that demonstrate how calling the US a ‘safe’ country for refugees is nothing more than a fiction. 
All are welcome to join us at the Federal Court in Toronto (180 Queen Street West) from November 4-8, 2019, or click here to learn more and take action to call on Canada to suspend the STCA.

“Year after year, month after month, Canada willfully turns its back on refugee claimants at the border.” 
The applicants’ opening remarks, delivered by Mr. Andrew Brouwer, set the stage for the day’s arguments, which reviewed the facts, the evidence and administrative law issues. 
 
Bolstered by an enthusiastic crowd who gathered in solidarity during a lunch-time rally outside the courthouse, the magnitude of this case was not lost on any attendees today. This case is important. It comes on the heels of several years of work from advocates calling for a suspension of the STCA in light of the United States’ failure to adequately protect refugee claimants. 
As it stands, the STCA requires refugee claimants who arrive in Canada or the U.S. to request protection in the first country where they set foot. This means that, with limited exceptions, the STCA bars people from seeking refugee protection in Canada at a border crossing if they first went through the U.S. 
A safe third country agreement relies on the idea that both countries in question will guarantee the rights and necessary protections of refugees and asylum seekers, as is required by international law.   
But can we really say that the US is a safe place for refugees? 
The current Canada-US STCA was put in place in 2004. Since then, the deficiencies in the U.S. refugee system and prevalence of human rights violations have intensified, particularly as a result of harsh and xenophobic policies implemented under President Donald Trump’s administration. By designating the U.S. as a safe place for refugees under the STCA, Canada is complicit in the U.S.’ ill-treatment of refugee claimants. 
 
This week, the Federal Court will hear evidence demonstrating that when refugee claimants are turned away at Canadian borders and sent back to be subjected to the flawed U.S. refugee system, they face detention (often indefinite in nature), family separation, and serious ill-treatment. These conditions place individuals at a further risk of being refused refugee status and returned to the very countries they fled because their lives are at risk. As audiences in the courtroom learned today, the risks are heightened for women fleeing gender-based violence given that current U.S. policy essentially closes the door on their refugee claims. 
Amnesty International, along with other public interest groups and refugee rights advocates have come together to assert that the continued application of the STCA violates the rights to equality and life, liberty and security of the person under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as well as Canada’s obligations under international law.

WINNIPEG – Indigenous youth and mercury survivors from Grassy Narrows First Nation will be the focus of Amnesty International’s largest worldwide letter-writing campaign this year, the human rights organization announced today.
The annual Write for Rights event, which takes place around International Human Rights Day Dec. 10, is highlighting 10 cases of young people around the world who are experiencing human rights abuses, including the Indigenous Anishinaabe youth from the northwestern Ontario First Nation.
These youth are seeking justice for Grassy Narrows First Nation, also known as Asubpeeschoseewagong, a community that has been exposed to mercury poisoning for five decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, a pulp mill dumped 10 tonnes of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system upstream from Grassy Narrows. Today, the community’s vital waterways and fish are still contaminated, and people are still living with the devastating aftermath, including health problems, the loss of their jobs, and the erosion of their cultural traditions.   
“I have trouble speaking. I have speech impairments. I have learning disabilities,” said Steve Fobister, also known as Darwin, a 22-year-old mercury survivor. “But like my late grandfather, Steve Fobister Sr., I will never give up until our waters are clean and our fish are safe to eat.”
Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign invites people around the world to write messages of support to Grassy Narrows youth, and send letters to the Canadian government demanding concrete action. Like their parents and grandparents, Grassy youth are asking federal officials to build a mercury treatment facility and properly compensate community members.
“We will not stand by and let people die,” said Paris Meekis, a 15-year-old activist from Grassy Narrows, adding that the community’s youth are fighting for a “brighter, better future for future generations.”
Thirteen-year-old Jianne Turtle is following in the footsteps of her father, Grassy Narrows Chief Rudy Turtle, in calling for the government to take concrete action. She said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “should keep his promise” to address the mercury crisis.
“Mr. Trudeau, you have another chance to do something. Please do it,” she said. “Do it for all the people of Grassy Narrows and our future generations.”
Rodney Bruce, a 25-year-old member of Grassy Narrows, who is also part of the First Nations Climate Change Adapt Program at the Kenora Chiefs Association, said fishing is important to him, and his community.
“Grassy is a beautiful place, but there’s a cloud over our heads – it’s the mercury poisoning,” he said. “Mercury is not a physical thing you can see. It’s in the symptoms.”
Amnesty International has been fighting alongside Grassy Narrows for years, but this is the first time the organization is putting the First Nation in the global spotlight.
“We’re calling on human rights activists from around the world to show their support for Grassy Narrows,” said Ana Collins, Amnesty International Canada’s Indigenous Rights Campaign Advisor. “It’s unacceptable that youth are now having to fight for the right to live in a healthy environment, nearly 50 years since the Canadian government first became aware of the mercury crisis. The time for concrete action is long overdue. We’re hoping Amnesty’s global movement will help drive home the point that governments must respect Indigenous rights and future generations of Grassy Narrows youth must not be exposed to mercury poisoning.”
Write for Rights background:
Last year, Amnesty International sent 5.9 million letters, petitions, tweets, and solidarity messages from around the world in support of women human rights activists, who were the focus of the 2018 campaign. This year’s Write for Rights event is focused on youth under the age of 25.
Write for Rights events will be taking place across Canada from late November until mid-December. More information can be found at writeathon.ca.

On their last day, the group crossed the border into Matamoros, Mexico to speak with families and others who have been affected by the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. 
Matamoros, Mexico 
“Some days we cry.  Some days we laugh.  And we are here to lift each other up when we are down.” 
It is easy to walk through the makeshift “camp” of tents – home to 2,000 people, growing daily – that has sprung up on the Mexican side of one of the three bridges that link Matamoros with Brownsville, Texas and get lost in outrage about the myriad deliberate policies brought in by the Trump Administration to intentionally create the punitive injustice that now governs this border.  
 
And we should. Terms like migrant protection protocols, the remain in Mexico policy, asylum ban, metering, tent courts, parole, bonds, credible fear, pro se hearings and arriving aliens describe a callous, calculating assault on the rights of refugees and migrants looking to the United States for protection and to reunite with family. 
 
What is truly raw and agonizing is the human dimension that lies behind the legal fights, political debates and advocacy campaigns. 
It was four strong women from El Salvador, Honduras and Cuba – Andrea, Xiomara, Yudelmis and Dina – who talked to us of tears, laughter and lifting each other up. Through separate, arduous journeys they reached the Matamoros camp, alone, where they have become each other’s strength.  
 
Andrea (pictured, right) had made it from El Salvador to this border, travelling with her same-sex partner and her partner’s young daughter. US guards taunted them when they insisted they were a family. Her partner and daughter were allowed to cross over and lodge their asylum claims, but Andrea is trapped in the world of Donald Trump’s ‘remain in Mexico’ policy, not allowed to enter the United States until her claim is accepted, easily one year from now at best.  The ugly irony of having fled threats of violence as a lesbian couple in El Salvador only to face precisely that same discrimination at the US border is beyond cruel. 
So many more stories.  
Indigenous families from Chiapas, forced to wait in Mexico for weeks because of the arbitrary process of ‘metering’, under which US border guards decide how many asylum claims they will register on any given day. They described to us the anxiety of waiting in the very country in which they fear persecution. A blatant violation of international law; one more violation in a long list, all disregarded by the Trump Administration. 
Pregnant women are not to be returned to wait it out in Mexico. Yet many were until an egregious instance of a woman receiving an injection to stop her contractions, so that her return could go ahead, finally led Mexican officials to draw a line. 
In San Diego, we spoke with a mother and her teenage son from El Salvador who face imminent return to remain in Mexico. They have endured so much already, including threats and hardship during their trip through Mexico to reach the border. Yet she remains strong, determined to face anything in the search for safety, rather than turn her son over to gangs back home. 
 
Near Matamoros, two parents and their three young children from Honduras rushed across the border – the youngest in his father’s arms, the other two running hand in hand with their mother. When they were apprehended the father and son were slightly ahead of the others, and border guards refused to treat them as a family unit. Mum and the two children with her are now lost in the harsh world of the Matamoros border camp. Dad was deported because of an earlier immigration order. And the youngest child is on his own in US immigration foster care, apologetic in phone calls to his mother about not having been fast enough to run alongside her, so that they could still be together. 
2,000 people (growing every day), in a makeshift camp with five portable toilets and one hand-washing station; reliant on a handful of volunteer doctors who come to diagnose respiratory ailments, diarrhea and high blood pressure. 
 
A camp on the banks of the Rio Grande, living under constant threats from criminal cartels who see asylum-seekers, with relatives in the United States, as easy prey for violence and extortion. The river’s currents often carry decapitated bodies as a reminder of the dangers that lurk. 
And every turn is designed to dehumanize. Tent courts are being piloted so that asylum-seekers will not even be in the same courtroom as the judges deciding their fate, the government officials opposing their claims, and the translators interpreting their words. We were excluded from those tent courts, where groups of asylum-seekers are brought forward to face “justice” and often dealt with en masse.  
 
Lying on a pathway in the Matamoros camp, a small plastic bag from the US Department of Human Security, in which personal belongings were likely handed back to someone being returned to Mexico. Now empty and discarded in the dirt.  And hauntingly, no name appears. Instead, only a number, P 506, and a scannable bar code. This assault on rights and dignity so much relies on stripping away humanity. 
There are bright spots. 
On both sides of the border, people and communities are mobilizing with passion and solidarity. Migrant shelters in Mexico, run largely by faith communities, charities and volunteers and receiving next to no government support, dig deep in the struggle to meet the needs of an influx of returnees, forced to wait out the asylum process on the Mexican side of the border. 
 
An impressive resource centre is coming together in Matamoros, led by the inspirational Gaby Zavala, identifying needs such as showers, clean water and schooling and finding solutions that are almost always volunteer-driven. 
Team Brownsville volunteers cook daily meals for 1500 plus people. “Angry Tias and Abuelas” distribute duffle bags with notebooks, sanitary pad and toothbrushes. Volunteer lawyers step forward, from local communities and across the country, determined to do all that they can to give people a chance in a system that is determined to confuse and punish asylum-seekers with the singular goal that they will give up. 
 
One lawyer moved across the country to Brownsville and has poured herself into the effort to shore up justice as the government dismantles basic principles of the rule of law at the border. As she described it, this is one of those times when you need to show up or face your conscience. And so many have indeed decided to show up. 
Canada’s chance to show up lies in rejecting Donald Trump’s border vitriol and championing the rights of refugees and migrants. That means suspending the US/Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which is based on the disgraceful illusion that the US refugee protection record meets international standards such that refugee claimants can be sent back from Canada into the US to pursue their claims there. 
Amnesty International will be in Federal Court for five days, beginning November 4th, alongside the Canadian Council for Refugees, Canadian Council of Churches and eight courageous refugee claimants from El Salvador, Syria and Ethiopia, challenging the STCA. Until that agreement is suspended or overturned, Canada is complicit in Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of refugees and migrants.

On their last day, the group crossed the border into Matamoros, Mexico to speak with families and others who have been affected by the ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. 
Matamoros, Mexico 
“Some days we cry.  Some days we laugh.  And we are here to lift each other up when we are down.” 
It is easy to walk through the makeshift “camp” of tents – home to 2,000 people, growing daily – that has sprung up on the Mexican side of one of the three bridges that link Matamoros with Brownsville, Texas and get lost in outrage about the myriad deliberate policies brought in by the Trump Administration to intentionally create the punitive injustice that now governs this border.  
 
And we should. Terms like migrant protection protocols, the remain in Mexico policy, asylum ban, metering, tent courts, parole, bonds, credible fear, pro se hearings and arriving aliens describe a callous, calculating assault on the rights of refugees and migrants looking to the United States for protection and to reunite with family. 
 
What is truly raw and agonizing is the human dimension that lies behind the legal fights, political debates and advocacy campaigns. 
It was four strong women from El Salvador, Honduras and Cuba – Andrea, Xiomara, Yudelmis and Dina – who talked to us of tears, laughter and lifting each other up. Through separate, arduous journeys they reached the Matamoros camp, alone, where they have become each other’s strength.  
 
Andrea (pictured, right) had made it from El Salvador to this border, travelling with her same-sex partner and her partner’s young daughter. US guards taunted them when they insisted they were a family. Her partner and daughter were allowed to cross over and lodge their asylum claims, but Andrea is trapped in the world of Donald Trump’s ‘remain in Mexico’ policy, not allowed to enter the United States until her claim is accepted, easily one year from now at best.  The ugly irony of having fled threats of violence as a lesbian couple in El Salvador only to face precisely that same discrimination at the US border is beyond cruel. 
So many more stories.  
Indigenous families from Chiapas, forced to wait in Mexico for weeks because of the arbitrary process of ‘metering’, under which US border guards decide how many asylum claims they will register on any given day. They described to us the anxiety of waiting in the very country in which they fear persecution. A blatant violation of international law; one more violation in a long list, all disregarded by the Trump Administration. 
Pregnant women are not to be returned to wait it out in Mexico. Yet many were until an egregious instance of a woman receiving an injection to stop her contractions, so that her return could go ahead, finally led Mexican officials to draw a line. 
In San Diego, we spoke with a mother and her teenage son from El Salvador who face imminent return to remain in Mexico. They have endured so much already, including threats and hardship during their trip through Mexico to reach the border. Yet she remains strong, determined to face anything in the search for safety, rather than turn her son over to gangs back home. 
 
Near Matamoros, two parents and their three young children from Honduras rushed across the border – the youngest in his father’s arms, the other two running hand in hand with their mother. When they were apprehended the father and son were slightly ahead of the others, and border guards refused to treat them as a family unit. Mum and the two children with her are now lost in the harsh world of the Matamoros border camp. Dad was deported because of an earlier immigration order. And the youngest child is on his own in US immigration foster care, apologetic in phone calls to his mother about not having been fast enough to run alongside her, so that they could still be together. 
2,000 people (growing every day), in a makeshift camp with five portable toilets and one hand-washing station; reliant on a handful of volunteer doctors who come to diagnose respiratory ailments, diarrhea and high blood pressure. 
 
A camp on the banks of the Rio Grande, living under constant threats from criminal cartels who see asylum-seekers, with relatives in the United States, as easy prey for violence and extortion. The river’s currents often carry decapitated bodies as a reminder of the dangers that lurk. 
And every turn is designed to dehumanize. Tent courts are being piloted so that asylum-seekers will not even be in the same courtroom as the judges deciding their fate, the government officials opposing their claims, and the translators interpreting their words. We were excluded from those tent courts, where groups of asylum-seekers are brought forward to face “justice” and often dealt with en masse.  
 
Lying on a pathway in the Matamoros camp, a small plastic bag from the US Department of Human Security, in which personal belongings were likely handed back to someone being returned to Mexico. Now empty and discarded in the dirt.  And hauntingly, no name appears. Instead, only a number, P 506, and a scannable bar code. This assault on rights and dignity so much relies on stripping away humanity. 
There are bright spots. 
On both sides of the border, people and communities are mobilizing with passion and solidarity. Migrant shelters in Mexico, run largely by faith communities, charities and volunteers and receiving next to no government support, dig deep in the struggle to meet the needs of an influx of returnees, forced to wait out the asylum process on the Mexican side of the border. 
 
An impressive resource centre is coming together in Matamoros, led by the inspirational Gaby Zavala, identifying needs such as showers, clean water and schooling and finding solutions that are almost always volunteer-driven. 
Team Brownsville volunteers cook daily meals for 1500 plus people. “Angry Tias and Abuelas” distribute duffle bags with notebooks, sanitary pad and toothbrushes. Volunteer lawyers step forward, from local communities and across the country, determined to do all that they can to give people a chance in a system that is determined to confuse and punish asylum-seekers with the singular goal that they will give up. 
 
One lawyer moved across the country to Brownsville and has poured herself into the effort to shore up justice as the government dismantles basic principles of the rule of law at the border. As she described it, this is one of those times when you need to show up or face your conscience. And so many have indeed decided to show up. 
Canada’s chance to show up lies in rejecting Donald Trump’s border vitriol and championing the rights of refugees and migrants. That means suspending the US/Canada Safe Third Country Agreement, which is based on the disgraceful illusion that the US refugee protection record meets international standards such that refugee claimants can be sent back from Canada into the US to pursue their claims there. 
Amnesty International will be in Federal Court for five days, beginning November 4th, alongside the Canadian Council for Refugees, Canadian Council of Churches and eight courageous refugee claimants from El Salvador, Syria and Ethiopia, challenging the STCA. Until that agreement is suspended or overturned, Canada is complicit in Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of refugees and migrants. 
Canada needs to restore regard for refugee rights at the northern border, so that we can call out what is happening on the southern border. It is time for Canada to show up.

With the arrival of winter, it’s important to take action now. 
The STCA requires that refugee claimants who arrive in Canada or the US request protection in the first country in which they arrive. However, it does not bar refugee claimants from seeking protection in Canada if they do not enter Canada at an official border crossing.  
In response to the harsh, xenophobic immigration polices of President Donald Trump’s administration, many refugee claimants have turned to Canada for protection. Because they would be sent back to the United States if they make a claim for refugee protection at an official border crossing, many have resorted to crossing the border between official border posts. During the winter months, this is particularly dangerous: people have had amputations due to frostbite, and at least one woman believed to have been attempting to cross the border has died. 
Amnesty International, along with the Canadian Council for Refugees and the Canadian Council for Churches, is challenging the STCA in Federal Court. We need you to help us call on Canada to end the STCA in the lead-up to the hearing this November.

‘We can’t complain’ reveals how last month’s offensive – Operation Peace Spring – was accompanied by a wave of repression in Turkey which swept up anyone who deviated from the government’s official line. Journalists, social media users and protesters have been accused of “terrorism” and subjected to criminal investigation, arbitrary detention and travel bans. If prosecuted and found guilty, they could face lengthy prison sentences.
“As the tanks rolled across the Syrian border, the government took the opportunity to launch a domestic campaign to eradicate dissenting opinions from media, social media and the streets. Critical discussion on issues of Kurdish rights and politics has become even further off limits,” said Amnesty International’s Europe Director, Marie Struthers.
“Language around the military incursion was heavily policed, and hundreds of people who expressed their dissenting opinions about Turkey’s military operation were rounded up and are facing investigations under anti-terrorism laws.”
Silencing of journalists
On 10 October, a day after the offensive began, Turkey’s broadcasting regulatory body (RTÜK) warned media outlets that there would be zero tolerance of “any broadcasting that may negatively impact the morale and motivation of […] soldiers or may mislead citizens through incomplete, falsified or partial information that serves the aims of terror”.
On the same day, two journalists were detained. Hakan Demir of the daily newspaper Birgün was questioned over a tweet on the paper’s official Twitter account based on an NBC report stating that “Turkish warplanes have started to carry out airstrikes on civilian areas.”
Meanwhile Fatih Gökhan Diler, managing editor of the Diken news website, was detained after publication of an article with the headline “SDF claim: two civilians lost their lives”. Both journalists were accused of “inciting enmity and hatred” before being released with overseas travel bans pending the outcome of criminal investigations. 
Police also burst into the home of journalist and human rights defender, Nurcan Baysal, at 5am on 19 October. She told Amnesty International: “Having my home raided and my children terrorized by 30 heavily armed, masked police officers simply for some social media posts calling for peace, shows the level of suppression of freedom of expression in Turkey.”
Journalist Özlem Oral was detained on the same day and questioned over tweets criticizing ‘Operation Peace Spring’ which were posted on a Twitter account not even her own. She was released the next day with an overseas travel ban, required to regularly report at a local police station, and not to leave İstanbul where she lives.
On 27 October, lawyer and columnist Nurcan Kaya was detained at Istanbul airport for criticizing the offensive by tweeting “We know from experience how everything you call a peace operation is a massacre”.” She was released after questioning the same day,but received an international travel ban.
It is not just Turkish journalists that have been targeted. On 25 October, President Erdoğan’s lawyers announced that they filed a criminal complaint against the director and editor of French magazine Le Point, following the publication of the October 24 issue which used the cover headline “Ethnic cleansing: the Erdoğan method” in its coverage of the military offensive. The lawyers claimed the cover is insulting to the president, a crime under Turkish law.
Targeting of social media users
In the first week of the offensive alone, 839 social media accounts were under investigation for “sharing criminal content” with 186 people reportedly taken into police custody and 24 remanded in pre-trial detention, according to official figures.
One social media user, who was detained and accused of “propaganda for a terrorist organization” had retweeted three tweets, one of which read: “Rojava [the autonomous Kurdish area in northern Syria] will win. No to War”. Like others, these tweets did not come remotely close to constituting evidence of an internationally recognizable crime.
He was given an overseas travel ban and required to report to a local police station twice a month. One lawyer told Amnesty International: “Using the words ‘war’, ‘occupation’, ‘Rojava’ has become a crime. The judiciary says ‘you cannot say no to war’.”
Targeting of politicians and activists
“Operation Peace Spring” has also been used by the government as a pretext to escalate its crackdown on opposition politicians and activists. Several MPs are currently subject to criminal investigations including Sezgin Tanrıkulu, who is facing a criminal probe for comments he made in the media, and a tweet which read: “Government needs to know this, this is an unjustified war and a war against the Kurds.”
According to lawyers from the Bar Association in Şanlıurfa province, at least 54 people were taken into police custody in the province by counter-terrorism officers on 9 and 10 October. Among them were members of the Kurdish-rooted leftist opposition People’s Democratic Party (HDP), as well as members of left-wing opposition trade unions.
Within the first week of the military offensive at least 27 people, many of whom were affiliated with HDP, were detained in Mardin province on terrorism-related charges. Detainees included the elected mayor of the town of Nusaybin. The government later replaced her with the unelected district governor.
On 12 October the Saturday Mothers, relatives of victims of enforced disappearances who have been holding peaceful vigils every Saturday since 2009 to remember their loved ones, were warned by police that they would break up the vigil “if they utter the word ‘war’”. The peaceful gathering was violently broken up as soon as the statement that criticized the military operation was read out.
“Since the start of the military offensive, Turkey’s already entrenched atmosphere of censorship and fear has deepened, with detentions and trumped-up charges used to silence the few who dare to utter any challenge or criticism of ‘Operation Peace Spring’,” said Marie Struthers.
“The Turkish authorities must stop gagging opinions they don’t like and end the ongoing crackdown. All charges and prosecutions of those targeted for peaceful expression of their opposition to Turkey’s military operations should be immediately dropped.”

Laith Abu Zeyad, Amnesty International’s Campaigner on Israel and Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), was stopped at the Allenby/King Hussein crossing between Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank on 26 October while on his way to attend a relative’s funeral. He was kept waiting for four hours before being informed he has been banned from travelling by Israeli intelligence for undisclosed “security reasons”.
“The Israeli authorities’ claim that they have security reasons for banning Laith Abu Zeyad from travelling is totally absurd. Their failure to provide any details to justify the ban reveals its true intent. This is a sinister move imposed as punishment for his work defending human rights of Palestinians,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“As well as violating Laith’s rights to freedom of movement and association, this travel ban further illustrates the Israeli authorities’ chilling resolve to silence human rights organizations and activists who are critical of the government. It also highlights the cruel and inhuman nature of their policies.”
Laith Abu Zeyad was previously denied a humanitarian permit to enter Israel from the occupied West Bank in September to accompany his mother for chemotherapy treatment in Jerusalem. The permit regime requires all Palestinian residents of the OPT to obtain an entry permit in order to enter Israel, including East Jerusalem, for any reason, including work, medical care and family visits.
As well as cruelly infringing on his family life, these arbitrary travel restrictions are interfering with his human rights work, as they will prevent him from entering East Jerusalem and Israel or travelling abroad for essential activities, including advocacy at the UN and other international organizations and participation in conferences and other events.
“The Israeli authorities must immediately lift arbitrary travel bans on Laith Abu Zeyad and all other Palestinian human rights defenders who are being punished for daring to speak out about Israel’s systematic discrimination and human rights violations against Palestinians,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Israel has a track record of using arbitrary travel bans to harass and intimidate human rights defenders and peaceful activists. Omar Barghouti a co-founder of the BDS movement, has been repeatedly and arbitrarily banned from travel since 2016. Shawan Jabarin, Director of Palestinian rights organization al-Haq, has also faced an arbitrary and punitive travel ban.
According to international human rights standards, restrictions on the right to freedom of movement may only be imposed exceptionally, and must be necessary for a legitimate purpose, proportionate and based on clear legal grounds. The reasons must be made clear, and the restrictions should be open to legal challenge.
The refusal of the Israeli authorities to make public any evidence to substantiate the reasons for this travel ban means Laith Abu Zeyad has also been denied a meaningful opportunity to challenge the ban in court.
Background
Laith Abu Zeyad has been granted three permits to enter Israel, each lasting for six months, since he began working with Amnesty International in November 2017. The last of these three permits was valid from 20 November 2018 to 12 May 2019.
On 8 September 2019, Laith Abu Zeyad applied for a humanitarian permit at al-Zaytoona military checkpoint (Hazatem) to accompany his mother for medical treatment in Jerusalem. His application was denied on the same day based on “security reasons” without any further explanation.
On 13 June 2018, Laith Abu Zeyad was among those arbitrarily detained and tortured by Palestinian security forces, during a crackdown on a demonstration organized by Palestinian activists in Ramallah demanding that the Ramallah-based Palestinian authorities lift the sanctions imposed on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. He had been apprehended and attacked by two security officials in civilian clothes on his way to monitor the demonstration.
In recent years, Israeli authorities have dramatically intensified their intimidation of civil society organizations and their staff in Israel and the OPT. Civil society are facing continuing attacks, through restrictive legislation and governmental policies coupled with smear campaigns aimed at delegitimizing human rights work. Last month, Israeli forces raided the offices of Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association, a Palestinian human rights organization. The Israeli Supreme Court also heard an appeal against a government decision to revoke the work permit of Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine Director, Omar Shakir, paving the way for his deportation.

We invite you to consider joining the Fieldworkers!  
Fieldwork is a great way to be involved in activism because we have the ability to shape our human rights work and be involved in our communities in a way that makes sense. As Fieldworkers, we are catalysts of activism and we work to support activists near us to take action on human rights issues. We can do this by writing letters with local groups and helping to support the projects that activists are taking on in their communities. 
Fieldworkers, like Gord and Crystal in Regina, Saskatchewan, support groups in their human rights actions and provide leadership for folks who want to defend human rights. 
Fieldworkers serve as key resources and work to educate Amnesty members as well as the public on human rights issues and Amnesty campaigns. Shelley is a Fieldworker in Calgary, Alberta, fresh out of training with keen skills for learning new things and teaching others. 
Our team of Fieldworkers is a diverse group of individuals with many different identities and lived experiences. Our differences are our strengths and we bring our full selves to our human rights work as the public faces of Amnesty International Canada. Fieldworkers like Mohamed in Mississauga, Ontario, connect to people through public speaking and forge new relationships between all types of activists. 
Fieldworkers span the whole country from coast to coast and we’re looking to add to our team. Fieldworkers are dynamic because we have each other across the country as well as the communities we build and are a part of closer to home. There’s no one way to be a Fieldworker, all that we really have in common is that we all have big hearts for human rights. If you’d like to know more about us or you’d like to apply to join us, please email Shauna MacLean at smaclean@amnesty.ca!

Young people living in the Indigenous Anishinaabe First Nation of Grassy Narrows in northwestern Ontario are fighting for a healthy future for themselves and their community. Over the past 50 years, toxic mercury has poisoned rivers and fish vital to Grassy Narrows. Because of government inaction, generations of young people have grown up with devastating health problems and the loss of their cultural traditions.
This year, Amnesty International is urging everyone to help demand justice for Grassy Narrows through the Write for Rights campaign by writing letters calling on the Canadian government to fully address the mercury crisis and end 50 years of human rights violations.

Evidence gathered...","Iraqi security forces resorted yet again to excessive and unlawful lethal force to disperse crowds of largely peaceful protesters in the southern city of Karbala last night, said Amnesty International, after at least 14 protesters were reported killed and more than 100 injured.
Evidence gathered from eyewitnesses and verified geo-located video footage indicates that Iraqi security forces and anti-riot police opened fire using live ammunition as well as tear gas, chasing peaceful protesters staging a sit-in at the Tarbiya roundabout on 28 October. Witnesses also said security forces attempted to run them over with vehicles. 
“In horrific scenes from Karbala last night, Iraqi forces opened live fire on peaceful protesters and resorted to excessive and often lethal force to disperse them in a reckless and utterly unlawful manner. These scenes are all the more shocking as they come despite assurances from Iraqi authorities that there would be no repeat of the extreme violence used against demonstrators during protests earlier this month,” said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International.
“According to international law, security forces should refrain from the use of firearms unless there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury and there is no suitable alternative available. Eyewitness accounts clearly suggest that was not the case. Iraqi authorities must immediately rein in security forces to prevent further bloodshed.”
A second wave of protests erupted on 24 October in Baghdad and other governorates across Iraq including Diwaniya, Thi Qar, Basra, Karbala, Najaf, Maysan and Babel. According to the Independent High Commission for Human Rights in Iraq, at least 77 protesters have been killed and 3,654 injured in this latest round of protests.
One eyewitness present during protests in Karbala last night told Amnesty International that security forces had attempted to chase away protesters using tear gas and batons on previous days, but that the violence used last night was far more extreme.
“Security forces opened fire on the protesters they were chasing. There was a black four-wheel drive that started to drive towards the roundabout and attempted to run over the protesters. It was complete horror. There were women and children. The children were screaming. The security forces dispersed everyone and started chasing them into the side streets,” he said.
A doctor at al-Hussein hospital in Karbala interviewed by Amnesty International said protesters arrived at the emergency room last night with shrapnel and gunshot wounds including in the leg, stomach, eye and head. The doctor added that they had also received several protesters injured due to beatings in recent days and that on 27 October security forces in plainclothes had visited the hospital and arrested around 50 people suspected of participating in protests. 
“They arrested a lot of people from the hospital… They even took children. One of the protesters they took was 14 years old,” the doctor said.
Another eyewitness told Amnesty International that at first, army officers had verbally warned protesters not to cross the gate to the government buildings near the roundabout where protesters have gathered since 24 October. Some of the protesters ignored the warnings and approached the area but were driven back by tear gas and sound grenades.
“They used a lot of tear gas. Even the army was suffocating and started leaving. When the army left, the protesters started burning tyres and trash,” he said, adding that protesters began to throw stones in response.
“Around 8pm they started using live ammunition to disperse us. At first it was a little, then it started increasing,” he added.
The eyewitness said that at around 11pm anti-riot police cars began charging towards the peaceful protesters, attempting to run them over. He said the tactic of using cars to run over protesters was also used in protests over the weekend. 
Another protester said he was attending the largely peaceful protest when he heard gunshots coming from the area near the government buildings. He described how security forces dressed in black were chasing protesters.
“There were about seven to 10 cars driving fast towards us and the men inside were shooting in the air to scare people. We all started retreating… protesters and the army were injured alike. These other forces started catching people and beating them, even young boys. They beat them so savagely. They grabbed me and started hitting me on my head…. The live fire was non-stop. It was complete horror. There were children as young as 12 among the protesters.”
One protester who was arrested in Karbala on 28 October described the appalling detention conditions at the anti-crime station inside a complex of government buildings.
“There was blood all over the walls. There were boys who were under the age of 18. We heard screams from the other room,” he said, adding that he saw at least one child bleeding heavily from the mouth after being kicked in the face and another young man with similar wounds denied medical care.
“Iraqi forces must order an independent impartial investigation into events last night in Karbala and ensure all those responsible are held accountable for their actions,” said Lynn Maalouf.
Amnesty International is also calling on Iraqi authorities to end arbitrary arrests and lift the curfews imposed in several areas in the country, including Karbala.

The court will hear that...,"Demonstrators to rally outside Toronto court in support of legal challenge to flawed Safe Third Country Agreement 
29 October 2019
From November 4th to 8th the Federal Court of Canada will hear a challenge to the designation of the U.S. as a safe third country for refugees. The court will hear that sending refugee claimants back to the US violates Canadian law, including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and Canada’s binding international human rights obligations.
The Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), Amnesty International (AI) and The Canadian Council of Churches (CCC), alongside an individual litigant and her children, initiated the legal challenge in July 2017. The hearings are taking place at the Federal Court of Canada in Toronto, at 180 Queen Street West.
“We are asking the court to look at the impact of the Safe Third Country Agreement on women, men and children who can’t find safety in the U.S. and to assess the legality of Canada sending them back to detention and potential deportation to persecution,” said Claire Roque, CCR President. “The impacts are particularly severe for women, because of U.S. policies that close the door on women fleeing gender-based violence. The conclusion is clear to us: the U.S. cannot be considered a safe country for refugees.”
“The Canadian Council of Churches has long advocated that every human being who is physically present in Canada has a legal right to life, liberty and security of person under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms,” said Peter Noteboom, General Secretary of The Canadian Council of Churches. “The U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement stands in the way of guaranteeing those legal rights.” 
“The time for Canada to rely on the adequacy of the U.S. protection regime has come to a definitive end,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International. “In the absence of action on the part of Canada’s elected representatives to acknowledge the serious shortcomings of the U.S. refugee protection system, we now turn to the courts to ensure that Canada’s domestic and international legal obligations are upheld.”    
The organizations and individuals leading the legal challenge have submitted extensive evidence that the U.S. system fails in many ways to protect refugees, and that people turned back from Canada under the Safe Third Country Agreement are at risk of being sent in turn by the U.S. to face persecution, torture and even death in their home countries.
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, implemented in 2004, refugees who present themselves at a Canada-U.S. border post seeking to make a refugee claim in Canada are, with limited exceptions, denied access to the Canadian refugee system and immediately returned to the United States. Since the Agreement does not apply to people who cross into Canada other than at an official border post, people in need of safety in Canada have been crossing in significant numbers in between ports of entry. Withdrawing from the Agreement would not only ensure that Canada meets its legal obligations, but would also allow people to present themselves in an orderly way at ports of entry, ending irregular crossings.
A rally will be held outside the Court (180 Queen Street West) in support of the legal challenge on Monday, November 4 at 12:30pm.

From the streets of Hong Kong to La Paz, Quito, Barcelona, Beirut and Santiago, we have witnessed a huge wave of people taking to the streets to exercise their right to protest and demand change from those in power. 
Sadly, a common thread throughout these protests has been an extremely harsh response from the state, which in many instances have amounted to gross violations of human rights. 
Amnesty International has documented signs of abuse and violations at protests in Bolivia, Lebanon, Chile, Spain, Iraq, Guinea, Hong Kong, the UK, Ecuador, Cameroon and Egypt in October so far.

In places like Hong Kong the protests have lasted over a long period of time despite police crackdowns, whereas in other countries demonstrations were quickly repressed through tactics such as mass arrests. In Egypt more than 2,300 people were detained for taking part in demonstrations this September. If referred to trial, it would be the largest protest-related criminal case in Egypt’s history. 
At Amnesty International we always make it clear that protesting peacefully is not a crime, it is in fact a human right. The way governments have by and large chosen to respond to these protests has been massively disproportionate, unwarranted and therefore unlawful. 
Protesters are exercising their human rights and should be allowed to do so. But what is just as important is that the reasons why people are taking to the streets are also often linked to human rights concerns.

Here we look at some of the common factors influencing people to protest. 
Allegations of government corruption have helped to spark massive waves of protests across Chile, Egypt and Lebanon. 
In late September thousands of people took part in demonstrations nationwide across Egypt. Many gathered in Tahrir Square, Cairo, famous from the 2011 protests that toppled the previous head of state Hosni Mubarak. The protests were triggered by a series of viral videos claiming high-level corruption in the Egyptian military.   
And in Lebanon, one of the overwhelming drivers to the calls for the government’s resignation – and more broadly the change of political establishment – is the latter’s perceived corruption and failure to provide basic social and economic rights. Tellingly, people have been calling for all ministers and public officials to be held accountable for what people perceive to be stolen public funds. 
The abuse of public funds through corruption is not only a criminal concern, it’s also a human rights issue because it often results in the diversion of funds away from essential services. Under human rights law governments are required to make the best use of resources to ensure people can live in dignity. 
Promises by government officials to address protesters’ grievances ring terribly deceitful when security forces are given free rein to prevent the Lebanese people from voicing their anger. Our statement about yesterday’s brutal clampdown https://t.co/KMMGYefFcf

Where corruption is a concern so too is the cost of living. In Chile, demonstrations were kicked off by students after the government announced a hike in transport fares in Santiago de Chile, the country’s capital. 
Since then the protests have snowballed to cover the vast number of government policies that have placed a burden on the economic, cultural and social rights of ordinary people across Chile. People’s concerns about inequality are underscored by the fact that Chile has one of the worst levels of income inequality. 
People’s legitimate concerns over the increasing cost of living have been made worse by the fact that many governments are also imposing harsh economic austerity measures, like in Egypt and Ecuador.

In Ecuador the government decision to end fuel subsidies led to massive protests over a contested austerity package, which the government has now been forced to climb down on. 
The impact of austerity on people is however only set to get worse. One report forecasts that in 2021 two-thirds of all countries will be impacted by austerity, affecting nearly six billion people. The human cost is estimated to include millions being put out of work as a result of these measures, with few prospects of alternative employment. 
The burning injustices of climate change and environmental degradation have increasingly become the focus of protests in the past year. From Indigenous activists who are leading the charge against environmental degradation, to the emergence of civil disobedience-led groups which have dominated headlines in the UK, to mass protests over the government’s handling of wildfires in Bolivia, more and more people are taking to the streets to express their concern over how leaders are responding to this crisis. 
But one of the standout moments came in September, when more than 7.6 million people took part in a week of climate strikes in 185 countries. The protests were organized by Fridays for Future, a youth-led movement started by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who started striking outside her parliament only just over a year ago.

Amnesty International awarded the Fridays for Future movement with its highest honour this year, the Ambassador of Conscience award. Upon accepting the award, Greta Thunberg said: “This award is for all of those millions of people, young people, around the world who together make up the movement called Fridays for Future. All these fearless youth, fighting for their future. A future they should be able to take for granted. But as it looks now, they cannot.” 
This month saw massive mobilizations and demonstrations occurring in Barcelona and the rest of Catalonia after Spain’s Supreme Court sentenced 12 Catalan political leaders and activists.  
And in India protests have been held after the government of India’s unilateral decision to revoke Article 370 of the Indian Constitution which guaranteed special autonomy to Jammu & Kashmir and split the state into two separate union territories. All these amendments and changes were made amidst a complete communication blackout, curfew on movement and mass detentions of political leaders and activists in the region.

Hong Kong has been home to arguably one of the biggest and most sustained protests linked to political freedoms this year. The protests started in April 2019 after the government of Hong Kong proposed a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. 
People have taken to the streets in record-breaking numbers. While the government eventually dropped plans to introduce the draft law, the protests have evolved into a much wider call for change, which include calls for a full review of the police response and political reforms to allow them to choose Hong Kong’s leaders themselves.

The Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous...","Our nations and organizations welcome the tabling of Bill 41, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, to provide a framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in British Columbia. The Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples is urging all members of the provincial legislature to support the Bill in a non-partisan manner.
The Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples is made up of Indigenous Nations, Indigenous peoples’ organizations, civil society groups and individual experts and advocates. The Coalition has been deeply involved in the development, promotion and implementation of the Declaration. We are firmly convinced of the Declaration’s vital importance for achieving justice, reconciliation, healing and peace.
Bill 41 provides a legislative framework for British Columbia to lead at the provincial level and move forward with the important and urgent work of implementing the Declaration. This framework will address the legacy of colonialism in B.C. laws and policies that continue to deny Indigenous peoples and individuals their basic human rights. We hope other provinces will follow the lead that B.C. has set.
The Act requires the province to collaborate with Indigenous peoples in developing an action plan to implement the UN Declaration. It also calls for a collaborative process to ensure that B.C. laws live up to the human rights affirmed in the UN Declaration.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action, which have been widely endorsed at the federal, provincial, and territorial levels, urged all governments to implement the Declaration as the framework for reconciliation in Canada.  
Those opposing the Declaration focus on its provisions requiring the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous peoples on decisions that affect their well-being.  However, these provisions are wholly consistent with the existing requirements of international law, including how expert bodies have interpreted and applied international human rights Conventions including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination.
In Canadian legal tradition, international human rights instruments are considered as relevant and persuasive sources of interpreting human rights domestically. Canadian courts and tribunals are already using the Declaration in this way. In addition, specific commitments to uphold the Declaration have already been written into a number of recent Canadian laws both provincially and federally.
Furthermore, the concept of FPIC is not foreign to Canadian law and legal history. Treaties would have no legitimacy without Indigenous consent. The Supreme Court of Canada in Delgamuukw (1997) and Haida Nation (2004) stated that Indigenous consent may be required on serious issues to prevent the Crown running roughshod over Indigenous rights and interests.  In the Tsilhqot’in decision (2014) the Supreme Court defined Indigenous land title as including the requirement that decisions be made with Indigenous consent.
In other words, even without legislation to implement the Declaration, governments and courts would be called upon to respect and implement FPIC. Legitimate debate about implications of adhering to the UN Declaration cannot ignore these facts.
Crucially, the Act provides the opportunity for open and transparent collaboration between Indigenous peoples and the provincial government on how FPIC and other standards in the Declaration can be implemented in a consistent and principled manner.
In 2010 Canada formally endorsed the UN Declaration and expressed “confidence” that the Declaration is consistent with Canada’s Constitution and legal framework. More recently, the federal government has repeatedly pledged to fully implement the Declaration.
There is very wide spread support across the country for legislation to implement the Declaration. Similar legislation was passed by the federal Parliament in 2018 but died on the order paper after an unscrupulous campaign of filibustering by a handful of Conservative Senators.
As a legislative framework that includes regular reporting, the Act also provides the means to hold this and future governments accountable to the commitments that have been made to honour and respect the rights of Indigenous peoples.
Critically important in this Act is the opportunity for the province to work with Indigenous peoples on joint decision-making, including the recognition and affirmation of Indigenous governance.
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission clearly told us that reconciliation requires hard work by all sectors of society. Adoption of legislation at the provincial level is a vital part of this journey. We strongly encourage all Members of B.C. legislature to actively support the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.
Background
The UN Declaration was the subject of one of the most extensive standard-setting processes ever undertaken in the international human rights system. The collaboration between Indigenous peoples and Canadian government representatives during the final years of negotiation was a key factor in developing a text that could attain broad, global support from both Indigenous Peoples and States. Today, the Declaration stands as a global human rights instrument, which to date has been reaffirmed 10 times by the UN General Assembly by consensus.

They did this an astonishing 5,911,113 times as part of Amnesty’s 2018 Write for Rights – an annual letter-writing marathon on or around International Human Rights Day (December 10th) that has become the world’s biggest human rights event.

Gulzar Duishenova had been championing disability rights in her country for years. In March 2019, her persistence paid off when Kyrgyzstan finally signed up to the Disability Rights Convention. Supporters wrote nearly a quarter of a million messages backing her. “I am grateful for all the support and solidarity from so many of Amnesty International’s activists who care about our rights despite being from a different country,” said Gulzar.

Marielle Franco was a charismatic local politician who always stood up for Brazil’s poorest: black women, LGBTI people, young people. In March 2018, she was gunned down in her car. Experts said the bullets had belonged to the Brazilian Federal Police. One year later, two ex-police officers were arrested for her killing. It was a small step towards justice, no doubt aided by the more than half a million messages demanding “Who killed Marielle Franco?” 
“It helps me to get up in the morning and see some meaning, knowing that there is this big global network of affection,” said Monica Benicio (pictured), Marielle’s partner, when asked what it meant to be part of Write for Rights. “All these demonstrations of love and affection are helping us to mobilise, to demand justice, to pressure for investigation and above all to fight so that there will be no more Marielles.”

She needed specialist medical care urgently, and thanks to the more than 700,000 actions taken by people worldwide, Iran finally gave her the treatment she needed. “I am wholeheartedly grateful to all people around the world who have showered me with compassion and kindness and spared no effort in supporting me,” she said.

Nonhle Mbuthuma and her community have struggled hard to stop a mining company from extracting titanium from her people’s ancestral land in South Africa. But her campaign has put her danger. Nonhle has survived harassment, threats, even an assassination attempt. “Some of my colleagues have been killed, and I know I could be too. But I am not scared,” she told us when we spoke to her last year. 
Through Write for Rights, people took more than half a million actions for Nonhle. “I want to thank Amnesty globally, the support they gave us is amazing and it makes a lot of difference,” Nonhle recently told us. “The thousands of letters we have received shows that this struggle is not just about us, that we are not alone. It shows that the earth is important, and not only in Africa, because we have received letters from Germany, Sweden, Norway, and France. They want peace at the end of the day because without land there is no peace.”

So, what can a tweet, postcard or signature really achieve? As it turns out, LOADS. With their words, supporters unleashed a wave of warmth and solidarity across the globe for the women we featured last year. Those words helped comfort people in distress. They also helped amplify these women’s calls for justice, in some cases persuading leaders to step up and do the right thing by them. 
As we close out 2019, Write for Rights kicks off again. This year, we’re standing by young people around the world who are facing danger because the adults in charge are failing to protect them. These young people need you to stand by them. If you have any doubts, read what Geraldine Chacón (pictured) has to say. She’s a young activist from Venezuela who was at constant risk of being thrown back in jail for helping young people know their rights. 
“I’ve campaigned for Write for Rights cases before,” said Geraldine. “I never imagined I’d be on the other side of the campaign. I have no words to thank all that Amnesty has done for me.” People wrote thousands of letters in support of her in 2018, and she had this to say about what they meant to her: “A letter has the power to turn a bad day into a happy day.” 
So, get writing. Join Write for Rights 2019.

During the annual Independence Day march in Warsaw in 2017, when many far-right protestors gathered calling for things like a “white Poland”, the 14 women refused to let it go unchallenged. They headed to the Poniatowski Bridge to peacefully confront the hatred. 
What they encountered there was deeply disturbing.

Moments later, the women came under attack. Several of the far-right protestors were caught on camera kicking, hitting, spitting and verbally abusing the women. 
Afterwards, despite footage documenting the violence, the authorities decided to close the investigation into the attacks on the women. Adding insult to injury, the authorities instead charged 13 of the women with obstructing a lawful assembly. 
The women appealed the decision of the Prosecutor not to investigate the attacks against them, and on February 13, 2019, a judge ordered that the investigation should be re-opened. This sent a positive message that violence won’t simply be tolerated or excused.

0,Turkey: Syrians illegally deported into war ahead of anticipated ‘safe zone’,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/turkey-syrians-illegally-deported-war-ahead-anticipated-safe-zone/,"Turkey spent the months leading up to its military incursion into northeast Syria forcibly deporting refugees to the war-torn country, in advance of attempting to create a so-called “safe zone” on the Syrian side of the border, a new Amnesty International report ‘Sent to a War Zone:...","Turkey spent the months leading up to its military incursion into northeast Syria forcibly deporting refugees to the war-torn country, in advance of attempting to create a so-called “safe zone” on the Syrian side of the border, a new Amnesty International report ‘Sent to a War Zone: Turkey’s Illegal Deportations Of Syrian Refugees’ has revealed.
The organization met or spoke with refugees who said Turkish police had beaten or threatened them into signing documents stating they were asking to return to Syria, when in reality Turkey was forcing them back to a war zone and putting their lives in grave danger.
“Turkey’s claim that refugees from Syria are choosing to walk straight back into the conflict is dangerous and dishonest. Rather, our research shows that people are being tricked or forced into returning,” said Anna Shea, Researcher on Refugee and Migrant Rights at Amnesty International.
“Turkey deserves recognition for hosting more than 3.6 million women, men and children from Syria for over eight years, but it cannot use this generosity as an excuse to flout international and domestic law by deporting people to an active conflict zone.”
Without official statistics, estimating the number of forced deportations is difficult. But based on dozens of interviews conducted between July and October 2019 for the report, ‘Sent to a war zone: Turkey’s illegal deportations of Syrian refugees’, Amnesty International estimates that over the past few months the figure is likely in the hundreds. The Turkish authorities claim that a total of 315,000 people have left for Syria on an entirely voluntary basis.
It is illegal to deport people to Syria as it exposes them to a real risk of serious human rights violations.
“It is chilling that Turkey’s deal with Russia this week agrees to the ‘safe and voluntary return’ of refugees to a yet to-be-established ‘safe zone.’ Returns until now have been anything but safe and voluntary – and now millions more refugees from Syria are at risk,” said Anna Shea.
Forced returns disguised as “voluntary”
The Turkish government claims that all those who return to Syria do so voluntarily, but Amnesty International’s research showed that many had been coerced or misled when signing so-called “voluntary return” documents.
Some said they were beaten or threatened with violence to force them to sign. Others were told they were signing a registration document, that it was a confirmation of having received a blanket from a detention centre, or a form that expressed their desire to remain in Turkey.
Amnesty International documented 20 verified cases of forced deportations, each of which involved people being sent across the border on buses filled with dozens of other people who were handcuffed with plastic ties and were also seemingly being forcibly deported.
Qasim*, a 39-year-old father from Aleppo, said he was detained in a Konya police station for six days, where the officers reportedly told him: “You have a choice: one or two months, or a year, in prison – or you go to Syria.”
John, a Syrian Christian, said Turkish migration officials told him: “If you ask for a lawyer we will keep you six or seven months and we will hurt you.”
He was deported after being caught by the Turkish coastguard trying to get to Greece, and said that after arriving in Syria he was detained for a week in Idlib by Jabhat al Nusra, an Islamist group linked to Al Qaeda.
“It was a miracle I got out alive,” he said.
Any interaction with Turkish police or migration officials appears to put refugees from Syria at risk of detention and deportation, such as attending an interview to renew valid documents, or being asked for identification on the street.
The most common explanation given to people for their deportation is that they are unregistered or outside their province of registration. However, even people with valid IDs for their province of residence have been deported.
The overwhelming majority of deportees appear to be adult men transported together on buses through Turkey’s Hatay province to the Bab al-Hawa border crossing in the Syrian province of Idlib.
However Kareem, a 23-year-old man from Aleppo, said he was deported from Istanbul with two children aged 15 and 16, who were unregistered. Their mothers pleaded with the authorities outside the bus while their children were inside, but military police reportedly said the boys were breaking the law because they had no IDs, and that they would therefore be deported.
Nabil, a young man with a wife and two-year-old son, told Amnesty International that he and his family were detained in Ankara in June 2019, alongside more than 100 other people. All the detainees were families except for three single men. Nabil said that after three days, they were told they were being taken to a camp in Hatay province, but instead they were all deported by bus to Idlib.
“The Turkish authorities must stop forcibly returning people to Syria and ensure that anyone who has been deported is able to re-enter Turkey safely and re-access essential services,” said Anna Shea.
“The European Union and the rest of the international community, instead of devoting their energies to keeping people seeking asylum from their territories, should dramatically increase resettlement commitments for Syrian refugees from Turkey.”

The conflicts show no sign of abating, raising the prospect of further violations.
A new report, “Caught in the middle”: Abuses against civilians amid conflict in Myanmar’s northern Shan State, details the harrowing conditions of civilians arbitrarily arrested, detained and tortured by the military. It also highlights the abusive tactics used by ethnic armed groups as they confront the military and each other to exert control in the region.
“The Myanmar military is as relentless and ruthless as ever, committing war crimes against civilians in northern Shan State with absolute impunity,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southeast Asia. “Soldiers – and more importantly commanders – are subjecting civilians to the military’s hallmark brutality in the absence of any form of accountability.”
Amnesty International documented war crimes and other military violations against ethnic Kachin, Lisu, Shan, and Ta’ang civilians during two field missions to the region in March and August 2019.
Civilians who spoke to Amnesty International repeatedly implicated the military’s 99th Light Infantry Division (LID) in many of the violations. Units from the 99th LID were implicated in some of the worst atrocities against the Rohingya in Rakhine State since August 2017, as well as in war crimes and other serious violations in northern Myanmar in 2016 and early 2017.
“Wherever the 99th Light Infantry Division is deployed we see similar patterns of abuse and the commission of horrific crimes unfold. This highlights the urgency of international action to hold Myanmar’s military – not least its senior generals – accountable.”
Violations have continued even after the military announced a unilateral ceasefire, since lapsed, in December 2018. A recent escalation of fighting in the region – which the government has linked to illegal drug trafficking but which ethnic armed groups attribute to ongoing military offensives – has brought new reports of violations. Meanwhile, progress on the country’s stalled peace process looks unlikely as all sides gear up for general elections in 2020.
Familiar patterns of military violations
Myanmar soldiers have committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in the last year, particularly in the northernmost townships of Shan State. These have continued even after the military’s announcement of a unilateral ceasefire in the area on 21 December 2018.
Soldiers have detained civilians – overwhelmingly men and boys – often torturing or subjecting them to other forms of ill-treatment. Most were accused of having links to specific armed groups based solely on their ethnicity, a sign of the climate of suspicion, discrimination and arbitrary punishment that Kachin, Shan, Ta’ang and other ethnic minority communities face at the hands of the Myanmar military. The military has also fired indiscriminately in civilian areas, killing and injuring civilians and damaging homes and other property.
On 11 March 2019, soldiers from the 99th LID detained and tortured two ethnic Kachin villagers in Kutkai Township. While the men were away fishing, fighting broke out between the military and the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). One of the men, 35, recalled what happened when they encountered the group of soldiers:
“[A soldier asked] ‘Are you KIA?’ I said ‘no’, then they started punching and kicking me. They forced me to take off my clothes [and] held a knife to my neck… Then they forced me to squat with my fingers on my knees… They told me if I moved they would cut off my fingers… They put a grenade in my mouth… I was afraid if I moved it would explode.”
In some cases, detainees were taken to military bases where they were held incommunicado for up to three months and denied access to family and lawyers. In one case documented by Amnesty International, an 18-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy were subjected to forced labour, including digging trenches, while being held at a military base in the town of Kutkai.
Before being taken to the base the 18-year-old was beaten, then tortured further. He said: “They asked if I was a [KIA] soldier… I kept saying no, then they put a plastic bag over my head [and] tied it tight by holding it in the back. They were asking me if I knew any soldiers from the village. They did it six or seven times, each time for two or three minutes. I couldn’t breathe.”
Ethnic armed groups also committing abuses
Civilians are increasingly caught between ethnic armed groups who abduct, detain and sometimes torture men and boys, often accusing them of supporting a rival armed group. Amnesty International documented such abuses by the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Shan State Army-North (SSA-N), the Shan State Army-South (SSA-S), and the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA).
Armed groups have also subjected civilians to forced labour. Amnesty International documented several instances when civilians were forced to work as porters, carry fighters’ belongings and guide them to other villages during active combat, putting their lives at risk. Civilians also told Amnesty International that armed groups regularly extort food and money from them, threatening anyone who refuses with physical violence.
“Armed groups are responsible for heinous abuses against civilians, including abductions, forced labour and beatings. We are calling on all sides to stop targeting civilians, and to take all possible measures to keep fighting away from populated areas,” said Nicholas Bequelin.
Civilians paying the price
Thousands have been forced to flee their homes in the last year as the fighting moves closer to villages. Many people have been displaced multiple times. One women told Amnesty International she had fled her home four times in March 2019 alone.
Villagers often flee to makeshift displacement sites such as churches and monasteries, where they stay until the fighting moves to a different area. These short-term displacements can make it difficult for humanitarian workers to access people in need, made worse by government and military restrictions on humanitarian access.
Even those who flee are not safe, with an alarming increase since 2018 in the number of civilians killed or injured by landmines or improvised explosive devices.
Amnesty International is calling on all sides to respect international humanitarian and human rights law, protect civilians, and ensure humanitarian access. Armed groups must end acts of violence and intimidation against civilians and take all feasible measures to avoid civilian-populated areas.
“Those responsible for war crimes should face justice, all the way up to Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the Myanmar military’s Commander-in-Chief,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “Fighters and commanders in ethnic armed groups should also be investigated and held accountable for war crimes.”
“For too long the UN Security Council has stood by as civilians were abandoned to a ceaseless cycle of violence. It is time for the Council to stop dragging its feet and refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.”

More than 100 civilians killed and injured; 100,000 displaced
UN arms embargo violations by UAE, Turkey and others fuel potential war crimes 
Warring parties in the ongoing battle for Tripoli have killed and maimed scores of civilians by launching indiscriminate attacks and using a range of inaccurate explosive weapons in populated urban areas, Amnesty International said in a new report today.
In the first in-depth field investigation across the frontline since fighting broke out on 4 April, the organization visited 33 air and ground strike sites in Tripoli and surrounding areas. It unearthed evidence of potential war crimes by both the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) and the self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA), who have been fighting in and around the city.
“Our on-the-ground investigation on both sides of the frontline revealed a systematic disregard for international law fuelled by the continued supply of weapons to both sides in violation of a UN arms embargo,” said Donatella Rovera, Senior Crisis Response Adviser at Amnesty International.
“Scores of civilians have been killed and injured as both sides use everything from Gaddafi-era unguided rockets to modern drone-launched guided missiles in attacks that could amount to war crimes,” said Brian Castner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Advisor on Arms and Military Operations.
First investigation on both sides of Tripoli frontline
Amnesty International investigators were on the ground in Libya from 1 to 14 August, and visited both sides of the conflict in and around Tripoli, Tajoura, Ain Zara, Qasr Bin Ghashir and Tarhouna. They interviewed 156 residents, including survivors, witnesses and relatives of victims, as well as local officials, medical workers and members of militias.
Amnesty International experts in remote sensing, weapons and ordnance, photographic and video verification, and members of its Digital Verification Corps also carried out an open source investigation into many of the strikes.
GNA and LNA officials have not responded to questions Amnesty International sent about their strikes.
Civilians caught in the crossfire
According to UN statistics, the fighting over the last six months has killed and wounded more than 100 civilians – including dozens of detained migrants and refugees – and has displaced more than 100,000. Air strikes, artillery barrages and shelling have struck civilian homes and other key infrastructure, including several field hospitals, a school, and a migrant detention centre, and have forced the closure of the Mitiga airport, Tripoli’s sole international air link.
Some of the attacks documented by Amnesty International were either indiscriminate or disproportionate – meaning they violated fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and could amount to war crimes. In other cases, the presence of fighters at or near civilian homes and medical facilities endangered civilians there.
Children as young as two years old playing outside their homes, mourners attending a funeral, and ordinary people going about their daily activities were among those unlawfully killed or injured.
“What kind of war is this, killing civilians, families, in their homes? What can we do? May God help us,” one woman told Amnesty International. Her husband, a 56-year-old father of six, was killed when a rocket struck his own bedroom where he was resting after returning home from playing football.
It was part of an indiscriminate attack launched by the LNA on the Abu Salim neighbourhood just before 11pm on 16 April, 2019. The salvo of six notoriously inaccurate ground-launched “Grad” rockets rained down over several city blocks, killing eight civilians, injuring at least four more, and leaving the survivors badly traumatized.
A GNA artillery attack on the densely populated civilian neighbourhood of Qasr bin Ghashir at around 12.15pm on 14 May, 2019, hit a three-storey building, killing at least five civilians and injuring more than a dozen. Many people were moving about the area at the time to attend the funeral of a well-known neighbour.
“I was at home and my brother was standing outside on the street. The strike was massive; it sent a vehicle flying on top of another vehicle and for a moment everything was black. I rushed outside and there were many neighbours dead and injured on the ground; there were severed body parts. It was a shocking sight. Then we found my brother; he had injuries everywhere; he died. I couldn’t believe it,” the brother of 19-year-old Ahmad Fathi al-Muzughi, who died in the strike, told Amnesty International.
GNA air strikes in Qasr Bin Ghashir and Tarhouna have also hit civilian homes and infrastructure, utilizing FAB-500ShL unguided “parachute” bombs. With a blast radius of over 800m, this weapon is completely inappropriate for use in urban areas.
Airport and field hospitals attacked
Mitiga Airport – for months Tripoli’s only functioning airport – is now closed after being repeatedly targeted by LNA attacks. Nearby civilian homes and a school have also been struck in what appear to be indiscriminate attacks. Amnesty International experts examined craters and munitions fragments at several of these strike sites, pointing to the use of unguided, large explosive weapons.
LNA attacks have also damaged or destroyed several ambulances and field hospitals used to treat wounded fighters. Medical workers and facilities – including those treating sick or wounded fighters – have special protection under international humanitarian law and should not be targeted. Amnesty International has found that GNA fighters have used field hospitals and medical facilities for military purposes, thereby rendering them vulnerable to attacks.
The deadliest such attack was a missile strike on a field hospital near the closed Tripoli International Airport on 27 July 2019 that killed five medics and rescuers and injured eight more. Based on Blue Arrow 7 munition fragments found at the site and other evidence, Amnesty International determined that the strike was launched from a Chinese Wing Loong drone – which the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been operating on behalf of the LNA. The organization also established that the facility was not marked as a medical facility and had also been used by fighters for eating and other purposes.
UN arms embargo violated
Despite a comprehensive UN arms embargo in place since 2011, the UAE and Turkey have been supporting the LNA and GNA, respectively, through illicit arms transfers and direct military support.
“The international community must uphold the UN arms embargo, which Turkey, the UAE, Jordan and other countries have flagrantly violated,” said Brian Castner.
“All sides must take immediate and concrete steps to protect civilians in line with the laws of war and investigate the conduct of their forces. A Commission of Inquiry should be put in place to pave the way for justice and reparation for the victims and their families,” said Donatella Rovera.
“Members of the UN Human Rights Council should work together to establish this mechanism as a matter of urgency, which could determine responsibility for violations and preserve evidence of crimes.”

3. Will you introduce effective and transparent due diligence requirements for Canadian embassies and Export Development Canada to prevent these public agencies from supporting, financing and insuring business activity that is linked to human rights abuse? 
Here are the responses received by the New Democratic Party (NDP), Bloc Québécois (French only), Green Party of Canada (GPC), Christian Heritage Party (CHP Canada), and Marijuana Party. 
Disappointingly, the Liberal Party of Canada (LPC), Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) and People’s Party of Canada (PPC) have not detailed any commitments on corporate accountability and human rights in response to the questions submitted by our network.

0,Syria: Damning evidence of war crimes and other violations by Turkish forces and allied armed groups,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/syria-damning-evidence-war-crimes-and-other-violations-turkish-forces-and-allied-armed-groups/,"Turkish military forces and a coalition of Turkey-backed Syrian armed groups have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into...","Turkish military forces and a coalition of Turkey-backed Syrian armed groups have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians, during the offensive into northeast Syria, said Amnesty International today.
The organization gathered witness testimony between 12 and 16 October from 17 people including medical and rescue workers, displaced civilians, journalists, local and international humanitarian workers, as well as analyzing and verifying video footage and reviewing medical reports and other documentation.
The information gathered provides damning evidence of indiscriminate attacks in residential areas, including attacks on a home, a bakery and a school, carried out by Turkey and allied Syrian armed groups. It also reveals gruesome details of a summary killing in cold blood of a prominent Syrian-Kurdish female politician, Hevrin Khalaf, by members of Ahrar Al-Sharqiya, part of the Syrian National Army, a coalition of Syrian armed groups equipped and supported by Turkey.
“The Turkish military offensive into northeast Syria has wreaked havoc on the lives of Syrian civilians who once again have been forced to flee their homes and are living in constant fear of indiscriminate bombardment, abductions and summary killings. Turkish military forces and their allies have displayed an utterly callous disregard for civilian lives, launching unlawful deadly attacks in residential areas that have killed and injured civilians,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“Turkey is responsible for the actions of the Syrian armed groups it supports, arms and directs. So far, Turkey has given these armed groups free rein to commit serious violations in Afrin and elsewhere. We call on Turkey again to end violations, hold perpetrators accountable, and protect civilians living under their control. Turkey cannot evade responsibility by outsourcing war crimes to armed groups.”
The Kurdish-led administration’s health authority in northeast Syria said on 17 October that at least 218 civilians have been killed in Syria, including 18 children, since the offensive began.
According to the Turkish authorities, 18 civilians have died and 150 have been injured in Turkey up to 15 October, as a result of mortar attacks they attribute to Kurdish forces in Syria. If Kurdish forces are firing imprecise explosive weapons into civilian areas in Turkey this would violate international humanitarian law. They should stop such unlawful attacks immediately.
Attacks on civilians in northeast Syria
In one of the most horrific attacks documented, a Kurdish Red Crescent worker described how he pulled bodies from the wreckage of a Turkish air strike on 12 October at around 7am, in which two munitions landed near to a school in Salhiye, where civilians displaced by the fighting had sought shelter.
“Everything happened so fast. In total, there were six injured and four killed, including two children. I couldn’t tell if they were boys or girls because their corpses were black. They looked like charcoal. The other two people killed were older men, they looked older than 50. Honestly, I am still in shock,” he said, adding that the nearest frontline was more than 1km away and that there no fighters or military objectives in the vicinity at the time of the attack.
Another Kurdish Red Crescent worker described to Amnesty International his attempts to rescue an 11-year-old boy and an eight-year-old girl who were injured when mortars landed as they played outside their home near al-Salah mosque in Qamishli. He said that Qamishli had come under heavy indiscriminate attack since 10 October and residential homes, a bakery and restaurant had been struck.
“The boy was injured in his chest. The injury was horrible. He had an open wound… and he couldn’t breathe. It looked like a [piece of] shrapnel ripped his chest open,” the Kurdish Red Crescent worker said.
The boy later died of his wounds. His sister was also struck by shrapnel in the attack and doctors were forced to amputate part of her leg below the knee. The rescue worker said there were no military bases or checkpoints anywhere in the vicinity.
In a separate incident on 13 October, according to independent international monitors, a Turkish air strike on a market struck a civilian convoy that included several journalists travelling between Qamishli and Ras al-Ain. According the Kurdish Red Crescent six civilians, including one journalist, were killed in the incident and 59 people were injured. A journalist who was present on the scene and witnessed the attack described it as “an absolute massacre”. He said the convoy was made up of around 400 civilian vehicles and that there were no fighters present, only a handful of armed guards protecting the convoy.
“All parties to the conflict must respect international humanitarian law, which requires that all feasible precautions are taken to avoid, or at least, minimize civilian harm. Striking a civilian convoy is inexcusable,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“There is also no justification for indiscriminately shelling civilian areas using imprecise weapons such as mortars. Such unlawful attacks must be investigated and those responsible held to account.”
The USA is the largest exporter of weapons to Turkey. Other suppliers include Italy, Germany, Brazil and India. Amnesty International is calling on states to immediately suspend arms transfers to Turkey and other parties to the conflict in Syria, including Kurdish forces, against whom there are credible allegations of serious violations of international law, of weapons that could be used to commit or facilitate human rights violations.
Summary killings and abduction
Amnesty International also corroborated witness testimony, verified video footage and reviewed a medical report to shed light on how Hevrin Khalaf, a Kurdish female politician and Secretary General of the Future Syria political party, was ambushed on 12 October on the international highway linking Raqqa to Qamishli. She was dragged out of her car, beaten and shot dead in cold blood by fighters from Ahrar al-Sharqiya. They also summarily killed her bodyguard.
On the same day and location Ahrar al-Sharqiya fighters also captured and then killed at least two Kurdish fighters. They also abducted  two civilian men, both of whom work with a local medical organization and were transporting medicine at the time they were captured. Family members confirmed to Amnesty International that their whereabouts remained unknown. Amnesty International verified the time and date of the videos showing that the summary killings and abduction of the two civilians carried out on the afternoon on 12 October.
Hervin Khalaf’s close friend told Amnesty International that when she tried to call Hevrin’s phone, a man who identified himself as a Syrian armed opposition fighter answered. In Arabic, he told her: “You Kurds are traitors, all of you in the [PKK] party are operatives” and informed her that Hevrin had been killed.
A medical report seen by Amnesty International lists a series of injuries inflicted on Hevrin Khalaf, including multiple gunshot wounds to the head, face and back as well as fractures to her legs, face and skull, detachment of skin from her skull and loss of hair as a result of being dragged by the hair.
“Killing defenseless people in cold blood is utterly reprehensible and a blatant war crime. Ahrar’s al-Sharqiya’s murder of Hevrin Khalaf and others must be independently investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. Turkey has a responsibility to stop war crimes and violations committed by forces under its control. Unless Turkey reins in its proxy forces and ends impunity for violations, it will encourage further atrocities,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Deteriorating humanitarian situation
Local and international aid workers told Amnesty International that the US withdrawal from northeast Syria, Turkey’s military offensive and the Syrian government joining the fray was a combination of worst-case scenarios happening all at once.
There are real fears about whether the 100,000 displaced are getting enough food, clean water and medical supplies – and how those in need will continue to receive assistance in the longer term. In camps for the internally displaced, such as al-Hol, the population is entirely dependent on humanitarian aid. A group of 14 international humanitarian organizations warned on 10 October that the offensive could lead to cutting off aid to the population, while the ICRC warned a few days later that hostilities could lead to the displacement of 300,000 people, with serious concerns about water shortages.
Many of those displaced have nowhere to go and are sleeping out in the open, in gardens and in the streets. Some have sought shelter in schools. 
In the town of Derbassiya, around 90% of the population are people who were displaced from their homes and moved there. One man in Derbassiya, who fled with his family, told Amnesty International that around half were staying with relatives in the south and the rest had sought shelter in schools and mosques.
“There are no humanitarian organizations in south Derbassiye. We didn’t see anything from them. We need basic supplies like water, food, clothes, blankets and mattresses. We need a medical clinic… Winter is on its way. We need a solution especially for the families who are living outside in the open,” he said.
A humanitarian aid worker told Amnesty International: “People already suffering from chronic diseases will be at huge risk. Their survival will depend on how long this fighting lasts, and whether we are able to operate going forward.”
Many expressed serious concerns that the security situation would lead to further evacuation of international staff and that the advance of Syrian government forces could pose risks to local Arab and Kurdish staff, as well as to displaced civilians who fled other parts of Syria. There are also fears that the ability of aid agencies to carry out crucial cross-border operations to deliver aid would be limited.
“All parties to the conflict including Turkey, armed groups allied to Turkey, as well as Syrian government and Kurdish forces must provide unfettered access to local and international humanitarian organizations.”
“Turkey’s continued military offensive has driven thousands of already displaced people from what had been places of safe shelter. Turkey’s actions risk hampering the delivery of life-saving assistance and medical aid to those in need, causing a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe in a country already ravaged by war,” said Kumi Naidoo.

“The international community must be clear that the human rights crisis in Nicaragua since April 2018, caused by the government of Daniel Ortega, is ongoing and that the authorities have shown no desire to ensure the population can exercise their rights. As a result of this strategy of repression, tens of thousands of people are living in exile, including human rights defenders and journalists,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“With this campaign, we are urging the Nicaraguan government to stop the repression, to immediately and unconditionally release those held solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and to ensure that courageous defenders and journalists can work in a safe and conducive environment, without fear of reprisals. We will continue to raise our voice for the Nicaraguan people.”
The campaign will include petitions, events and the sharing of information and audiovisual materials containing the testimonies of people who have fled the country in the wake of the crisis, in order to highlight the human rights violations that continue to take place in Nicaragua. It will also include actions on Nicaraguan human rights defenders and journalists, such as Francisca Ramírez, Lucía Pineda Ubau and Vilma Núñez, in the framework of Amnesty International’s global campaign, “Brave”.
International human rights organizations report that more than 80,000 people have been forced to leave Nicaragua because of the current crisis. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has stated that more than 68,000 people have sought protection in Costa Rica. According to the UNHCR, Costa Rica, Panama, the USA, Spain and Mexico were the countries that received the highest number of asylum applications from people from Nicaragua in 2018.
The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has reported that more than 100 journalists and media workers have had to leave the country.
Francisca Ramírez, a campesino leader and renowned Nicaraguan human rights defender, fled to Costa Rica more than a year ago after receiving serious threats. Lucía Pineda Ubau, a journalist with the media outlet 100% Noticias, left Costa Rica immediately following her release from prison in June, after almost six months in arbitrary detention. In addition, the authorities have revoked the registration of the Nicaraguan Centre for Human Rights (CENIDH), which was coordinated by Vilma Núñez; the organization’s goods and assets were seized in December and have yet to be returned. Harassment of the organization has resulted in some of its members having to flee the country.

“This judgment is a bitter blow to the LGBTI communities in Hong Kong, who cannot acquire the same status and recognition, and access the same rights, as opposite-sex couples due to outdated laws that refuse to recognize same-sex unions. MK’s decision to challenge this discrimination in court was an opportunity for Hong Kong to break away from the injustices of the past and start shaping a more fair and equal society.
“Sadly, the discriminatory treatment of same-sex couples will continue for the time being. This result is deeply disappointing but will not dampen the fight for LGBTI rights in Hong Kong. We stand in solidarity with LGBTI people in Hong Kong and all those who bravely campaign for equal rights. The Hong Kong authorities must stop stigmatizing people based on who they are and immediately undertake a thorough review of all laws, policies and practices in order to end any discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status.
“This judgment must not be used as an excuse to further undermine the rights of LGBTI people. The Hong Kong government needs to step up and take all necessary measures to deliver equality and dignity for all, regardless of who people love.”
Background
“MK”, a Hong Kong woman in a same-sex relationship, filed an application for judicial review at the High Court in June 2018, claiming that the government is breaching her constitutional rights to privacy and equality. The case was heard at the end of May this year.
Currently, Hong Kong only legally recognizes “marriage” as being between a man and a woman and does not recognize same‑sex marriage or civil partnership or any other form of legal union.
The High Court in “MK” held that same-sex couples in Hong Kong had no constitutional right to marry under the territory’s Basic Law or other domestic human rights protections and that, therefore, the government also was not under an obligation to provide any alternative form of legal recognition that would essentially endow equivalent rights.
This case follows two other recent landmark decisions, QT v. Director of Immigration and Leung Chun Kwong v. Secretary for the Civil Service and Another, in which the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal held that the blanket denial of specific marriage benefits to same-sex couples legally married or in civil partnerships overseas could not be justified and amounted to sexual orientation discrimination.
Amnesty International believes that same-sex relationships need to be recognized equally and on the same basis and with the same rights as those of opposite-sex couples

Several survived being shot. And they didn’t always get the help they needed from the system.
Amnesty International’s new report, Fragmented and Unequal, shows how the justice system in Louisiana is failing survivors of domestic violence. From failing to take violence seriously, to arresting survivors who call for help, the response from the authorities is frequently inadequate and discriminatory. 
By telling their stories, these survivors are letting others know that it’s possible to overcome both the trauma of domestic violence and the injustice of the system. They are using their experiences to help others, and showing that there is a way out.
These stories are powerful, heart-breaking and inspiring.
They also include graphic descriptions of violence and sexual assault.
ANGELA’S STORY
In my case, it started as verbal abuse. I’d known my partner for 20 years and he was a good person. He started changing in 2015. After his mum died, he bought several guns including a machete and a shotgun.
He became more combative, not only with me but with others and through his social media. I couldn’t do anything right.
One evening in early November it turned physical. We were having a conversation and at some point it escalated and I asked him to leave. I walked over to the door, opened it and said we could have the conversation another day. He grabbed me by the hood of my sweatshirt, threw me out my door and got on top of me and started choking me. I managed to yell for our oldest son and he got off of me and left.
We’d broken up, but we were starting to work things out again, when one morning we had a disagreement. I was in the bathtub, when he came in and shot me. I can only remember the last two gunshots. I look up at him and he says “‘Look what you made me do Angie”, ‘You made me shoot you.’
He returned with my cell phone and I told him to dial 911. I felt as though I was dying. My legs felt prickly. I didn’t realize he’d shot me in the back and I was already paralyzed.
I can remember being loaded into the paramedics’ truck and saying to the female paramedic, “please don’t let me die, I have four children to raise.” I spent 3 weeks in hospital. During that time around 400 people came to visit me. That’s when I realized I had a message I wanted to share.
Since then, I’ve been doing a lot of public speaking – not just about gun violence and domestic violence, but about gun control and mental health. If people are willing to listen, I want to talk about the things that matter.
I survived nine gunshots, but I’ve never cried about being paralyzed. I still have pity parties, but it’s because I have to rely on others, when all I want is to be a mother again. This year, I will be partnering with the IRIS domestic violence centre, where I will be talking to people about what to do if you’re experiencing an abusive relationship.
Let’s not just point people in the right direction, let’s walk with them.
ELIZABETH’S STORY​​​​​​​
His behaviour changed rapidly. I know I should have recognized it, but when you’re inside a situation it’s hard to get perspective.
One day my daughter called me crying saying my ex had threatened to hit her in the head with a hammer. I called the police and they removed him from the house and I got a restraining order the next day.
After a month, I went to the judge and asked him to rescind the order because I couldn’t imagine this man hurting us. Then on January 13, my whole life changed.
When my ex entered the house, my daughter was awake. I heard an argument. I came into the living area to try and calm her down. Her eyes were wide with fear – she could see him approaching with a gun. When I turned around shots rang. I managed to dial 911. I couldn’t talk because [my face] was shot up, but they traced the call home. The police came, then the medical team.
I heard a policeman say, “Oh this is just a domestic violence case.” He was just five feet from where I was fighting for my life and where my child lay dead. There was nothing “just” about it.
My entire face was reconstructed because the bullets tore it apart. I was in a coma for almost a month. When I woke up, I was hit with the reality of the situation. My brother and sister refused to bury my daughter without me. I had to go to therapy to learn to use my muscles, but a lot of it they couldn’t fix. I can’t blow my nose. My lips are still numb and when I’m eating and drinking I don’t know if something is too hot until I get a blister. It’s been a struggle.
I’ve talked to women who dated my ex and they’ve mentioned he was violent with them. Had I known he’d been abusive with other women, I wouldn’t have made him a part of my life.
The first time somebody asked me to talk about what happened, it was hard. It’s hard every time. But if it changes one life, it matters to me. Domestic violence is such a personal issue and it’s a secret. We must get people to understand that they’re not in it by themselves.
I’ve met young women and men who’ve heard my story and said it changed them. It gives them the courage to reach out and ask for help.
TWAHNA’S STORY
I was a sophomore in college. I fell in love with a wonder guy, my prince charming. It was the perfect relationship – until one day I felt his hand on my face. He said, “Bitch if you had kept mouth closed, it wouldn’t have happened.”
From that moment, my life was turned upside down. I was mentally, emotionally and sexually abused. He degraded me, he talked about me being overweight, and he stripped me of all my power. I began to question my self-worth, self-confidence, and my true purpose in life. I thought of committing suicide many times. It was a way out for me.
I told no one in the beginning. I was too embarrassed and ashamed to share what I was going through – my family and friends adored him. He isolated me from my support system, those who loved and cared for me dearly. Lines of communication with family and friends were limited. He monitored my every move.
Eventually I built up enough courage and strengthen to tell a relative.  She said, “I believe you. You deserve better. What can I do to help?”
I left him and went to live with her for a while, but my abuser convinced me to return to him. He swore that he would seek counselling, an anger management program, but he never did. He said all the right things to get me back in his possession. I believed him with all my heart. I gave in to another chance. 
Change never came. One day he put his hands around my neck and began strangling me. It was like he was possessed. He said to me, “I will kill you if you every leave again”. I saw myself dying at his hands.
I went to bed that night and prayed. I heard this soft-spoken voice in my ear and I knew it was voice of God. The next morning, I woke up and the voice said to me, “today’s the day you leave”. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I told him I was leaving for work and gave him a kiss goodbye. I hid behind a building across from our apartment building and when I saw him get into his car I returned to the apartment to gather my things. I never went back!!
It was the scariest time of my life. Starting over without him was very challenging, but I pressed forward determined to live again. I got busy volunteering at a local shelter and speaking out against domestic violence in some uncomfortable spaces. 
I began dating again and decided to return to university. I had the opportunity to share my story with a gathering of young women an event remembering those who had lost their lives due to domestic violence. That night my story impacted several of the women and I realized my story could inspire me.
The Butterfly Society came to be through my personal journey. We’re a grassroots organization – boots on the ground, meeting people where they are. We go to barbershops, neighbourhood schools, and churches. We aim to educate, empower and engage the community.
There’s still so much work to be done and it’s up to us as a team to make an impact. One person can’t do this alone. It takes many hands and many voices to do this work.

KIRBY’S STORY
I met someone in high school and we started dating. I fell pregnant 3 months before graduating and moved in with him. The first time he put his hands on me was while I was pregnant. I wanted my daughter to have a father, so I stayed with him.
The violence progressed. It was sexual, physical and emotional abuse. No one knew what went on behind closed doors. He treated me like I was his property.
I got my first restraining order after he showed up at my apartment, after we separated, threw me around, choked me. I got another one four years later, but I ended up dropping it because I didn’t have anyone to represent me and I was afraid of his threats.
In June 2017 I woke up to him sexually assaulting me in my bed. I stood up for myself and told him that what he was doing was rape. He told me he would show me what it was really like to be raped. He threw me onto the bed, I swung at him and bit him hard. He got back on top of me and started strangling me. My daughter came and yelled at him to stop.
I was able to call the police. They treated me like a delusional, hysterical, uncooperative person because I didn’t want to repeat what I had already said four times in front of different men. The police report says I refused to write a statement, but I was never asked to do so. They told me I needed to decide if I wanted to press charges of breaking and entering or if I wanted them to call whoever does rape kits.
One police officer talked to my daughter, then told me my husband he was being arrested for domestic abuse and battery by strangulation based on her statement. They told me: “Just sign the paper Ma’am, I’m done handling you with kid gloves.”
I met with my counsellor and next thing, I have Child Protective Services called on me for allowing my children to see spousal abuse. I was instructed to get a Protective Order for me and the kids. At the hearing, he was granted supervised visitation and required to take 26 weeks of family violence intervention classes. He was arrested four times while he was taking the classes, but he still got his certificate.
After that he decided to file for sole custody of the kids. The closer it gets to trial, the more I fear that he will kill me and my kids and flee to another country. He used to have an AK 47 and a Glock, always loaded. I don’t know if he surrendered his guns. He’s probably just hiding them in his garage. Yet I am determined to fight him every step of the way.
A women’s abuse group was started at the Bayou church – and that’s where I broke my silence for the first time. Now I am a trained facilitator.
I co-founded VOICES of Acadiana, an organization which advocates for victims of domestic violence.
 I spoke in front of a group of 150 women and shared my story of domestic abuse. It was an incredible feeling when these women stood up and clapped for me – it made me feel as though my chains were broken.
TIFFANY’S STORY
I met my first abuser when I was 14. After I left him I met another guy. At first there wasn’t physical abuse, it was emotional. He would embarrass me or make feel inferior in front of other people. It went from verbal to physical real fast. When I was seven months pregnant, he beat me until I was on the floor, curled in a ball.
While I was in the hospital having my child, he cashed my mom’s cheque and bought drugs to sell. We were behind on rent, and the landlord took everything I owned out of the home and put it on the curb.
Finally, I made up my mind: I wasn’t going back. He managed to track me down. He showed up at my doorway, and just like that, it was on again. Mentally I was broken. He made me believe he was the only person who would ever love me.
When I was seven months pregnant with my sixth child, he pulled a gun on me. I saw a big flash of light and my jaw swayed. I saw my shirt. It was red. The doctors told me that the only reason that the shot didn’t kill me was because he had the wrong calibre bullet in the gun.
While I was sat on my doorstep, bleeding from a bullet hole in my jaw, the police came and threatened to lock me up if I did not tell them who shot me. I gave the name of my abuser, but later recanted my statement because I was scared and then I told the prosecutor that I shot myself. They dropped all the charges against him, but he ended up going to jail for three years because of a probation violation from a previous offense.
I’ve had six surgeries, and I am still living with the physical effects of the shooting as well as the trauma. I’ve been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. I shake in crowds, I’m always looking for an exit. I can’t read a book anymore because I can’t retain information, my mind is constantly scrambling. My kids suffer.
Despite everything that’s happened I am determined to raise awareness about domestic violence. I posted a video on Facebook – I was crying but I wanted to tell people what I’d been through. I didn’t realize how many people had watched it, but doors started opening. I do a lot of public speaking and have even been asked to work on a play about my story.
It’s important for women in that situation to hear from someone who understands. A lot of people might say, “You’re so stupid, you should have stayed gone.” They don’t understand the hold an abuser has on his victim.
BRANDIE’S STORY
We were married at 18, had three children and stayed together for nearly 15 years. At the time I didn’t realize that I was in an abusive marriage.
After we divorced, he always knew where I was. Once my co-worker texted me and said, ‘He is down the street just sitting in his company vehicle’. The police escorted me back to my office.
I took out a protective order against my ex. A couple of weeks later, he left the severed leg of a pig in our boys’ diaper bag with a note saying that the boys wanted it as a souvenir. He had gone hunting and cut off the leg. There was blood all over it.
Even with the protective order in place, he stalked and harassed me. I was still too scared to call the police. He barged into my house and threatened to kill himself, to kill other people. I had entered a new relationship and that made things 10 times worse. Those few years after leaving were hell. I was unaware that I could renew my protective order, so it expired.
After getting remarried and divorced twice, my ex got engaged again. His new fiancé filed for a protective order because he was abusing her, and she was scared for her life. She asked me if I would go to the hearing to testify about past abuse.
She had approached his second and third wives as well, so we came together to take a united stand. When he heard we were all there along with two other witnesses, he dropped the petition he had filed for a reciprocal protective order.
My ex had been acting aggressively towards my kids for years, and judging from the escalating violence with other women, I knew that my children needed protection. I met with the staff attorney at Faith House and we filed for sole custody. It was traumatic going through it all again, but the judge ruled in my favour and now I have sole custody of my kids, and a permanent protective order for us all.
Since then, I co-founded VOICES of Acadiana. Our mission is to advocate for victims of domestic violence by actively working towards systems change, educating and raising awareness around domestic violence and survivor outreach to break the generational cycle of abuse.
Using my voice to break the silence against domestic violence was difficult but getting my life back has been worth it!

“Hajar Raissouni’s release comes as a huge relief and is undoubtedly a cause for celebration for her and her family. But the fact remains that she and the four others involved in this case should never have been detained or convicted in the first place.
“A royal pardon does not erase the grave injustice they have suffered. Their convictions should be quashed and their records cleared.
“Hajar Raissouni’s case shows just how much work is still needed to protect women’s rights in Morocco. The Moroccan authorities must urgently decriminalise abortion and repeal all other laws that discriminate against women.”
Background:
Hajar Raissouni, a journalist for the independent Moroccan newspaper Akhbar al-Yaoum, was arrested on 31 August 2019, along with her fiancé Amin Rifaat, as they left a doctor’s office in Rabat. The doctor and two other members of medical staff were also arrested on suspicion of carrying out an abortion. On 30 September, Hajar Raissouni and Amin Rifaat were sentenced to one year in prison, and the doctor involved in the case received a two-year prison term. The two other members of medical staff received suspended prison sentences, one for one year and the other for eight months. All have been granted a royal pardon.
While in custody Hajar Raissouni wrote a letter describing how she was interrogated about her political writings, one of her media colleagues and her uncle Ahmed Raissouni, a prominent theologist and former president of the Mouvement de l’Unicité et de la Réforme (MUR), one of the largest Islamic movements in Morocco.

UP FOR DEBATE 2019
October 17, 2019
OTTAWA – A broad alliance of women’s rights and equality-seeking organizations has officially called off plans to host a national leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality, citing a lack of commitment from most federal party leaders.
In March, the alliance wrote to all party leaders, inviting them to participate in a national televised debate on women’s rights and gender equality – the first debate of its kind since 1984.
Months later, and only days away from Election Day, the only two leaders committed to debating women’s rights and gender equality issues are the NDP’s Jagmeet Singh and the Green Party’s Elizabeth May. While the Bloc Quebecois expressed interest, Up for Debate could not secure a firm commitment from the party’s leader, Yves-François Blanchet. The alliance did not receive an RSVP from Conservative leader Andrew Scheer or Liberal leader Justin Trudeau.
“It is with great regret that the Up for Debate campaign is cancelling our plans to hold a nationally televised leaders’ debate on women’s rights and gender equality issues,” said Jacqueline Hansen, Gender Rights Campaigner with Amnesty International Canada. “It’s especially disheartening because not all the leaders have outlined their commitments to address the rights of women, transgender, non-binary, and two-spirit people.”
With less than a week until Election Day, Up for Debate is now calling on all federal party leaders to clearly articulate their plans to address women’s rights and gender equality. Specifically, the campaign is asking each leader to outline their plans to end gender inequality; provide more affordable housing and child care options; protect and promote sexual and reproductive rights; and end violence against Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people.
“These are the issues directly impacting more than half Canada’s population. And these issues were simply not up for debate in this election campaign,” said Sarah Kennell, Director of Government Relations at Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights. “We may have cancelled a standalone debate, but we’re expecting the federal leaders to outline their plans to address women’s rights and gender equality issues in the last few days of the election campaign. They owe it to more than half of the voting population.”
Up for Debate 2019 is a campaign coordinated by an alliance of women’s rights and gender equality advocates from across Canada.

They had been arrested on August 31 in the capital, Rabat. On September 30, Hajar and her fiancé were sentenced to one year in prison (and the doctor to two years) after being convicted for unlawful abortion and sex outside of marriage. This was likely a politically motivated attack on Hajar for her journalistic work at newspaper Akhbar al-Yaoum. It was a blatant violation of the rights to freedom of expression and private life. 
Amnesty International issued an Urgent Action appeal on Hajar’s case. Amnesty activists wrote to the head of Morocco’s government calling for freedom for Hajar, her fiancé, and the doctor. Hajar’s case garnered the support of several human rights organizations in Morocco and abroad. The response of the international community to Amnesty’s Urgent Action helped release Hajar, and sparked a conversation around women’s rights and freedom of expression in Morocco. 
Hajar wrote that while in custody, she was interrogated about her political writings and was asked about one of her colleagues at Akhbar al-Yaoum newspaper and her uncle Ahmed Raissouni, the ex-president of one of the largest Islamic movements in Morocco. Hajar Raissouni had written about the Hirak El-Rif protest movement and had also published articles critical of Moroccan authorities. 
Hajar’s case was a stark reminder of Morocco’s laws which deny women the right to autonomy over their bodies through the criminalization of abortion and extra-marital sex. These laws have not been changed in Morocco and so arrests may continue on these grounds. Hajar’s case also highlighted the continued crackdown on freedom of expression of journalists and human rights defenders in Morocco. Moroccan authorities should take steps to ensure the protection of the fundamental right to freedom of expression. They should also decriminalize abortion and repeal all laws that discriminate against women.

The smart city project has been advertised as an easy fix to the headaches of city life by using as much data as it can. But questions have been raised about whether Toronto’s residents want to be the test subjects for this project in the first place and, importantly, what mass data collection means for human rights. 
At the end of October 2019, Waterfront Toronto, a tri-government agency, has an opportunity to stop the project. 
 #Blocksidewalk, a local grassroots organization, is calling for the project to be stopped in its current form. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association has filed a lawsuit against 3 levels of government over the project. Various individuals and organizations continue to speak out with their concerns about big data companies moving off our screens and into our streets. 
At Amnesty International, the project raises flags about mass surveillance and protecting:  
Increased data collection and mass surveillance can harm groups who are already marginalized (e.g. immigrants, refugees, BIPOC* communities, sex workers) and replicate oppressive power structures by compounding systemic issues like racism and transphobia. Surveillance can also have a chilling effect that undermines activism and political dissent, damaging social and political movements. 
Waterfront Toronto, the group that gets the final say over what happens with the project has the opportunity to terminate their controversial partnership with Google on October 31st. 
The Sidewalk Labs project won’t just have a local impact. If it goes ahead as planned it could have serious consequences, including being uncritically replicated in countries around the world. 
People whose rights will be affected should have control over whether and how new technologies are used.

In a heartfelt video posted to Twitter, Maryam is seen embracing her sons, Ramin and Mehran Seyed-Emami, at the Vancouver International Airport on October 10. It had been 582 days since they had last seen each other.
“We are grateful to the Canadian government, and specifically Foreign Minister Freeland for their unwavering support from day one. We are also thankful to Iran for allowing our mother, Maryam Mombeini, to finally leave and join us in Vancouver,” said Ramin in a statement sent to media and shared with Amnesty International.
“We have been overwhelmed with an amazing outpour of love and support from everyone. And we cannot be happier to have such an amazing network of friends and family, who’ve stood by our side through thick and thin.
“Our reunion has been very emotional. We are processing the sudden turn of events and would like to have some private family time to reconnect and resettle. We appreciate your understanding.”
The family’s nightmare began in January 2018, when Maryam’s husband and dual Canadian-Iranian national, Dr. Kavous Seyed-Emami, was arrested and interrogated in Iran on national-security grounds related to his peaceful environmental activism as the managing director of the Persian Heritage Wildlife Foundation. Two weeks later, Kavous died in custody under suspicious circumstances. There has never been an independent investigation of his death.
On March 7, almost four weeks later, Maryam Mombeini and her two sons were ready to board a plane to Canada when the Iranian authorities prevented Maryam, also a dual Canadian-Iranian citizen, from leaving the country. She ordered her sons, Ramin and Mehran, to leave without her. They have since tirelessly advocated for her safe return home. Amnesty International joined the family in that campaign.
“We are immensely relieved to learn that Maryam is safely back in Canada with her sons,” said Alex Neve, Amnesty International Canada’s Secretary General. “We extend a heartful congratulations to the family, as they begin the next chapter of their lives together.
“While we’re grateful to the Iranian authorities for granting Maryam permission to leave the country, we must remember that eight wildlife conservationists, all of whom were Kavous’ colleagues at the Persian Heritage Wildlife Foundation, remain behind bars in Iran.  They must be immediately and unconditionally freed.”
Amnesty International is calling on Iranian authorities to promptly release the conservationists, who have been wrongly accused of espionage for using cameras to track endangered species.

Those 18 arrested represented the 18,000 refugee cap set by the Trump administration – the lowest in the history of the resettlement program.
Those arrested were joined by supporters holding 95 photographs of refugees, a nod to the historic average refugee cap of 95,000 per year. The arrests came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo today meets with Members of Congress to consult over the historically low cap.
Prior to being taken into custody by Capitol Police, a number of the arrested issued the following statements:
“Today we are standing up to hostility and fear and standing with refugees to call for dignity, equality, and fairness. It’s well past the time for the President to stop abusing his power to demonize people seeking safety and for this country to welcome refugees once again. Today we are sending a strong message to the administration that the country we want to live in is one where we take care of people who need safety and we are not afraid to be silenced.” Margaret Huang, Executive Director, Amnesty International USA
“The program once had strong bipartisan support, since policymakers on both sides of the aisle understood that by resettling refugees, the United States serves as a moral leader and annually renews a promise on which our country was founded.  Resettlement also supports U.S. foreign policy interests, including the fragile regional stability in the Middle East. Supporting the countries that host refugees through investment, humanitarian aid, and resettlement is essential as globally more than 70 million people are displaced, including nearly 26 million refugees. By taking in some refugees, the U.S. can encourage other countries to keep their doors open and allow refugees to work and refugee children to attend school. That’s key to mitigating conflict, restoring dignity to those who’ve fled and ensuring a future for millions of young people.” Anne C. Richard, Former Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration (PRM)
“Risking handcuffs pales in comparison to what refugees risk every day to live simple lives in peace and freedom. As a representative of the faith community, I could not in good conscience sit idly by as Secretary Pompeo came to Capitol Hill to get a rubber stamp on his woefully inadequate and cruel proposal. Men and women across the nation have shown themselves willing to open their hearts and their communities to the world’s most vulnerable. The secretary should heed their calls for compassion, not Trump’s basest fears.” Rev. John L. McCullough, President and CEO, Church World Service
“Today’s action is a reminder to everyone that it is not okay for the U.S. to stop being a land of immigrants that welcomes refugees. As a Palestinian American who was born and raised in a refugee camp, I can say with absolute certainty that drastically cutting the U.S. refugee resettlement program by 80 percent will directly impact those seeking shelter inside our nation, diminishing their safety and our nation’s standing. At this time, Congress should be considering how to raise the refugee cap and not accepting the Trump administration’s systematic destruction of how immigrants, especially those of color, become U.S. citizens.”  Nihad Awad, National Executive Director, Council on American-Islamic Relations
“Opening our hearts and our arms to refugees from around the world is foundational to the American experiment. Ours is a nation defined not by blood and soil but by shared ideas and ideals. I am proud to stand up for one of America’s finest traditions, and I am heartbroken that this administration recklessly trashes it. It is actions like today that renew my faith that we the people will overcome the aberrant administration in power to restore our commitment to welcoming those who come to infuse the nation’s bloodstream with a profound love of freedom.” Frank Sharry, Founder and Executive Director, America’s Voice
“Now is the time to welcome refugees. Given the many ongoing and emerging displacement crises around the world, we will not stand by idly as the United States turns its back on these individuals. Our commitment to offer refuge to those fleeing violence and persecution, rooted in our faith and more than 100 years of Maryknoll mission, requires our government to demonstrate the moral leadership upon which our nation was founded. To arbitrarily restrict tens of thousands of people from seeking safety would be to forsake our nation’s values of compassion, hospitality, and welcome.” Susan Gunn, Director, Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns
“Trump’s nonstop action to dismantle the refugee program is motivated by racism, contempt, and an utter disregard for American values. I have met and worked alongside refugees in more than twenty countries and in every region of the world. The U.S.’ commitment to refugee resettlement both supported countries that hosted millions of refugees, and those refugees who remained most vulnerable. Trump’s ignorant and callous destruction of the resettlement program is shameful.” Sarnata Reynolds, Director of Policy, The Immigration Hub
Others arrested today included Sarnata Reynolds, former counsel for the House Judiciary Committee; Susannah Cunningham, Executive Director, Only Through US; Rev. Michael Puckett, Beargrass Christian Church & Board Chair, Kentucky Refugee Ministries; Rev. Seth Kapper-Dale, Reformed Church of Highland Park, NJ; and Sr. Maria Orlandini, Advocacy Director, Franciscan Action Network.
Since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States has set an average admissions goal of 95,000 refugees annually. Since the beginning of the Trump administration, refugee admissions have been severely cut, causing irreparable damage to refugee families, American communities and the infrastructure in place to welcome and support new arrivals. Across the country, hundreds of elected officials, congregations and business leaders have been showing their support for refugee resettlement. Church World Service calls on Congress to support the GRACE Act (S.1088 and H.R.2146), which would set a minimum refugee admissions goal at 95,000 and restore the resettlement program to historic norms.
Today’s protest was cosponsored by: Church World Service, Sahloul, Franciscan Action Network, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, Center for Victims of Torture, Leadership Conference of Women Religious, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, Amnesty International USA, Disciples Refugee and Immigration Ministries, American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee, Congregations Action Network, Presbyterian Church USA, United Church of Christ, Sojourners, NOVA Friends of Refugees/One Journey.

Allan Hogarth, Head of Advocacy and Programmes at Amnesty International UK, said:
“Imposing a blanket ban on Extinction Rebellion protests is an unlawful restriction on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Under UK and international human rights law, the Government has an obligation to facilitate the exercise of these rights. 
“The majority of those protesting have been doing so peacefully, removing and prosecuting activists for engaging in non-violent direct action to raise their voice is deeply worrying. Overly harsh and disproportionate charges will have a chilling effect on rights.
“This is a heavy-handed and unacceptable move by the Metropolitan Police. Certain disruption to ordinary life for protesting is natural, and it needs to be tolerated. The police must respect the rights of those peacefully protesting and ensure that the voices of those demanding action on tackling the climate crisis are allowed to be heard.”
As of Monday 7 October, Extinction Rebellion has been calling for a two-week “International Rebellion” across the world. Media and observers have reported concerns over heavy handed policing; mass arrests, including preventive arrests; use of vaguely defined criminal offences against climate activists across Europe.

Responding to Ugandan Ethics and Integrity Minister Simon Lokodo’s announcement that the government is planning to introduce the death penalty for consensual same-sex sexual acts, Amnesty International’s Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes, Joan Nyanyuki said:
“It is outrageous that instead of the Ugandan government taking urgent steps to decriminalize gay sex, they want gay people executed. This is going to fire-up more hatred in an already homophobic environment.
“This is an example of how Uganda’s politicians are stoking dangerous intolerance and bias against LGBTI people. Uganda’s MPs must resoundingly reject any plan to legalize this kind of bigotry and witch hunting of anyone who is perceived as being different.”

According to Sexual Minorities Uganda (SMUG), an LGBTI organization, he is the fourth LGBTI person to have been killed in the past three months in the wake of heightened anti-LGBTI sentiments from political leaders. Others were a transwoman from Gomba district, a gay man in Kayunga district, one from Kampala and another in Jinja
The government of Uganda has a long history of anti-LGBTI advocacy.

As part of Write for Rights, they write in solidarity to people whose basic human rights are being attacked. This year, we’ll be writing to young people, under the age of 25, who are a leading force for change in their communities, from calling out climate injustice to calling for women’s rights, from tackling homelessness to exposing police brutality. 
You might think that writing to a young person you don’t know will make no difference, or that they won’t want to hear from you. But when you’re locked up or in fear for your life for calling out injustice, having someone tell you they believe in you, matters a lot. Whoever you choose to write to, remember that they will love to hear from you. They may feel anxious and alone, and your words will bring comfort and hope to them. 
Last year, your messages to Mônica Benício in Brazil made a huge difference after her partner, Marielle Franco, was killed. Marielle was a charismatic local politician and defender of the poorest in Brazil and after she was killed, people worldwide sent over half a million messages demanding answers and justice. The messages you send demanded “Who killed Marielle Franco?” and in March 2019, two ex-police offiers were arrested for her killing. It was a first step towards justice.

The report, Fatally flawed: Why Malaysia must abolish the death penalty, reveals the use of torture and other ill-treatment to obtain “confessions”, inadequate access to legal assistance, an opaque pardons process and other serious violations of the right to a fair trial that have put people at risk of execution.
The report also highlights how 73% of those on death row – 930 people – have been sentenced to death for drug-related offences in contravention of international human rights law. Almost half are foreign nationals – including nearly nine out of ten women. More than half of them (478) are foreign nationals.
“Malaysia has a golden chance to break with decades of cruelty and injustice, disproportionately inflicted on some of the most marginalized,” said Shamini Darshni Kaliemuthu, Executive Director of Amnesty International Malaysia.
“Our research found a pattern of unfair trials and secretive hangings that itself spoke volumes. From allegations of torture and other ill-treatment to an opaque pardons process, it’s clear the death penalty is a stain on Malaysia’s criminal justice system.”
The death penalty is currently retained as the punishment for 33 offences in Malaysia and is mandatory for 12 of these. In recent years, it has mostly been used for murder and drug trafficking convictions.
A year ago, the newly-elected Malaysian government announced it would repeal the death penalty for all crimes, having already established a moratorium on executions in July 2018. But in a new parliamentary session starting this month, the government is expected to table legislation that will remove the mandatory death penalty only, and for just 11 offences – way short of full abolition.
Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to continue to observe the moratorium on executions until the death penalty is fully abolished and use the anticipated legislation to repeal the mandatory death penalty for all crimes – including drug trafficking.
Death row for the most marginalized
Of the 1,281 people reported to be on death row in Malaysia as of February 2019, 568 (44%) are foreign nationals, who face serious obstacles to access adequate consular assistance and interpretation.
Amnesty International has also found that some of Malaysia’s ethnic minorities are over-represented on death row, and data seen by the organization points to a large proportion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Amnesty International found that most people (73%) on death row were convicted of drug trafficking, almost more than half of them are foreigners. Many of them claimed they were coerced or manipulated into bringing small amounts of drugs into the country and had not used any violence. Under international law, countries that have not yet abolished the death penalty must limit its use to the “most serious crimes,” such as murder.
The cases of many women on death row show the devastating impact of Malaysia’s draconian anti-drugs law combined with the mandatory death penalty. Nearly nine out of 10 women facing the gallows are foreigners convicted of drug trafficking. In some cases, women said they were in financial trouble or were coerced into carrying the drugs. However, the mandatory death penalty means judges have no opportunity to give any consideration to these circumstances.
Unfair trials
Lawyers and relatives told Amnesty International that it was common for defendants who could not afford a lawyer to go without any legal assistance until charges were brought before a court. They also described a critically under-resourced legal aid system that left many defendants without legal assistance for long periods, often until the very start of their trial.
Suspects in death penalty cases can be detained up to 14 days, and interviewees told Amnesty International that it was common for defendants to “get beaten up” to extract “confessions”. The practice continues to this day, despite ongoing outcry from Malaysian NGOs. A UN working group’s 2011 investigation already found that “virtually all detainees” had suffered torture or other ill-treatment during their interrogations.
Despite the very high rate of foreigners sentenced to death, as well as the numerous languages spoken inside the country, Malaysian law does not provide for any interpretation services to support defendants who do not speak Malay other than in courtroom proceedings. Amnesty International heard cases of people being asked to sign documents in Malay despite not understanding the language.
Hoo Yew Wah, a Malaysian national of Chinese ethnicity, was arrested aged 20 in 2005 with methamphetamine and convicted based on a statement he made in Mandarin, his mother tongue, but which police recorded in Malay. He says the statement they made him sign is inaccurate, that police broke his finger during the interrogation, and further threatened to beat his girlfriend if he refused to sign it. He did not have the assistance of a lawyer during the period in question. Hoo Yew Wah has been on death row since 2011.
An opaque and secretive system – and a chance for change
Malaysian law does not define the pardon process in any detail, nor does it set out the criteria for a pardon or how prisoners or their families are notified of a decision.
Defendants are not guaranteed a lawyer when they apply for a pardon, and many go without. Others fail to apply for a pardon altogether, either out of despair or because they do not want to admit guilt for a crime they say they did not commit.
While some pro-bono initiatives exist, access to these services is controlled by prison officials, and there is no transparency over how access is granted or not. While the criteria used are not known, they appear to affect foreign nationals: half of them have not filed a pardon application.
“A system this secretive denies Malaysians the full picture,” said Shamini Darshni.
“Amnesty International’s research shows why this government must now honour its pledge to abolish this ultimate cruel and inhumane punishment without delay.”

Responding to the announcement that Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo said:
“This award recognizes the critical work Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government has done to initiate human rights reforms in Ethiopia after decades of widespread repression.
“Since assuming office in April 2018, it has reformed the security forces, replaced the severely restricting charities and society law, and agreed a peace deal with neighbouring Eritrea to end two decades of hostile relations. He also helped broker an agreement between Sudan’s military leaders and the civilian opposition, bringing an end to months of protests. 
“However, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s work is far from done. This award should push and motivate him to tackle the outstanding human rights challenges that threaten to reverse the gains made so far. He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses. He should also ensure that his government revises the Anti-Terrorism Proclamation which continues to be used as a tool of repression, and holds suspected perpetrators of past human rights violations to account.
“Now more than ever Prime Minister Abiy must fully espouse the principles and values of the Nobel Peace Prize to leave a lasting human rights legacy for his country, the wider region, and the world.”

Following his arrest on 29 September during the authorities’ latest crackdown, Alaa Abdel Fattah was transferred to Egypt’s notorious Tora maximum security prison 2, known as al-Aqrab 2 – where prison officers blindfolded him, stripped him of his clothing, beat and kicked him repeatedly, and subjected him to threats and verbal abuse.
One police officer told him prison was “made for people like you”, adding that he would be in prison for the rest of his life. A National Security Agency officer warned he would face further torture if he reported the abuse.
“Alaa Abdel Fattah’s torture in custody illustrates the Egyptian authorities’ use of extreme brutality to crush dissent and shows the extreme lengths that they are prepared to go to in order to intimidate perceived government critics,” said Najia Bounaim, North Africa Campaigns Director at Amnesty International.
Alaa Abdel Fattah’s lawyer, Mohammed el-Baqer, a well-known human rights defender and director of Adala Center for Rights and Freedoms, was also arrested on 29 September and has been subjected to ill-treatment at the same prison.
He is being detained in a cell with poor ventilation and was blindfolded, stripped of his clothes and verbally insulted by prison guards who also prevented him from showering for nine days and from buying clean water or food from the prison canteen.
“The abuse that the Egyptian authorities are subjecting Mohamed el-Baqer to just because he bravely defends the rights of victims of human rights violations is another illustration of Egypt’s utter disregard for human rights,” said Najia Bounaim.
“The Egyptian authorities must immediately open an independent and impartial investigation into these shocking torture allegations and urgently ensure Alaa Abdel Fattah’s and Mohamed el-Baqer’s protection.
“Both men appear to have been targeted solely based on their legitimate work defending human rights, they should not even be behind bars let alone facing torture and other ill-treatment. They should both be released immediately and the charges against him dropped. And all those responsible for this cruel injustice must be held accountable.”
The Egyptian authorities campaign of mass arrests coupled with fresh evidence of torture and other ill-treatment against peaceful activists and human rights defenders places a spotlight on Egypt’s human rights record ahead of its review at the UN Human Rights Council in November.
“The international community, and in particular Egypt’s allies, must stand up to these dangerous developments and call on president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to bring the country’s worsening human rights crisis to an end,” said Najia Bounaim.
Background:
The Egyptian authorities have launched the biggest crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s rule rounding up more than 2,800 people, including protestors, politicians, journalists and human rights lawyers.
On 9 October, Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed el-Baqer reported their torture and other ill-treatment when they appeared before prosecutors for questioning.
Both are detained in the notorious Tora Maximum security prison 2 or Aqrab 2, where dire detention conditions have pushed tens of detainees to go on hunger strikes.
Alaa Abdel Fattah has been repeatedly arrested in recent years including for his role in demonstrations during 2011 uprising. He served an unjust five-year prison sentence for participating in a peaceful protest in 2013.
He was released from prison in March 2019 under arbitrary probation conditions requiring him to spend 12 hours every night at a police station for five years. Despite the fact he did not participate in the latest outbreak of protests because he was detained in the police station at the time, he was arrested and detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal organization.

Thank you to the over 30,000 of you who took action and emailed the Myanmar authorities. We know building international pressure on cases like these makes a real impact. 
In October 2005 Aung Ko Htwe was kidnapped by the Myanmar military at the main railway station in Yangon – the country’s largest city – and forced to serve in the army. He was only 13 years old at the time. 
In 2017 he spoke out about what he experienced in a radio interview with Radio Free Asia, shortly after which he was arrested and charged under Section 505(b) of Myanmar’s Penal code – a vague law which severely restricts freedom of expression. 
He was sentenced to the maximum two years in jail. 
Section 505(b) can be used to prosecute anyone who makes, publishes or circulates information which may cause “fear or alarm to the public or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity”.  
The law is so vague that it has frequently been used by the Myanmar authorities to wildly restrict freedom of expression. 
As well as his sentence under Section 505(b), Aung Ko Htwe was given an extra six months for criticising the judge in his case. He decided not to appeal, saying he had no faith that a fair decision would be made. 
 
Aung Ko Htwe manhandled by police 
Myanmar has a long history of recruiting child soldiers into its armed forces.  
The country signed a Joint Action Plan with the UN in 2012 to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Hundreds of children have been released from the military since and recruitment appears to have dropped. 
However, we continue to hear reports of child soldier recruitment in some parts of the country. 
It is clear from Aung Ko Htwe’s case that the Myanmar authorities want to keep this issue quiet.  
A number of Myanmar laws, including Section 505(b), restrict the right to freedom of expression. They have been used to jail people just for speaking out against the government. 
Activists and human rights defenders are at risk of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment as long as these laws remain in place.

With gender issues largely absent from last night’s federal leaders’ debate, a new video ad is urging all candidates to finally speak up on women’s rights and gender equality.
Up for Debate, a national alliance of women’s rights and gender equality advocates, posted the short ad online Monday night, just as the six federal party leaders took to the stage for the English debate.
The alliance has also invited the Liberal, Conservative, New Democratic, Bloc and Green parties to participate in a separate televised debate on women’s rights and gender equality. NDP leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party leader Elizabeth May have committed to participate. Up for Debate has not yet received a firm commitment from the Bloc Quebecois, the Conservatives or the Liberals.
“It’s been 35 years since federal party leaders debated women’s rights and gender equality,” states the ad, referring to the 1984 federal leaders’ debate on women’s issues.
“We are done waiting. If all party leaders won’t commit to a debate, we will demand answers.”
In the ad, the alliance is asking each leader to state how they will: 
End gender inequality in Canada
Provide affordable housing and child care options
Protect and promote sexual and reproductive rights
End violence against Indigenous women, girls and TwoSpirit people 
“If elected as the next prime minister,” states the ad, “how will you support women’s rights and gender equality?”

Dear Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Scheer, Mr. Singh, M. Blanchet, Ms. May and Mr. Bernier,
RE: Seeking commitment to establish public inquiry into case of Hassan Diab
We are writing to seek your party’s public commitment to support the establishment of a public inquiry into the case of Dr. Hassan Diab. 
Amnesty International and the BC Civil Liberties Association (“BCCLA”) consider the outcome of Murray Segal’s external review of the Government of Canada’s handling of Dr. Diab’s case (“Segal Review”) to be deeply unsatisfactory. Unfortunately, due to the inadequate mechanism chosen and the limited terms of reference set, this was the anticipated result. At the time the Minister of Justice announced their decision to establish a review, we voiced our concerns that this would be insufficient to adequately examine how the extradition scheme contributed to the unjust treatment of Dr. Diab; we strongly advocated for the establishment of a public inquiry.
Consequently, Amnesty International and the BCCLA reiterate their support for the call made by Dr. Diab himself for a full and public inquiry into all events leading up to his extradition from Canada, his detention without charge in France for over three years, and related matters since his return to Canada. At this time we seek your commitment to support the establishment of a public inquiry that inter alia would be empowered to: 
determine the extent and nature of the human rights violations Dr. Diab experienced;
explore fully how the application of existing extraditions laws, policies and guidelines facilitated an extradition that resulted in those serious human rights violations;
examine the failure of Department of Justice officials to ensure that key exculpatory evidence was disclosed to the court, to Dr. Diab and his counsel;
assess the action taken by Canadian politicians, consular personnel and other government officials to intervene with French officials as it became clear his treatment in France was in contravention of international human rights norms;
consider appropriate redress, including compensation and an official apology, for Dr. Diab and his family; and
make recommendations as to consequential reforms needed to Canada’ Extradition Act, consular guidelines and any other relevant laws or policies. 
As mandated, Mr. Segal’s report focuses on respect for and compliance with existing laws, policies and guidelines. It does not probe the fundamental injustice and human rights violations suffered by Dr. Diab. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had stated that “what happened to [Dr. Diab] never should have happened,” and that we must “make sure this never happens again.”[1] Yet the outcome of the review takes us no closer to ensuring that the Prime Minister’s call to action is fulfilled. Mr. Segal stresses that he was not tasked with “evaluat[ing] or mak[ing] recommendations about the careful balancing of the broader purposes of extradition with individual rights and interests,”[2] but simply with evaluating whether the current law was followed in Dr. Diab’s case. Clearly, such a limited mandate was insufficient in addressing what needs to change in our extradition system to avoid repetition of this miscarriage of justice.
We would expect that you are not reassured by or content with a review which concludes that the “law was applied faithfully and nevertheless produced a troubling result.”[3] . The Segal Review simply cannot be taken to be the end of the story for Dr. Diab, nor can it be the end of the road for a meaningful review of Canada’s extradition framework.
Amnesty International and the BCCLA are of the view that the disappointing and incomplete outcome of the external review compels our next government to take steps to ensure that the Extradition Act, as well as related policies and guidelines, are thoroughly reassessed. Evidently, it was the faithful application of this legal framework that led to the serious human rights violations suffered by Dr. Diab, including more than three years of detention without charge or trial and lengthy periods of solitary confinement.
While the Segal Review makes some recommendations for the government to consider, they fall far short of any concrete changes which would meaningfully safeguard against repetition of the human rights violations faced by Dr. Diab. Moreover, the government has not yet released its response to the report nor specified its intention to implement these recommendations.
Moving forward, the next federal government has a duty to revisit the questions and serious issues that were raised from this case, by Dr. Diab, his counsel, concerned individuals, and civil society organizations. There are many crucial preoccupations that remain unexamined and unresolved, including: 
The nature and toll of the human rights violations Dr. Diab and his family endured bear much closer attention. Dr. Diab endured over five years of severe bail conditions in Canada, more than three years of imprisonment in a foreign country away from his family, lengthy solitary confinement (far in excess of the maximum length recognized by UN experts to constitute torture or ill-treatment), a tarnished reputation, serious financial hardship, deterioration in both his physical and mental health, and he missed more than three years of his children’s lives, including the birth of his son.  There must be full consideration of appropriate redress to which Dr. Diab and his family are entitled.
Mr. Segal’s terms of reference did not include the fundamental task of evaluating how and why Dr. Diab’s human rights were violated in this shocking manner throughout the extradition process. Not only was Dr. Diab’s liberty unduly restrained while he was subjected to onerous bail conditions in Canada, his treatment in France, including his more than 3-year detention without facing charges or being brought to trial, was in contravention of international human rights standards.
Further attention must be given to the deficiencies in the consular and diplomatic action that was taken, including the reluctance to monitor the trial process in France to ensure its fairness and transparency, and the lack of follow-up or due diligence from Canadian officials with regards to Dr. Diab’s prolonged detention in solitary confinement.
Canada must ensure that, in keeping with the aims of its extradition laws, it does not extradite a Canadian citizen for purely investigative purposes, or to a jurisdiction which is manifestly unready to proceed to trial.
The Canadian extradition system must be reformed in order to guard against reliance on evidence that is unsound and discredited, and to avoid proceeding on cases which are wholly unsubstantiated or built on intelligence information possibly derived from torture.
Potentially exculpatory evidence should never be withheld from the individual facing committal to extradition. 
Canada is a nation that prides itself on a tradition of deep respect for the rule of law and fundamental human rights. When the liberty interests of our citizens, and others present on our territory, risk being compromised by an extradition process that can so easily be stripped of minimal guarantors of justice or fairness, this should be a clarion call for government action.
Ultimately, we look to your party to commit to establishing a full and independent, judge-led public inquiry that addresses the injustices that occurred in this case and the flaws in our extradition system. This public enquiry would ensure full transparency and accountability and bring about concrete recommendations for legal and policy reform. Such an inquiry must ensure Dr. Diab’s full involvement and allow for relevant stakeholders to provide their input on Canada’s extradition system. Crucially, justice dictates that the inquiry be specifically tasked with determining appropriate redress for Dr. Diab and his family, including an official apology and fair compensation for Canada’s part in the human rights violations he suffered.
We look forward to hearing from you on this important human rights matter.
Sincerely,

The law also grants the Hong Kong government sweeping powers relating to detention and to restriction of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.  
Joshua Rosenzweig, Head of Amnesty International’s East Asia Regional Office, said: 
“This is yet another attempt by the Hong Kong government to deter protesters, who have so far been undaunted by unnecessary and excessive use of force and the threat of prosecution, from exercising their rights.
“It is thanks to the climate of fear Hong Kong authorities have created that protesters feel the need to wear masks in the first place. This ban is especially worrying in a context where protesters fear arbitrary arrest, surveillance and the indiscriminate use of tear gas and other projectiles.  
During protests on 1 October a young man was shot in the chest by police and over 1,400 rounds of tear gas and approximately 900 rounds of rubber bullets were fired. Since then protesters have continued to gather daily across Hong Kong.
“Rather than deescalating the situation, Hong Kong’s authorities have chosen to grant themselves sweeping new powers to quash protests, demonstrating the extent of their growing intolerance for freedom of peaceful assembly,” said Joshua Rosenzweig.
“The Hong Kong authorities should not use emergency rules as a smokescreen for further tightening restrictions on protesters. We reiterate our call for the Hong Kong authorities to respect protesters’ rights to peacefully express their opinions and to refrain from using excessive and blanket powers to silence them.” 
The new law, which comes into effect on 5 October, will ban protesters from covering their faces in full or partially during protests. There will be an exemption for those who cover their faces owing to illness or for religious reasons. Violation of the law will be punishable with up to one year in prison.

A witness hearing examining Shell’s role in the execution of nine men in Nigeria in the 1990s is a key opportunity to hold the oil giant to account over its alleged complicity in human rights abuses, Amnesty International said.
The Kiobel v Shell case resumes at The Hague on 8 October and will for the first time hear accounts from individuals who accuse Shell of offering them bribes to give fake testimonies that led to the ‘Ogoni Nine’ – who included Esther Kiobel’s husband – being sentenced to death and executed.   
“For more than twenty years Shell has escaped scrutiny over its role in these tragic events. We applaud the courage and persistence of Esther Kiobel and the other women who have brought this case,” said Mark Dummett, Business and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International.
“This case exemplifies how hard it can be for the victims of human rights abuses to hold a powerful multinational corporation to account.”
Esther Kiobel and three other women – Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula – accuse Shell of being complicit in the unlawful arrest, detention and execution of their husbands. The men were hanged in 1995 along with renowned activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and four other men after they were convicted in a blatantly unfair trial.
The ‘Ogoni Nine’, as they were known, were accused of being involved in the murder of four Ogoni chiefs known to be opponents of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP). Led by Ken Saro-Wiwa, MOSOP had protested against oil pollution caused by Shell’s operations in the Ogoniland region.
“These four Nigerian widows represent the cause of the Ogoni Nine, as well as countless residents of the Niger Delta who feel that their rights have been trampled on by Shell,” said Mark Dummett.
Amnesty supported Esther Kiobel’s legal team to bring the case to the Netherlands in 2017, and detailed Shell’s role in the arrests and executions in a briefing, In The Dock. 
At the case’s first hearing in February 2019, Esther Kiobel and Victoria Bera were both allowed to speak to the court and gave moving testimonies regarding their late husbands and subsequent struggles for justice. It was the first time either had had such an opportunity.
On 1 May, the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, that it did have jurisdiction of the case and that this should not be time barred. It also ruled that Shell should hand over some confidential internal documents to the plaintiffs’ lawyers.
The court, however, did not order Shell to release other confidential internal documents, which were requested by Esther Kiobel’s legal team.  It also dismissed some of the other important allegations made by the plaintiffs, relating to Shell’s close ties with the Nigerian government and the extent to which the company supported a crackdown by the military against the Ogoni people in the 1990s. This resulted in a large but unknown number of people being killed, detained, raped and tortured.
Shell disputes all allegations and argued that the court should also dismiss the claim on jurisdictional grounds and because the events took place so long ago.

Timeline of the case:
2002: Esther Kiobel first sued Shell in the USA, where she had been granted asylum.
2013: US Supreme Court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over the case, meaning US courts never got to examine the facts of the case.
2017: Esther Kiobel filed a new civil case against Shell in The Netherlands, Shell’s home state, together with Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula.
February 2019: The District Court of The Hague heard the first arguments in Esther’s case against Shell. This was also the first time Esther Kiobel and Victoria Bera were allowed to speak to the court. Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula, who still live in Nigeria, were refused visas to travel to Europe.
May 2019: Court ruled that the case was not time-barred and that the court did have jurisdiction over the case. It ordered that the plaintiffs’ lawyers hear witnesses and provide further evidence as to whether Shell bribed people to testify against the Ogoni Nine. The court also ruled that Shell hand over some internal documents concerning communication within Shell about the trial of the Ogoni Nine. However, it did not order the release of other confidential internal documents requested by the plaintiffs’ legal team.
October 2019: For the first time the Court will hear witnesses.

This improves his detention conditions considerably, but Amnesty International will continue to campaign for a final ruling on his case. Jorge expressed how solidarity letters have had an enormous positive impact on his mental health, and how grateful he feels to Amnesty and each and every person who has written to him so far. 
Jorge has been illegally held in pre-trial detention for 12 years. Argentina’s law sets a temporary limit for pre-trial detention at two years. There is strong evidence that Jorge is innocent. The police officers who arrested him were later convicted of organizing a cover-up, giving false testimony and attempted extortion. 
Jorge, a taxi driver, was going home after work in July 2006 when suddenly police arrested him and beat him. They accused him of robbing a bank and of killing someone in the bank. But Jorge was not involved in those crimes. The police had forced someone at the crime scene to say that Jorge had done it. There is recent evidence from the Innocence Project Foundation to prove that Jorge is innocent. 
In 2010, a court sentenced Jorge to 25 years in prison. His lawyer asked Argentina’s Supreme Court to review the case because he thought the sentence was not fair. No progress in the case was made until this year.
