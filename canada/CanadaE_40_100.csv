The designation, made pursuant to a 2016 Israeli statute, effectively outlaws the activities of these civil society groups. It authorizes Israeli authorities to close their offices, seize their assets and arrest and jail their staff members, and it prohibits funding or even publicly expressing support for their activities. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, who work closely with many of these groups, said in a joint statement: 
“This appalling and unjust decision is an attack by the Israeli government on the international human rights movement. For decades, Israeli authorities have systematically sought to muzzle human rights monitoring and punish those who criticize its repressive rule over Palestinians. While staff members of our organizations have faced deportation and travel bans, Palestinian human rights defenders have always borne the brunt of the repression. This decision is an alarming escalation that threatens to shut down the work of Palestine’s most prominent civil society organizations. The decades-long failure of the international community to challenge grave Israeli human rights abuses and impose meaningful consequences for them has emboldened Israeli authorities to act in this brazen manner. 
How the international community responds will be a true test of its resolve to protect human rights defenders. We are proud to work with our Palestinian partners and have been doing so for decades. They represent the best of global civil society. We stand with them in challenging this outrageous decision.”

Most people would probably be shocked to learn that every year, Canada locks up hundreds of migrants and refugee claimants in maximum-security jails. Even more shocking is that Canada jails these newcomers under immigration law – without a trial or even a charge – minus any of the due process that those accused of crimes receive. There are no time limits: detention can occur indefinitely. 
Canadian law allows authorities to detain newcomers on immigration-related grounds – for example, if they are unsure as to the person’s identity, or if they believe the person is inadmissible, poses a danger, or is unlikely to appear for immigration proceedings – in facilities designed for criminal punishment. For decades, this has occurred in overcrowded facilities, where immigration detainees are co-mingled with prison populations, receive inadequate health care and have little to no contact with the outside world. Racialized people and those with mental-health conditions are habitually incarcerated for longer periods of time and endure harsher conditions of confinement when compared with other detainees. Many languish in lockdowns and solitary confinement, with no end in sight. All are routinely dismissed, degraded and demeaned, as chronicled by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in a recent report. 
The problems of immigration detention have received intense critical scrutiny for years – detainees have launched protests and hunger strikes, advocates have launched law reform campaigns, and lawyers have launched lawsuits. In 2016, after a series of deaths in detention, the federal government declared that it “can and must do better” and launched the National Immigration Detention Framework, a five-year, $138-million undertaking designed to create a “better, fairer immigration detention system that supports the humane and dignified treatment” of detainees. Despite this initiative now coming to a close, not enough has changed. 
In fact, one of the most egregious, most inhumane practices of immigration detention – holding migrants and refugee claimants in correctional facilities – has only intensified. Between April and September, 2020, for example, while the number of immigration detainees decreased, the portion of detainees held in provincial jails jumped from roughly 20 to 50 per cent. In the same period, the average length of detention also increased significantly – more than doubling when compared with before the pandemic. This means that authorities now rely as heavily on jails as on immigration holding centres to house immigration detainees. 
Studies confirm that immigration detention causes serious harm: anxiety, depression, despair, psychological distress, psychosis, catatonic withdrawal, self-harm and suicidal ideation. The mental-health impacts of detention are so severe that even a short stint can be devastating to the mind and cause long-term – and sometimes permanent – damage. Detainees experience these harms no matter where they are held, but the research has long confirmed that detainees are affected most acutely when they are held in jails. 
How can a country like Canada, one that prides itself on its commitment to human rights and refugee protection, continue to engage in such violations? One explanation is that year after year, each of the entities involved in immigration detention has passed the buck to another. The federal government has passed the buck to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which is tasked with enforcing immigration detention. The CBSA, in turn, has passed the buck to the provinces, by entering into memoranda of understanding or informal arrangements with the provinces that authorize immigration detention in provincial jails. As a result of these agreements, the CBSA maintains, it has “limited control over detention conditions” in provincial jails, and is unable to intervene in their operations. 
But what about the provinces? In a new campaign, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have turned the spotlight on their role. The groups are calling on provincial premiers and corrections ministers to cancel all existing arrangements with the CBSA that authorize detaining migrants and refugee claimants in jails. The groups make clear that by maintaining these agreements, the provinces are complicit in continuing human-rights violations. 
And they are right. Five years after launching its reform initiative, and despite the promise to “do better,” the federal government has allowed the most pernicious and violent aspects of immigration detention to thrive. But the success of some recent reforms show that change is possible. It is time for authorities to stop abdicating responsibility. The provinces can and must take the lead and end the devastating practice of detaining migrants and refugee claimants in jails once and for all.

0,Afghanistan: Few routes to safety for Afghans at risk of Taliban reprisals,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/afghanistan-few-routes-to-safety-for-afghans-at-risk-of-taliban-reprisals/,"Nearly two months since airlift operations in Afghanistan ended, those left behind face formidable obstacles to seeking safety outside the country, Amnesty International said today.

In an advocacy briefing, the organization highlights how neighbouring countries have closed their borders to Afghans without travel documents, leaving many with no choice but to make irregular crossings. Instead of granting protection to people who arrive on their territory in this way – as required by international law – countries across Europe and Central Asia have subjected Afghans to illegal pushbacks, detention and deportation.   
Download the briefing 
Amnesty International is calling on all countries to live up to their obligation to protect people at risk of serious human rights violations, by immediately ending all returns or deportations to Afghanistan and ensuring access to fair asylum procedures. They should also urgently take steps to secure safe passage for Afghans who are in danger of being targeted by the Taliban, including by minimizing requirements for travel documentation and offering humanitarian visas to those most at risk.  
“Trying to get out of Afghanistan right now is like an obstacle course. Since the Taliban takeover it has been near-impossible to obtain travel documents, forcing many Afghans to make irregular journeys which result in punitive treatment by other governments. Instead of finding safety and protection, Afghans who fled the Taliban end up trapped in makeshift camps at border zones, or detained while they await deportation to an uncertain fate,” said Francesca Pizzutelli, Head of Amnesty International’s Refugees and Migrants’ Rights Team.  
“We urge all countries to open their borders to Afghans seeking refuge, and to establish targeted resettlement schemes to bring the most at-risk to safety. Governments must offer international protection to new arrivals and to Afghans who are already on their territories, mindful of the international prohibition on non-refoulement.”  
Borders closed  
Amnesty’s briefing highlights how Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have all closed their borders to Afghans travelling without documents, despite the risk that returning people will put them at risk of serious human rights violations by the Taliban. IOM figures show that Iranian authorities deported 58,279 undocumented Afghans between 27 August and 9 September 2021, while Uzbekistan said on August 20 that it had returned 150 people to Afghanistan, based on an agreement with the Taliban.   
The international imperative to keep borders open for those seeking refuge, and the obligation on non-refoulement, does not just apply to countries which share a land border with Afghanistan. It also applies to countries that Afghans can reach via air or sea, or after journeys through other countries. In other words, it disregards any distinction between regular and irregular arrivals.   
Despite this, countries including Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece have continued to carry out pushbacks against Afghans, while Poland has introduced new restrictions which will make it impossible for people crossing the border irregularly to claim asylum in Poland.  
One group of 32 Afghans has been stranded on the Poland-Belarus border since 19 August, after they were moved from Poland to Belarus in a suspected pushback, without any individual assessment of their protection needs. Polish and Belarusian border guards have kept the group trapped in a small strip on the border, without adequate shelter, clean water, food or access to health care.  
Meanwhile, in July 2021, as arrivals from Afghanistan increased, Turkish authorities announced the extension of a wall with its border with Iran, and Turkey continues to round up undocumented Afghans in preparation for deportation.   
Amnesty also highlighted the impact of security clearance processes on Afghans seeking refuge. For example, Germany requires Afghans to present themselves to German authorities for security checks before they can be considered for evacuation – but there is currently no diplomatic representation in Afghanistan. In the US, the Biden administration has stated the intention to resettle 95,000 Afghan evacuees by the end of September 2022. However, questions remain about the treatment of Afghan evacuees in US military bases, and the detention and transfer to third countries of Afghan evacuees who have not cleared stringent US security checks.  
While Afghanistan’s human rights situation continues to deteriorate, all countries must take immediate measures to enable exit from Afghanistan, in particular for women activists, human rights defenders, journalists, and people from marginalized ethnic or religious minorities. They must offer international protection both to new arrivals and to those Afghans who are already on their territories, and support countries in the region to guarantee the rights of Afghans who travel there.  
“The lives of thousands of women and men who had worked to promote and defend human rights, gender equality, rule of law and democratic freedoms in their country are now hanging by a thread,” said Francesca Pizzutelli.  
“The world must not abandon Afghanistan at this critical moment – we need a concerted international effort to bring Afghans to safety.”

0,Nigeria: No justice for victims of police brutality one year after #EndSARS Protests,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/nigeria-no-justice-for-victims-of-police-brutality-one-year-after-endsars-protests/,"Despite promises of reform police impunity goes on  Investigation panels dashing victims’ hope of getting justice  Pro-government mobs used to instigate violence  One year after peaceful #EndSARS protests ended in a brutal crackdown by Nigerian security forces in Abuja, Lagos and...","One year after peaceful #EndSARS protests ended in a brutal crackdown by Nigerian security forces in Abuja, Lagos and other parts of the country, no one has been brought to justice for the torture, violence, and killings of peaceful protesters, while reports of human rights violations by the police continue, Amnesty International said today.  
An investigation by the organization found that Nigerian army and police killed at least 12 people on 20 October 2020 at Lekki toll gate and Alausa in Lagos. Amnesty International was able to establish that pro-government supporters instigated violence at many of the demonstrations, providing cover for the police to use lethal force against peaceful protesters. The organization also found that detained protesters were tortured and refused or denied immediate access to lawyers.   
A year on, despite the gravity of these human rights violations, not a single member of the security forces has been prosecuted while judicial panels of inquiry set up to investigate abuses by officers have made little progress.  
“President Muhammadu Buhari must fulfill his promise of reforming the police to end the reign of impunity Nigerians have been protesting against for many years. Failure to bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for the torture and killings of #EndSARS protesters on 20 October 2020 is yet another indication that Nigerian authorities lack the political will to ensure accountability for these atrocities, and end police brutality,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.   
“Under the pretext of restoring order, horrific injuries were inflicted on hundreds of people and at least 56 people were killed, among them dozens of young people lost their lives as Nigerian security forces used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse peaceful protesters across the country. It is unacceptable that despite overwhelming evidence, the government continues to deny the use of live ammunition on protesters at Lekki toll gate exactly a year ago.”   
Amnesty International had documented incidents at Lekki Toll Gate Lagos and other parts of Nigeria, showing the violent response of the Nigerian security forces to peaceful protests. The clear aim of the crackdown was to instill fear, discourage peaceful protests and punish those demanding an end to widespread human rights violations by the police.   
Use of pro-government supporters to whip up violence  
While most of the #EndSARS protesters were peaceful, there was violence, mostly instigated by pro-government supporters.  
After reviewing videos and photos of the protest sites, Amnesty international found that in nearly 21 incidents where violence occurred between peaceful protesters and pro-government supporters, security forces not only failed to take preventive measures to avoid peaceful assemblies from being disrupted, but they also failed to protect protesters from violent attacks.    
“In many instances, the police and other security agents watched as apparently government-backed armed thugs attacked peaceful protesters. In some cases, these thugs were brought to the protest sites in government vehicles. On at least two occasions, these attacks resulted in the death of protesters,” said Osai Ojigho.  
Excessive use of force  
Almost every person arrested during the protests described being beaten with the butt of a gun, whips and fists during their arrests. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 12 journalists were attacked during the #EndSARS protests by security forces and unidentified perpetrators.  
Many of those detained interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were tortured while in detention. In many cases, police abuse continued in detention, in police stations and other holding facilities, and on the way to detention, in police vehicles. Several such cases amount to torture and other ill-treatment.   
Delayed or no access to legal counsel  
Amnesty International also documented numerous cases in which police denied or delayed access to lawyers and medical care to detainees. This was despite repeated requests from detainees to see or call a lawyer – and repeated requests from lawyers at places of detention to have access to the detainees. Several lawyers and human right defenders said they spent days moving from one police station to another trying to find out where those who had been arrested were being held.   
One person arrested during a protest on 18 October 2020 and held at Lagos state Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Panti, said he repeatedly asked to call a lawyer. He was told by a police officer to shut up. While in detention, he was denied access to a lawyer who had come to see him and was unable to meet with a lawyer until a week after being arrested.  
Providing timely access to lawyers is an important safeguard for many human rights, such as the right to a fair trial and ensuring the detainee’s rights are respected in custody, including the right to access medical care when needed, as well as protection from coerced confessions and torture and other ill-treatment.  
Investigative panels set up to look into police brutality have so far been marred by prolonged adjournments, intimidation of witnesses by police lawyers and the failure of police officers to appear as witnesses, according to observer reports verified by Amnesty International. Panels have failed to sit in some states, and in others have gone on an indefinite break.  
“What we observed at these panels is discouraging and clearly shows there is no real commitment to ensuring justice for victims of police violence across Nigeria. These panels raised hopes of getting justice but in some states, this is quickly vanishing,” said Osai Ojigho  
Amnesty International is calling on Nigerian authorities to put words into action and decisively end police impunity. Use of pro-government thugs to violently disperse and undermine peaceful #EndSARS protests must be thoroughly, independently, impartially, and transparently investigated and suspected perpetrators brought to justice in fair trials.   
Nigerians must not be denied the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed right to peaceful protest. All those detained or missing since the #EndSARS protests must be immediately released or reunited with their families. Nigerian authorities must ensure access of victims and their families to effective remedies, including adequate compensation, restitution, and guarantee of non-repetition.   
“The #EndSARS movement was met with the same use of excessive force by the police it was set to fight against. It is time for the authorities to ensure accountability and end impunity for police violence in Nigeria,” said Osai Ojigho  
BACKGROUND  
The #EndSARS protest was a nationwide protest demanding an end to police impunity in Nigeria. On 3 October 2020, a video went viral showing SARS officers dragging two men from a hotel and shooting one of them outside. A few days later, protests erupted across Nigeria. On 11 October, SARS is disbanded. But it was the fifth time since 2015 that the Nigerian authorities pledged to reform the police and disband SARS. Protests continued demanding more than empty promises. On 20 October, the Nigerian army and police violently repressed peaceful protests and killed at least 12 people at Lekki toll gate and Alausa in Lagos.

0,Covid-19: Global attack on freedom of expression is having a dangerous impact on public health crisis,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/covid-19-global-attack-on-freedom-of-expression-is-having-a-dangerous-impact-on-public-health-crisis/,"Attacks on freedom of expression by governments, combined with a flood of misinformation across the world during the Covid-19 pandemic, have had a devastating impact on peoples’ ability to access accurate and timely information to help them cope with the burgeoning global health crisis, said...","Attacks on freedom of expression by governments, combined with a flood of misinformation across the world during the Covid-19 pandemic, have had a devastating impact on peoples’ ability to access accurate and timely information to help them cope with the burgeoning global health crisis, said Amnesty International today in a new report. 
Silenced and Misinformed: Freedom of Expression in Danger During Covid-19 reveals how governments’ and authorities’ reliance on censorship and punishment throughout the crisis has reduced the quality of information reaching people. The pandemic has provided a dangerous situation where governments are using new legislation to shut down independent reporting, as well as attack people who have been directly critical or even attempted to look into their government’s response to Covid-19. 
Read the report 
“Throughout the pandemic, governments have launched an unprecedented attack on freedom of expression, severely curtailing peoples’ rights. Communication channels have been targeted, social media has been censored, and media outlets have been closed down – having a dire impact of the public’s ability to access vital information about how to deal with Covid-19,” said Amnesty International’s senior director for research advocacy and policy, Rajat Khosla. 
“In the midst of a pandemic, journalists and health professionals have been silenced and imprisoned. As a result, people have been unable to access information about Covid-19, including how to protect themselves and their communities. Approximately five million people have lost their lives to Covid-19 and lack of information will have likely been a contributory factor.”  
The government of China has a long history of controlling freedom of expression. During the early days of the pandemic, health workers and professional and citizen journalists attempted to raise the alarm as early as December 2019. However, they were targeted by the government for reporting on the outbreak of what was then an unknown disease. By February 2020, 5,511 criminal investigations had been opened against individuals who published information about the outbreak for “fabricating and deliberately disseminating false and harmful information”. 
In one harrowing case, citizen journalist Zhang Zhan travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the Covid-19 outbreak. She went missing in May 2020 in Wuhan. It was later revealed that she was detained by police, charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. 
Numerous other countries have put in place oppressive laws, restricting the right to freedom of expression and silencing critics under the guise or in the context of the pandemic, including Tanzania, Russia and Nicaragua.  
Over the past few years, the Tanzanian government has introduced a raft of laws and used them to silence journalists, human rights defenders and members of the political opposition. Under former President Magufuli’s administration, the Tanzanian government took a denialist stance on COVID-19. From March to May 2020, authorities used laws prohibiting and criminalizing “false news” and other measures to restrict media coverage of the government’s handling of Covid-19. 
While initially trying to downplay the impact of the pandemic and intimidate those raising concerns, the Nicaraguan authorities used Covid-19 to introduce the “Special Law on Cybercrimes” in October 2020. In practice, it enables authorities to punish those who criticize government policies and gives them ample discretion to repress freedom of expression. 
In April 2020, Russia expanded its existing anti-“fake news” legislation and introduced criminal penalties for “public dissemination of knowingly false information” in the context of emergencies. Although the amendments have been described as part of the authorities’ response to Covid-19, these measures will remain in force beyond the pandemic. 
“It’s clear Covid-19 related restrictions on freedom of expression are not just time-bound, extraordinary measures to deal with a temporary crisis. They are part of an onslaught on human rights that has been taking place globally in the last few years – and governments have found another excuse to ramp up their attack on civil society,” said Rajat Khosla. 
“Restricting freedom of expression is dangerous and must not become the new normal. Governments must urgently lift such restrictions and guarantee the free flow of information to protect the public’s right to health.” 
Amnesty’s report highlights the role of social media companies in facilitating the rapid spread of misinformation around Covid-19.  This is because platforms are designed to amplify attention-grabbing content to engage users and have not done enough due diligence to prevent the spread of false and misleading information. 
The onslaught of misinformation – whether that be through social media companies or people in a position of power seeking to spread division and confusion for their own gain – is posing a serious threat to the rights to freedom of expression and to health. It is making it increasingly difficult for individuals to have a fully informed opinion and make educated choices about their health based on the best available scientific facts. A variety of sources is key, as is the ability to challenge and debate available information. 
“As we are urging governments and pharmaceutical companies to ensure vaccines are distributed and made available to everyone around the world, states and social media companies must also ensure the public has unfettered access to accurate, evidence-based and timely information. This is a crucial step to minimize vaccine hesitancy driven by misinformation,” said Rajat Khosla. 
“So far, 6.6 billion* doses have been administered globally, yet only 2.5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose.  With less than 75 days left until the end of the year, we’re calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to drastically change course and to do everything needed to deliver two billion vaccines to low and lower-middle income countries starting now – but they need safe, reliable information to help inform their decisions.” 
Amnesty International is calling on states to stop using the pandemic as an excuse to silence independent reporting, lift all undue restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and provide credible, reliable, accessible information so the public can be fully informed about the pandemic. Censorship does not help in dealing with misinformation: free and independent media and strong civil society do. 
States must overhaul the destructive business model of Big Tech – one of the root causes of the spread of mis/disinformation online. Social media companies must also stop hiding their heads in the sand and take measures to address the viral spread of misinformation, including by ensuring their business models do not endanger human rights. 
Amnesty International launched a new campaign, 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines now! on 22 September 2021. The organization is calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to deliver 2 billion vaccines to those who need it now, to ensure that the World Health Organization’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population of low and lower-middle income countries by the end of the year is met.

Nassima al-Sada, a campaigner for women’s freedom, walked free from jail in June 2021. Nassima had been arrested in 2018 for peacefully defending human rights. While imprisoned the guards beat her and banned anyone from visiting – even her lawyer. Supporters worldwide wrote a massive 777,611 letters, tweets and more. Nassima’s son, Mousa al-Sada, feels that international attention on his mother helped push her case to a verdict, after years of stagnation and aided in securing her release. Nassima is still subject to a travel ban, meaning she cannot leave Saudi Arabia for five years – Amnesty supporters will continue to fight for Nassima’s full freedom.

He was jailed before getting a chance to hold his youngest child, born just weeks after he was taken in July 2017. His family fled the country for fear of reprisals. Germain will soon be reunited with his family, after more than 400,000 actions calling for his release.

While male students nationwide were allowed to return to secondary school on 17 September, the Taliban insisted that a “safe learning environment” was required before girls could return. 
However, in more than 20 new interviews, students, teachers and school administrators told Amnesty International that intimidation and harassment by the Taliban are causing school attendance rates to remain low at all levels, particularly for girls. 
“At present, girls in Afghanistan are effectively barred from returning to secondary school. Across the country, the rights and aspirations of an entire generation of girls are dismissed and crushed,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The right to education is a fundamental human right, which the Taliban – as the de facto authorities running the country – are duty-bound to uphold. The policies currently pursued by the Taliban are discriminatory, unjust and violate international law. 
“The Taliban should immediately re-open all secondary schools to girls, put a stop to all harassment, threats and attacks against teachers and students, and cease any military use of schools in Afghanistan.” 
Amnesty International is also calling on the international community to ensure appropriate funding for Afghanistan’s education sector to enable schools to continue functioning, through organizations such as the UN or NGOs. Failure to do so could potentially deny millions of Afghan students the right to education.     
‘Education is not a crime’ 
To date – while some secondary schools have allowed girls to return, including in Kabul city and in provinces such as Kunduz, Balkh and Sar-e Pul – the vast majority of secondary schools across Afghanistan remain closed for girls. 
Asma*, a 14-year-old student in Kabul, told Amnesty International: “Will I be able to go to school or not? This is my biggest concern. I want to learn everything, from the easiest to the hardest subjects. I want to be an astronaut, or an engineer or architect… This is my dream… Education is not a crime. If the Taliban announce that getting an education is a crime, then we will commit this crime. We will not give up.” 
Mariam*, a 17-year-old student in Badakhshan, said: “When I first heard they would close high schools, I felt we were going backward instead of forward. We had so many hopes and dreams, and now they are gone. I want to study medicine and become a doctor. I was ready to take the entrance exam for university. I feel like I am paralyzed right now. I can’t think of the future.” 
Several female secondary school students said they had lost their motivation to study because the Taliban seem likely to allow them to work only in a few, specific fields, such as education or healthcare. 
Khalida*, a 16-year-old student in Kabul, said: “What will we do with an education, if we cannot fulfil our passions? I want to be a politician… I don’t want to graduate and sit at home… Girls like me, we want to be leaders… We can be anything, and they are not letting us.” 
Falling attendance rates 
Teachers, students and activists across Afghanistan told Amnesty International that primary school attendance rates have dropped significantly in many areas, particularly for girls. Many families remain fearful of the Taliban, and are too nervous to send their children to school, particularly girls. 
Zeenat*, a teacher in Samangan province, said: “There is no trust in the community… Parents think if they send their daughters to school, they could be beaten by the Taliban.” 
The severe economic situation has forced many families to take their children out of school and send them to work. Millions of Afghans have been internally displaced during and following the Taliban’s takeover of the country, and many displaced children are not attending school. 
Interviewees also said there are widespread absences among teachers, largely due to the Taliban’s failure to pay their salaries. This has led many primary schools either to run at reduced capacity, or to close entirely. 
At the tertiary level, students reported that while some universities have re-opened, attendance rates have dropped, particularly for young women. 
Wadan*, a 21-year-old medical student in Kabul, said: “There were 20 girls in my class [before the Taliban’s takeover]. Now there are just six girls… The Taliban introduced new rules… No-one knows what will happen in the next few hours, let alone days. Parents won’t give permission for their daughters to go to university in this situation.” 
Taliban harassment of teachers and military use of schools 
Pashtana*, a high school teacher, told Amnesty International she received death threats from the Taliban and had been called to the local court for prosecution due to her prior teaching of co-educational sports. 
She received a letter from Taliban members earlier this year, and explained: “It said, ‘If the Taliban catch you, they will cut your ears off, and this will be a lesson for others in [your] province’. Now I am in hiding. Even my family thinks I am out of the country.” 
Efat*, a 22-year-old woman, and Naveed*, her 16-year-old brother, said they were beaten unconscious by two Taliban members on 18 August. They said they were attacked while going to an English class, which the Taliban members called “the language of infidels”. 
Another secondary school teacher said the Taliban had subjected her to harassment and intimidation, in retaliation for a media interview in which she complained about teacher salaries and girls’ access to secondary education. She added that she and several other teachers were threatened with eviction from their homes, which the previous government had provided. 
For security reasons and fear of reprisal attacks, the precise locations of these incidents have been omitted. Amnesty International has not yet established whether these incidents represent a broader pattern of abuse by Taliban members against students and teachers, but will continue to monitor such reports. 
Witnesses also told Amnesty International that the Taliban used four schools for military purposes during fighting prior to their takeover of the country: Tughani High School and Khetib Zada High School in Sar-e Pul city, Zakhail e Khondon High School in Kunduz city, and Alishing High School in Alishing district in Laghman province. Such use of schools places them at risk of attack, and is likely to make it extremely difficult to deliver an adequate education. These acts are also contrary to the global Safe Schools Declaration, which the Afghan government endorsed in 2015. 
Methodology 
From 16 September to 8 October 2021, Amnesty International conducted telephone interviews with 11 teachers and school administrators and 10 students – ranging from ages 14 to 22 – in provinces across Afghanistan, including Badakhshan, Farah, Helmand, Kabul, Kandahar, Laghman, Nangahar, Samangan and Sar-e Pul. 
Amnesty International also interviewed 12 local activists, representatives of NGOs and the United Nations, and other experts on education in Afghanistan. 
Amnesty International attempted to contact Taliban officials on 6 and 12 October, but had received no reply by the time of publication.

Two Eritrean nationals, Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi have been arbitrarily detained without any legal basis or access to asylum procedures in Egypt since 2012 and 2013, respectively. The two are facing forcible return to Eritrea, where they will be at real risk of arbitrary detention and torture.

Additional Information  
Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi fled Eritrea to escape indefinite military conscription, which is one of the main drivers compelling people to flee Eritrea. According to a 2016 Amnesty International report, deserters are likely to face prolonged arbitrary detention, inhumane detention conditions and torture and other-ill-treatment. Furthermore, in 2015, the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry on human rights in Eritrea found that “with a few exceptions, those who have been forced to return to the country have been arrested, detained and subjected to ill-treatment and torture”.  
On 9 September, prison officials forced them to undergo Covid-19 PCR tests at a hospital outside the prison and to sign documents in Arabic that they were unable to read, before informing them about plans to deport them without specifying a date. Security forces arrested 42-year-old Alem Tesfay Abraham at the Salloum border crossing with Libya on 10 March 2012, while 37-year-old Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi was arrested on 30 December 2013 in North Sinai Governorate. According to their lawyer, they have not been charged with any criminal offence since and have been repeatedly pressured to “voluntarily” return to Eritrea by officials at the migration department of the interior ministry. The two men have refused and have repeatedly requested to register for protection with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  
On 23 July 2020, three UN independent experts wrote to the Egyptian government raising concerns about the two men’s prolonged arbitrary detention and denial of the right to seek asylum. According to a refugee rights activist, shortly after this communication, prison officials verbally and physically assaulted the two men, and threatened to deport them. Going ahead with plans to deport them would violate the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning anyone to a place where they would be at real risk of torture and other serious human rights violations.  
Egyptian security forces routinely arbitrarily arrest and detain refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants in an irregular situation. As a state party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Egyptian authorities are obligated to respect the principle of non-refoulement.

0,Canada: Stop Incarcerating Immigration Detainees in Provincial Jails,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/canada-stop-incarcerating-immigration-detainees-in-provincial-jails/,"National Campaign Urges Provinces to Cancel Contracts Enabling Abuses(Ottawa, October 14, 2021) – Provincial governments should sever their contracts to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, where many experience abusive conditions, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said...","National Campaign Urges Provinces to Cancel Contracts Enabling Abuses(Ottawa, October 14, 2021) – Provincial governments should sever their contracts to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, where many experience abusive conditions, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today in opening a joint national campaign, #WelcomeToCanada. While Canadian authorities have released significant numbers of people from immigration detention since the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020, the proportion of those in provincial jails rather than immigration holding centers more than doubled in the six months following the onset of the pandemic.Provincial jails in Canada are designed to hold people awaiting criminal court proceedings or serving criminal sentences of up to two years. Immigration detainees held in these jails – many of which are maximum-security facilities – are not only confined in more restrictive settings than those held in immigration holding centers, but they are also more likely to be detained for longer periods of time. “By allowing the federal government to transfer immigration detainees to provincial jails, where they may remain with no end in sight, provincial authorities are implicated in Ottawa’s human rights abuses,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The provincial governments have a real opportunity to show leadership by walking away from these contracts that allow serious violations to happen in their own backyards.”According to government statistics, in the three-year period between April 2017 and March 2020, about a fifth of immigration detainees were held in 78 provincial jails across Canada. In the six months following the onset of the pandemic, between April and September 2020, 50 percent of immigration detainees were held in provincial jails. The average length of detention more than doubled, to 29 days compared with the same period the previous year, and at least 85 people were held for 100 days or longer.“I was arrested without charge and my belongings were taken, including the batteries for my hearing aid,” Abdelrahman Elmady, an Egyptian man with a hearing disability said in one of the campaign videos released on October 14, 2021. He described his detention in three provincial jails in British Columbia after fleeing to Canada to seek asylum. “My whole life I have relied on hearing aids, but suddenly I was in prison, confused, scared, and unable to hear anything. Nobody told me how long I would be detained.”In their recent report, “‘I Didn’t Feel Like a Human in There’: Immigration Detention in Canada and Its Impact on Mental Health,” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented the serious human rights violations that people face in immigration detention in Canada. Immigration detainees include people who are fleeing persecution, seeking a better life, and some who have lived in Canada since childhood.Immigration detainees are not held on criminal charges or convictions, but many experience some of the country’s most restrictive confinement conditions, including maximum-security provincial jails and solitary confinement. Immigration detainees are handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. In provincial jails, many are confined in dangerous environments where they may be subjected to violence.Immigration detainees from communities of color, particularly detainees who are Black, appear to be detained for longer periods and often in provincial jails rather than immigration holding centers. People with psychosocial disabilities (or mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the detention process. Immigration detention has especially harmful effects on communities of color, refugee claimants, children, and families.Through access to information requests, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International obtained copies of the contracts between the federal government and six provinces (British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan), which allow authorities to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, including maximum security facilities. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) confirmed to researchers that an additional contract is in place with the province of Alberta, but it has not been released.According to the contracts reviewed by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, each province can terminate the agreement without penalty or explanation with one year’s notice. In the three remaining provinces (Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island), CBSA representatives said the agency has “informal arrangements” to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails.In its 2020-21 Departmental Plan, the CBSA indicated that it has “limited control over detention conditions” in provincial jails across the country, which “poses challenges in ensuring a common standard of care.”Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees in provincial jails is a violation of international human rights law. Incarceration in these facilities is inherently punitive in nature and not suited nor permitted under international standards for use in immigration detention.Canadian authorities at the federal and provincial levels should take concrete measures toward abolishing immigration detention, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. The groups have written to all provinces urging premiers and corrections ministries to stop using provincial jails and other incarceration facilities for immigration detention, and to cancel all contracts and informal arrangements between the federal and provincial governments that allow authorities to transfer immigration detainees to these facilities.Through their #WelcomeToCanada campaign, which will go coast to coast starting with British Columbia, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are asking the general public to support their advocacy efforts by writing, calling, or tweeting their premiers urging them to cancel the contracts that allow immigration detainees to languish in provincial jails.“By shining a spotlight on the devastating harm caused by immigration detention in provincial jails, we hope that people across Canada will join us in urging provincial leaders to end this shameful practice,” said Justin Mohammed, programs manager at Amnesty International Canada. “Canada should become the refugee-welcoming and multicultural country it holds itself out to be, and treat people seeking safety or a better life with the dignity and respect they deserve.”For more Human Rights Watch reporting on disability rights, please visit: https://www.hrw.org/topic/disability-rights

“Around the world, hundreds of thousands of people have signed our petition to express their outrage at evidence of crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations being inflicted on Muslims in Xinjiang,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“It’s a clear sign that people around the world see through China’s efforts to silence critics and lash out in response to credible reporting on its atrocities in Xinjiang. Every signature is a direct call on China to immediately stop this systematic persecution. 
“The Chinese government must immediately release all people arbitrarily detained in the camps and in prisons, dismantle the internment camp system, and end the systematic attacks against predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.” 
Petitions delivered at Chinese embassiesIn recent days, Amnesty International supporters in 10 cities around the world have held public events to hand over their Free Xinjiang detainees petitions. 
On 7 October, activists gathered at the Chinese embassy in London, UK, to hand over their petition while dressed in the distinctive blue uniforms that camp detainees are forced to wear. Amnesty International activists planned similar events at Chinese embassies in: Dakar, Senegal; Helsinki, Finland; Lima, Peru; Lisbon, Portugal; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; The Hague, the Netherlands; and Washington DC, USA. Amnesty International Indonesia hosted an online seminar and led a digital action encouraging activists to dress in blue uniforms and post selfies.  
The global petition is part of an ongoing Amnesty International campaign, launched in June 2021, to demand an end to the arbitrary detention and other serious human rights violations suffered by predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.The campaign highlights more than 60 cases of individuals arbitrarily detained in “transformation-through-education” centres – actually, internment camps – or sentenced to prison for years. These represent only a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of men and women – possibly up to one million or more – whom the Chinese authorities have detained under the guise of fighting “terrorism”.  
New family testimonies 
Amnesty International interviewed dozens of family members of those arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang and recently released new videos sharing some of their experiences. 
Memeteli’s sister, Hayrigul Niyaz, was detained after she returned from studying abroad, and he has no information about her whereabouts in Xinjiang. Memeteli told Amnesty International: “If I met her again, I will say: ‘Sorry, my sister, that I couldn’t save you from the camps.’” 
Adila’s father, Sadir Ali, was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, allegedly because he was fasting during Ramadan. Adila said: “Deep [in my] heart I will never be happy because my father is in the jail or in the camp. Why is the Chinese government doing this to us?” She said she had been unable to visit her hometown for 11 years and has lost contact with her relatives in Xinjiang.Abduweli Ayup, a well-known Uyghur activist now living in Norway, told Amnesty International about his sister, Sajidugul Ayup and brother Erkin Ayup, who are serving 12 and 14 year prison sentences, respectively, in Xinjiang for “inciting terrorism”: “I feel every time I do something, it will be dangerous for my family. No one can protect my family members from the punishment. I know that maybe my words will make the Chinese government very angry, but at least I will make the Chinese government know that I will not just watch them torture my sister. I’m not afraid to speak out anymore.” 
Accountability for Xinjiang violations 
In June 2021 Amnesty International launched a report documenting how Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang face systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity.The Chinese government has shown a total unwillingness to acknowledge the reality of the situation in Xinjiang, to halt the human rights violations, or to conduct impartial and thorough investigations and prosecute those suspected to be responsible in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty. 
Meanwhile, UN bodies and member states have been slow to respond to the violations. Indeed, another UN Human Rights Council session ended last week without any formal action being taken to address abuses in Xinjiang. 
Amnesty International is urging UN member states to stand together to strongly condemn China’s serious human rights violations in Xinjiang and to launch a robust, independent, international investigative mechanism to ensure accountability.“Despite mounting evidence of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law over the past four years, the United Nations and its member states have failed to live up to their responsibility to hold China to account for its actions,” said Agnès Callamard. “The international community must stop pretending that the dystopian reality for Muslims in Xinjiang will somehow remedy itself. Too much time has already been wasted. Now more than ever, UN member states have a duty to protect the human rights of all people in Xinjiang, launch an investigation into the suspected crimes under international law, and ensure accountability.”

“This resolution brings hope in the context of widespread and increasing climate disasters, and is a milestone moment in the battle against environmental degradation. With the adoption of this resolution, the HRC has finally acknowledged that the enjoyment of human rights depends on the environment we live in. When the planet suffers, so do we, and all over the world environmental degradation is robbing people of their rights. 
“Government failures to protect the planet, and the ongoing support for environmentally destructive industries, amount to an assault on human rights on a massive scale. We welcome the long-overdue adoption of this resolution, and now call on states to ensure it translates into real change by recognizing this right in law at a national level, and by strengthening their environmental laws and policies. 
“We also welcome the adoption today of the resolution establishing the mandate of a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change. Both resolutions are the result of continued efforts of a broad range of state and non-state actors, including human rights defenders from all over the world. They will both make it easier for the UN to support states in improving their performance on environmental issues.”

“Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov’s Nobel Peace Prize win is a victory not only for independent, critical journalism in The Philippines and Russia, but for the fight for justice, accountability and freedom of expression all over the world.  
“For more than three decades, Maria Ressa has worked tirelessly as a journalist in the Philippines, carrying out vital investigative reporting on corruption, abuses of power, and human rights violations in President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly so-called war on drugs. As the co-founder of Rappler, a highly lauded and uncompromising online news site, she’s opened the world’s eyes to the brutality and pervasive impunity in the Philippines. Put simply, she is a global icon for press freedom.  
“Dmitry Muratov has been a rock for free media in Russia, his newspaper producing hard-hitting, fearless journalism in the face of mortal danger in the country’s increasingly perilous press environment. He is one of the few who continue to hold power to account. We salute the indefatigable professionalism and courage not only of Mr Muratov, but of all those Russian journalists who have suffered while carrying out their professional duties.   
“The Russian and Philippines authorities must take note of Dmitry Muratov’s and Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize win and end their relentless attack on press freedom.”  
Background  
In January 2012, Maria Ressa co-founded Rappler, an online news website critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration’s murderous “war on drugs”. She also serves as the publication’s CEO.   
Under the Duterte administration, Maria Ressa, former journalist Reynaldo Santos and Rappler’s directors have collectively faced threats and multiple lawsuits and investigations, including alleged tax violations and violations of the prohibition against foreign control over mass media.  
In June 2020, Maria Ressa was found guilty of “cyber libel” after being convicted under the controversial Philippines Anti-Cybercrime law. For this conviction and if she is found guilty under a myriad of other charges she faces up to sixty years in prison. Amnesty International was among numerous rights groups around the world that condemned her conviction as an attack on press freedom.    
Dmitry Muratov co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has been its editor ever since. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least six of its journalists, including Anna Politkovskaya, have been murdered during the course of their professional duties.   
Dmitry Muratov and his Novaya Gazeta colleagues have over the decades provided essential public interest information to Russia society, in the continuing face of attacks, threats and imprisonment.   
In recent months an increasing number of media organizations and journalists have been designated “undesirable organizations” or “foreign agents”, either halting their work or imposing severe administrative and financial constraints.

“Many women have been convicted and sentenced to death in shoddy, unfair trials that have often failed to follow due process or consider mitigating factors, such as long-term abuse, violence and sexual assault,” said Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy and policy, Rajat Khosla. 
“By sentencing these women to death, justice systems around the world are not only perpetuating an abhorrent and cruel punishment, they are also making women pay the price for the authorities’ failures to address discrimination. In addition, a lack of transparency around the use of the death penalty means the cases we know of are just the tip of the iceberg.” 
In many cases, the failure of authorities to act on specific complaints and end discriminatory practices have created a culture of abuse that women on death row have had to endure, meaning that these women continue to be further marginalised as they move through the criminal justice system. 
Noura Hussein Hamad Daoud, from Sudan, was sentenced to death in April 2017 for the murder of the man she was forced to marry at the age of 16. After she was forced to wed and move into his home three years later, the man with help of two of his brothers and a male cousin violently beat her and held her down while he raped her. Amnesty International, along with other organizations, campaigned on behalf of Noura and eventually her death sentence was commuted. Others, however, have not been as fortunate. 
In 2018, Amnesty International documented the execution of a Kurdish woman Zeinab Sekaanvand in Iran. She was a child when she married, and endured years of sexual violence at the hands of her husband and brother-in-law, before being arrested at 17 on charges of murdering her husband and convicted in a grossly unfair trial. 
In some countries including Ghana, the mandatory death penalty for certain crimes, such as murder, has prevented some women from raising their experience of gender-based violence and discrimination as mitigating factors at sentencing. In Malaysia, an overwhelming majority of women on death row, in particular women who are foreign nationals, are there for drug trafficking, for which the death penalty is mandatory. 
“By the end of last year, 108 countries had fully abolished the death penalty. Thankfully the world is moving away from the idea that states have the power to deny the right to life. But until every country has abolished the death penalty, we will not stop campaigning for its end. Together we can help to consign this cruel punishment to the history books forever,” said Rajat Khosla. 
On World Day Against the Death Penalty, Amnesty International is calling for people to take action and support a legislative proposal to abolish the death penalty in Ghana for most crimes. The organization is asking people to show their support by writing to Ghana’s Speaker of Parliament or Minister of Justice; spreading the word online using #Ghanavoteforabolition; and reaching out to their own member of parliament.

My class learned about the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Criminal Court, and the legal definition of the Crime of Genocide as defined by the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. With this knowledge, we could learn about various human rights atrocities throughout history and examine them. At that time, I was vaguely aware of the Chinese government’s treatment of the Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in China. With all the material I was learning and discussing in class ever present on my mind, I decided to learn more. 
During this, I learned the Olympics are scheduled to be held in Beijing in 2022. This struck me as a parallel opportunity to one the world had, leading up to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, but ultimately failed to seize. While the actions of China’s government are not the same as Nazi Germany, the timing with the two countries as host nations of the Olympics presents a similar opportunity for the rest of the world; to take action against human rights abuses. Governments and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are aware of the oppression from the Chinese government, as they were of the persecutory laws in Germany in 1936, and as of now are choosing the Olympics and the associated money and politics over action. 
The common counterargument to a boycott of the Beijing Olympics is it would amount to nothing besides further angering the Chinese government and possible political and economic consequences. However, by attending, the rest of the world effectively allows the Chinese government to present a facade of themselves across the globe to mask the human rights abuses there, considering their current actions continue. The Beijing Olympics would then be a massive propaganda event for the Chinese government that the IOC, governments, and athletes, whether they wanted to or not, would be helping them carry out without some form of a boycott. Effectively, this guise is what the Nazis successfully completed with the Berlin Olympics, afterward continuing on their horrific path that led to the Holocaust and Second World War. 
I am a high school student and am by no means qualified to inform you of what exactly would be the outcome or exact consequences of different types of boycotts. Instead, I can use the knowledge I have been taught and what I have learned about history to understand how an international sporting event can hold significance for people being oppressed in the host nation. Before and while writing my article, I questioned my qualifications in writing it. There are many people much more knowledgeable than myself on human rights abuses, foreign policy, economics, and the specifics of the Olympics, but I still wanted to ask these questions. Now half a year after I wrote my article, the Tokyo Olympics have finished, and Beijing is next in line, presenting the possibility of more momentum and focus onto the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Beijing Olympics highlight the question of the role of the Olympics in addressing human rights issues, where is it suitable to house the Olympics, and whose responsibility is it to prevent the Olympics from being used to disregard, thereby condoning human rights abuses?

Taliban forces unlawfully killed 13 ethnic Hazaras, including a 17-year-old girl, in Afghanistan’s Daykundi province after members of the security forces of the former government surrendered, a new investigation by Amnesty International has revealed. 
The killings happened in Kahor village of Khidir district on 30 August. Eleven of the victims were former members of the Afghan National Defence Security Forces (ANDSF), and two were civilians. 
According to eyewitness testimony gathered by Amnesty International, the Taliban extrajudicially executed nine of the ANDSF members after they had surrendered, killings that appear to be war crimes. Two civilians were killed as they attempted to flee, including a 17-year-old girl shot when the Taliban opened fire on a crowd of people. 
Amnesty International verified photographs and video evidence taken in the aftermath of the killings, and identified the location of Kahor village, where they happened. 
“These cold-blooded executions are further proof that the Taliban are committing the same horrific abuses they were notorious for during their previous rule of Afghanistan,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“They repeatedly violate the rights of those they perceive as their adversaries, even killing those who have already surrendered. The Taliban say they are not targeting former employees of the previous government, but these killings contradict such claims. 
“The Taliban must immediately cease these cruel acts of revenge, and ensure employees of the former government and their families can live safely in Afghanistan. The new government must make clear that such grave violations will not be tolerated, and that those responsible will be prosecuted.” 
Verifying human rights abuses committed by the Taliban since they took control of Afghanistan in August 2021 has proven difficult, as the group have cut mobile phone service in many regions. Shortly after the fall of Kabul, Amnesty International documented how Taliban fighters massacred nine ethnic Hazara men after taking control of Ghazni province. 
Killings in Kahor village 
The Taliban took control of Daykundi province on 14 August. An estimated 34 former ANDSF members initially sought safety in Khidir district, and had government military equipment and weaponry with them. They then agreed to surrender to the Taliban as the group established its authority over vast swathes of the region. 
Mohammad Azim Sedaqat, who was leading the surrender, arranged to decommission the group’s weapons in the presence of the Taliban. On 29 August, the men negotiated to surrender fully to the Taliban. 
On 30 August, an estimated 300 Taliban fighters arrived in convoy close to Dahani Qul village, where the ANDSF members were staying, some with family members. As the ANDSF members attempted to leave the area with their families, one vehicle remained stuck close to Kahor village. 
When the Taliban fighters caught up with them, they opened fire on the crowd and killed the 17-year-old girl, called Masuma. One of the ANDSF members then fired back, killing one Taliban fighter and wounding another. 
The Taliban continued to shoot as the families fled, killing two ANDSF members fleeing the scene. After nine more ANDSF members surrendered, the Taliban promptly took them to a nearby river basin and executed them. 
Videos and photographs reviewed by Amnesty International show the corpses of 11 men lined up, with many showing bullet wounds to their heads. One video shows a body being carried up an incline, believed to be at the river basin near Kahor. Amnesty International has been unable to independently geolocate this video, but its content is consistent with eyewitness testimony describing the location as close to Kahor. 
The names and estimated ages of the 11 ANDSF members are: Musa Amiri, 46; Khudad Jawahiri, 33; Esmatullah Zarigh, 34; Noor Ali Ibrahimi, 34; Habibullah, 33; Amanullah, 32; Reza Karimi, 31: Dawran, 26; Dur Mohammad, 41; Abdul Hamid Fahimi, 28: and Reza Joya, 33. 
Aftermath of the killings 
On 31 August, the day after the killings, villagers took the bodies to Dahani Qul, where they were then brought to family plots for burial. Amnesty International reviewed and verified information confirming the locations of two of the graves, and the identities of the people buried there. 
The Taliban then told remaining family members that anyone who had fled should return, and surrender within three days. Interviewees told Amnesty International that one senior Taliban official warned: “I have killed people for the past 20 years. Killing is easy for me. I can kill again.” 
On 1 September, Sadiqullah Abed, the Taliban-appointed chief of police for Daykundi province, denied any killings had happened and instead only confirmed that a member of the Taliban had been wounded in an attack in Daykundi. 
Background 
The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan following the collapse of the government in mid-August 2021. Amnesty International has called for the protection of thousands of Afghans at serious risk of Taliban reprisals, from academics and journalists to civil society activists and women human rights defenders. 
In a recent briefing, Afghanistan’s fall into the hands of the Taliban, Amnesty International detailed a litany of human rights abuses committed by the Taliban, including targeted killings of civilians and surrendered soldiers, and the blockading of humanitarian supplies, which constitute crimes under international law.

Since August, authorities in Mexico have been conducting mass detentions and deportations of migrants and asylum seekers without taking measures to ensure that these individuals are not being returned to locations where their lives or physical integrity might be at risk. Asylum seekers and migrants are being deported to countries such as Haiti, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Such deportations potentially endanger the lives of thousands. Excessive use of force against migrants and asylum seekers has also been reported. Children are also being held in migratory detention centers in the south of Mexico, against Mexican law and international standards. Act urgently to protect their rights.

Additional Information 
On 9th and 10th August 2021, organizations from the Collective for Observation and Monitoring of Human Rights in the Mexican Southeast (Colectivo de Observación y Monitoreo de Derechos Humanos en el Sureste Mexicano) reported the arrival of flights from Texas, United States into Tapachula, Chiapas. These flights were reportedly carrying migrants and asylum seekers deported from the United States under Title 42, a measure implemented by the US in response to COVID-19, under which people crossing the Mexico-US land border may be expelled. According to the account of local organizations, authorities from the National Institute of Migration (INM) and the National Guard (GN) took those arriving on deportation flights to the Talismán border with Guatemala and abandoned them, without conducting administrative processing or individualized risk assessments. Processing also reportedly did not place on the Guatemala side of the border and no orientation or guidance was provided. According to local organizations, such incidents have occurred throughout the months of August and September and have affected predominately people from Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. This practice is reportedly also taking place at the Villahermosa airport, in the southern State of Tabasco, with migrants and asylum seekers arriving on flights being immediately loaded onto buses by authorities and sent to Honduras without individualized risk assessments or administrative processing. 
Local organizations also report that in addition to this treatment being experienced by those deported from the United States, people from Haiti and Central America detained in the interior of Mexico have also been subject to this practice. Local organizations report that even those with regular status in Mexico, such as those with refugee status or official asylum applications have also been subject to expedited deportation – a serious violation of their rights. Amnesty International has previously documented this practice. On 29 September, Mexican migration authorities also reported returning people from Haiti to their country of origin by plane, supposedly on a voluntary basis.    
Between 28 August and 5 September, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, primarily from Haiti, but also from other countries in the region, organized caravans to leave the city of Tapachula, Chiapas following days of protests. The protests related to the pace of asylum application processing and the lack of opportunities and decent living conditions in the city. Authorities from INM, GN and the military repressed the caravan, using excessive force against those participating. According to local organizations, authorities beat migrants and asylum seekers, and separated children from their families. Journalists were also reportedly injured. Authorities have also engaged in the persecution of Haitian migrants in the Northern border state of Coahuila, where thousands of people from Haiti have been waiting to cross into the US. Media reports suggest that police, INM and national guard officials on 21 and 22 September conducted raids in hotels and on the streets in order to detain people from Haiti possibly in need of international protection.  
In addition to mass, unlawful detentions and expulsions, local organizations also report poor detention conditions in migratory detention centers located at Mexico’s southern border. Overcrowding has been reported at the Cupape 1, Cupape 2 (La Mosca), and Siglo XXI centers in Chiapas. Infants, children and adolescents are also reportedly being held at these facilities despite Mexican law and international standards expressly prohibiting this due to concerns regarding the best interests of the child. Amnesty International and other organizations recently called upon the Mexican government to stop the detention and deportation of migrants and asylum seekers due to the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In recent years, the number of people seeking asylum in Mexico has soared. Recent data released in 2021 by the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) show that people fleeing Honduras make up the greatest portion of those seeking asylum in Mexico this year, followed by people from Haiti, Cuba and El Salvador. Amnesty International has documented that attacks, threats, persecution, impunity, and high levels of poverty and inequality are the main factors leading to forced migration from Central American countries to Mexico. With respect to Haiti, protests and widespread violence have been ongoing since at least 2019, as previously documented by Amnesty International. Amidst the chaos surrounding the killing of President Jovenel Moïse in early July, violent crime, and the human rights crisis afflicting the country, journalists and human rights defenders have increasingly come under attack. The Haitian government has been accused of complicity in large-scale attacks by gangs targeting impoverished neighbourhoods. In a report earlier this year, the UN highlighted the increase in human rights violations. Amnesty International is also calling upon the US government to stop deportations end human rights violations against Haitians in the United States.

No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
The Lebanese General Security (GS), which are in charge of monitoring the entry, residence and exit of all foreigners in Lebanon, released three Syrian nationals, Ahmad Al Waked, Tarek Al A’lo, and Fares Al Zo’bi, whom they had detained in September 2021 at Beirut International Airport as they were seeking to travel to a third country, on the basis that they had entered the country “illegally”. 
The GS held them in incommunicado detention, and they were at risk of being forcibly deported back to Syria. Were that to happen, the Lebanese authorities would have put them at heightened risk of being subjected to grave human rights violations, including torture, enforced disappearance or arbitrary detention. 
Following sustained pressure by a human rights lawyer who was following up on their cases and Amnesty International, Ahmad Al Waked and Tarek Al A’lo were released on 13 October and Fares Al Zo’bi on 22 October. The three men were handed back their passports, enabling them to seek asylum in a third country.

Today, September 30, marks the first National Day of Truth and Reconciliation in Canada. 
We honour the lives of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis children uprooted from their families and reflect on the deep wounds borne by Indigenous Peoples ever since. An estimated 150,000 children were forcibly removed from their families and communities, transferred to residential schools, sometimes thousands of kilometres away from their homes. They endured horrific conditions of physical and sexual abuse, unsanitary conditions resulting in disease, malnutrition and starvation, forced labour, and indoctrination out of their identity, languages and cultures. Thousands of children never made it home.  
From 1831 to 1996, there were 140 federally run residential schools across the country. For years, survivors and communities spoke out about the intergenerational trauma caused by these institutions: from the trauma inflicted on these children within the system, their loss of language, community, and culture and ways of being, to the ongoing forcible removal and assimilation under the child welfare system. 
The colonial policies continue to this date: Indigenous children are overwhelmingly represented in Canada’s child welfare system; Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people experience staggeringly high rates of violence; and governments frequently approve industrial projects on Indigenous territories without their free, prior, and informed consent. 
Yesterday, in an important step towards justice for Indigenous children, the Federal Court upheld a landmark Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling ordering the federal government to compensate First Nations children and their families.    
On this day, all non-Indigenous people are called upon to witness and act upon this truth, without which there can be no reconciliation. 
We invite you to join us at 7:00 pm EST today, in conversation with legal scholar Tamara Starblanket. Tamara is Spider Woman, a Nehiyaw iskwew (Cree woman) from Ahtahkakoop First Nation in Treaty Six. She is the author of “Suffer the Little Children: Genocide, Indigenous Nations, and the Canadian State”, a groundbreaking book in which she exposes the forcible removal of Indigenous children as a crime under the UN Genocide Convention. 
Indigenous Peoples have led the way in seeking truth, justice, and accountability. Settlers must reflect on the remarkable work Indigenous communities have been doing to gather and analyze evidence, support survivors, and lobby nationally and internationally for recognition and restitution. This work is exhausting and retraumatizing. We call on all non-Indigenous people to find the courage to face up to benefitting from the living legacy of colonization. We must take on the work we are being asked to do. 
What can you do to mark this important day of reflection? Read more on our blog.

Using satellite imagery and photographs to measure the area and 3D reconstruction, Amnesty International has established the group’s position on the border and found that in late August their position had shifted overnight from Poland to Belarus, in what appears an unlawful forced return. 
Amnesty International’s reconstruction shows that on 18 August, many of the 32 people, who had entered Poland from Belarus, were on the Polish side of the border, surrounded by Polish border forces. However, one day later they were back on the Belarusian side of the border. Amnesty International believes that this movement could constitute evidence of an unlawful pushback because it appears that the movement occurred as armed Polish border guards surrounded the refugees’ makeshift camp. 
“Poland has been cruelly holding this group of people on their border in horrendous conditions for weeks. Our analysis shows irrefutably on 18 August, their position shifted from Poland to Belarus overnight, which strongly suggests that they were victims of an unlawful pushback,” said Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office. 
On 20 August, all 32 Afghans stuck on the border made applications for international protection in Poland, with the help of lawyers, showing that they wished to remain in Poland. 
The interim measures granted by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on 25 August, and subsequently extended on 27 September, instruct Poland to provide the group with assistance, including “adequate food, water, clothing, medical care and, if possible, temporary shelter”. The ECtHR also indicate that the group of Afghans claimed they had previously entered Polish territory on 8 August and been pushed back. Poland has so far failed to comply with the interim measures. 
‘State of emergency‘ 
Since the event, the group has remained trapped between Polish and Belarusian borders guards. Poland has restricted movement in the area and introduced rules, on 20 August, allowing for people intercepted at the border to be returned to the border with Belarus. On 2 September, Poland declared a “state of emergency” at its borders with Belarus, limiting journalists and NGOs from accessing the area. The “state of emergency” has prevented the oversight of potential human rights violations, raising concerns about the treatment of refugees and migrants in the area, including the unlawful return of other people back across the border to Belarus. Since 19 September, five people have died in the border area, including as a result of hypothermia. 
“The dire situation facing the Afghans on the border is one that the Polish government has created.  The declaration of ‘the state of emergency’ is illegitimate and must be lifted. The situation at the country’s borders does not constitute a public emergency by European and international definitions,” said Eve Geddie. 
“Forcing back people who are trying to claim asylum without an individual assessment of their protection needs is contrary to international and EU law. The introduction of new laws and measures that attempt to legalize pushbacks do nothing to change that.” 
Digital verification 
To evaluate the situation on the Poland-Belarus border, Amnesty International’s Evidence Lab collected and analyzed cross-border satellite imagery and more than 50 videos and photographs of incidents on the border since 12 August. The images confirm the group’s movements and the increased securitization of the border in recent weeks. The images came from numerous sources, such as local people and press, and included helicopter footage and satellite imagery – all of which was then analyzed and verified.   
Using photogrammetry and photo-matching to reconstruct 3D models, Amnesty International was able to verify the group’s position on the border, confirm the suspected pushback between 18 and 19 August and the location of the group between 12 August and 13 September. It also exposed the inhumane conditions in the makeshift camp that the group is being forced to live in.  
Amnesty International is calling on Poland’s government to ensure that those seeking protection have access to its territory. The authorities must end pushbacks, and urgently provide adequate shelter, food, water, sanitary facilities, access to lawyers and medical care to the group of Afghans stranded at the Poland-Belarus border. Poland should also repeal the state of emergency and laws limiting movement in the border area, and grant unhindered access to journalists, activists, NGOs and lawyers. 
“People have requested asylum in an EU country, an EU member state is blatantly violating their rights and the EU must act swiftly and firmly to call out these flagrant abuses of EU and international law,” said Eve Geddie. 
Background 
On 2 September, Poland introduced a state of emergency in areas at the border with Belarus. A state of emergency is defined under international law as something that threatens “the life of the nation.” Migration to Poland plainly fails to meet this test and poses no emergency. In addition, international human rights law has strict conditions that a state needs to follow when it imposes a state of emergency that limits human rights, such as notifying relevant international bodies. Poland has failed to act in compliance with these requirements. 
On 20 August 2021, prior to the introduction of the state of emergency, a ministerial decree limited movements at the border and established that, except for people falling under certain categories, those intercepted in the border area must leave Poland and be “returned to the state border line.” The decree conflicts with Poland’s obligations under refugee law, as it limits asylum-seekers’ access to Polish territory, which is instrumental to their ability to claim international protection there. The decree is also at odds with the principle of non-penalization of asylum-seekers, whereby people seeking protection should not face penalties on account of their irregular entry or presence in a country. By allowing Polish authorities to return people without an assessment of their circumstances and without an effective opportunity for them to challenge the return decision, the decree is inconsistent with the principle of non–refoulement and could lead to collective expulsions prohibited under international law. 
Lithuania and Latvia, which also neighbour Belarus, have seen comparable arrivals at their borders, and have introduced measures similar to Poland’s. On 17 August, the Polish government proposed a series of worrying amendments to the legislation on returns and international protection. The amendments propose to facilitate returns, which could lead to collective expulsions; allow asylum authorities to discard asylum applications made by people intercepted at an irregular crossing, unless specific circumstances apply; and impose penalties for irregular border crossings. The UNHCR strongly criticized the proposal. At the time of writing, the proposal is not yet in force and is pending before the Polish Senate. 
On 25 August, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Poland to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants and refugees at their borders. This was renewed on 27 September. Poland has so far failed to comply with the Court’s order. 
UNHCR and IOM have made public calls to be granted immediate access to people in need at the border.

Residential schools were part of a colonial policy to eradicate Indigenous cultures, languages, and communities. The last school did not close until 1996 and intergenerational trauma, ongoing harms, and discriminatory practices continue.   
On this day, all non-Indigenous people are called upon to witness and act upon this truth, without which there can be no reconciliation.

Listen to First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities and peoples and support their calls for justice and accountability. Do not ask Indigenous people to support your learning or to share ways for you to take action if they have not offered. Indigenous Peoples and communities are grieving and have been sharing resources and knowledge for many years.

0,Federal Court decision on compensation for First Nations children a step towards justice for Indigenous Peoples,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/federal-court-rulings-on-compensation-for-first-nations-children-a-step-towards-justice-for-indigenous-peoples/, OTTAWA – Amnesty International welcomes a Federal Court decision to uphold a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling on compensation and public services for Indigenous children today.  “The federal government never should have taken Indigenous children to...," OTTAWA – Amnesty International welcomes a Federal Court decision to uphold a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruling on compensation and public services for Indigenous children today.  
“The federal government never should have taken Indigenous children to court in the first place,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English-speaking branch. “Today’s decision – a day before the first annual National Day of Truth and Reconciliation – signals a step towards justice for First Nations children. We urge the federal government to act without delay and properly compensate the First Nations children, youth and families who Canada has harmed.”  
In 2019, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that Canada “willfully and recklessly” discriminated against First Nations children living on reserve because it did not properly fund child and family services. The ruling ordered Canada to monetarily compensate First Nations children, youth, and families with the maximum allowable amount under the Canadian Human Rights Act. In October 2019, the federal government applied for judicial review of that decision and, today, the Federal Court quashed that appeal.  
The decision also relates to who is eligible for Jordan’s Principle, which is a rule that ensures Indigenous children living on- and off-reserve have equitable access to services. It is also intended to resolve jurisdictional disputes about whether the provincial/territorial or federal government is responsible for providing those services.   
Background  
Amnesty International intervened on this case at the request of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. Amnesty International argued that the Canadian Human Rights Act must be interpreted consistently with Canada’s international obligations. International law strictly prohibits discrimination against an individual or group because they are Indigenous. Canada also has obligations under international law to protect children. These obligations require the government to consider the best interests of First Nations children in all of its actions, including by preserving their family environment and protecting their cultural identity through the provision of appropriate child welfare services.

Where I live in British Columbia, a “heat dome” caused unbearable conditions that resulted in several hundred deaths. Hundreds of forest fires across the province have blanketed the air with smoke and thousands of households had to be evacuated. Tragically, last month the town of Lytton, BC burned to the ground. In other Canadian provinces and territories, people’s lives have been turned upside down by drought, melting permafrost, and other extreme weather events. 
In August, the United Nations’ international panel of climate scientists published a report warning that the world is dangerously close to runaway warming, and that humans are “unequivocally” to blame. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called this report a “code red for humanity”. 
“The alarm bells are deafening, and the evidence is irrefutable:  greenhouse‑gas emissions from fossil-fuel burning and deforestation are choking our planet and putting billions of people at immediate risk…. This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.” 
Guterres called on countries to end all new fossil fuel (coal, oil, gas) exploration and production, and shift fossil-fuel subsidies into renewable energy. Amnesty International urges the Government of Canada to heed this advice. According to a recent study by the organization Environmental Defence, Canada provides the second highest levels of public finance to oil and gas of all G20 countries – and the most on a per capita basis. The study shows that the Canadian government announced at least $18 billion to the oil and gas sector in 2020 alone. This is shameful given that fossil fuel pollution is the biggest contributor to climate change.

“Fair access to Covid-19 vaccines across the world is our only pathway out of this crisis so we welcome the news that the USA and the EU have committed to new targets in the fight against this pandemic. 
“Ensuring everyone in all countries, rich and poor, can be vaccinated is an essential goal to keep us all safe, but the world is already miles off track from the World Health Organization’s current target of ensuring 40% of people in lower-income countries are vaccinated by the end of this year. 
“Yes, today’s summit produced large pledges of vaccines that will eventually save lives, but inexplicably delays delivering the vast majority of them until well into 2022. Why wait to act when hundreds of millions of doses are available today and people are dying right now? 
“The US and EU have together pledged over 1.6 billion vaccine doses – but not until far into 2022. With the right level of urgency and political will, a huge number of these doses could be shared in the next few months – especially as they are projected to be sitting on around 900 million surplus doses by the end of the year. 
“Other countries such as UK, Canada and Japan must also step up and make much more ambitious contributions if they are to get serious about meeting the WHO goal for 2021. 
“It is essential states and companies work together to deliver 2 billion vaccines to lower-income countries by the end of this year and Amnesty International is calling for a concrete plan detailing when the vaccines are going to be shared and where. If immediate action isn’t taken now, millions more lives will be lost.” 
NOTES TO EDITORS 
Today marks 100 days until the end of the year and Amnesty International is launching its’ new campaign, 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines now!. 
The organization is calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to deliver 2 billion vaccines to those who need it most starting now, to ensure that the World Health Organisation’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population of low and lower-middle income countries by the end of the year is met. 
Projections from data science company Airfinity estimate that the EU, UK, US, Canada, Japan and China are currently sitting on over 500 million surplus vaccine doses – a figure that will rise to over 1.5 billion by the end of the year on current trends. 
Over 5 billion vaccines are projected to be produced worldwide between September and December 2021.

On September 17th, a national sentencing court in Honduras finally absolved Edwin, dropping the charges that had landed him first in solitary confinement and then in a military run prison with violent offenders where his life was threatened.    
More than 9,000 messages were sent from Canada to Honduran authorities calling for due process and a fair trial.   
Edwin was arrested in 2018 following his participation in massive marches that denounced the government for election rigging. His case, and that of his cellmate Raul Alvarez, are emblematic of a brutal crackdown on social protest.   
Tellingly, the charges against Edwin and Raul were dropped for lack of evidence, confirming what the two men had always said.   
There is no doubt that arbitrary detentions are a tactic to suppress dissent in Honduras. There is also no doubt that Honduran authorities are sensitive to their international image and pressure from outside the country.

In a new report, A Double Dose of Inequality: Pharma companies and the Covid-19 vaccines crisis, the organization assessed six of the companies that hold the fate of billions of people in their hands: AstraZeneca plc, BioNTech SE, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Inc., Novavax, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc. It paints a dismal picture of an industry that is woefully failing to respect human rights. 
Read the report 
“Vaccinating the world is our only pathway out of this crisis. It should be time to hail these companies, who created vaccines so quickly, as heroes. But instead, to their shame and our collective grief, Big Pharma’s intentional blocking of knowledge transfer and their wheeling and dealing in favor of wealthy states has brewed an utterly predictable and utterly devastating vaccine scarcity for so many others” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“It’s plunging parts of Latin America, Africa and Asia into renewed crises, pushing weakened health systems to the very brink and causing tens of thousands of preventable deaths every week. In many low-income countries, not even health workers and people at-risk have received the vaccine.”   
“Against the backdrop of these gross inequalities BioNTech, Moderna and Pfizer are set to make US$130 billion combined by the end of 2022. Profits should never come before lives.” 
Failing to meet human rights responsibilities 
In order to assess their response to the crisis, Amnesty International reviewed each company’s human rights policy, vaccine pricing structure, their records on intellectual property, knowledge and technology sharing, the fair allocation of available vaccine doses, and transparency. It found that to differing degrees, the six vaccine developers had failed to meet their human rights responsibilities. 
Out of 5.76 billion doses administered worldwide, a paltry 0.3% have gone to low-income countries with over 79% going to upper-middle and high-income countries. Despite calls to prioritize and collaborate with COVAX Facility, the international instrument aiming to ensure a fair global vaccine allocation, some of the assessed companies have continued to stock up vaccine supplies for states known to be hoarding the vaccine. 
All the companies assessed have so far refused to take part in internationally coordinated initiatives designed to boost global supply by sharing knowledge and technology. They have also opposed proposals to temporarily lift intellectual property rights, such as the World Trade Organization Trade Related Intellectual Property Rules (TRIPS) Waiver proposed by India and South Africa. 
Further findings included: 
Despite most companies receiving billions of dollars in government funding and advance orders, vaccine developers have monopolized intellectual property, blocked technology transfers, and lobbied aggressively against measures that would expand the global manufacturing of these vaccines. Their continued inaction has caused human rights harms suffered by the billions of people still unable to access a lifesaving Covid-19 vaccine. 
100-day countdown 
“Today marks 100 days until the end of the year. We’re calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to drastically change course and to do everything needed to deliver 2 billion vaccines to low and lower-middle income countries starting now. No one should spend another year suffering and living in fear,” said Agnès Callamard. 
To coincide with the publication of today’s report, Amnesty International is launching a global campaign –backed by the World Health Organisation and High Commissioner for Human Rights – to hold states and big pharma to account. The 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines now! is demanding that the World Health Organization’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population of low and lower-middle income countries by the end of the year is met. We are calling upon states to urgently redistribute the hundreds of millions of excess doses currently sitting idle and for vaccine developers to ensure that at least 50% of doses produced go to these countries. If states and pharma companies continue down their current path, there will be no end in sight for COVID-19.“Armed with billions of dollars of tax-payers money and expertise from research institutions, pharmaceutical companies have played a pivotal role in developing life-saving vaccines. But now they must take immediate action to provide billions more people with the chance to be inoculated. To achieve a fair and rapid roll-out, vaccine developers must prioritize deliveries to countries that need them most and suspend their intellectual property rights, share their knowledge and technology and train qualified manufacturers to ramp-up production of Covid-19 vaccines,” said Agnès Callamard. 
As President Biden is set to announce new commitments to fight the coronavirus pandemic including fully vaccinating 70 percent of the world’s population by next September, at a summit today (22nd Sept), Agnes Callamard said: 
“Covid-19 vaccines must be readily available and accessible for all. It is up to governments and pharma companies to make this a reality. We need leaders like President Biden, to put billions of doses on the table and deliver the goods, otherwise this is just another empty gesture and lives will continue to be lost.” 
Amnesty International is also calling on states to ensure that health facilities and medicines, are available, accessible, acceptable and of good quality to everyone. They must adopt laws and policies to ensure pharmaceutical companies conform with human rights standards. 
Amnesty International wrote to each company before publication. Five companies – AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson – responded. The companies acknowledge that fair and equitable distribution, particularly in low-income countries, is essential, but all companies have failed to meet these aspirations and fulfil their human rights responsibilities. 
Background 
Amnesty International’s report did not assess in detail the Russian and Chinese companies that are producing billions of doses, as these companies disclose less corporate information. This lack of transparency makes it impossible to conduct a full assessment. However, like all companies, they also have human rights responsibilities. They, too, have not distributed their vaccines equitably, reserving the majority of doses for domestic consumption, and failed to join knowledge and technology sharing pools. 
Data on the distribution of vaccines, projected production and revenue forecasts for each company was drawn from Airfinity, a data science company. Data on vaccination rates in different countries was taken from Our World In Data. 
Using data from these sources, Amnesty has calculated that an additional 1.2 billion people in low and lower-middle income countries would need to be vaccinated by the end of the year to meet the WHO’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population in these countries. This would require over 2 billion vaccines. If just 50% of the world’s projected vaccine production until the end of the year was distributed to low and lower-middle income countries, it would provide 2.6 billion vaccines.

Contrary to the Taliban’s repeated claims that they will respect the rights of Afghans, the briefing, Afghanistan’s fall into the hands of the Taliban, details a litany of human rights abuses including targeted killings of civilians and surrendered soldiers and the blockading of humanitarian supplies in the Panjshir Valley, which constitute crimes under international law. Restrictions have also been reimposed on women, freedom of expression and civil society.   
“In just over five weeks since assuming control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have clearly demonstrated that they are not serious about protecting or respecting human rights. We have already seen a wave of violations, from reprisal attacks and restrictions on women, to crackdowns on protests, the media and civil society,” said Dinushika Dissanayake, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for South Asia.   
“Given the prevailing climate of fear, lack of mobile connectivity in many areas, and internet blackouts enforced by the Taliban, these findings are likely to represent just a snapshot of what’s happening on the ground. The UN Human Rights Council must establish a robust, independent mechanism with a mandate to document, collect and preserve evidence of ongoing crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations and abuses across Afghanistan.”   
Climate of fear for Human Rights Defenders  
Attacks on human rights defenders have been reported on a near-daily basis since 15 August. The Taliban are conducting door-to-door searches for human rights defenders, forcing many into hiding.   
Researchers spoke to Mahmud*, an Afghan human rights defender who managed to get out of the country. Mahmud described how, on the day the Taliban entered Kabul, he received a call asking him to hand over his organizations’ vehicles, equipment and money. The caller knew his name and warned him he had no choice but to cooperate.   
Over the following days, Mahmud received further phone calls and WhatsApp messages, asking for his home address and requesting to meet him at designated locations. Two colleagues at his NGO had been beaten by the Taliban. Images shared by one of his co-workers and verified by Amnesty International and a forensic pathologist show classical assaultive ‘whipmarks’ to the back and yellowing bruising to the victim’s left arm. 
“The threat faced by human rights defenders stranded in Afghanistan is real. They are under attack on all fronts as they are seen as enemies of the Taliban. Their offices and homes have been raided. Their colleagues have been beaten. They are forced into permanent hiding. They live under the constant threat of arrest, torture or worse. Those who managed to leave the country are now stranded in military camps or in neighbouring countries, not knowing their final destination nor how they will be able to rebuild their lives that have been shattered overnight,” said Delphine Reculeau, Human Rights Defenders Programme Director at the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT).   
“The international community must uphold its moral and political commitments and not fail the people who have dedicated their lives to the defence of human rights, gender equality, the rule of law and democratic freedoms in their country, but protect them at all costs.”  
Persecution of journalists  
Two Kabul-based female journalists that Amnesty International spoke to, shared the threats and intimidation they faced following the Taliban takeover. Ayesha*, who has now fled the capital following warnings from her employer that her life was at risk, said her family had since been visited by the Taliban, and threatened after they informed the group that she was not at home.   
Aadila* described the first two weeks of Taliban rule as a time of fear and uncertainty. She had initially decided to stay in Afghanistan and continue her work, until the Taliban came to her home one night asking for her. Upon the insistence of relatives, she left the country shortly afterwards.  
Abdul, a male journalist said that editors, journalists and media workers had received instructions from the Taliban that they could work only under the terms of Sharia law and Islamic rules and regulations.  
“I have not reported to my job since the fall of the republic. Taliban came to my house several times, but I hid myself. From the time of the collapse, our office is closed” he said  
Women and girls and the right to protest  
As a result of a climate of fear bred by the Taliban’s takeover, many Afghan women are now wearing the burka, refraining from leaving the house without a male guardian, and stopping other activities to avoid violence and reprisals. Despite the myriad threats now presented to women’s rights, women across the country have been holding protests.  
While some protests have been allowed to continue peacefully, many were violently repressed by the Taliban. On 4 September, approximately 100 women at a protest in Kabul were dispersed by Taliban special forces, who fired into the air and reportedly fired tear gas.   
Nazir*, a human rights defender, told Amnesty International how his male friend Parwiz* was severely beaten by the Taliban after attending a women’s rights protest on 8 September.  
“Parwiz was detained during women’s protests on 8 September. He was severely tortured. He had his arm broken. He was taken inside the Police district [district number withheld]. When the Taliban released him, they made him wear new clothes because his clothes had become wet from his blood.”  
On 8 September, the now Taliban controlled Ministry of Interior issued an order banning all demonstrations and gatherings across Afghanistan “until a policy of demonstration is codified.”  
“The international community must not turn a blind eye to the violations being committed by the Taliban. Taking concrete action at the UN Human Rights Council will not only send the message that impunity will not be tolerated, but also contribute to preventing violations on a broader scale. This should go hand in hand with support for the ongoing investigation at the International Criminal Court, in order to secure accountability for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by all parties,” said Juliette Rousselot, FIDH’s Program Officer for South Asia.

These shortcomings hamper the judicial process and increase the likelihood that cases will remain unpunished, said Amnesty International in a new report released today. 
Justice on trial: Failures in criminal investigations of feminicides preceded by disappearance in the State of Mexico documents how these failings are consistent with those found in other investigations highlighted by civil society organizations and by rights holders, as well as with cases such as the feminicides committed in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, more than 20 years ago. This indicates that feminicidal violence and the failures in investigating and preventing them are part of a broader reality in the country. 
Read the report 
“State-level authorities must prevent, investigate and punish feminicides with due diligence. As part of the Mexican state, they are obliged to comply with the international treaties to which Mexico is a state party, including the Belem do Pará Convention, the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women and the judgments issued by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in respect of Mexico, which establish a set of norms, standards and principles to guarantee women’s rights”, said Edith Olivares Ferreto, Executive Director of Amnesty International Mexico. 
“Each feminicide has an appalling impact on the victims’ families, who, in their search for access to the truth, justice and reparation for the harm done, also suffer re-victimization by the authorities. For this reason, Amnesty International continues to insist that the issue of violence against women must be a high priority on the agenda of the federal and local governments.” 
In 2020 alone, 3,723 killings of women were registered in Mexico, of which 940 were investigated as feminicides in the country’s 32 states. Not one state was free of feminicides. 
In the report, Amnesty International documents four emblematic cases of feminicide preceded by disappearance, specifically detailing the failings in the criminal investigations into each killing. The cases documented were those of Nadia Muciño Márquez, who was killed in 2004; Daniela Sánchez Curiel, who disappeared in 2015 and whose whereabouts remain unknown and whose family assumes she was a victim of feminicide; Diana Velázquez Florencio, who disappeared and was killed in 2017; and Julia Sosa Conde, who disappeared and was killed in late 2018. 
The report shows that state authorities fail to examine the crime scene properly; store the evidence collected securely; or carry out forensic tests or processes, resulting in loss of data, objects or substances and testimonies. 
The authorities do not always pursue all lines of inquiry and their failure to act results in the victims’ relatives – generally women – taking on leading the investigations and using their own resources to do so. In some instances, the authorities threaten and harass families so that they do not bring the case to the attention of their superiors. The authorities do not always apply a gender perspective throughout the criminal process, in contravention of protocols on investigating killings of women. 
The report also shows that the State of Mexico Attorney General’s Office officials do not have the necessary conditions to enable them to carry out investigations: their workload is excessive and they lack the material resources to carry out some procedures. In addition, personnel have to pay for some of the materials needed to carry out investigations themselves and their offices do not have anywhere to store evidence securely, which increases the risk of contamination and destruction. They also require further specialized training to carry out investigations appropriately. 
The failings documented in the investigations result in violations of women’s human rights to life and physical safety and their families’ rights to judicial protection and access to justice. In order to protect the rights of victims, Amnesty International makes the following recommendations. 
In parallel with the publication of the report, Amnesty International has launched the #HastaSerEscuchadas (Until They Are Heard) campaignwhich aims to ensure that the authorities publicly acknowledge the failings in the investigations of feminicides, comply with the movement’s recommendations and initiate a process to provide reparations for the harms caused by these failings. 
“At Amnesty International we will continue to raise our voices together with those of victims’ families and support them in their search for truth, justice and reparation for the harm suffered, until they are heard”, said Edith Olivares Ferreto.

In the months that followed, six more members of this human rights organization were thrown behind bars and charged with unfounded criminal offences for carrying out their legitimate human rights work,” the organizations said.  
The following is a list of those detained and their charges under the Criminal Code of Belarus:  
Marfa Rabkova, the coordinator of Viasna’s network of volunteers, was detained on 17 September 2020, and has been in pre-trial detention ever since. She has been charged with ‘training and other preparation of people for participation in mass riots’, ‘incitement of racial, national, religious or other social hatred or discord committed by a group’, and ‘membership of a criminal organization’ and could face up to 12 years in prison.  
Andrei Chepyuk, a volunteer for Viasna in Minsk, was detained on 2 October 2020 and is charged with ‘participation in mass disorder’ and ‘membership of a criminal organization’. He could face up to seven years in prison.  
Leanid Sudalenka, the director of the Homel branch of Viasna, was detained on his way to the office on 18 January 2021. Sudalenka had provided legal assistance to dozens of Homel region residents who were detained and charged for their participation in post-election protests.  
Tatsyana Lasitsa, an activist who volunteers for Viasna in Homel, was detained on 21 January 2021, and is charged with ‘organization or participation in group actions that gravely violate public order’. She could face up to three years’ imprisonment.  
Another volunteer of the Homel branch of Viasna, Maryia Tarasenka, was detained on 18 January 2021. She was held for three days before being released on 21 January 2021 after she agreed to sign a pledge not to leave the country.  
All three members of Homel branch of Viasna, Leanid Sudalenka, Tatsyana Lasitsa, and Maryia Tarasenka, face charges of “organizing, financing, training and preparation of actions grossly violating public order and financing such activities” under parts 1 and 2 of Article 342 of the Criminal Code. If convicted, they could face up to three years of imprisonment.  
On 16 February 2021, Belarusian law enforcement officers raided Viasna branches in Minsk, Homel, Mahilyou, Vitsebsk, Brest, and other towns, as well as the homes of staff.  In March 2021, the Belarusian Investigative Committee, an agency responsible for criminal investigations, opened a criminal case into Viasna’s activities under Article 342 of the Criminal Code (“organizing and preparing actions that gravely violate public order or active participation in such actions”).  
Finally, on 14 July 2021, following raids on more than a dozen major Belarusian civil society and human rights organizations, including Viasna, by Belarusian law enforcement officers, Ales Bialiatski, the chair of Viasna, Valiantsin Stefanovich, a member of the Viasna Board and vice-president of the International Federation of Human Rights, and Uladzimir Labkovich, a Viasna lawyer, were detained. They have all been charged under Article 342 and Article 243(2) (“tax evasion”) which carries a maximum sentence of seven years.  
Systematic silencing of civil society  
The reprisals against Viasna are just a part of a broader crackdown on civil society in Belarus. On 22 July 2021 alone, the Ministry of Justice ordered the closure of 53 organizations. At present, more than 200 civil society organizations have been shut down or are in the process of being closed down.   
“Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s government openly assaults peaceful protesters but tries those who defend them in secret. Its sham ‘trials’ are kept out of sight, to hide the absurd charges, avoid public witnesses and save itself profound embarrassment. The government pressures lawyers representing peaceful protesters not to speak, and information is sparse. Even so, one thing we can be certain of is that these seven human rights defenders are innocent of all charges, and we demand their immediate and unconditional release,” the organizations said.  
There are concerns that none of the Viasna staff members or volunteers will face a fair trial. Uladzimir Labkovich, for instance, was not given access to his lawyer for several days after his detention. There are also concerns about the detention conditions, as the majority of human rights defenders have not been allowed any phone calls or visits from family members and their correspondence is often blocked.  
The joint campaign #FreeViasna, demanding the immediate release of the Viasna seven, calls on the Belarusian authorities to:  
Background  
Founded in 1996, Viasna is a leading human rights group in Belarus and has been actively monitoring and documenting human rights violations following the August 2020 disputed presidential elections. Viasna has faced harassment and interference from the Belarusian authorities throughout its existence. In 2003, the authorities deregistered the organization, and despite numerous attempts to re-register, Viasna has been forced to continue its work without official registration. In 2011, the Chair, Ales Bialiatski, was sentenced to four and a half years in prison on tax evasion charges and served almost three years of his sentence before being released in an amnesty in 2014.

The 48th regular session of the Human Rights Council (HRC) begins today in Geneva. Amnesty International is joining more than 1,100 civil society and Indigenous peoples’ groups in calling on member states to adopt a resolution to formally recognize the right to a healthy environment. Member states should also establish a new mandate for a UN Special Procedure on human rights and climate change.  
“The dramatic impacts of climate change have exposed, with devastating clarity, how integral a healthy environment is to the enjoyment of all our other rights. It’s easy to take our planet for granted until we see the human cost of its degradation: hunger, displacement, unemployment, homelessness, illness and deaths,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International.   
“Governments’ failure to act on climate change in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence may well be the biggest inter-generational human rights violation in history. As the primary global human rights body, the HRC must use all the tools at its disposal to counter the crisis. We call on all states to support recognition of the right to a healthy environment, at the UN and at national level. Those who do not will be on the wrong side of history and standing against the common future of humanity.”    
A crucial human right  
The right to a healthy environment is legally recognized in more than 80% of UN member states through constitutions, legislation, court decisions and regional treaties. In the view of many it is also implicitly contained in global human rights treaties, though it has not been explicitly recognized by states through the United Nations. A wide range of UN entities and other intergovernmental bodies, as well as NGOs, trade unions and business groups, have voiced their support for global recognition of the right to a healthy environment.   
UN recognition would make clear that states have an obligation to protect, respect and fulfil this right.  It would encourage the states who do not yet recognize this right in their national laws to do so, and motivate others to strengthen their legislation. It would also support the critical work of environmental human rights defenders, buttressing the legitimacy of their efforts and putting more pressure on states to protect them from threats and attack.   
Along with the creation of a Special Procedure on Climate Change and Human Rights, formal recognition would also make it easier for the UN to support states in improving their performance on environmental issues. Currently, UN human rights bodies’ involvement in environmental issues depends on the link between environmental impacts and other rights – for example, they could look at whether the right to adequate housing has been violated through deforestation, or whether the right to health is threatened by failure to tackle air pollution. A universally recognized right to a healthy environment would make it more straightforward for UN human rights bodies to examine states’ compliance with their human rights obligations related to the environment, and to provide support and assistance to states in promoting such compliance.  
Research demonstrates that state-level recognition of the right to a healthy environment contributes to improved environmental outcomes, including cleaner air, enhanced access to safe drinking water, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. It also empowers communities to defend their rights in the face of adverse environmental impacts linked to state and corporate responsibility.  
“As the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment has pointed out, when the UN adopted resolutions recognizing the human rights to water and sanitation in 2010, it spurred many states to include these rights in their national legislation. It also mobilized billions of dollars in increased investment in water infrastructure, dramatically improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people,” said Agnès Callamard.  
“Recognizing the right to a healthy environment could spur similar transformative change in state approaches to climate change. We call on all HRC member states to seize this opportunity to scale up the HRC’s work on the climate crisis – one of the most daunting and urgent human rights challenges in history.”

Present in the country since 2002, UNAMA’s responsibilities include a pivotal role in monitoring the country’s human rights situation and providing oversight through the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).   
“The Taliban takeover poses grave risks to vulnerable groups, especially journalists, ethnic minorities, women and girls, and those who worked with the former government, foreign states, and contractors,” said Lawrence Moss, Senior Advocate for Amnesty International at the UN.  
“It is essential that UN human rights monitors remain on the ground and show support for the rights of Afghans at this perilous time.”  
In a resolution adopted on 30 August, the UNSC called on the Taliban to:  
“To enforce its own expectations, the Security Council urgently needs the immediate monitoring and reporting function provided by the very mission it established,” said Lawrence Moss. “UNAMA should brief the Council at least monthly on the human rights situation in Afghanistan.”  
Amnesty International further calls on the United Nations to supply the additional staff and resources necessary for UNAMA to amplify its human rights monitoring. UNAMA’s international human rights staff are now out of the country, primarily in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the work of its domestic human rights staff is greatly limited by fear of reprisals.  The UN has allowed humanitarian and political staff to remain in Afghanistan, but not its human rights monitors.    
“The UN should show support for the people of Afghanistan by returning international human rights monitors to the country, subject to the same security protocols as for humanitarian staff, and the UNSC should demand the Taliban respect the work of the UN’s domestic human rights staff and refrain from any reprisals,” said Lawrence Moss.  
Panjshir Valley reports underscore need for human rights monitoring  
Alarming reports are emerging from the Panjshir Valley, where fighting between the Taliban and resistance fighters is ongoing. BBC Persian has shared a video which claims to show a wilful killing in the area, while the BBC has further reported that the Taliban have killed civilians. According to sources interviewed by Amnesty International on Sunday 12 September, the Taliban have also been blockading food and essential supplies from entering the region.  
“An increasingly dire picture is emerging from the Panjshir Valley. This deeply disturbing footage and reports of other human rights abuses in the region underscore the immediate need for the international community to guarantee effective oversight of what’s happening in Afghanistan,” said Lawrence Moss.   
Background  
UNAMA’s mandate is reviewed on an annual basis by the UN Security Council – for further information, see here. For further information about its human rights work, see here.  
Amnesty International is also calling on the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to establish a complementary Fact-Finding Mission or similar independent investigative mechanism for Afghanistan. A special session of the UNHRC in Geneva in August failed to authorize such a mechanism, and Amnesty International has joined more than 50 national, regional, and international organizations to urge UN member states to do so at its 48th regular session, which runs from 13 September – 8 October 2021.

Ernest Johnson faces execution on 5 October 2021. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995 for the 1994 murders of three employees of a convenience store in Missouri. A jury sentenced him to death despite a claim of intellectual disability in violation of international law. Johnson had surgery in 2008 to remove a brain tumour, which has left him with seizures. Medical expert testified that the lethal injection drugs may trigger violent and painful seizures. State and federal courts have denied his claims for relief.

Additional Information 
Ernest Lee Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death in 1995 for the 1994 murders of Mary Bratcher, age 46; Fred Jones, age 58, and Mabel Scruggs, age 57, in a convenience store in Columbia, Missouri, where the three worked. 
In 1998, the Missouri Supreme Court ordered a new sentencing due to the lawyer’s failure to present the testimony of a psychiatrist who had examined Ernest Johnson. The Court said it was “left with the definite and firm impression” that his testimony “would have altered the jurors’ deliberations” and may have resulted in a vote for life imprisonment. 
In 2002, the US Supreme Court ruled in Atkins v. Virginia that the execution of people with intellectual disability contravened a national consensus and was unconstitutional. The Atkins ruling pointed to clinical definitions of “mental retardation” as a disability, manifested before the age of 18, characterized by significantly sub-average intellectual functioning, and with limitations in two or more adaptive skill areas. It left it to states to develop “appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction”, resulting in a degree of inconsistent application across the country. At his third resentencing hearing in 2006 following Atkins, the judge instructed the jurors that if they unanimously found “by a preponderance of the evidence” that Ernest Johnson had an intellectual disability, then they would have to return a verdict for life imprisonment without parole. The defence objected to this instruction, arguing that it should have been the prosecution’s burden to prove Ernest Johnson did not have an intellectual disability. In addition to the evidence of his intellectual disability, Ernest Johnson has been diagnosed with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the most serious condition on the group of conditions known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs). According to Ernest Johnson’s lawyers, his mother abused alcohol and drugs from around the age of 10, and by the time she was pregnant with Ernest at the age of 18 she was reported to be drinking large quantities of gin and whisky, as well as taking sedatives. Ernest Johnson’s half-brother was diagnosed with an intellectual disability and his mother likely had one as well. In their June 2021 briefing, the defence team highlighted studies that found an increased risk of diagnosis due to a close familial history of intellectual disability. 
Around 2008, it was discovered that Ernest Johnson had a meningioma brain tumour. He underwent surgery on 28 August 2008 to remove part of the tumour (it could not be removed in its entirety). Since the surgery, Ernest Johnson has suffered from seizures and has been prescribed anti-seizure medication. Prior to his 2015 scheduled execution, his lawyer filed a complaint in federal court seeking an injunction against the execution, arguing that his lethal injection could cause him to have violent seizures which would render his execution unconstitutional. In an affidavit signed on 22 October 2015, filed with the complaint, an expert in anaesthesiology and surgery stated that “…a substantial risk of serious harm will occur during his execution as a result of a violent seizure that may be induced by Pentobarbital injection. Generalized seizures, such as the one that would occur in Mr Johnson, are severely painful. Pentobarbital is a drug in the barbiturate class… Pharmacologically, barbiturates like Pentobarbital are known to actually exaggerate pain. That is, they make pain worse… I am of the medical opinion that Mr Johnson faces a significant risk for a serious seizure as the direct result of the combination of the Missouri lethal injection protocol and Mr Johnson’s permanent and disabling neurologic disease”. The US Supreme Court halted his 2015 execution to allow the appeals around this issue to continue. In April 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rejected his appeal for an alternate method of execution, nitrogen-induced hypoxia, after the US Supreme Court rejected a similar claim from Missouri when it found that nitrogen was not tried or tested. The Eighth Circuit noted Ernest Johnson had established a risk of pain. 
His execution was scheduled for 5 October 2021. On 21 June 2021, Ernest Lee Johnson sought relief from the Missouri Supreme Court on the basis that he never received a reliable determination on his intellectual disability; that jury instructions during his resentencing unconstitutionally required that all jurors believe his intellectual disability – one juror could overrule the other eleven; and that the lethal injection protocols may cause extreme pain due to his seizures. On 31 August, the Missouri Supreme Court denied his request. 
Amnesty International opposes the sentence in all circumstances as a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

As we head into the final stretch of the election, Canadians are faced with an important question: what kind of society do we want?  
Canada continues its steep climb out of a pandemic that has particularly affected Black, immigrant and low-income women working on the frontlines of Covid-19. Refugee claimants are facing more difficulties as the Canada-US border remains closed to asylum-seekers. Indigenous communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by the violence of colonialism, non-respect of treaties, persisting inequalities in access to water, healthcare and education, in addition to the climate crisis, facing raging wildfires, flooding, and food shortages. .   
The pandemic has also shown us that we can do things differently. Canada released a significant number of immigration detainees to help reduce the spread of Covid-19, proving that alternatives to detention are possible. Migrant workers on the frontlines of the pandemic are courageously speaking out to demand the protections they deserve.   
It has never been more urgent to centre human rights and build a future based on justice and dignity for everyone in Canada.   
That’s why between now and the election, we encourage you to contact the candidates in your riding. Ask them how their parties will support human rights. We will send you some quick actions to help you reach candidates, focused on three urgent human rights issues: Indigenous rights, climate justice, and immigration detention.

Talalelei Pauga is a vocal critic of the Samoan government’s policies, known for protesting the former Samoan Prime Minister’s 2018 visit to Australia by presenting him with a pig’s head. Pauga is an Australian citizen with dual Samoan nationality. He is subject to an extradition request from the former Samoan Prime Minister, Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, over an alleged plot to assassinate him. Because of his vocal opposition to the former Samoan Prime Minister, Amnesty International believes the charges against Pauga are politically motivated and without merit and that he may not receive a fair trial if extradited. 
Under Australia’s extradition laws with Samoa, minimal evidence is required for the Australian government to act on the extradition request from Samoa. As a result, Pauga has been detained in Australia since August 2020 without knowing the evidence against him. This raises serious concerns about arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial.

Additional Information 
Talalelei Pauga is a former Australian public servant who has been an Australian citizen for over twenty years. He is currently appealing the extradition proceedings through the Federal Court of Australia, with his trial before the Federal Court of Australia listed on 14 March 2022. Pauga was arrested and detained in August 2020 in Australia. 
In late 2018, when the then Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi (Tuilaepa) visited Brisbane, a city in Australia, Pauga verbally protested political corruption committed by the foreign leader and presented him with a pig’s head, a Samoan cultural slur. In 2019, Pauga and the co-accused Lemai Sione and Malele Paulo, were all charged with conspiracy to murder. The accused had all been vocal opponents of the Samoan government and Tuilaepa. 
Under the Australian Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) a person is only required to have been charged with an extradition offence to get extradited. That is: an offence recognised in both countries that carries a penalty of at least 12 months. This means that there is almost no evidentiary burden to overcome in requests of extradition and as such concerningly little evidence has been presented as to the charges Pauga is facing. The right to a fair trial includes the right to know what evidence is being presented in order to appropriately prepare a defence case with lawyers.

Saiful Mahdi, a university lecturer at the Syiah Kuala University in Aceh Province, was sentenced for defamation to three months in prison and a fine of Rp 10 million (approximately USD $690) for writing in a WhatsApp group chat a message criticizing the university’s hiring process of the candidates of civil servants. On 2 September 2021, he was escorted by the prosecutors to serve his prison sentence after the Indonesian Supreme Court rejected his cassation appeal. Amnesty International is calling on the President to grant Saiful Mahdi an amnesty, as he has been jailed solely for peacefully expressing his opinion.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:   
In March 2019, Saiful Mahdi, a statistics lecturer at the faculty of math and science at Syiah Kuala University in Aceh Province, sent a message criticizing the result of a civil servant test for engineering faculty lecturers in a WhatsApp chat group. Among his messages, he stated, “I have received sad news about the death of common sense in the leadership ranks of the engineering faculty during the last civil servant test,” and “Why is a faculty that was once so glorious now so faint-hearted?” He wrote the message in response to a civil servant test held in late 2018 as a recruitment for lecturers at the university’s faculty of engineering. After the test, Saiful Mahdi heard a suspicion of irregularities in the selection process from a lecturer at the engineering faculty, who had worked there for two years and joined the test to obtain his civil servant status. He informed Saiful Mahdi that a test taker who reportedly did not meet administrative criteria had been able to join the selection process and later passed the test, while he himself was declared fail despite having scored the highest among other test takers during a competency test.  
Saiful Mahdi, who had worked at the university for 25 years, analysed the scores of the test takers from the faculty of engineering and later concluded that there were irregularities in the scoring that should be reviewed. He later posted his criticism towards the selection process in the WhatsApp group, which comprised around 100 lecturers. His message circulated among the university’s employees and eventually reached the engineering faculty’s dean, who was not part of the chat group.  
The dean reported Saiful Mahdi to the university’s senate, which later summoned him for clarification on 18 March 2019. After clarifying the issue, the senate sent a letter to Saiful Mahdi on 6 May 2019 asking him to write an apology letter to the leadership ranks of the engineering faculty and stating that he had violated the ethics code by making the statement. Saiful Mahdi, however, refused to do so and argued against the senate’s decision since he had never been examined in an ethics hearing for the case.  
On 4 July 2019, Saiful Mahdi was summoned by the Banda Aceh Police as a witness in a defamation case reported by the engineering faculty’s dean. Following an investigation, he was named suspect and charged under Article 27 (3) of the Information and Electronic Transactions (ITE) Law for allegedly defaming the dean, even though Saiful Mahdi never mentioned any names in his WhatsApp message. The case was brought to trial, and on 21 April 2020 the Banda Aceh District Court sentenced him to three months in prison and a fine of Rp 10 million despite no clear evidence proving he had violated the law. He later filed an appeal against the verdict to the Banda Aceh High Court, but it was rejected. On 29 June 2021, the Supreme Court rejected the cassation plea submitted by Saiful Mahdi and upheld the lower court’s guilty verdict.  
On 2 September 2021, prosecutors escorted Saiful Mahdi to start serving his prison sentence in Banda Aceh’s Class II A Penitentiary. On the same day, his lawyers sent an official letter to President Joko Widodo to ask him to grant Saiful Mahdi a Presidential amnesty. Under Indonesian law, the President can only grant an amnesty after seeking consideration from the advice of the House of Representatives. The ITE Law, including Article 27 which contains an anti-defamation provision, has increasingly been used to criminalize people who peacefully exercise their right to freedom of expression using electronic means, such as writing messages in messenger platforms or sharing opinions in social media. The Indonesian authorities have also misused the draconian articles in the ITE Law to criminalize peaceful activists, journalists, and human right defenders who criticize the government.   
From January to June 2021 alone, Amnesty International recorded at least 39 individuals named suspects by the police for allegedly violating the ITE Law.

32 Afghans are stuck at the Polish-Belarus border following pushbacks by Polish authorities to Belarus in August. They have been stranded for weeks without adequate shelter, food, water and medical care. Polish and Belarusian border guards have kept them in a strip of land at the border, limiting their access to lawyers, humanitarian, and healthcare workers. While the European Court of Human Rights has ordered Poland to provide the group with food, water, clothing and adequate medical health care, Polish authorities have so far failed to comply with this request. Instead of denying asylum-seekers entry and pushing them back to Belarus, Poland must immediately admit them into its territory, allow them to seek protection and urgently provide them with adequate shelter, food, water and medical care. 
Write to the Prime Minister urging him to: 
· immediately admit the group of asylum-seekers into Poland 
· ensure they can apply for international protection, and urgently provide them with adequate food, water, shelter, and medical assistance. 
· ensure unhindered access to the group by organizations and lawyers 
· grant asylum-seekers effective opportunities to seek protection in Poland and refrain from adopting legislation and measures that breach international and EU law.

Additional Information: 
32 asylum-seekers from Afghanistan have been stranded at the Poland Belarus border for weeks, with limited access to water, food, adequate shelter, and medical care. Belarus and Polish border guards have 
kept them in a strip of land on the border, in Usnarz Górny, following their pushback from Poland. Among them, there are 27 men, four women and one 15-year-old girl. 
Initially, lawyers, organizations, humanitarians, and activists were given access to the group. On 20 August, the asylum-seekers filled in applications for international protection. Lawyers from the Warsaw Bar attempted to assist with the submission of the applications of all 32 Afghans. However, Polish border guards did not allow them to access the territory of Poland. Since 21 August, activists and several members of parliament have been denied regular access to the group and the border guards prevented them from providing humanitarian assistance. On 1 September, the Belarusian Red Cross, in cooperation with the Polish Red Cross, provided humanitarian assistance to the group. 
On 24 August, an Amnesty International delegation visited the area and tried to get access to the group of asylum-seekers, but the border guards did not permit it. Amnesty International obtained credible and consistent reports from other sources about the use of force and threats of violence by Polish border guards when pushing the group back to Belarus. 
On 25 August, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) issued interim measures and requested Polish authorities to provide the group with food, water, clothing, adequate medical care and, if possible, temporary shelter. By the time of writing, on 2 September, the Polish authorities have failed to fully comply with this order. 
In response to the statements of the President of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, that he would not stop people crossing the Poland-Belarus border, Polish authorities have rushed to adopt a battery of measures that curtail the right to seek asylum. On 20 August, Poland’s Ministry of Interior issued an order to close its borders to persons entering the country “irregularly” and obliging them to immediately leave the territory of Poland. In August, the Polish government announced changes in two pieces of legislation- the Law on Foreigners and the Law on granting international protection to Foreigners. These changes would make it impossible for people crossing the border irregularly to seek international protection in Poland. On 25 August, soldiers of Poland’s army started building a fence on the border with Belarus. On 31 August, the Polish government requested the President of Poland to declare a state of emergency for 30 days in the regions bordering Belarus, on the grounds of risks posed by the “3,000 attempted border crossings in August”. The declaration of the state of emergency would entail a ban on assemblies, protests, mass events, and cultural events, among others. Amnesty International fears the state of emergency could have a disproportionate impact on human rights and enable further restrictions of the legitimate and vital activities of organizations, journalists, and humanitarian workers, including preventing them from monitoring human rights violations at the border or providing humanitarian assistance to asylum-seekers. 
Pushbacks are unlawful under national, international and European law. Article 4 of Protocol no. 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights, to which Poland is a signatory, prohibits collective expulsions. Under EU and international refugee law, Poland must ensure access to territory to those seeking protection and ensure they have access to a fair and effective asylum procedure, in which their individual circumstances and protection needs can be assessed. Article 31 of the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees also obliges states to refrain from punishing asylum-seekers for irregular entry.

She has been unjustly jailed for nearly 12 years.    
Prisoner of conscience Maryam Akbari Monfared has been unjustly jailed for nearly 12 years solely because of her association and correspondence with her relatives abroad, who are members of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran. On 10 March 2021, she was suddenly transferred from Evin prison in Tehran to a distant prison in Semnan province 200km away from her family, in breach of both international and Iranian law requiring prisoners to be held, to the extent possible, in prisons close to their homes. Prosecution and prison officials have refused to provide any justification to her family or explain who ordered the transfer. To further punish Maryam Akbari Monfared, the authorities have denied her family visits since June 2021, and only allowed her to speak to her family on the phone for several minutes every day in the presence of an intelligence official.  
Her transfer came after open letters from inside prison seeking truth and justice for the victims of the mass enforced disappearances and secret extrajudicial executions of 1988 who include her siblings. For years, ministry of intelligence officials have threatened to subject her to internal “exile” or to impose an additional prison term on her if she continues to speak out against the authorities’ crimes under international law and human rights violations as she recently did in an open letter in July 2021 addressing the unlawful killings of protesters in November 2019 and July 2021.  
Conditions in Semnan prison are cruel and inhumane. Prisoners have reported that for the past several months, the flushing system of the toilets has not worked, resulting in filthy floors and foul odours and putting prisoners in danger of disease. They have also said that reduced access to shower facilities, inadequate provision of shampoo and sanitary products, and the use of shared slippers are leading to the spread of infections and lice infestation. Those infected are denied adequate medical treatment. The  
spread of Covid-19 also remains a serious concern as the authorities are failing to isolate new arrivals and provide prisoners with disinfectant products and masks.

Salutation:   Dear Mr Mohseni Ejei  
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  
The punitive transfer of Maryam Akbari Monfared to Semnan prison is part of a broader distressing trend, documented by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, which has involved “the transfer of human rights defenders to distant prisons far from their families as a punishment.” In his 16 July 2021 report, the Special Rapporteur noted with concern that human rights defenders “Sepideh Qoliyan and Atena Daemi were transferred from the women’s ward in Evin Prison to remote prisons in Bushehr and Gilan Provinces on 10 and 16 March 2020, respectively… Golrokh Iraee was transferred from Qarchak Prison to Amol prison on 24 January 2021.”   
Maryam Akbari Monfared has been imprisoned since December 2009 and has served 12 of her 15- year prison sentence for “enmity against God” (moharebeh) imposed solely because she had made phone calls to her relatives, who are members of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), and had visited them once in Iraq. The PMOI is a banned opposition group outside Iran that advocates the overthrow of the Islamic Republic system. Her conviction and sentence were issued by Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran in May 2010 after a grossly unfair trial which, according to an informed source, lasted less than 15 minutes. She was held in solitary confinement for 43 days after her arbitrary arrest on 19 December 2009 and subsequently subjected to enforced disappearance for five months. She was denied access to a lawyer during the investigation stage and met her state-appointed lawyer for the first time at her trial. Her husband has said that during her trial session, the judge told her she was “paying” for the activities of her relatives with the POMI. Branch 33 of the Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in August 2010. Maryam Akbari   
Monfared’s subsequent requests for retrial were denied.  
Maryam Akbari Monfared submitted a complaint to the office of the prosecutor in Tehran from inside prison on 14 October 2016. The complaint concerns the extrajudicial execution and enforced disappearance in 1988 of her sister Roghayeh Akbari Monfared and her brother Abdolreza Akbari Monfared, who was 17 years old at the time of his arrest in 1980. In her complaint, she requested “an official investigation into the extrajudicial execution of her siblings” and sought “detailed information about the executions including the location of the mass graves, and the identity of the perpetrators.” To date, the authorities have not processed her complaint. Instead, they have subjected her to reprisals.  
In its 2018 report Blood-soaked secrets: Why Iran’s 1988 prison massacres are ongoing crimes against humanity, Amnesty International concluded that, in addition to committing the crime against humanity of murder in 1988 by extrajudicially executing thousands of political dissidents in secret, the Iranian authorities are committing the ongoing crimes against humanity of enforced disappearance, persecution, torture and other inhumane acts, including by systematically concealing the fate of the victims and the whereabouts of their remains. A group of UN experts also stated in a September 2020 communication that past and ongoing violations related to prison massacres in 1988 “may amount to crimes against humanity” and stated that should Iran “continue to refuse to uphold its obligations under international law, we call on the international community to take action … through the establishment of an international investigation.”  
The rise to presidency of Ebrahim Raisi who must be investigated for past and ongoing crimes against humanity related to the mass enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions of 1988 is a grim manifestation of the systemic impunity that prevails in the country. Amnesty International has called on the UN Human Rights Council to take concrete steps to address the crisis of impunity in Iran including by establishing an impartial and independent mechanism, complementary to the work of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, to collect, consolidate, preserve, and analyze evidence of the most serious crimes under international law committed in Iran, in a manner that meets general standards of admissibility in criminal proceedings, in order to facilitate future fair and independent criminal proceedings.

“The Taliban have repeatedly insisted that they will respect human rights, yet these claims are completely at odds with what we are currently seeing and hearing in cities across the country. 
“Afghans who have taken to the streets, understandably fearful about the future, are being met with intimidation, harassment, and violence – particularly directed at women. Multiple journalists attempting to cover the protests have reported being detained, beaten up and having their equipment confiscated. 
“There have already been reports of casualties, and the risk of a major incident is extremely high. We urge the Taliban to de-escalate the tension and allow people to exercise their fundamental right to gather peacefully and protest. 
“Journalists must also be permitted to report on the protests without fear of violence. For its part, in ongoing negotiations with the Taliban, the international community must use all leverage to demand that these basic rights are protected.” 
Background 
According to media reports, peaceful protests in Kabul, Badakhshan and Herat over the past two days have been dispersed by Taliban fighters firing rifles into the air, while some female protesters have reportedly been lashed with cables. 
Amnesty International has independently verified videos of Taliban fighters firing guns into the air to disperse protests in Kabul, and also verified videos of violence against women protesters between 4 and 7 September in Kabul committed by the Taliban. 
Journalists and cameramen from Afghan media outlets Ariana, Tolo and Etilaat-e- Roz have said that they were beaten up and detained by Taliban fighters while trying to cover protests, before having their equipment confiscated or their footage destroyed.

We will assess new and better ways to continue our efforts to ensure the release of the defenders.  
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Eight members of the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Assets (CMDBCP), also known as defenders of the Guapinol river, will continue in pre-trial prison in Yoro (North Honduras). The defenders have been imprisoned for two years for standing up in defense of protected water sources in danger by a mining project, despite the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention declaring their detention as arbitrary and asking for their immediate release. UN human rights experts also recommended all states to consider alternatives to imprisonment to reduce risks of spreading COVID-19, particularly for persons in pretrial detention or detained without legal basis. Amnesty International has urged Honduran authorities to review the preventive detention of all eight defenders and take all necessary measures to immediately release them.  
On 29 July 2021, the Attorney General Office of Honduras requested the Criminal Chamber Supreme Court to extend the pre-trial detention for six months, since the legal duration of this preventive measure is two years, and the trial had not yet been scheduled. Around the second anniversary of their imprisonment, which took place on 26 August, the Supreme Court decided to in favour of the extension. On the other hand, the Sentencing Court in Trujillo schedule the trial for the beginning of December 2021.   
While we have not achieved the main goal of their release, we believe that the public campaign on behalf of the defenders of the Guapinol river, including appeals sent by Amnesty International members, contributed to bringing attention to the case. Amnesty International will continue monitoring the situation and will be ready to further campaign for the release of the defenders.

We are deeply disturbed by the escalating humanitarian crisis unfolding in Afghanistan. As a beacon of freedom, rule of law, and human rights, we are writing to urge Canada to recognize the moral imperative to resettle more Afghans, provide immediate and further humanitarian aid, engage in proactive diplomacy in support of international humanitarian law, and preserve the rights of girls, women, and ethnic and religious minorities. 
In the aftermath of an abrupt withdrawal of US and NATO troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban have invaded the country. The progress that Canada has helped make in Afghanistan through funding and military support is jeopardized by Taliban rule. Girls and women are at risk of forced marriage and being banned from studying and working. Some groups are disproportionately vulnerable at the hands of the Taliban, such as the Hazara community, Afghan Hindus, and Afghan Sikhs. These groups have historically and currently face systematic discrimination, repeated targeted violence, and resulting displacement. Over 35 million Afghan people are at the heart of a humanitarian catastrophe. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, there are 389,645 and counting Afghans who are internally displaced, and thousands more fleeing to neighbouring countries. This is in addition to 2.7 million Afghans already registered as refugees. 
We are grateful to the Canadian government for their rapid response and commendable measures to support Afghans to date. This includes a special immigration program for those who were integral to Canada’s efforts in Afghanistan. On August 13, 2021, the government announced that Canada will expedite the resettlement of 20,000 vulnerable Afghans who were already eligible for resettlement. While the current measures are a positive first step, we believe that Canada can, and should do more. Some of us and our parents have been resettled to Canada as refugees over the past three decades. There are others like us who are still seeking safety and a future for themselves and their families; who need Canada’s advocacy and voice at this crucial moment in the world’s history. 
We urge you to meet the following demands: 
The full scale crisis occurring in Afghanistan is a humanitarian emergency that requires an exceptional and time-sensitive response. The Taliban cannot be trusted to respect human rights and the rule of law. We appreciate that Canada is a global champion in promoting peace, development, and human rights around the world. Canada can make an impact right now. All that is needed is the willpower. We are counting on your support.

In a new report, “You’re going to your death”, the organization documented a catalogue of horrific violations committed by Syrian intelligence officers against 66 returnees, including 13 children.

With a number of states – including Denmark, Sweden and Turkey – restricting protection and putting pressure on refugees from Syria to go home, the harrowing testimony in Amnesty International’s report is proof that no part of Syria is safe to return to. Returnees told Amnesty International that intelligence officers explicitly targeted them for their decision to flee Syria, accusing them of disloyalty or “terrorism.”    
“Military hostilities may have subsided, but the Syrian government’s propensity for egregious human rights violations has not. The torture, enforced disappearances, and arbitrary or unlawful detention which forced many Syrians to seek asylum abroad are as rife as ever in Syria today. What’s more, the very fact of having fled Syria is enough to put returnees at risk of being targeted by authorities,” said Marie Forestier, Researcher on Refugee and Migrants Rights at Amnesty International.  
“Any government claiming Syria is now safe is wilfully ignoring the horrific reality on the ground, leaving refugees once again fearing for their lives. We are urging European governments to grant refugee status to people from Syria, and immediately halt any practice directly or indirectly forcing people to return to Syria. The governments of Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan must protect Syrian refugees from deportation or any other forcible return, in line with their international obligations.”   
Amnesty International’s report documents serious human rights violations committed by the Syrian government against refugees who returned to Syria from Lebanon, Rukban (an informal settlement between the Jordanian and Syrian borders), France, Germany, Turkey, Jordan and UAE, between mid-2017 and spring 2021, based on interviews with 41 Syrians, including returnees and their relatives and friends, as well as lawyers, humanitarian workers and Syria experts.   
The authorities have targeted returnees to Syria, accusing those who fled the country of treason or supporting “terrorism”. Amnesty documented 24 cases where men, women and children were targeted as a direct result of these perceptions, and subjected to human rights violations including rape or other forms of sexual violence, arbitrary or unlawful detention, and torture or other ill-treatment. In some cases returnees were targeted simply because they came from parts of Syria that had been under opposition control. 
For example, security members arrested Karim* four days after he returned from Lebanon to his village in Homs province. Karim recounted one interrogation which took place during his six-and-a-half months of detention:   
“[An officer] said: ’You came to ruin the country and complete what you started before you left.’ I said that I was coming to my home country, to my village[…]They [security officials] told me that I’m a terrorist because I’m from [a renowned pro-opposition village].    
Karim told Amnesty International that he was tortured during detention:  
“After I was released, I couldn’t see anyone who visited me for five months. I was too scared to speak to anyone. I had nightmares, hallucinations. I was talking during my sleep. I used to wake up crying and scared. I’m disabled because the nerves of my right hand are damaged due to [torture]. Some of the discs of my back are also damaged.”   
The punishments for those who fall under government suspicion are brutal. Amnesty International documented 14 cases of sexual violence committed by security forces, including seven cases of rape, committed against five women, a teenage boy and a five-year-old girl. Sexual violence took place at border crossings or in detention centres, during questioning. Testimonies are consistent with well-documented patterns of sexual violence and rape committed against civilians and detainees during the conflict by pro-government forces.   
When Noor* returned from Lebanon she was stopped at the border by a security officer who said: 
“Why did you leave Syria? Because you don’t like Bashar al-Assad and you don’t like Syria? You’re a terrorist … Syria is not a hotel that you leave and return to when you want.” 
The officer subsequently raped Noor and her five-year old daughter in a small room used for interrogation at the border crossing. 
Yasmin* returned from Lebanon with her teenage son and three-year old daughter. Security forces arrested them immediately at the border crossing and accused Yasmin of spying for a foreign country. Yasmin and her children were transferred to an intelligence detention centre, where they were detained for 29 hours. Intelligence officers raped Yasmin, and took her son to another room where they raped him with an object.  
The officer who raped Yasmin said: 
“This is to welcome you to your country. If you get out of Syria again and come back again, we will welcome you in a bigger way. We are trying to humiliate you and your son. You will not forget [this] humiliation in all your life.”  
Some families chose for women to return to Syria ahead of their husbands, assuming they would be less likely to be arrested than men – partly because women are not subject to compulsory military service. 
However, Amnesty International documented the arbitrary or unlawful detention of 13 women, some of whom were interrogated about their male relatives, and of ten children, aged between three weeks old and 16 years old, who were arrested along with their mothers. Security forces subjected five children to torture and other-ill treatment. Women are as much at risk as men when they return to Syria, and should therefore be granted the same level of protection.  
In total, Amnesty International documented 59 cases of men, women and children who were arbitrarily detained after returning to Syria, most frequently following broad accusations of “terrorism”. In 33 cases, returnees were subjected to torture or other ill-treatment during detention or interrogation. Intelligence officers used torture to coerce detainees into confessing to alleged crimes, to punish them for allegedly committing crimes, or to punish them for alleged opposition to the government. 
Yasin* was arrested at a checkpoint just after he crossed the border with Lebanon, and spent four months in prison.   
He said: “I don’t know how much time I spent being tortured in this room[…] Sometimes, when [an agent] hit me, I counted every hit. Sometimes it reached 50 or 60 and I passed out. Once it reached 100.”   
Ismael*, who was detained in four different intelligence branches over three and a half months, said: 
“They electrocuted me between the eyes. I felt my whole brain was shaking[…] I wished I would die. I didn’t know if it was the morning or the night. I wasn’t able to stand on my feet anymore, even to go to interrogation. They had to hold me to take me there and bring me back.”  
Amnesty recorded 27 cases of enforced disappearance. In five cases, authorities eventually informed families that their disappeared relatives had died in custody; five were eventually released; the fate of the other 17 people remains unknown.  
Ola*, who returned from Lebanon with her brother in 2019, said security forces had arrested her brother at the border crossing. In the following weeks, they also visited Ola at her home and interrogated her about her reasons for leaving and returning to Syria. 
“They see us as terrorists because we left to Lebanon,” Ola said. 
Five months later, authorities informed Ola’s family that her brother had died in detention.  
Ibrahim* told Amnesty that his cousin, alongside his wife and their three young children, aged 2, 4 and 8 years old, had been arrested upon returning from France in 2019. At the time of writing, the family has been subjected to enforced disappearance for two years and eight months.  
Amnesty documented 27 cases where returnees were detained as a means of extortion, with families paying on average between 3 and 5 million Syrian pounds (the equivalent of USD 1,200 to USD 27,000) for the release of their relatives. 
The level of fighting in Syria has decreased significantly in the past three years, with the Syrian government now controlling more than 70% of the country. Against this backdrop, the Syrian authorities have publicly encouraged refugees to return home, while several host countries have begun to reconsider the protection they offer to people from Syria. In Lebanon and Turkey, where many refugees face dire living conditions and discrimination, governments have put increasing pressure on Syrians to return.  
In Europe, Denmark and Sweden have reassessed residency permits of asylum-seekers who come from regions they consider safe for return, including Damascus and the surrounding countryside. It is notable however, that a third of the cases documented in this report involve human rights violations that took place in Damascus or the Damascus area.   
Based on the findings in its report, Amnesty International concludes that no part of Syria is safe for returnees to go back to. In addition, people who have left Syria since the beginning of the conflict are at real risk of suffering persecution upon return, on account of perceptions about their political opinions or simply as punishment for having fled the country. 
“The Assad government has attempted to depict Syria as a country in recovery. The reality is that Syrian authorities are still perpetrating the widespread and systematic human rights violations that contributed to millions of people seeking safety abroad,” said Marie Forestier.  
“We call on Syrian authorities to ensure the protection of returnees and to end human rights violations against them, as well as ensuring the respect, protection and fulfilment of the human rights of all people in Syria. Countries hosting Syrian refugees must continue to provide refuge, and ensure ongoing protection from the Syrian government’s atrocities.”

Know Your Rights and Claim Them explains what child rights are,...","Angelina Jolie and Amnesty International have joined forces to create a resource for children and young people to learn about their rights, with the publication of a new book which empowers teenagers to speak out against injustice. 
Know Your Rights and Claim Them explains what child rights are, equips young people with the knowledge they need to protect themselves and others, and shows how governments are failing to uphold their commitment to child rights. It was written in collaboration with Professor Geraldine Van Bueren QC, one of the original drafters of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  
Angelina Jolie said: 
“If governments kept their word, and if all adults respected children’s rights, there would be no need for this book. Children have rights just as adults do and they should have the power and agency to claim them. 
“Know Your Rights and Claim Them is the book some adults don’t want children to read, as it will arm them with the knowledge to defend their rights and those of others. 
“Governments signed up to protect children’s rights in 1989, yet many of them are still failing to listen to the voices of children. In some countries, girls as young as nine are forced into marriage. Globally, more than 61 million children don’t attend primary schools and, in 2019, one in six children were living in extreme poverty – a number that rose significantly during the pandemic. It’s time to remind the world of its commitment to children’s rights.” 
The book is available in bookshops in the UK from today, and available for pre-order in USA, Australia, New Zealand and Greece. With other countries including South Korea, Denmark and Germany following close behind. The authors’ goal is for the book to be published in all languages and countries, empowering many millions of young people to know and claim their rights.  
The social and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic provide a stark reminder that many human rights issues have a disproportionate impact on young people and when it comes to issues that directly affect them, their voices are rarely heard or listened to. Know Your Rights and Claim Them aims to equip young people with the knowledge they need to stand up and have their say. 
The book sets out how the concept of children’s rights came into being through the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was designed to give children the right to a voice and to participate in all decisions that affect them. It also features how-to guides, along with the stories of a number of incredible young activists who are at the forefront of human rights change around the world. Whether campaigning on climate change, demanding access to education, or speaking out against racial discrimination and gun violence, these inspirational young people demonstrate the power of standing up for what we believe in. 
Khairiyah Rahmanyah, 19, was born to a fishing family that lives close to the sea in southern Thailand. The sea near her home is a rich source of seafood and home to endangered marine species, such as sea turtles and rare pink dolphins. In 2020, when she was 17, Khairiyah launched a campaign against the Thai government’s plan to develop her village, Chana, into an industrial estate. As a result, the government decided to postpone their decision. However, the project has not been dropped, and the fight for her community continues. 
“Words cannot explain how I feel to be part of this book,” said Khairiyah, who spent hours picketing, and travelled 1,000 kilometres to Government House in Bangkok to deliver a letter to the prime minister begging him to stop the development. 
“I am really proud to be representing the stories of my community. I was born into activism and I have been fighting to protect my community since I was little. It has been painful to live this reality and I want life to be different for the next generation. As children, we must be allowed to learn about our rights and it’s up to adults to encourage, empower and support us.” 
Children have a right to life, dignity and health; identity; equality and non-discrimination; a safe place to live; protection from harm; participation (including the right to be heard); bodily integrity; protection from armed violence; justice and liberty; privacy; minority and Indigenous rights; education; play; freedom of thought; and voice and peaceful protest.  
There are about 2.3 billion children in the world, nearly a third of the total human population. Given the devastating impact of the global pandemic on children and young people, it’s never been more crucial to arm them with the knowledge they deserve. This is their right – and it’s time for the world to listen and act.    
Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said: 
“We must all tackle the human rights issues of today, with an eye on the future, knowing we are accountable to the world of 2030. Not only must we ask ourselves – ‘how are our actions impacting the children of tomorrow?’ – we need to make sure that children are setting the agenda for the years to come. That can only happen if they know their rights and how to claim them. 
“When children don’t, they’re at risk of abuse, discrimination, and exploitation, often at the hands of adults. They’re also at risk of being overlooked, unable to participate in important decisions about the world they live in and the problems they will inherit. Amnesty International is campaigning to ensure children’s rights are a priority for governments across the world. 
“That’s why, alongside the book, we have launched an online human rights education course featuring young activists, which will serve as a powerful tool to empower young people and others to claim their rights across the world. When young people are educated about their rights, they are empowered to defend them, to stand up against injustice against themselves and others. Knowledge is key. We will all benefit from a world in which child rights are upheld.” 
Know Your Rights and Claim Them will be released in the UK on 2 September 2021, with publication in Australia, Greece, New Zealand and USA to follow in October. The book will be available online and from all good bookshops. Amnesty International’s online human rights education course will be available on the Human Rights Academy on 2 September.

Additional Information 
On 9 May 2021, a special police unit, Satgas Nemangkawi, arrested Victor Yeimo, a spokesman for the West Papua National Committee (Komite Nasional Papua Barat, KNPB) in Jayapura, the capital of Papua province. Police charged him with treason for a 2019 statement, made during anti-racism protests, calling for a referendum on independence. 
Mr Yeimo was arrested without a warrant at 7.15pm when he was at a kiosk in Jayapura. Mr Yeimo’s lawyers received arrest and detention warrants the following day at 6pm, a breach of Indonesian criminal procedure law which requires an arrest warrant to be presented at the time of arrest. 
On the first evening of his detention, Mr Yeimo was moved from Papua province’s regional police detention centre in Jayapura to the Police’s Mobile Brigade Headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Abepura, without his lawyers being notified. This move to Mako Brimob prison signified higher security and probable difficulties accessing Mr Yeimo. 
His case has been handed to the prosecutor and the first trial is scheduled to take place on 24 August 2021. We are concerned that Victor’s trial might be moved to other city just as the trial of the Balikpapan 7. If this happens, then the access of the lawyers and family will be more difficult. He should be released or, instead of keeping him in the Mako Brimob isolation cell, he should be moved to the state prison during trial. 
Mr Yeimo has been accused of violating the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP), namely Article 106 on treason, Article 110 of the KUHP on treason with conspiracy. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  
The Indonesian authorities have used these criminal code provisions, mainly Articles 106 and 110 KUHP, to prosecute several peaceful pro-independence political activists in Papua simply for peacefully exercising their human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
Amnesty International does not take any position on the political status of any province or region in Indonesia, or any other state, including calls for independence. However, the organization believes that the right to freedom of expression, including the right to advocate for self-determination or other political issues, carried out in a peaceful manner, must be respected and protected.

Meanwhile,...","The Taliban and the international community must urgently reach an agreement to extend the 31 August deadline for completing evacuations out of Afghanistan, Amnesty International said today, to help protect thousands of Afghans who are increasingly at risk of violent reprisal attacks. 
Meanwhile, President Joe Biden has said the U.S. is on track to pull its troops out of Afghanistan in five days, and Canada stopped evacuating Canadian nationals and Afghan refugees as of today, despite calls to delay the withdrawal following reports of escalating Taliban threats to human rights defenders, women and girls, ethnic and religious minorities, lawmakers and journalists. 
In a recent on-the-ground investigation, Amnesty International researchers revealed that nine Hazara men were tortured and killed last month by the Taliban in Ghazni province. 
“Amnesty International is all too aware of how terrifying the experience is for all those desperately trying to flee to safety, by air and across land borders,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Every effort must now be made to safely evacuate Afghans who fear revenge attacks by the Taliban and have to leave the country. To fail them would be an unforgivable betrayal. 
“The international community must extend the deadline for evacuations and ensure those wishing to leave Afghanistan can do so safely. This means ensuring people are able to board flights and suspending visa requirements for the most at-risk individuals. This is all the more urgent as information about abuses, targeted abductions and killings by the Taliban continues to emerge.” 
Thousands of Afghans are still arriving at Hamid Karzai International Airport, desperately trying to board evacuation flights. Many must run the gauntlet of Taliban check points to reach the gates. As many as 20 people have been killed trying to enter the airport, either due to gunshot injuries as US military and Taliban shoot in the air to control the crowd, or crushed as the crowd surges to enter the airport. 
The Taliban this week stated that it will not agree to an extension and does not want Afghans to leave the country, increasing fears that they will not live up to their promises to uphold and guarantee international human rights law. 
Mounting persecution, killings and abuses 
Mounting reports of human rights abuses have raised fears about what Taliban rule may bring. 
As of 25 August, reports have emerged of the Taliban conducting door-to-door searches in Kabul for human rights defenders and journalists. One report suggests the Taliban shot dead a family member and injured another when they could not locate the journalist they were searching for. 
In the first week of their takeover of the capital Kabul, the Taliban publicly assured women and the international community that women’s rights would be protected according to Sharia law, but within days they told women journalists not to report to work. 
In July, the Taliban abducted, abused and killed Nazar Mohammed, a popular comedian known as Khasha Zwan, initially denying the killing but later claiming responsibility for the cold-blooded murder.  
Hundreds of arrests and abductions in Spin Boldak, Kandahar, by the Taliban have also been documented. 
In another incident, Afghans who waved the national flag on Afghanistan Day were violently dispersed by Taliban fighters. In Jalalabad, at least three people died and others were injured – raising fears about freedom of expression under Taliban rule. 
“Our own investigations into the massacre in Ghazni province is proof that the Taliban’s capacity for murder and torture has not lessened,” Agnès Callamard said. 
“Afghans are fleeing at immense personal cost and risk to themselves and their families. Countries must not engage in ‘push back’ tactics, and must find a way to support all those who wish to leave Afghanistan.” 
According to media reports, thousands of Afghans fleeing over land across Iran to the Turkish border face being pushed back by Turkish border guards and military police. Meanwhile, Greece has installed a 40km fence on its border with Turkey amid concern over a rise in migrants from Afghanistan. 
Amnesty International recommendations 
Amnesty International is calling for a robust, independent UN mechanism to be established with a mandate to document, collect and preserve evidence of ongoing crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations and abuses across Afghanistan. 
UN member states must also urgently pass a resolution at the UN Security Council, calling on the Taliban to uphold international human rights law and guarantee protection from reprisals to those most at risk, including human rights defenders, journalists, and women leaders in Afghanistan. 
Amnesty International is also calling for forced returns and deportations of Afghans to be halted immediately. 
Background 
On 19 August, Amnesty International published an investigation that revealed the murder of nine ethnic Hazara men in Ghazni province between 4 and 6 July. Six men were shot while three others were tortured and killed, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off.

Where are they? Enforced Disappearance as a Strategy of Repression in Nicaragua documents the cases of 10 people detained for their activism or for exercising their right to freedom of expression who have been subjected to enforced disappearance, despite being in the custody of the Nicaraguan authorities.  
“Daniel Ortega’s government is implementing a new strategy to try to silence those who speak out. By disappearing opponents, activists and journalists, Ortega is showing his fear of criticism and complaints,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The 10 cases we have documented demonstrate a new pattern of detentions followed by enforced disappearances and bear strong similarities to the cases of dozens of others who may be in the same situation. We demand that Daniel Ortega’s government immediately release all those detained for exercising their rights.”  
Since the beginning of the human rights crisis in Nicaragua in April 2018, there has been no end to reports of harassment against people identified as opponents of the government, human rights defenders, journalists, victims of human rights violations and their families. 
The new phase of the repressive strategy of President Ortega’s government, which is highlighted by the detention of a new group of people identified as opponents of the government, began on 28 May 2021. From then until 2 August, more than 30 people were deprived of their liberty, adding to the more than 100 people who were already in prison just for exercising their human rights. 
After analyzing the cases of 10 individuals, Amnesty International concluded that – in light of the Nicaraguan state’s international human rights obligations – their detention, followed by the concealment of their whereabouts, constitutes the crime of enforced disappearance. The cases documented were those of Daysi Tamara Dávila, Miguel Mendoza, José Pallais, Suyen Barahona, Víctor Hugo Tinoco, Félix Maradiaga, Ana Margarita Vijil, Violeta Granera, Jorge Hugo Torres and Dora María Téllez. 
The 10 documented cases are not isolated cases and occur in a context where there are repeated reports of other situations that have important similarities. Therefore, the cases analyzed likely represent just a small sample of a longer list of victims. 
In all of the documented cases, as of 2 August (the closing date of the investigation), the authorities had not officially disclosed the exact location of the detainees – a requirement under international law. In most cases, the only information received about their possible location has been provided verbally by police officers at the gate of the Judicial Assistance Directorate Evaristo Vasquez Police Complex (Dirección de Auxilio Judicial Complejo Policial Evaristo Vásquez, DAJ), known as the “New Chipote” (Nuevo Chipote), after family members insisted. However, mere statements by police officers in charge of the entrance of a detention centre are not sufficient, official and credible proof of the whereabouts and conditions of the detainees. 
Both the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the National Police have issued public statements acknowledging the detentions. However, in none of them do they mention the place of detention. Furthermore, the families have not been able to visit the detainees, their legal teams have not had access to interview them, and the judicial authorities have not responded to calls to authorize the entry of family members and lawyers. 
The information available to Amnesty International shows that the families and legal representatives of the 10 detainees submitted more than 40 applications, petitions and appeals to different authorities, requesting access to their files, medical examinations for the detainees, interviews with their lawyers, family visits, and immediate release, among other requests. Unfortunately, these appeals have been ineffective and, in most cases, left unanswered by the authorities. 
Enforced disappearance is a crime under international law and one of the most serious human rights violations because it implies the violation of multiple human rights. It is defined as a lawful or unlawful deprivation of a person’s liberty by state agents, or by other actors with the acquiescence or tolerance of the state, without subsequently acknowledging that the detention took place, or, if acknowledged, withholding information about the fate or whereabouts of the person deprived of liberty. 
“This week will mark 90 days since the most recent detentions began, but the authorities continue to refuse to provide official information on the whereabouts and conditions of detention,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. “The families deserve to know for sure if their loved ones are alive and where they are being held. The anguish they’re experiencing is yet another form of punishment under the repressive policies of Daniel Ortega’s government.”

At the opening of today’s UNHRC special session, the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the UN Special Procedures and a host of other civil society speakers – including Amnesty International – unequivocally called for the creation of a robust investigative mechanism. Such a mechanism would allow for monitoring and reporting on human rights violations and abuses, including grave crimes under international law, and to assist in holding those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in fair trials. 
However, the calls were ignored by UNHRC member states, who adopted by consensus a weak resolution which merely requests further reports and an update by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in March 2022, which adds little to the oversight process already in place. 
“The UN Human Rights Council special session has failed to deliver a credible response to the escalating human rights crisis in Afghanistan. Member states have ignored clear and consistent calls by civil society and UN actors for a robust monitoring mechanism,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Many people in Afghanistan are already at grave risk of reprisal attacks. The international community must not betray them, and must urgently increase efforts to ensure the safe evacuation of those wishing to leave. States must now move beyond handwringing, and take meaningful action to protect them. 
“Amnesty International’s recent on-the-ground investigation into the massacre of Hazara men in Ghazni province is proof that the Taliban’s capacity for murder and torture has not diminished. 
“UN member states must correct today’s failure when the Human Rights Council meets again in a few weeks. A robust investigative mechanism – with a mandate to document, collect and preserve evidence of ongoing crimes and human rights violations across Afghanistan – is urgently needed.”

The Taliban have seized power in Afghanistan following the collapse of the former government in recent weeks. Amnesty International has called for the protection of thousands of people at serious risk of Taliban reprisals, from academics and journalists to civil society activists and women human rights defenders. 
Last week Amnesty International revealed how the Taliban were responsible for a massacre of nine ethnic Hazara men after taking control of Ghazni province in July 2021. The brutal killings likely represent a tiny fraction of the total death toll inflicted by the Taliban following recent territorial gains to date, as the group have cut mobile phone service in many of the areas they have captured, preventing information from emerging.

My passion for travel and having lived in many places, cultural distinctions only amplified my rigour towards social justice. From Student Council and repeated requests for period products in the women’s washroom to the UN to several youth-led non-profits looking to make a change within our democracy, something’s always drawn me to human rights and defending freedoms. That’s why I think I jumped at the chance to be a National Organizer for Amnesty International the minute an organizer from Dogwood told me about the volunteer position.  
Currently, as a National Organizer and a part of various campaigns, one of the more fulfilling projects I’ve worked on has been the Climate Workshop for the Annual General Meeting of AI Canada. Although the Climate Justice Movement, attached to Amnesty and otherwise, has found major footing and urgency in recent years, upon reflection through my work, I’ve found that this care and love for nature and the climate festered within me long before that. It might be all the trees I climbed as a youngin or nature class we had in primary school; it’s hard to pinpoint but, those small beginnings definitely played a part in the passion I carry for the climate movement. Seeing my small contributions come to life through the presentation, watching the audience interact and absorb the information I put forward was invigorating. The first step to participating in any movement is knowing its message and importance; I think the workshop team really accomplished that, talking about climate change and its inseparable link with racism, poverty and human rights.  
Amnesty International is a global organization promoting human rights. AI’s work and campaigns are saving lives. It may be selfish, but this position is very personally fulfilling. I’ve watched for years the work Amnesty has done for the security of reproductive rights, the acquittal of wrongful convictions, eradication of discriminatory practices against BIPOC, women, queer people and children – the list could genuinely go on – but to have seen the significant and life-altering changes Amnesty continues to make throughout this pandemic is remarkable. Now to be a part of furthering real change, all while supporting an organization that’s so focused on youth leadership and listening to the voices of the future, is greatly gratifying.  
Something I look forward to exploring in my journey as an activist is lowering the voting age. My work with Vote16BC has shown me that lowering the voting age does not just offer an increase in the voting population; it sets off a domino effect. Lowering the voting age allows more youth to be a part of politics, leading to more young candidates running for office, younger MLAs, youth as a part of the city council and school boards. Youth are leading fundamental movements for gun control, education rights and taking critical steps towards climate action – last year, more than 100,000 people marched in a youth-led climate strike just in Vancouver, let alone the millions worldwide. Adults and youth alike are joining forces to advocate for our present and the future. Even with the events of past years — RCMP violence against Wet’suwet’en Land Defenders, societal impacts of COVID-19, rampant forest fires in Australia, the global Black Lives Matter movement, and a U.S. election drenched in dishonesty — more and more youth are realizing governments can no longer amuse our ideas just for political show. We need representation, being no different from any other constituent. We are ready to watch the change take place and be a part of making it. 
Amnesty International has really made it possible for me to dream. The platform as a whole allows individuals to find their place in different areas of social justice, discovering countless unique ways to be involved, all while working with consistently talented and inspiring individuals.

On-the-ground researchers spoke to eyewitnesses who gave harrowing accounts of the killings, which took place between 4-6 July in the village of Mundarakht, Malistan district. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off. 
The brutal killings likely represent a tiny fraction of the total death toll inflicted by the Taliban to date, as the group have cut mobile phone service in many of the areas they have recently captured, controlling which photographs and videos are then shared from these regions. 
“The cold-blooded brutality of these killings is a reminder of the Taliban’s past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“These targeted killings are proof that ethnic and religious minorities remain at particular risk under Taliban rule in Afghanistan. 
“We urge the UN Security Council to adopt an emergency resolution demanding that the Taliban respect international human rights law, and ensure the safety of all Afghans regardless of their ethnic background or religious beliefs. 
“The UN Human Rights Council must launch a robust investigative mechanism to document, collect and preserve evidence of ongoing crimes and human rights abuses across Afghanistan. That will prove critical to ensure informed decision-making by the international community, and combat the impunity which continues to fuel grave crimes in the country.” 
Torture and murder in the context of an armed conflict are violations of the Geneva Conventions, and constitute war crimes under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which is already considering crimes committed in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan. 
Tortured and murdered 
Amnesty International interviewed eyewitnesses and reviewed photographic evidence in the aftermath of the killings in the village of Mundarakht. 
On 3 July 2021, fighting intensified in Ghazni province between Afghan government forces and the Taliban. Villagers told Amnesty International that they fled into the mountains to traditional iloks, their summer grazing land, where they have basic shelters. 
There was little food for the 30 families that fled. The next morning, 4 July, five men and four women returned to the village to gather supplies. On their return, they found that their homes had been looted, and that Taliban fighters were lying in wait for them. 
One man, 45-year-old Wahed Qaraman, was taken from his home by Taliban fighters who broke his legs and arms, shot him in the right leg, pulled his hair out, and beat his face with a blunt object.  
Another man, 63-year-old Jaffar Rahimi, was severely beaten and accused of working for the Afghan government, after cash was found in his pocket. The Taliban strangled him to death with his own scarf. Three people involved in the burial of Rahimi said that his body was covered in bruises, and that the muscles of his arms had been carved off. 
Sayed Abdul Hakim, 40, was taken from his home, beaten with sticks and rifle butts, had his arms bound, and was shot twice in the leg and twice in the chest. His body was then dumped next to a nearby creek.  
One eyewitness, who assisted with the burials, told Amnesty International: “We asked the Taliban why they did this, and they told us, ‘When it is the time of conflict, everyone dies, it doesn’t matter if you have guns or not. It is the time of war.’” 
Callous executions 
During the two-day killing spree, three other men – Ali Jan Tata (65), Zia Faqeer Shah (23), and Ghulam Rasool Reza (53) – were ambushed and executed as they left the iloks, and attempted to pass through Mundarakht to reach their homes in the nearby hamlet of Wuli. 
In Mundarakht, they were stopped at a Taliban checkpoint, where they were executed. Ali Jan Tata was shot in the chest, and Rasool was shot in the neck. According to witnesses, Zia Faqeer Shah’s chest was so riddled with bullets that he was buried in pieces. The men’s bodies were thrown into the creek alongside Sayed Abdul Hakim. 
Three more men were also callously killed in their home village. Eyewitnesses told Amnesty International that Sayeed Ahmad, 75, insisted the Taliban would not harm him as he was an elderly man, and that he intended to return to feed his cattle. He was executed with two bullets to the chest and another in his side.  
Zia Marefat, 28, suffered from depression and rarely left his home in Mundarakht. He refused to leave after the Taliban took control of the village on 3 July, but eventually did so after being urged by his mother and others to flee for his own safety. However, as he walked alone to the ilok, he was captured by the Taliban, who killed him with a shot to the temple. 
Karim Bakhsh Karimi, 45, who had an undiagnosed mental health condition which caused him to act erratically, did not flee with the rest of the villagers. He was also shot, execution-style, in the head.

The Russian authorities last week hit Navalny with yet another absurd criminal charge, while his supporters’ calls for accountability have been brutally repressed, and those behind the assassination attempt enjoy absolute impunity.  
“One year ago today, the Kremlin’s most vocal critic was attacked with a banned chemical weapon, an outrageous crime which should have been the subject of an urgent investigation by Russian authorities. Instead, the Russian government chose to throw Aleksei Navalny behind bars on false grounds – in conditions which almost killed him – and to pursue a relentless campaign of reprisals against his supporters,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.  
“The Russian authorities’ failure to investigate the attempt on Navalny’s life is damning proof of their utter disregard for justice and for the right to life. We reiterate our call for an immediate and impartial investigation into the attempted poisoning of Aleksei Navalny, and for an end to the persecution of Navalny and his supporters.   
“Most urgently, we call on the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Aleksei Navalny, who is a prisoner of conscience deprived of liberty solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. The international community must do everything in its power to ensure those behind the poisoning are brought to justice; to end the unlawful detention of Aleksei Navalny; and to halt the spiraling campaign of repression which Russian authorities have unleashed on their people.”   
Background  
Aleksei Navalny, a leading Russian opposition activist and founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, collapsed while flying from Tomsk (Siberia) to Moscow on 20 August 2020. He was transferred to Germany for treatment where he spent 18 days in a coma. International experts later concluded that the politician had been poisoned with Novichok-class military-grade nerve agent which is prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention.  
Since then, the Russian authorities have failed to launch a meaningful investigation, blocked Navalny’s lawyers’ attempts to challenge their inaction in various courts, and ignored strong evidence that agents of the Russian Federal Security Service were involved in the poisoning.   
After his return to Moscow on 17 January 2021, Aleksei Navalny was arrested and sentenced to serve 2.5 years in a penal colony for violating the probation terms of his earlier, politically motivated sentence. The Anti-Corruption Foundation and the “Navalny Headquarters” support network were listed as “extremist” and banned. On 11 August 2021, Navalny was additionally charged with “creation of a non-profit organization undermining rights of citizens”, under an obscure article of the Russian Criminal Code. He faces an additional prison sentence of up to three years if found guilty.

“What we are witnessing in Afghanistan is a tragedy that should have been foreseen and averted. It will only be compounded further without swift and decisive action from the international community. Thousands of Afghans at serious risk of Taliban reprisals – from academics and journalists to civil society activists and women human rights defenders – are in danger of being abandoned to a deeply uncertain future.   
“Foreign governments must take every necessary measure to ensure the safe passage out of Afghanistan for all those at risk of being targeted by the Taliban. This includes expediting visas, delivering support for evacuations from Kabul airport, providing relocation and resettlement, and suspending all deportations and forced returns. We urge the US to provide continued security at the airport while evacuations are ongoing.  
“As Afghanistan’s people face up to a stark new reality, the UN Security Council must also adopt an emergency resolution calling on the Taliban – who now effectively control the country – to respect international human rights law, protect civilians, and end reprisal attacks, as negotiations on transitional arrangements continue.”  
Background  
Thousands of Afghans fearing a return to Taliban rule are trying to flee the country via Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Videos circulating on social media have showed hundreds of people racing across the tarmac as U.S. soldiers fired warning shots in the air; a crowd pushing and shoving its way up a staircase trying to board a plane; and dozens clinging to the sides of planes attempting to take off.  
According to a statement by the airport authority, all commercial flights have been suspended. Kabul airport was overwhelmed on Sunday night, with more than 2,000 people hoping to board commercial flights leaving the country according to media reports.  
At least five people have reportedly been killed in Kabul airport as hundreds of people tried to forcibly enter planes. It is not clear whether the victims were killed by gunshots or in a stampede. US troops are currently in charge of the airport and overseeing ongoing efforts to evacuate US nationals.

We are particularly concerned that Canada’s neutral position on a temporary waiver to the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and its failure to reform the Canadian Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR) so manufacturers can expand the global supply of Covid-19 vaccines, constitute a failure to fulfil its international human rights obligations. 
Canada’s commitment to contribute $1.3 million to the World Health Organization’s Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) and to its COVAX Facility, dedicated to increasing global access to Covid-19 vaccines especially to lower and middle-income countries, is a welcome step. However, financial support alone cannot protect the right to health of millions around the world. Since its first delivery in February 2021, COVAX is already unable to deliver according to schedule in many countries and; in fact, on June 26, COVAX announced that it had no doses of AstraZeneca, Serum Institute of India, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines in stock.

Activists, Larry Emmanuel, Anene Victor Udoka, Samuel Gabriel, Henry Nwodo, and Ben Mannaseh, who had been arbitrarily detained in connection to their peaceful activism, have been released on bail. On 4 July, they attended a church service at the Dunamis International Gospel Center in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, when they were arrested and beaten by the Center’s security unit for wearing #BuhariMustGo T-shirts. On 29 July they were charged with ‘constituting themselves as vagabonds’ to disturb public peace.  Amnesty International believes the charges to be baseless and in connection to the activists’ peaceful expression of their dissenting views. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
On 3 August, Nigerian authorities released activists Larry Emmanuel, Anene Victor Udoka, Samuel Gabriel, Henry Nwodo, and Ben Mannaseh (also known as ‘the Dunamis5’) after spending 29 days in the custody of Nigeria’s secret police, the Department of State Services (DSS). On 26 July, a Federal High Court issued an order that the activist be released but the DSS disregarded it and kept them in custody. On 29 July, the DSS arraigned the five activists before a magistrate court where they were charged with ‘constituting themselves as vagabonds’ to disturb public peace. If convicted, they face a minimum of three years in jail. Amnesty International believes the charges to be fabricated. They must be dropped. 
On 4 July, the five activists were attending a Sunday church service when the security guards at Dunamis International Gospel Center, Abuja, arrested them for wearing #BuhariMustGo branded T-shirts. The shirts were in reference to President Buhari and were worn by the activists in protest against bad governance in Nigeria. In detention, they were denied access to their lawyers and family. Their prosecution is punishment for expressing dissenting opinions, which is covered by their right to freedom of expression. 
The right to peacefully protest and express dissent is increasingly being criminalised in Nigeria. Individuals who exercise their right to freedom of expression in Nigeria risk physical attack, arrests, and trumped-up charges. Also, the abuse of existing laws and growing impunity imply that perpetrators of these violations are not prosecuted. In most cases individuals who suffer abuses never get justice. 
Through alternative channels, Amnesty International will continue its campaign to ensure that the criminal charges against the activists are dismissed. 
‘Amnesty International spoke out for us and we are free. We would not relent in speaking out for others. Thank you!’, shared the Dunamis5.

Additional Information 
Long Kunthea (22), Phuon Keoraksmey (19), and Thun Ratha (29) were charged with ‘plotting’ under article 453 of the Criminal Code by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court during the week of 21 July 2021. If convicted, they could face 10 years in prison, in addition to the 18-20 months they are currently serving on charges of “incitement”. 
“Plotting” is an exceptionally serious charge akin to terrorism or other offences against the state – it is intended to cover situations whereby individuals take steps towards committing an attack, or acts of violence, liable to endanger the institutions of the Kingdom of Cambodia or violate the integrity of the national territory. 
The three were first arrested in September 2020, soon after publicly announcing a plan to undertake a two-person march to Prime Minister Hun Sen’s house to express concerns regarding plans to privatize and develop Boeung Tamok lake, Phnom Penh’s largest remaining lake. 
Long Kunthea and Phuon Keoraksmey were sentenced to 18 months in prison for “incitement to commit a felony or disturb social order” under Articles 494 and 495 of the Criminal Code and fined 4 million riel each (approximately $1,000 USD). Thun Ratha was sentenced to 20 months under the same charges and also fined 4 million riel. 
Sun Ratha (26), Ly Chandaravuth (22) and Yim Leanghy (32) were arrested on 16 June while two of them were investigating river pollution in the Tonle Sap river in Phnom Penh. On 21 June, Phnom Penh Municipal Court Investigating Judge Im Vannak confirmed that Sun Ratha and Yim Leanghy were charged with both “plotting” and “insulting the King”, under articles 453 and 437 (bis) of the Cambodian Criminal Code, which carry maximum prison sentences of 10 years and 5 years, respectively, while Ly Chandaravuth was charged with “plotting” only. 
Yim Leanghy and Ly Chandaravuth were sent to pre-trial detention in CC1 prison and Sun Ratha was sent to CC2 prison. 
These activists are all affiliated with environmental group Mother Nature Cambodia, a prominent campaign group which has won several major environmental victories. Using a combination of community mobilization, direct action and public awareness raising, in 2015 they successfully convinced the Cambodian authorities to drop plans to build a major hydroelectric dam in Cambodia’s Areng Valley, which had gravely threatened local Indigenous communities.  
In 2016, their work to expose widespread environmental destruction and human rights abuses linked to the mining and export of sand from coastal areas of Cambodia led to yet another major victory – a total export ban on coastal sand announced by the Cambodian government.  
Mother Nature Cambodia activists have faced a litany of repression in recent years, with many activists arbitrarily charged and imprisoned. Several of its activists have been imprisoned on baseless criminal charges of “incitement”. The group has been accused of “causing chaos in society” and characterized as “illegal” by Cambodia’s Ministry of Interior because it is not registered under Cambodia’s notorious NGO Law.

On Tuesday, the Higher People’s Court of Liaoning Province rejected Schellenberg’s appeal to overturn the sentence, which was handed down in January 2019. 
In a statement, a spokesperson for Schellenberg’s family said the latest development is “disappointing” and “difficult to fully process,” but that the case is not closed. 
“The process is ongoing and the family is choosing to be hopeful – holding out hope against hope even – that it will move forward in a better direction for their son, brother, grandson, nephew, and cousin,” reads the statement. “The Canadian government has been clear in its condemnation of the situation and demands for clemency for Robert. His family hopes for the same and believes it is still possible.” 
Schellenberg was initially sentenced to 15 years in prison for drug smuggling, charges he denies, at his original trial in November 2018 at the Dalian Intermediate People’s Court in China’s northeast Liaoning Province. At the appeal hearing a month later, prosecutors said they had uncovered new evidence and argued that the original sentence was too lenient. He received a death sentence at a one-day re-trial by the same Dalian Intermediate People’s Court in January 2019. 
Aubrey Harris, Amnesty International Canada’s Coordinator of the Campaign to Abolish the Death Penalty, called the ruling a flagrant violation of international law. 
“This is hardly a show of justice for Robert Schellenberg, or for China, the country that still issues the highest number of death sentences in the world,” he said. “These executions remain shrouded in secrecy, and Robert’s sentencing is no different. Despite significant concerns about the fairness of his re-trial – a rushed, one-day affair that ended with a death sentence – a higher court is choosing to stand by this cruel sentence. Chinese authorities must halt this execution – and immediately stop seeking the death penalty in all cases.” 
Background: 
Chinese authorities continue to execute a significant number of individuals for drug-related and other offences which do not meet the “most serious crimes” threshold to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international law. States are under an obligation to review their criminal laws to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed for drug-related offences 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The organization has been campaigning for total abolition of the death penalty for over 40 years.

Soldiers and militias subjected Tigrayan women and girls to rape, gang rape, sexual slavery, sexual mutilation and other forms of torture, often using ethnic slurs and death threats. 
“It’s clear that rape and sexual violence have been used as a weapon of war to inflict lasting physical and psychological damage on women and girls in Tigray. Hundreds have been subjected to brutal treatment aimed at degrading and dehumanizing them,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The severity and scale of the sexual crimes committed are particularly shocking, amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. It makes a mockery of the central tenets of humanity. It must stop. 
“The Ethiopian government must take immediate action to stop members of the security forces and allied militia from committing sexual violence, and the African Union should spare no effort to ensure the conflict is tabled at the AU Peace and Security Council.” 
The Ethiopian authorities should also grant access to the African Commission for Human and Peoples’ Rights Commission of Inquiry, and the UN Secretary General should urgently send his Team of Experts on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict to Tigray. 
Amnesty International interviewed 63 survivors of sexual violence, as well as medical professionals. Twenty-eight survivors identified Eritrean forces as the sole perpetrators of rape. 
Widespread sexual violence 
The pattern of acts of sexual violence, with many survivors also witnessing rape of other women, indicates that sexual violence was widespread and intended to terrorize and humiliate the victims and their ethnic group.  
Twelve survivors said soldiers and militia raped them in front of family members, including children. Five were pregnant at the time. 
Letay*, a 20-year-old woman from Baaker, told Amnesty International she was attacked in her home in November 2020 by armed men who spoke Amharic and wore a mixture of military uniforms and civilian clothing. 
She said: “Three men came into the room where I was. It was evening and already dark… I did not scream; they gestured to me not to make any noise or they would kill me. They raped me one after the other… I was four months pregnant; I don’t know if they realized I was pregnant. I don’t know if they realized I was a person.” 
Nigist*, a 35-year-old mother-of-two from Humera said she and four other women were raped by Eritrean soldiers in Sheraro on 21 November 2020. 
She said: “Three of them raped me in front of my child. There was an eight-months pregnant lady with us, they raped her too… They gathered like a hyena that saw something to eat… They raped the women and slaughtered the men.” 
Health facilities in Tigray registered 1,288 cases of gender-based violence from February to April 2021. Adigrat Hospital recorded 376 cases of rape from the beginning of the conflict to 9 June 2021. However, many survivors told Amnesty International they had not visited health facilities, suggesting these figures represent only a small fraction of rapes in the context of the conflict. 
Survivors still suffer significant physical and mental health complications. Many complained of physical trauma such as continued bleeding, back pain, immobility and fistula. Some tested positive for HIV after being raped. Sleep deprivation, anxiety and emotional distress are common among survivors and family members who witnessed the violence.  
Sexual slavery and intention to humiliate 
Twelve survivors said they were held captive for days and often weeks, and repeatedly raped, in most cases by several men. Some were held in military camps, others in houses or grounds in rural areas. 
Tseday*, 17, told Amnesty International that she was abducted by eight Eritrean soldiers in Zebangedena and held captive for two weeks. She said: “They took me to a rural area, in a field. There were many soldiers; I was raped by eight of them… Usually, they went out to guard the area in two shifts. When four of them went out, the rest stayed and raped me.” 
Blen*, a 21-year-old from Bademe, said she was abducted by Eritrean and Ethiopian soldiers on 5 November 2020, and held for 40 days alongside an estimated 30 other women. She said: “They raped us and starved us. They were too many who raped us in rounds. We were around 30 women they took… All of us were raped.” 
Eight women also told how they had been raped by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers and associated militia near the border with Sudan, as they sought shelter. 
Two survivors had large nails, gravel, and other types of metal and plastic shrapnel inserted into their vaginas, causing lasting and possibly irreparable damage. 
Soldiers and militia repeatedly sought to  humiliate their victims, frequently using ethnic slurs, insults, threats, and degrading comments. Several survivors interviewed by Amnesty International said that the rapists had told them, “This is what you deserve” and “You are disgusting”. 
Lack of support for survivors 
Survivors and witnesses told Amnesty International that they received limited or no psychosocial and medical support since they arrived in the internally displaced persons camps in the town of Shire in Ethiopia, or in refugee camps in Sudan. 
Survivors also suffered because medical facilities were destroyed and restrictions imposed on the movement of people and goods, which hindered access to medical care. Victims and their families said they are short of food, shelter and clothes due to the limited humanitarian aid. 
Reports of sexual violence were mostly hidden from the outside world during the first two months of the conflict that began in November 2020, largely because of access restrictions imposed by the Ethiopian government and the communications blackout. 
“On top of their suffering and trauma, survivors have been left without adequate support. They must be able to access the services they need and are entitled to – including medical treatment, livelihood assistance, mental healthcare and psychosocial support – which are essential aspects of a survivor-centred response,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“We must see all allegations of sexual violence effectively, independently and impartially investigated to ensure survivors receive justice, and an effective reparation program must be established. All parties to the conflict should also ensure unfettered humanitarian access.” 
Methodology 
Between March and June 2021, Amnesty International interviewed 63 survivors of rape and other sexual violence; 15 in person in Sudan, and 48 remotely on secure telephone lines. Amnesty International also interviewed medical professionals and humanitarian workers involved in treating or assisting survivors in the towns of Shire and Adigrat, and in refugee camps in Sudan, about the scale of sexual violence and for corroborating information on specific cases. 
In May, the Ethiopian authorities announced that three Ethiopian soldiers had been convicted and 25 others indicted for rape and other acts of sexual violence. However, no information has been made available about these trials, or other measures to investigate and to bring those responsible to justice. 
Amnesty International wrote to Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister, the Office of the Federal Attorney General and the Minister of Women, Children and Youth, to Eritrea’s Information Minister and a senior advisor to President Isaias Afwerki on 26 July 2021 requesting a response to the organization’s preliminary research findings, but had not received a reply at the time of publication. 
Since fighting began in the region on 4 November 2020, thousands of civilians have been killed, hundreds of thousands of people have been internally displaced within Tigray, and tens of thousands of refugees have fled to Sudan.

Read the Report: No Credible Evidence: Canada’s Flawed Analysis of Arms Exports to Saudi Arabia 
This report follows a 2020 Global Affairs Canada (GAC) review of arms exports to Saudi Arabia, which concluded that there is “no substantial risk” the transfers would be used to commit or facilitate violations of international human rights law, international humanitarian law, or gender-based violence.   
But as Amnesty International and Project Ploughshares conclude in their report, No Credible Evidence: Canada’s Flawed Analysis of Arms Exports to Saudi Arabia, the federal government’s assessment is “fundamentally flawed” as it misinterprets, or ignores, key pillars of the Arms Trade Treaty. 
“Contrary to what the federal government has said, Canada continues to ignore its international obligations to the Arms Trade Treaty,” said Cesar Jaramillo, Executive Director of Project Ploughshares. “Canada must do everything in its power to fully assess the risk level of all weapons exports. Instead, its review of the Canada-Saudi arms agreement cherry-picks through evidence to paint a picture of weapons deal that is fully compliant with international law.” 
Drawing upon international treaties, domestic legislation and UN documents and reports by human rights organizations, Amnesty International and Project Ploughshares point to evidence that weapons exported from Canada to Saudi Arabia, including armoured vehicles and sniper rifles, risk being diverted for use in the war in Yemen. Reports also illustrate that the Saudi-led coalition’s participation in the conflict in Yemen has contributed to gender-based violence, forced displacement, and indiscriminate attacks against civilians. 
“Saudi Arabia has a long history of human rights violations, and there are extensive reports documenting international humanitarian law violations committed by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen,” said Justin Mohammed, Programs Manager at Amnesty International Canada’s English section. “Yet Global Affairs Canada’s analysis is largely dismissive of these factors, and thereby fails to fully consider whether Canadian weapons exports could be used to commit acts or facilitate gender-based violence, violence against children, and other serious international human rights law violations and abuses.” 
Canada officially joined the Arms Trade Treaty in 2019, a step that then-foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland acknowledged was long overdue. In 2018, prior to becoming a state party to the treaty, Canada adopted Bill C-47 to address the shortcomings of its own export assessment process under the Export and Import Permits Act (EIPA). A legal analysis comparing this legislation to the Arms Trade Treaty shows that it falls short of the treaty’s international standards. Therefore, contrary to what the federal government claims, Canada’s own law is not compliant with the Arms Trade Treaty. 
Amnesty International and Project Ploughshares are calling on the federal government to revoke existing arms export permits to Saudi Arabia. The government should then consider introducing greater parliamentary scrutiny of Canadian export controls, policy and practice, and complement it with the creation of an arm’s-length advisory panel of experts to review best practices and support compliance with the Arms Trade Treaty.

The expert report looking into the discriminatory motive of the attack and its possible qualification as a hate crime, is expected to be finalised at the beginning of 2022. These are welcome developments as there was a risk that the investigation would not be extended beyond the deadline of 31 July, denying Vitalika Koval the right to equal access to justice. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
The investigation into this attack under Article 161 (“Violation of the equality of citizens”) was opened in December 2018 and was at risk of not being extended beyond the deadline of 31 July 2021, which would have denied Vitalina Koval’s right to equal access to justice. 
Moreover, the court decision extending the deadline for the investigation also indicates that the opinion of experts looking into the discriminatory motive of the attack and whether the attack can be qualified as hate crime is expected to be finalized at the beginning of 2022. This is excellent news and brings hope to LGBTI activists and those seeking justice in similar situations. 
On 8 March 2018, six members of the anti-LGBTI group Karpatska Sich shouted homophobic slogans and doused Vitalina Koval and other activists with paint during a public action marking International Women’s Day at Teatralna Square in Uzhgorod. As a result, Vitalina Koval received chemical burns to both her eyes. 
Amnesty International, with the support of thousands of people around the world, has been campaigning for justice alongside Vitalina Koval since 2018. She was featured in the 2018 edition of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign alongside other women human rights defenders from five continents. During Write for Rights, more than 380,000 actions were taken around the world expressing support for Vitalina Koval’s work in defence of women’s and LGBTI rights in Ukraine, calling for justice in connection with the violent attack she suffered in 2018 and for the discriminatory motive of the attack to be taken into consideration throughout the criminal process. 
Amnesty International will continue monitoring the case and campaigning for justice and LGBTI rights in Ukraine.

The organization’s Europe Director, Nils Muižnieks, said: 
“This attempt by the US government to get the court to reverse its decision not to allow Julian Assange’s extradition on the basis of new diplomatic assurances is a blatant legal sleight of hand. Given that the US government has reserved the right to keep Julian Assange in a maximum security facility and subject him to Special Administrative Measures, these assurances are inherently unreliable. 
“This disingenuous appeal should be dismissed by the court and President Biden should take the opportunity to drop these politically motivated charges which have put media freedom and freedom of expression in the dock. 
“President Obama opened the investigation into Julian Assange. President Trump brought the charges against him. It is now time for President Biden to do the right thing and end this farcical prosecution which should never have been brought in the first place. 
“Amnesty International’s recent work as a technical partner on the Pegasus Project is just the latest example that exposes what some states will do outside the gaze of publicity. It reinforces the vital importance of whistle blowers, investigative journalists and publishers in holding the perpetrators of human rights violations to account.” 
BACKGROUND 
The US extradition request is based on charges directly related to the publication of leaked classified documents as part of Assange’s work with Wikileaks. Publishing information that is in the public interest is a cornerstone of media freedom and the public’s right to information about government wrongdoing. Publishing information in the public interest is protected under international human rights law and should not be criminalized. 
If extradited to the US, Julian Assange could face trial on 18 charges, 17 of them under the Espionage Act; and one under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He would also face a real risk of serious human rights violations due to detention conditions that could amount to torture or other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement. Julian Assange is the first publisher to face charges under the Espionage Act. 
The US government is expected to challenge the grounds on which it can appeal and may request reconsideration for appeal on the other two grounds, which question the expert profile of one of the expert witnesses and also the assessed risk of Assange committing suicide.

He was released without charge, after he was abducted from his home in the middle of the night in front of his wife and children. Seengar had been organizing his community to campaign against allegedly illegal land grabs by a private property developer, which his supporters believe to be the reason for his disappearance. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
Seengar Noonari is a grassroots activist who has been engaged in social work and uplifting his community and, at 3:00 am on the morning of 26 June 2021, he was abducted by about 15 armed men. Recounting the events, Fouzia, Seengar Noonari’s wife, told Amnesty International that their children, aged between 15 months and 10 years, were with them as the men broke into their home and ransacked their belongings. They seized two mobile phones, an internet device, a USB and a few books before blindfolding Seengar and taking him away. 
Fouzia submitted a petition to the Sindh High Court on 2 July, calling for Seengar to be produced in court. Notices were issued to the Sindh police, the chief of Rangers (a paramilitary force under the command of the Pakistan army) and the station house officer of Nasirabad Police Station, alongside the Deputy and Additional Attorney Generals, seeking their response by July 13. These were not adhered to. 
In addition to Fouzia’s efforts, the Awami Workers Party (AWP), a political organisation that Seengar has been a member of since 2009, organized daily protests calling for his return across the country, staging demonstrations, press conferences and online actions. 
Seengar was released near Khairput district. No further details about his ordeal have been disclosed. 
The AWP and Fouzia attribute Seengar’s return to a combination of their advocacy and international scrutiny into the case. She said his return was like “Eid has arrived.” 
In Pakistan, enforced disappearance has been used as a tool to muzzle dissent. The individuals and groups targeted in enforced disappearances include Sindhis, Baloch, Pashtuns, the Shia community, political activists, human rights defenders, members and supporters of religious and nationalist groups, suspected members of armed groups, and proscribed religious and political organizations in Pakistan. 
The current government of Imran Khan promised to criminalize enforced disappearances through legislation. After families staged a sit-in in Feb 2021 for days, Imran Khan met with the families, pledging to bring an end to the practice. According to victim groups, there have been some returns in recent months. However, these seem to be ad hoc, and returnees are reluctant to share their experiences and never press charges. Dr Shireen Mazari, the Minister for Human Rights, introduced a bill in the National Assembly criminalizing enforced disappearance in June 2021, but the practice of enforced disappearance continues in the country with impunity.

On 29 December 2020, Moroccan authorities arrested Maati Monjib and held him in arbitrary detention, after a Rabat court convicted him of “threatening the internal security of the State,” and sentenced him to one-year imprisonment. His conviction was in retaliation for his critical stance towards the authorities and his work promoting the right to freedom of expression. Following his release, Maati Monjib has kept up his fight for human rights in Morocco. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
On 23 March, academic and human rights defender Maati Monjib was provisionally released from Oukasha prison in Casablanca, Morocco but money laundering charges against him are still pending which puts him in danger of re-arrest and resumption of trial. 
On 29 December 2020 Maati Monjib was arrested while having lunch at a restaurant in the Moroccan capital, Rabat. He was placed in pretrial detention on fraud and money-laundering charges. On 27 January 2021, he was unjustly sentenced for a case dating back to 2015 to one year in prison and a fine of 10,000 dirhams without undergoing a hearing or receiving a summons or any notifications to his defence team to allow for a fair and proper trial. On 4 March, he started a hunger strike, despite suffering a chronic heart condition and diabetes, to protest his detention and his sentencing in absentia in two separate cases brought against him in 2015 and 2020, in relation to the exercise of his rights to freedoms of expression and association, following years of unlawful digital surveillance and harassment through the criminal justice system. 
Since his release from detention, Maati Monjib has continued to stand up for human rights and regularly attends rallies and events in support for those unjustly detained in Moroccan prisons, including journalist Omar Radi and Suleiman Raisouni. 
The Moroccan authorities must recognize the legitimacy of human rights defenders and publicly support their work, acknowledging their contribution to the advancement of human rights. Individuals like Maati Monjib must not be punished for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association. They must be allowed to carry out their vital human rights work free from harassment and reprisals from the authorities. Amnesty International will continue to campaign for the bogus charges still pending against Maati Monjib to be dropped. 
The Urgent Action (UA), along with efforts by partner organizations, has pressured the authorities to release Maati Monjib. The UA gained momentum especially during the time Maati Monjib started his hunger strike, in March. It was the best direct tool to address the authorities directly. Upon release, in a phone call with Amnesty International, Maati Monjib thanked everyone who took the time to express solidarity with him. He also promised as soon as he was released “to never stop standing up for just causes”.

Gustavo himself joined Amnesty staff for the handover — their first offline event since the pandemic began — where he also received thousands of written and voice solidarity messages. He expressed gratitude to the hundreds of thousands of supporters who joined his fight for justice:   
“We are here demanding justice for my case and for all those whose human rights were violated during the protests. Today we delivered more than 206,000 signatures asking the prosecutor’s office to investigate. Afterwards, these signatures will go to Carabineros (national police) trying to speed up the cases of human rights violations and to let the institutions know that the world is aware of what has happened in Chile, that this has not been forgotten and that we will continue calling for justice. “ 
Gustavo and staff met with the Jorge Abbott, National Prosecutor and target of our global campaign, who expressed solidarity with Gustavo and committed to keeping commanders within the scope of their investigations. This is a truly promising step towards our goal of holding commanders to account.  
Amnesty and Gustavo also delivered the signatures to the Carabineros (national police) offices, where they left a hefty 13-volume stack of signatures for the current General Director, Ricardo Yáñez, who is also a target of our global campaign, as well as one of the commanders who should be investigated for his role and responsibility during the period of social unrest.  
Thank you for the solidarity, creativity and dedication to supporting Gustavo and all other victims of police violence. Amnesty will continue pushing for police commanders to be held accountable so this never happens again.  
Background:   
In November 2019, amid widespread concern over rising costs of living and inequality, people across Chile came out in protest demanding “dignity”. The world watched as millions demonstrated their yearning for change in the country. But they were met with excessive force by the authorities, and police officers loaded their guns with metal and rubber ammunition.   
On the 8th November, Gustavo Gatica, a 21-year-old student of psychology and an avid fan of music and photography joined the protests. Police fired into the crowds aiming at the upper body of protesters, and Gustavo was shot in both eyes. He was blinded permanently.  
According to the Prosecutor’s investigation, the two metal and rubber bullets removed from Gustavo Gatica’s eyes match the ammunition used by the Carabineros. This ammunition was used indiscriminately and disproportionately on countless occasions during the protests, in violation of international standards on the use of force.  
Even after enduring these injuries, Gustavo hopes that his blindness will help the world see what is happening in Chile; “I gave my eyes so people would wake up.”

Additional Information 
On 14 July, Belarus law enforcement officers broke into and searched the offices of at least a dozen major Belarusian civil society and human rights organizations and opposition groups, as well as the homes of civil society leaders. The list of those targeted included the human rights group Viasna, Belarusian Association of Journalists, Belarusian Helsinki Committee, the human rights group Human Constanta, the independent academic research centre BEROC, the human rights group Gender Perspectives, World Union of Belarusians Batskaushchyna, Belarusian People’s Front opposition party, “For Freedom” pro-democracy movement and Imena publishing house. At least 12 people were arrested on 14 July. Some were released in the following days but Viasna chair Ales Bialiatski, Viasna vice chair Valyantsin Stefanovich, the organization’s lawyer Uladzimir Labkovich and his wife Nina Labkovich, were transferred to a pretrial detention centre on 17 July. Nina Labkovich was subsequently released on 23 July. 
This is just the last instance of a coordinated and systematic campaign to stifle human rights defenders and any form of criticism of the authorities in Belarus following the post-election protests that started in August 2020. Already on 16 February, the authorities carried out raids simultaneously in Minsk, Homel, Mahilyou, Vitsebsk and Brest on the homes of staff and offices of Viasna, the Belarusian Association of Journalists and the independent trade union REP. The raids took place as part of unfounded criminal proceedings under Article 342 of the Criminal Code of Belarus (“organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order”). According to Belarus’ Investigative Committee, the investigation was aimed at “establishing the circumstances of the financing of protest activities”. In March, the Belarusian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case into the activities of Viasna under Article 342 of the Criminal Code. 
The lawyers of all three detainees have been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements, but it is believed that the pretrial detention of Valyantsin Stefanovich, Uladzimir Labkovich, and Ales Bialiatski may be connected to the criminal case opened against them in March under Article 342, an article that has been used by the authorities to launch unfounded cases targeting civil society activists, journalists and human rights monitors. There are also signs that they may be charged with tax evasion or other financial crimes. In a social media post on 16 July the investigative committee suggested they were being investigated, along with other NGO members for “shadow transfer of funds” and tax evasion. On 29 July, Ales Bialiatski’s wife, Natalia Pinchuk received the first letter from him which was numbered “three”, the first two letters did not reach her. Valyantsin Stefanovich’s family also received letters from him in which he told them: “I am preparing for a very long separation from the free world, but all the same I am hoping for better. Everything passes and this will pass too, and we will be together again.”

Additional Information 
Prior to Elisée Lwatumba Kaonia and Eric Muhindo Muvumbu’s release, the Minister of Human Rights publicly called for their release during his visit in North Kivu on 14 July. 
Elisée Lwatumba Kasonia is in his last year of high school. He has been denied the opportunity to complete pre-tests for the upcoming national exam which gives access to tertiary education. Eric Muhindo Muvumbu is married and a father of two children, aged two and eight. His small business has gone bankrupt due to his prolonged absence, leaving his wife struggling to provide for their two children alone. 
On 6 May, the DRC authorities announced a “State of Siege” for two provinces in the eastern part of the country, North Kivu and Ituri. This decision, according to the authorities, was meant to restore security and peace in the two provinces where decades of armed conflict and violence have left thousands of people dead and forced many more to flee their homes. Under this martial law, the civilian administration, including justice, was replaced by the military. Amnesty International is firmly opposed to the trials of civilians before military courts. To date, military courts are not fully operational, delaying the administration of justice to thousands of people in the two provinces. Amnesty International’s statement on the proclamation of the “State of Siege” is available here.

Amnesty was asked to contribute a personal reflection, and you can read mine, below, and all the essays contributed to this series on their blog.  
Like most people, I know the story about how money ensures the already powerful maintain their wealth and privileges, even when they break the law or hurt innocent people. My entire working life has been spent supporting people harmed by the decisions of the powerful and helping them obtain justice for those harms. This is how I came to meet the good people residing in Secwepemculew and around what is now known as Quesnel Lake.  
In my home province of British Columbia, money talks, especially mining money. Until the Mount Polley mine disaster in 2014, the province’s mining laws hadn’t changed very much since the gold rush era. And mining companies like Imperial Metals and Teck were among the largest donors to the political parties that were supposed to protect the lake and its residents. It’s a pretty convenient feed-back loop when you think about it.  
All of this was in the back of my mind when I made the trek in 2015 from my home on Vancouver Island to Likely, BC near Quesnel Lake. I was part of a small Amnesty International research team sent up to scope out the extent of the disaster and determine whether human rights had been abused by the company or violated by the provincial government. I was also there to listen and determine whether the people harmed by the disaster wanted our support and would work with us.   
We’ve now been working together for 6 years. I’ve been to the shores of Quesnel Lake in the heat of summer and at the turning of the season when a toque and mittens are absolute necessities. Two of my children came up with me in 2019 and my teenage daughter’s shock at the state of devastation, 5 years on, was captured in a video clip she recorded at Hazeltine Creek. “Its disgusting that nothing has been done to clean this up,” she said, “People need to know”. We delivered hundreds of solidarity messages from people across Canada to let residents know that they are not alone.  
At the same time, over the last 2 years my daughter has talked regularly about returning to Mitchell Bay, one of the many pretty bays tucked into the shores of this mighty fjord-like lake. She longs to swim in the crystal waters of the lake, to smell the trees along the edge of the water, and to feel cocooned by the silence of this great, interior rainforest.  
While I return again and again for the people I’ve met and to support their human rights cause, she wants to return for the lake and its creatures. We are grateful to the individuals and families who have opened their hearts and homes to us, who have shared their stories and struggles to protect the lake, who have travelled with us, and who continue to stand strong for Quesnel Lake. We stand with you.

“The Colombian authorities violated the human rights of peaceful demonstrators in Cali, using excessive and unnecessary force to disperse them. Under the pretext of restoring order, terrible injuries were inflicted on hundreds of people and dozens of young people lost their lives. What happened in Cali shows the violent response of the authorities and the true objectives behind this repression: to instill fear, discourage peaceful protest and punish those demanding to live in a fairer country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The city of Cali, capital of the department of Valle del Cauca, is in one of the regions hardest hit by the internal armed conflict and where various armed groups have proliferated and continue to operate, resulting in thousands of people being displaced and killed. It is the city with the second largest Afro-descendant population in Latin America and is characterized by inequality, exclusion and structural racism. This context contributed to Cali becoming the epicentre of protests and human rights violations during their repression. 
Since 28 April, mass demonstrations have taken place in Cali, in the framework of the “National Strike”. It was the city that saw the greatest concentration of the most serious reports of violent repression of young protesters by the security forces and armed civilian groups, and the authorities are continuing to restrict the right to peaceful protest. 
Amnesty International carried out an exhaustive digital verification of audiovisual material, which confirmed that National Police officials, in particular members of the Mobile Anti-Riot Squad (ESMAD), used excessive and unnecessary force. The organization also documented acts of urban paramilitarism by armed civilians, who accompanied National Police officials and, acting with their acquiescence and tolerance, attacked demonstrators and human rights defenders.  
The report analyses three cases of human rights violations in Cali. The first took place on 3 May, when, in an incursion called “Operation Siloé”, National Police officers, together with members of ESMAD and the Special Operations Group of the National Police of Colombia (GOES), used lethal weapons, including Tavor 5.56mm rifles, against peaceful protesters. That night, at least three deaths from gunshot wounds were recorded, among them that of the young man Kevin Agudelo, and hundreds of people were injured and several arbitrarily detained.  
The second incident detailed is the attack on 9 May on the Indigenous Minga (a collective of Indigenous Peoples participating in the protest) by armed civilians as National Police officers looked on. On that day, 11 Indigenous people were injured, including the Indigenous human rights defender Daniela Soto. 
The third and final case centres on the events that occurred on 28 May, when National Police officials used excessive force in an attack, in coordination with armed civilians, on demonstrators in the neighbourhood around Valle University. On that day, a dozen young demonstrators, including Álvaro Herrera, Noé Muñoz and Sebastián Mejía, were beaten and detained by armed civilians, who then handed them over to the National Police. Álvaro and Sebastián alleged that they were subjected to torture and cruel and inhuman treatment during their unlawful detention. 
In the case of Siloé, the unlawful and excessive use of tear gas – including against peaceful protesters who had nowhere to disperse to – involved the use of Venom, a system that is not appropriate for use in law enforcement operations. 
The incidents documented were not isolated or sporadic, but rather reflect a pattern of violence on the part of the Colombian authorities, who have responded to the protest with stigmatization, criminalization, unlawful police repression and militarization. When President Iván Duque decreed the use of the military in several cities in the country, including Cali, on 28 May, far from giving a message of dialogue, he fuelled protests by sending military units shaped by more than six decades of armed conflict onto the streets. 
In response to the announcement of the 20 July mobilizations and the holding of the National People’s Assembly, made up of people, groups and movements involved in the National Strike, in different cities in the country, including Cali, the Valle del Cauca government issued measures restricting the movement of transport and/or people entering the department between 16 and 22 July, thereby restricting the right to peaceful protest. 
The report highlights the recent observations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) following its visit to Colombia and calls on the state to comply with its recommendations and cooperate with and not hinder the work of the IACHR’s recently created Special Monitoring Mechanism for Human Rights in Colombia. 
The report urges the Colombian authorities to promptly issue an unequivocal order to stop the violent repression by the security forces. This includes a ban on the use of lethal weapons to disperse crowds and the use of tear gas against peaceful assemblies and/or in a way that risks causing excessive and unjustified harm – in accordance with the 30 Rules for the use of chemical irritants in law enforcement published by Amnesty International this week. 
Likewise, thorough, independent and impartial investigations must be initiated into human rights violations and crimes under international law committed in the context of the National Strike, specifically, in the city of Cali and the cases detailed in the report, taking into account all chain of command responsibilities within the security forces, as well as the participation of armed civilians with their acquiescence. Impunity must not prevail for these serious crimes. 
On 12 July, Amnesty International requested information on the three cases documented in the report from the Minister of Defence, the Director General of the National Police and the Attorney General, with a view to receiving their comments within 10 days and including them in the report. No response has been received. 
On 19 July, President Duque publicly presented “the process for comprehensive transformation of the National Police” which, he claims, has as its pillars the prioritization of a human rights perspective. Despite this announcement, on 20 July Amnesty International received reports that members of ESMAD used unlawful force during protests in Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cali and Medellín, injuring several protesters. 
“Amnesty International hopes that the police reform process announced by President Duque is not merely a paper promise, and that it includes the reforms ordered by the Supreme Court of Justice in September 2020 and a change in the repressive modus operandi of the National Police against the peaceful demonstrations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

This is the reality for 1 million or more predominantly Muslim adults and children in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang).   
Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against “terrorism,” the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against Muslims living in Xinjiang. The internment camp system is part of a larger campaign of subjugation, mass surveillance and forced assimilation.  
Now, thanks to courageous former detainees who are sharing their stories, the horrific scale and cruelty of abuses in Xinjiang is becoming increasingly clear.  
In June 2021, Amnesty International published a report that presents the most comprehensive account ever of life inside the internment camps. This new evidence confirms that China has committed crimes against humanity — including imprisonment, torture and persecution — against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.  
The world cannot allow these atrocities to continue. Please join our global petition calling on President Xi Jinping to release people arbitrarily held in Xinjiang and dismantle the internment camp system. 
— Yerulan, former detainee who told Amnesty that guards routinely beat people as they walked to class, and that a man in his class was taken out of class and beaten for not singing a song properly 
Amnesty’s latest report on mass violations in Xinjiang is based on first-hand testimonies from former detainees and others present in the region after 2017, as well as analysis of satellite imagery and data.   
From the moment detainees enter a camp, their lives are extraordinarily regimented under “prison-like” conditions. They are subjected to physical and psychological torture and to “political education” classes. 
Art: Molly Crabapple 
— Aitugan, former internment camp detainee 
Detainees reported constant surveillance, 24-hour lighting, and being forced to sit still for hours at a time. They were forbidden to speak to each other or in their own language, or to show any signs of religious practice. Detainees could be violently punished if they broke the rules.“We can’t even touch our face, or they would suspect us of praying,” said one former detainee.  
The government has devoted tremendous resources to concealing the truth. It prevents people in Xinjiang from communicating freely about the situation and denies journalists and investigators meaningful access to the region.  
Millions of people in Xinjiang live in constant fear of persecution for practicing their own religion and culture. People living abroad are often unable to obtain information about missing family members in Xinjiang, and many fear they will be detained if they return to China. 
The human suffering is immense. We must speak as one voice to end it.  
There are signs of growing international concern. On June 22, following the release of Amnesty’s report, Canada made a statement at the United Nations on behalf of 45 countries regarding evidence of crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. 
This sends a crucial message to Chinese authorities that they are not above international scrutiny, but concern must translate into action. An independent, international investigation into human rights violations in Xinjiang is critical.

The world cannot stand by as Muslims in Xinjiang face mass imprisonment, torture and persecution – simply for who they are. Please sign the global petition now and share it with your friends, family and contacts!

She was criminalized for her work as a defender of sexual and reproductive rights in Venezuela.  During the preliminary hearing held on 21 July, the court dismissed the prosecution and closed the case against Vannesa. 
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS. 
In October 2020, Vannesa Rosales responded to a request for support from a woman and her 13-year-old daughter. The girl was her student and had been raped by a man from her neighbourhood, which had resulted in pregnancy. In a previous medical consultation, the girl’s mother had been warned that the pregnancy put her daughter’s life at risk. 
Vannesa was arrested on 12 October 2020, being charged with induction to abortion, conspiracy, and criminal association. Since 11 January 2021, she was held under house arrest, awaiting a preliminary hearing for over six months. 
Since her arrest, Venezuelan and international NGOs like 100%Estrógeno and Women’s Link have campaigned tirelessly on Vannesa’s behalf. One week after Amnesty International issued an urgent action demanding the hearing take place and the case against Vannesa be dropped, the hearing was held and Vannesa was released with the case against her closed and no charges against her pending. 
Vannesa’s detention occurs in a context of systematic repression and criminalization of human rights defenders in Venezuela. The harassment and stigmatization against those who carry out this work in the country are constant and many are the target of reprisals such as threats, public stigmatization, arbitrary detentions, and attacks on their physical integrity. 
Amnesty International will continue campaigning for the protection of human rights defenders in Venezuela, as well as for the advancement of sexual and reproductive rights in the country, which are currently some of the most restricted in all of Latin America.

They were arbitrarily detained by the Belarusian authorities on 23 May, after their Ryanair flight was illegally forced to land in Minsk, Belarus’ capital. Amnesty International will continue calling for their immediate release. 
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS. 
On 25 June, Raman Pratasevich and Sofya Sapega were transferred to house arrest in an undisclosed location and remain in custody of the Belarusian authorities. This has been confirmed by their relatives. Sofya Sapega’s mother, who lives in Belarus, was allowed to see her daughter in June. Presently, there is no indication that either of them is at an imminent risk of torture or other ill-treatment. This development is widely attributed to the unprecedented international campaign on their behalf. 
Raman Pratasevich is a Belarusian journalist, former editor-in-chief of the NEXTA, NEXTA Live and, later, Belamova Telegram channels. These Telegram channels played a crucial role in the peaceful protests against widely disputed presidential election results in August 2020, by facilitating information-sharing, mobilization and coordination of protesters. 
Raman Pratasevich, who until his arrest lived outside Belarus out of fear for his safety, was charged on 5 November 2020 in absentia with “organization of mass disorder”, “organization of group actions that severely violate public order” and “inciting hatred towards social groups” (these “groups” according to the indictment being police officers and government officials). On 19 November, he became the first Belarusian national on the country’s official “List of Terrorists”. 
On 23 May 2021, Raman Pratasevich was travelling to Vilnius from Athens with his partner Sofya Sapega. When their flight was flying over Belarus, it was diverted by Belarusian air traffic controllers and ordered to land in Minsk Airport, ostensibly due to a false bomb threat. A fighter jet of the Belarusian Air Forces was deployed “to accompany” the civilian aircraft to Minsk. After landing, Raman Pratasevich and Sofya Sapega were detained by the Belarusian security services. Sofya Sapega is facing similar charges for allegedly moderating another Telegram channel. If convicted, the two are facing up to 20 years’ imprisonment. 
Belarusian authorities have published several videos of Raman Pratasevich and Sofya Sapega seemingly confessing to their “crimes”, and paraded Raman Pratasevich in front of reporters at a Foreign Ministry’s press briefing. Amnesty International has noted that such forced televised confessions amounted to ill-treatment. The Investigative Committee of Belarus claims that Raman Pratasevich and Sofya Sapega are “cooperating” and “making confessions”. However, their access to family members and lawyers has been restricted, and their lawyers are arbitrarily prohibited from sharing any details of the case. 
Amnesty International will continue to closely monitor the situation of Raman Pratasevich and Sofya Sapega and insist on their immediate release.

Additional Information 
Thin Thin Aung is a prominent woman human rights defender who has advocated for peace, equality, and human rights in Myanmar. In addition to her role as a co-founder and director of Mizzima Media, she has been a champion of women’s rights and intersectional feminist movement in Myanmar working with various local and international women’s rights organizations. Prior to 1 February 2021, she was involved in work aimed at reforming the police, working with the media and civil society.    
On 27 March 2021, Deputy Police Chief Kyaw Sein Tun from the Thanlyin Township Police Station filed complaints against the management of Mizzima, a prominent Myanmar news outlet, at the Thanlyin Township Court. He alleged that Mizzima did not follow the notice issued on 8 March, which revoked the outlet’s licence (along with four other media outlets’) to publish and broadcast. He accused Mizzima’s management of publishing and broadcasting materials that are exaggerated and false to incite more public unrest, to make protesters confront and target security personnel on duty, and to cause fear among the public.    
On the morning of 8 April, Thin Thin Aung and another Mizzima staff member were arrested outside her house in Yangon, Myanmar’s commercial capital. Both were taken to the Mingalardon interrogation centre (Yay Kyi Aing) on the same day. After being tortured for two weeks, they were transferred to Yangon’s Insein prison on 21 April.   
Thin Thin Aung appeared in court in prison court for the first time on 22 April. A few subsequent court hearings were cancelled due to the absence of a senior judge and a surge in Covid-19 cases in Myanmar. Her lawyer was able to meet with her on 30 May for the first time. Her next court hearing is scheduled on 28 July.   
She has been charged under Section 505 (a) of the Penal Code, which criminalizes anyone who “causes fear, spreads false news, agitates directly or indirectly criminal offense against a Government employee” and carries up to three years in prison and/or a fine.   
On 1 February 2021, the Myanmar military staged a coup and began to arrest scores of people including the de facto head of state, Aung San Suu Kyi, the President, Win Myint, and many other senior elected officials and other representatives from their political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD).  
The military continues to kill protesters, bystanders and other civilians, and arrest, detain, prosecute and imprison activists, human rights defenders, media workers, medical workers, artists, political opponents, and critics of the military for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.   
According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB), as of 19 July, the military has killed over 900 people and arrested more than 6,600 people, including at least 88 journalists. More than 5,200 people remain in arbitrary detention.

On August 4th, 2014, the tailings dam burst at Imperial Metals’ Mount Polley Mine, releasing a catastrophic 24 billion litres of toxic mine waste and contaminated water into Polley Lake, Hazeltine Creek and Quesnel Lake. It is the worst environmental mining disaster in Canadian history. 
By August 8, most of the sludge in the four-square-kilometre (1.5 square mile) sized tailings pond had drained out having ripped out thousands of trees and carried arsenic, lead and debris into adjacent waterways. 
Mount Polley mine records filed with Environment Canada show that there were “326 tonnes of nickel, over 400 tonnes of arsenic, 177 tonnes of lead and 18,400 tonnes of copper and its compounds placed in the tailings pond”. 
The Mount Polley mine is owned by Imperial Metals, a Vancouver-based company. It also owns or has interests in three other B.C. mining properties; Huckleberry copper mines, the Red Chris mine, and the Ruddock Creek lead/zinc property; and has several exploration projects, including claims within Manning Park (known as the “Donut Hole”). 
Seven years later, there have still been no charges or fines issued against Mount Polley for the disaster. The BC Government effectively quashed a private prosecution. 
Mount Polley’s on-going impacts: 
Ongoing risks from this incident remain high, including: metal-laden tailings deposited at the bottom of Quesnel Lake posing long term impacts to the lake’s health; post-spill remediation efforts of Hazeltine Creek are failing to support growth; and a discharge pipe spewing diluted mine wastewater directly into Quesnel Lake, a source of drinking water for local residents. The permit allows the mine to release up to 52 million litres of diluted mine wastewater per day through a pipe into the lake. Imperial Metals neglects to offer alternatives to discharging this pollution, despite ongoing community appeals. 
The Mount Polley Mine discharge permit is under appeal by a member of the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake (CCQL), with the goal to stop mine waste discharge into the once pristine Quesnel Lake. Mount Polley has been out of compliance with its waste discharge permit numerous times. 
Quesnel Lake is considered the deepest fjord lake in the world, and deepest lake in British Columbia. It is a tributary to the Fraser River and important spawning grounds for the watershed’s sockeye salmon. The lake also contains rainbow trout, Kokanee, Dolly Varden and other freshwater species.

7 Years After Canada’s Biggest Mining Disaster – Are We Any Safer? 
There are currently 98 tailings dams at 60 mine sites in B.C. There are nearly 200 contaminated or potentially contaminating mine sites throughout the province. 
Many mines in BC use the same type of waste storage facility that Mount Polley used. These wet tailings impoundments store water in massive disposal lakes, mixed with mine waste materials. 
A 2016 report by Dr. David Chambers, an internationally renowned geophysicist, found key recommendations by the expert panel into the Mount Polley disaster had been ignored or not implemented in a way to significantly reduce the risk of tailings dam breaches in both existing and planned structures. 
In particular, B.C. does not put safety first when it comes to mine tailings design, construction, operation and closure. While the Mount Polley Expert Panel recommended that BC update its guidelines to emphasize protecting public safety, it continues to make safety only one of many considerations in establishing a risk category for TSFs. B.C.’s Mine Audits Unit recently audited the tailings regulator updates made in 2016, and found the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Low Carbon Innovation was “inconsistent in its approach”, had “vague language” and lacked enforcement. 
In July 2020, a report by the B.C. First Nations Energy and Mining Council (FNEMC) found that while some changes had been made to B.C. mine legislation following the Mount Polley disaster, significant reforms were still needed to ensure the health and safety of dozens of First Nations and non-First Nation communities living downstream of existing or planned tailings dams. 
In northern B.C.,at least 12 new mines have been proposed or are already under construction. One of them, theKSM Mine, could be the largest open pit gold and copper mine in North America. Its proposed tailings dam – 28 times the volume of Mount Polley’s – could be behind a239-metre high dam towering over the salmon-rich Bell Irving/Nass watershed. 
The owners of Copper Mountain mine in southern B.C. want to expand operations and raise the current tailings dam from 150 metres to 260 metres – 220 metres higher than the Mount Polley dam and higher than Vancouver’s tallest skyscraper.  
Nearly two years after passing the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, which was meant toadvance a path forward to true reconciliation and uphold Indigenous rights, the B.C. government has done virtually nothing to implement it. Mining is not even mentioned the government’s draft action plan for the implementation of DRIPA, and mining operations continue to override the rights of Indigenous communities across B.C. See examples here, here, and here. 
Calls for the B.C. government to take action to improve mine safety are getting increasingly louder with Indigenous leaders and communities in Canada and the U.S. along with governors and lawmakers in neighbouring U.S. states become increasing concerned about the dangers posed to communities and the environment. See examples here, here, here, here, here, here and here. 
Concerns are growing because B.C. is in the midst of a mining boom. The latest annual British Columbia Mineral and Coal Exploration Surveyfinds that exploration spending across the province increased by 28 per cent year-over-year to $422-million — just short of the highs experienced in 2011 and 2013. And B.C. is wanting to position itself to be a key mineral supplier in the clean energy revolution.

Fighting between various armed groups and the Cameroonian armed forces has continued unabated for the past three years, with civilians bearing the brunt of unlawful killings, kidnappings, and widespread destruction of houses and villages. Government intervention has been limited, and there has been near-complete silence from the international community. 
Violence between government forces and the Anglophone armed separatist groups-who are themselves divided-erupted in 2017, when protests against discrimination and marginalization were repressed by the authorities. Based on eyewitness testimonies and analysis of satellite images, Amnesty International documented how dozens of civilians have been killed and multiple villages destroyed since 2019. 
“All parties to the conflict in Cameroon’s Anglophone regions have committed human rights violations and abuses, and civilians are caught in the middle. In one particularly appalling case, armed separatists shot dead two elderly women with barrage rifles; in another, Fulani vigilantes burned hundreds of houses and killed four people in a terrifying attack,” said Fabien Offner, Amnesty International’s Central Africa Researcher. 
“It is difficult to obtain accurate information about the human rights crisis unfolding in these regions, which are hard to reach by road and have poor telecommunications networks. But this is no excuse to look away – without strong action by the authorities and the international community, civilians will continue to bear the brunt of the crisis.”  
The Anglophone regions of Cameroon – the South-West and North-West – make up approximately 20% of the country’s population. Violence has recently intensified in parts of the North-West. 
According to the UN, at least 22 civilians were killed in Ngarbuh in the night of 13 to 14 February 2020, including 15 children and two pregnant women, following a military operation. A government inquiry found that during the same incident “the detachment commander decided to enlist 17 members of a local vigilante committee”. Several sources reported that members of that “local vigilante committee” were Fulani armed groups. The situation has heightened tensions with armed separatists who have long accused the Fulanis of cooperating with the authorities.  
Between June and July 2021, at least four policemen were killed in an ambush near the town of Bali Nyonga in the North-West region. Two gendarmes were beheaded in the town of Babadjou in the West region, bordering the North-West in an attack attributed to armed separatists by officials. Other examples include the killing by the army in Bamenda 3 subdivision of civilian man driving a car, and the kidnapping of six local officials in the town of Ekondo Titi in the South-West region. 
Nwa subdivision particularly hard hit by violence 
Nwa subdivision, located along Cameroon’s border with Nigeria, has been particularly hard hit by the recent violence. 
Between 22 and 26 February 2021, at least 4,200 people were displaced from seven villages in Nwa, following attacks by Fulani vigilante groups in which at least eight people were killed.   According to the Centre for human rights and democracy in Africa (CHRDA), the Fulani herders “have carried out over a dozen raids against the natives in the villages of Nwa in less than a month”. 
Satellite images analysed by Amnesty International show at least four villages that have been destroyed or burned down in Nwa in February 2021. It is unclear whether Fulani vigilante groups attacked the villages or whether the destruction took place during clashes with armed separatist groups, but the images suggest that the destruction was fairly recent. 
For example, imagery taken from the village of Sih on 5 March 2021 shows large areas of blackened vegetation, indicating it was recently burned. The village of Ntong was also heavily impacted as shown by imagery from 11 February and 5 March 2021. Imagery from 3 April 2021 shows multiple areas where structures in the village of Ntim appear damaged or no longer existing. 
 Like many areas in the North-West region, villages in Nwa subdivision are poorly mapped, meaning not all locations could be verified.  
Mbororo communities paying a heavy price 
Attacks have particularly targeted Mbororo communities-a subgroup of the Fulanis.  
According to unofficial figures Amnesty International received from Mbororo groups, in the absence of official data from the authorities, since 2017, in the seven divisions of the North-West region: 
One Mbororo traditional leader in Nwa subdivision told Amnesty International: 
“Armed separatists came to attack me six times. They destroyed my compound, burned down my brother’s houses. Seven people were killed in my compound. They gathered them in a house, locked the house and burned it. “ 
Testimonies, documents and satellite imagery reviewed by Amnesty International showed that armed separatists attacked a Mbororo community in the town of Mbem on 16 February 2020. 
Four members of one family, aged between 15 and 80, were killed, and three others were injured, including two elderly women who were shot in the forehead, legs and thighs with barrage rifles. The attackers also set fire to 30 homes, the mosque, and looted property, including motorcycles. 
A victim and eyewitness whose identity has been verified by Amnesty International said: 
“We were coming out of the mosque after prayer, when armed separatists came on three motorcycles and attacked us. They burned all our houses. Two hundred people could not sleep because their homes were razed.” 
During the night of 30 to 31 May 2019, around a hundred armed separatist groups carrying guns and knives attacked Upkwa resettlement camp near Lake Nyos, burning down dozens of Mbororos’ homes and killing cattle. 
In October 2019, Amnesty International researchers met two people, one of them who used to work as a motorbike taxi driver, said: 
“The armed groups were looking for me because I was a motorcycle driver, and they think the motorcycle drivers are informants for the military. They told us to go back to where we came from.” 
Leaders of separatist groups, and participants of the media networks they manage, have also targeted Mbororo communities in aggressive speeches broadcast online. 
Some of these speeches could constitute incitement to discrimination, hostility, or violence, according to Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
Advocacy of hatred escalated after the Ngarbuh massacre in February 2020. 
On 19 February 2020, an online TV channel belonging to an Anglophone separatist group broadcast a call from a speaker who said: 
“These people [Mbororos] are immigrants and it seems their time is over (…) The earlier they will leave, the better…or they will pay the price like any other ‘La République’ citizen that is in the Southern Cameroon (…) All of them if they don’t want to leave, they will die.” 
‘Hundreds of houses were burnt‘ 
Fulani armed groups have also committed multiple serious human rights abuses. 
Between 30 January and 7 July 2020, five people were killed, 600 houses were burned down, and at least 4,500 people were displaced from Koshin, Fangs and Bu-u villages (North-West). These violations took place during attacks perpetrated by about 200 members of Fulani vigilante groups, according to reports by OCHA. 
A resident of Koshin who is now displaced told Amnesty International that the village was attacked on three occasions in February 2019, February 2020 and June 2020. 
“The Fulanis came twice. In February 2019 they killed four people and in February 2020 they killed two people and burnt many houses. Then in June 2020, the state security forces also came in search of non-state armed groups and destroyed the village. They killed one civilian. Hundreds of houses were burnt. There are about 3,000 people [displaced] in the bushes now. They need food, shelter, health services, education, water,” he said. 
‘Bodies spreading all over… ‘ 
An estimated 350 people fled the village of Kimbi (Boyo Division), following clashes between armed separatist groups and Fulani vigilante groups on 25 and 28 January 2020. 
Kimbi was also attacked on 12 December 2019 by Fulani vigilante groups, some of whom were wearing army uniforms and armed with guns, who burned houses and killed people, according to eyewitnesses. 
One witness told Amnesty International: 
“They went ahead burning palm plantations all over Kimbi, harassing the population, looting people’s clothes, collecting money from people…On 16 December some armed separatists came, and clashes started with Fulanis. There were bodies spreading all over here in Kimbi.” 
“The Cameroonian authorities must deliver on their responsibility to protect the entire population indiscriminately, and they should accept the fact-finding mission the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights has been calling since almost three years, “said Fabien Offner. 
“The international community must publicly call on the Cameroonian authorities to urgently initiate thorough, independent, impartial investigations into allegations of human rights violations and, if there is sufficient admissible evidence, prosecute those suspected of criminal responsibility in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts without recourse to the death penalty. In addition, the international community must ensure that the humanitarian response aimed at addressing the needs of those affected by the violence, including refugees and internally displaced, is adequately funded.”

“The conviction of Tong Ying-kit is a significant and ominous moment for human rights in Hong Kong. Today’s verdict underlines the sobering fact that expressing certain political opinions in the city is now officially a crime, potentially punishable by life in jail. 
“To convict Tong Ying-kit of ‘secession’ for displaying a flag bearing a widely used political slogan is a violation of international law, under which expression must not be criminalized unless it poses a concrete threat. This feels like the beginning of the end for freedom of expression in Hong Kong. 
“People should be free to use political slogans during protests, and Tong Ying-kit should not be punished for exercising his right to free speech. It is particularly clear that he should never have been charged with a ‘national security’ offence carrying a possible life sentence. 
“Hong Kong authorities must ensure that any legal provisions aimed at protecting national security, or created in the name of counterterrorism, are clearly and narrowly defined and that their use conforms to international human rights law and standards.” 
Background 
On 1 July 2020, the first full day of the national security being in force, Tong Ying-kit drove a motorcycle towards a group of police officers while displaying a flag bearing the common protest slogan, “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times”. 
A first instance court in Hong Kong today convicted him of “inciting secession” and “acts of terrorism” under the national security law (NSL). Prosecutors said the slogan on the flag signified a desire to overthrow the government and deemed it to “connotate separation from China”. 
Tong Ying-kit, who has been remanded into custody since 6 July 2020, is the first person convicted under the national security law and faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. 
He was denied the right to trial by jury – used in Hong Kong’s common law system for 176 years – after the justice secretary said there was a potential risk to the jurors. 
Under international human rights law, displaying political slogans is in principle protected as legitimate expression. 
The Hong Kong authorities’ sweeping definition of “national security”, which follows that of mainland China, has been used arbitrarily as a pretext to restrict the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association, fair trial and liberty, as well as to repress dissent and political opposition. 
Between 1 July 2020 and 26 July 2021, police arrested or ordered the arrest of at least 138 people in relation to the NSL. As of 26 July 2021, 68 people have been formally charged, of whom 51 are presently in pretrial detention. 
An Amnesty International research briefing released last month found that the NSL has decimated Hong Kong’s freedoms and created a landscape increasingly devoid of human rights protections.

The briefing, Uncovering the Iceberg: The Digital Surveillance Crisis Wrought by States and the Private Sector, reveals the devastating impact of the poorly regulated spyware industry on human rights worldwide.   
“In the last few days, the world has rightly been outraged by the systematic targeting of human rights activists, journalists and lawyers revealed by the Pegasus Project. Not only does it expose the risk and harm to those individuals unlawfully targeted, but also the extremely destabilizing consequences on global human rights and the security of the digital environment at large,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.  
“NSO Group is just one company. This is a dangerous industry that has operated on the edges of legality for too long, and this cannot be allowed to continue. Now, we urgently need greater regulation over the cyber surveillance industry, accountability for human rights violations and abuses, and greater oversight over this shadowy industry.”  
State and corporate responsibility  
For years, Amnesty International has warned of the dangers to human rights posed by the surveillance industry generally, and the specific cases of unlawful targeted surveillance facilitated by NSO Group specifically.   
States have binding obligations under international human rights law to protect human rights from abuse by third parties, including private companies that operate outside their borders.   
According to international legal standards, a company may be complicit in human rights violations if it meets two main criteria: that through its business activities it helped in the commission of the violation and that the company knew or should have known that its acts would help in furthering the violation.   
It is clear that NSO technology enabled the violations revealed in the Pegasus Project, and especially given that targeting has been found linked to the same countries in which NSO has previously been found, a reasonable person ought to have known the abuses were likely.  
“Private companies like NSO Group have shown they will flout their human rights responsibilities with impunity, all the while profiting from human rights abuse. By allowing NSO software to be used without taking adequate steps to protect our rights, states worldwide have allowed an unlawful system to flourish resulting in rampant human rights violations and abuses on a grand scale,” said Agnes Callamard.  
“The fact that world and other political leaders themselves may have come into the spyware technology’s crosshairs will hopefully serve as a long overdue wake-up call for them and states worldwide to step up and regulate this industry. If world leaders are being targeted in this way then it further confirms that everyone’s rights, including human rights activists, journalists and lawyers, are at risk.  
“Meaningful control of the spyware industry is now urgently needed to stop further violations. All legal steps must be taken to unveil the full extent and nature of NSO complicity in human rights abuses.”  
Amnesty International is calling for an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer and use of surveillance technology until there is a human rights-compliant regulatory framework in place.  
NSO Group is licensed to export Pegasus software by the Israeli Ministry of Defence. Amnesty International is calling on the Israeli government to revoke existing export licenses to NSO Group, given the risk its spyware could be used for human rights violations. In addition, NSO Group should immediately shut down clients’ systems where there is credible evidence of misuse.  
The organization is also calling on the company to publish a human rights compliant Transparency Report that discloses incidents of misuse of their products, destination countries, contracts, and other information necessary to fully investigate the possible occurrence of human rights abuses linked to their business.  
Background  
The Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, with the technical support of Amnesty International who conducted cutting-edge forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware.  
NSO Group has insisted that Pegasus software is legally used to “collect data from the mobile devices of specific suspected major criminals”. However, our recent investigation has proven that there is parallel use of the tool against civil society that is in clear violation of international human rights law.    
NSO Group’s targeted digital surveillance tool is inherently prone to human rights violations, given its design and the lack of checks in place to ensure its proper deployment. States have wilfully used Pegasus to unlawfully target individuals, completely violating their right to privacy.  
Pegasus severely impacts the right to privacy by design: it is surreptitious, particularly intrusive, and has the capacity to collect and deliver an unlimited selection of personal and private data.  
NSO Group has not taken adequate action to stop the use of its tools for unlawful targeted surveillance of activists, lawyers and journalists, despite the fact that it either knew, or arguably ought to have known, that this was taking place.  
NSO Group said in a series of statements that it “firmly denies… false claims” in the report. It wrote that the consortium’s reporting was based on “wrong assumptions” and “uncorroborated theories”, and reiterated that the company was on a “life-saving mission”. A fuller summary of NSO Group’s response is available here.

0,Bangladesh: End crackdown on freedom of expression online,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/bangladesh-end-crackdown-freedom-expression-online/,"Bangladeshi authorities must end the crackdown on people’s right to freedom of expression online and urgently repeal the draconian Digital Security Act (DSA) unless it can be amended in compliance with international human rights law and standards, Amnesty International said in a new briefing...","Bangladeshi authorities must end the crackdown on people’s right to freedom of expression online and urgently repeal the draconian Digital Security Act (DSA) unless it can be amended in compliance with international human rights law and standards, Amnesty International said in a new briefing released today. 
The briefing, “No space for dissent” examines cases under the DSA – a law that contains overbroad and vague provisions granting the authorities extensive powers to police the online space – against 10 individuals who have been subjected to a wide range of human rights violations including enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention and torture, simply for criticizing powerful people on social media. 
Bangladesh has at least 433 people imprisoned under the DSA as of July 2021, most of whom are held on allegations of publishing false and offensive information online. 
Those targeted include journalists, cartoonists, musicians, activists, entrepreneurs, students and even a farmer who cannot read or write, among others. In one case, writer Mushtaq Ahmed died in prison after languishing there for 10 months without trial on accusations under the DSA. One inmate alleged that he was subjected to torture. 
“The actions taken by the authorities under the purview of the DSA demonstrate just how dangerous it has become to speak out and voice dissenting views in Bangladesh today. These undue restrictions on different forms of expression have sent a chilling effect across Bangladeshi society and have severely curbed the space for independent media and civil society organizations. Bangladeshi authorities must release all prisoners held solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner. 
The DSA gives arbitrary powers to law enforcement agencies to conduct searches, seize devices and their contents, and arrest individuals without warrant simply for a comment they may have shared online, in violation of the right to freedom of expression enshrined under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which Bangladesh is a party. 
“We remind the Bangladeshi authorities about the recommendations they accepted from several UN member states during the country’s last Universal Periodic Review in May 2018, with regards to taking concrete measures to bring all legislation including the DSA in conformity with the ICCPR,” said Saad Hammadi. 
Tool for repression 
Introduced in October 2018, the DSA is increasingly being used to stifle dissent on social media, websites, and other digital platforms, with punishments that can extend to life imprisonment. The authorities have targeted critical voices under the pretext that they have made false, offensive, derogatory or defamatory statements online. 
Even before its adoption, the UN Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression and on the situation of human rights defenders raised concerns over the draft of the DSA. Several UN member states at Bangladesh’s UPR recommended the government to amend the DSA “to ensure online freedom of expression”. The government, despite accepting these recommendations, has so far failed to follow through on its promise and continues to crackdown on people’s right to freedom of expression. 
On 26 February 2021, rights activist Ruhul Amin was arrested for a Facebook post criticizing the Bangladeshi government and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for the death of Mushtaq Ahmed. He was subjected to intrusive questioning and imprisoned for 45 days before he was eventually released on bail. 
Mushtaq Ahmed was arrested in May 2020 for criticising the Bangladeshi government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic on Facebook. Denied bail at least six times, he reportedly died of a heart attack in prison on 25 February 2021. 
“Mushtaq Ahmed should not have spent a single minute in prison, let alone his final ones. Many provisions in the DSA are criminalizing conduct that should not constitute an offence in the first place. We urge the authorities to break away from this practice of using the law as a weapon against dissent,” said Saad Hammadi. 
Criminalizing free speech 
Amnesty International has found a concerning pattern in which the authorities are weaponizing sections 25 (Transmission, publication, etc. of offensive, false or threatening data information), 29 (Publication, transmission, etc. of defamatory information), and 31 (Offence and punishment for deteriorating law and order, etc) of the Act to target and harass critical voices. 
The Cyber Tribunal based in Dhaka, which holds trials of cybercrimes including cases filed under the DSA, has recorded 199 cases under trial between 1 January and 6 May 2021. Amnesty International has found 134 of those cases that clearly specified the sections under the DSA. Eighty percent of those cases (or 107 out of 134) were filed under both sections 25 and 29 of the DSA. 
The briefing finds that cases against six out of 10 individuals featured all three of these DSA sections, with sections 25 and 31 used against three other individuals. 
The way in which defamation is criminalized under the Digital Security Act shows the serious shortcomings of a criminal approach to defamation, where the law has been further instrumentalized to silence dissent. Amnesty International calls on the Bangladeshi authorities to ensure that defamation is treated as a matter for civil litigation, not criminal. 
Widespread abuse of DSA 
Cases against eight out of 10 individuals featured in the briefing have been filed by lawmakers, members of ruling Awami League party or law enforcement officials. 
Emdadul Haque Milon, a pharmacist and contractor, said that a local political leader of ruling Awami League party had him detained on 3 March 2020 under the DSA for a Facebook post where he criticised the Bangladeshi government’s invitation to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the de facto or first president of Bangladesh. Emdadul Haque Milon alleged that the politician had him detained to stop him from submitting a proposal for a government contract that subsequently went to the politician’s son-in-law. He was eventually released on bail after 23 days. 
A law enforcement official told Amnesty International that it is their responsibility to contain criticism against the government. Yet, international human rights law is clear that criticism of the authorities can never be legitimately punished. 
The Cyber Tribunal in Dhaka has dismissed nearly 50 percent of the cases (or 97 out of 199) during the period under review for lacking merit and evidence. That, however, did not waive the human rights violations that people have suffered including facing detention for various periods even before the cases appeared for trial. 
“The volume of DSA cases turned down by the tribunal demonstrates the way in which powerful people in Bangladesh have weaponized the law to silence dissent. The UN member states that expressed concern over the right to freedom of expression during Bangladesh’s UPR must continue to raise concerns about the ongoing violations being committed under the DSA and work with the authorities at implementing their recommendations to ensure critical voices are no longer silenced,” said Saad Hammadi.

“Bernardo Caal’s imprisonment for more than three years now sends a frightening message to the Indigenous peoples leading the defense of human rights, justice and the protection of our planet,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.   
“It’s shameful that the Guatemalan authorities continue to criminalize and intimidate those who dedicate their lives to defending nature while a global movement for environmental protection is gaining ground. Guatemala’s authorities have it in their hands to end the injustice against Bernardo and change the course of the country.”  
Bernardo Caal, 49, has been unfairly imprisoned since 30 January 2018 for defending the rights of  Q’eqchi’ Mayan communities affected by the construction of a hydroelectric project on the sacred Cahabón River in the department of Alta Verapaz in northern Guatemala.  
The petition emphasizes Amnesty International’s grave concerns about the major challenges facing those who fight for climate and environmental justice, and Indigenous peoples’ rights in Guatemala and worldwide, and demands that Guatemala’s Attorney General investigate those who handled Bernardo Caal’s case and his unjust arrest.  
His detention is emblematic of how human rights defenders, especially Indigenous people and those working on issues associated with territory, land and the environment – are criminalized in Guatemala and Latin America. It also reflects the historical racism and dispossession of Indigenous peoples’ territories in Guatemala.  
Amnesty international is calling for an end to the criminalization of justice officials and human rights defenders in Guatemala.  
When the organization named Bernardo Caal prisoner of conscience on 16 July 2020, it sent an open letter to the Attorney General expressing concern over the irregularities and negligence in the criminal proceedings against him – including the lack of objective evidence to support the charges – that coincide with the patterns of criminalization that Amnesty International has previously documented in cases against land or environmental defenders.  
In a last resort attempt to obtain justice and freedom, Bernardo Caal filed a cassation appeal with the Guatemala’s Supreme Court of Justice in September 2020. The first public hearing before the Supreme Court’s Criminal Chamber was scheduled for 5 April 2021 but did not take place because the lawyer of the company that sued Bernardo Caal filed a recusal motion against the magistrates. The Criminal Chamber did not admit the recusal on 11 May, and rescheduled the hearing of the cassation appeal to review Bernardo Caal’s unjust detention for 21 June 2021. The court has not ruled yet.

Ottawa – As a federal election looms, hundreds of migrants are converging in Ottawa to demand equal rights and fair treatment from the Trudeau government. While Canada recovers from COVID-19, the migrants who grow food, care for loved ones and provided essential services to our communities during the pandemic are being left behind. Without permanent resident status, 1.6 million people (1 in 23 residents) are denied access to the same rights that protect others in Canada. Migrants are marching to the Prime Minister’s Office to challenge Trudeau to end unfair treatment and exploitation. At the start of his time in office, Trudeau promised to welcome migrants and refugees. As Canadians prepare to go to the polls, the demand for status for all from migrants is a litmus test of Trudeau’s sincerity in building a fair post-pandemic society that benefits all people in the country.  
Starting at 2pm on Sunday, July 25, 2021, hundreds of migrants from Montreal, Toronto and beyond will be marching through downtown Ottawa. They will be carrying photographs of 14 farmworkers who have died in Canada this year, and a massive Humanitarian and Compassionate application. Migrants – including undocumented people, farm workers, refugees, international students, and care workers – will call on Prime Minister Trudeau to create a comprehensive regularization program for non-status residents, and re-open and expand the Essential Workers stream of the Temporary Resident to Permanent Resident program to include everyone by removing unfair language, immigration status, and work exclusions.

0,Chile: Amnesty International demands investigations into Carabineros’ former and current General Directors for human rights violations,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/chile-amnesty-international-demands-investigations-carabineros-former-and-current-general/,"Amnesty International published a new video today calling on the Chilean National Prosecutor’s Office to investigate the high command of the Carabineros, specifically the former Director General and the current Director General, for widespread human rights violations committed...","Amnesty International published a new video today calling on the Chilean National Prosecutor’s Office to investigate the high command of the Carabineros, specifically the former Director General and the current Director General, for widespread human rights violations committed during the period of social unrest that began in October 2019. 
Given the imminent closure of the investigation into the attacks that left Gustavo Gatica permanently blind, set for 30 July; the review of the precautionary measures against the Carabinero identified as having shot the tear gas canister that blinded Fabiola Campillai, and the request for an extension of the deadline for the investigation by the Prosecutor’s Office in this case, which will be on 28 July; Amnesty International considers investigations of the full chain of command to be as necessary as they are urgent. 
“It’s disappointing that, after more than 20 months, only small steps have been taken to investigate some of the Carabineros’ strategic commanders, and none in individual cases. There are good reasons to believe that the former General Director and the then-Director of Order and Security – who is now the current Director General – could have consented to the commission of acts of torture and ill-treatment against protesters, including cases as serious as that of Gustavo Gatica or Fabiola Campillai,” said Clara del Campo, campaigner for South America at Amnesty International. 
Clara del Campo also stated that the fact that a person is investigated for their alleged responsibility in committing a crime does not nullify the presumption of innocence that everyone enjoys. 
“The delay in the investigation into commanders is even more alarming in a context where social protest in Chile endures and continues to be repressed with police violence. The methods and weapons have changed, but the intention to harm the protesters persists. Until there is accountability from the high command, we will continue to lament human rights violations. Impunity fuels repetition.” 
In October 2020, Amnesty International published a thorough report, Eyes on Chile: Police violence and command responsibility during the period of social unrest, in which it analyzed the actions of Carabineros officers between 18 October and 30 November 2019. It concluded that serious human rights violations had been committed, including widespread violations of the rights of to personal integrity, because the strategic commanders did not take all the necessary measures to prevent them from happening. In said report, the organization warned that, in order to guarantee the non-repetition of events such as those analyzed in the report, it is not only necessary to judge all those responsible, up to the highest possible level, but also that the Carabineros institution be substantially reformed. Both recommendations remain necessary and urgent.

0,Morocco: Journalist harassed by authorities must be granted fair re-trial,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/morocco-journalist-harassed-authorities-must-be-granted-fair-re-trial/,"Responding to the conviction of journalist and government critic Omar Radi to six years in prison in a trial marred by blatant breaches of due process in relation to charges of espionage and rape, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Amna Guellali said:...","Responding to the conviction of journalist and government critic Omar Radi to six years in prison in a trial marred by blatant breaches of due process in relation to charges of espionage and rape, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Amna Guellali said: 
“Before his arrest Omar Radi was harassed by the authorities because of his brave journalistic work criticizing human rights violations and exposing corruption. Ever since his trial began, it has been marred by flaws. He has been deprived of the right to prepare a proper defence, he and his legal team were denied the right to access some of the evidence against him and all requests to summon defence witnesses in the cases against him were denied. He has also been held in solitary confinement for nearly a year. 
“Condemning someone to six years in prison after such flawed proceedings is not justice. Morocco’s authorities must urgently grant him a fair retrial in line with international standards.” 
Background 
Omar Radi is one of the founders of Le Desk, an independent Moroccan news website that publishes content critical of the authorities. His journalism has focused on politics and investigating corruption by the authorities. 
On 29 July, the authorities arrested him and charged him with “harming the internal and external security of Morocco” based on an accusation that he had received funds from sources “linked to foreign intelligence agencies”. Amnesty International considers these to be trumped up charges as they are related to research grants in the context of a journalism fellowship and freelance consultancies, both protected by his right to freedom of expression. 
Omar Radi was also charged with “rape” and “indecent assault against a female” after a former colleague at Le Desk alleged he assaulted her on 12 July 2020. He has denied the accusation. It is vital for all sexual assault allegations to be properly investigated and for perpetrators of such assaults to be brought to justice. Yet regardless of how serious the charges against him are, the authorities must ensure he is treated fairly and is granted a fair trial. 
In June 2020, an Amnesty International report revealed that Omar Radi was targeted by the Moroccan authorities using spyware produced by NSO Group, an Israeli company. Following its publication, the Moroccan authorities launched a smear campaign against Amnesty International, in an attempt to discredit the organization’s findings and distract from the unlawful surveillance in Morocco of human rights defenders and journalists. The indictment in both the espionage and rape cases against Omar Radi, dated 18 March 2021, confirms that the authorities had put the journalist under surveillance since 29 December 2017.

These include heads of state, activists and journalists, including Jamal Khashoggi’s family. 
The Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media non-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, who conducted cutting- edge forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware. 
“The Pegasus Project lays bare how NSO’s spyware is a weapon of choice for repressive governments seeking to silence journalists, attack activists and crush dissent, placing countless lives in peril,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“These revelations blow apart any claims by NSO that such attacks are rare and down to rogue use of their technology. While the company claims its spyware is only used for legitimate criminal and terror investigations, it’s clear its technology facilitates systemic abuse. They paint a picture of legitimacy, while profiting from widespread human rights violations.” 
“Clearly, their actions pose larger questions about the wholesale lack of regulation that has created a wild west of rampant abusive targeting of activists and journalists. Until this company and the industry as a whole can show it is capable of respecting human rights, there must be an immediate moratorium on the export, sale, transfer and use of surveillance technology.” 
In a written response to Forbidden Stories and its media partners, NSO Group said it “firmly denies… false claims” in the report. It wrote that the consortium’s reporting was based on “wrong assumptions” and “uncorroborated theories” and reiterated that the company was on a “life-saving mission”. A fuller summary of NSO Group’s response is available here. 
The Investigation 
At the centre of this investigation is NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware which, when surreptitiously installed on victims’ phones, allows an attacker complete access to the device’s messages, emails, media, microphone, camera, calls and contacts. 
Over the next week, media partners of The Pegasus Project – including The Guardian, Le Monde, Süddeutsche Zeitung and The Washington Post – will run a series of stories exposing details of how world leaders, politicians, human rights activists, and journalists have been selected as potential targets of this spyware. 
From the leaked data and their investigations, Forbidden Stories and its media partners identified potential NSO clients in 11 countries: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Hungary, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Togo, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 
NSO Group has not taken adequate action to stop the use of its tools for unlawful targeted surveillance of activists and journalists, despite the fact that it either knew, or arguably ought to have known, that this was taking place. 
“As a first step, NSO Group must immediately shut down clients’ systems where there is credible evidence of misuse. The Pegasus Project provides this in abundance,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Khashoggi family targeted  
During the investigation, evidence has also emerged that family members of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi were targeted with Pegasus software before and after his murder in Istanbul on 2 October 2018 by Saudi operatives, despite repeated denials from NSO Group. 
Amnesty International’s Security Lab established that Pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of Khashoggi’s fiancée Hatice Cengiz just four days after his murder. 
His wife, Hanan Elatr was also repeatedly targeted with the spyware between September 2017 and April 2018 as well as his son, Abdullah, who was also selected as a target along with other family members in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
In a statement, the NSO Group responded to the Pegasus Project allegations saying that its “technology was not associated in any way with the heinous murder of Jamal Khashoggi”. The company said that it “previously investigated this claim, immediately after the heinous murder, which again, is being made without validation”. 
Journalists under attack 
The investigation has so far identified at least 180 journalists in 20 countries who were selected for potential targeting with NSO spyware between 2016 to June 2021, including in Azerbaijan, Hungary, India and Morocco, countries where crackdowns against independent media have intensified. 
The revelations show the real-world harm caused by unlawful surveillance: 
“The number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how Pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media. It is about controlling public narrative, resisting scrutiny, and suppressing any dissenting voice,” said AgnèsCallamard. 
“These revelations must act as a catalyst for change. The surveillance industry must no longer be afforded a laissez-faire approach from governments with a vested interest in using this technology to commit human rights violations.” 
Exposing Pegasus infrastructure 
Amnesty International is today releasing the full technical details of its Security Lab’s in-depth forensic investigations as part of the Pegasus Project. 
The Lab’s methodology report documents the evolution of Pegasus spyware attacks since 2018, with details on the spyware’s infrastructure, including more than 700 Pegasus-related domains. 
“NSO claims its spyware is undetectable and only used for legitimate criminal investigations. We have now provided irrefutable evidence of this ludicrous falsehood,” said Etienne Maynier, a technologist at Amnesty International’s Security Lab. 
There is nothing to suggest that NSO’s customers did not also use Pegasus in terrorism and crime investigations, and the Forbidden Stories consortium also found numbers in the data belonging to suspected criminals. 
“The widespread violations Pegasus facilitates must stop. Our hope is the damning evidence published over the next week will lead governments to overhaul a surveillance industry that is out of control,” said Etienne Maynier. 
In response to a request for comment by media organizations involved in the Pegasus Project, NSO Group said it “firmly denies” the claims and stated that “many of them are uncorroborated theories which raise serious doubts about the reliability of your sources, as well as the basis of your story.” NSO Group did not confirm or deny which governments are NSO Group’s customers, although it said that the Pegasus Project had made “incorrect assumptions” in this regard.  Notwithstanding its general denial of the claims, NSO Group said it “will continue to investigate all credible claims of misuse and take appropriate action based on the results of these investigations”.

The arrests appear to be ethnically motivated, with former detainees, witnesses and lawyers describing how police checked identity documents before arresting people and taking them to detention centres. 
“Following the withdrawal of the Ethiopian National Defense Force from parts of Tigray and the announcement of a unilateral ceasefire by the Federal government on 28 June, for the last two weeks Tigrayans in Addis Ababa have been arbitrarily arrested and detained. Former detainees told us that police stations are filled with people speaking Tigrinya, and that authorities had conducted sweeping mass arrests of Tigrayans,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“Amnesty International urges the Ethiopian government to end this wave of arbitrary arrests, and to ensure that all detainees are either promptly charged with internationally recognized crimes and given fair trials, or immediately and unconditionally released. The government must also inform families of the whereabouts of those detained and ensure that they have access to lawyers and their relatives.”  
While some people have been released on bail, approximately hundreds of others remain in detention, and their whereabouts unknown. Amnesty International is not aware of any internationally recognizable criminal charges against those still in detention who were arrested in these cases documented by the organization.   
Ethiopian law requires police to present detainees in court within 48 hours of arrest to review the grounds for arrest. Promptly bringing detainees before a judicial authority is an important safeguard against torture, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance. 
Beaten, harassed, arrested 
Amnesty International remotely interviewed 14 people in Addis Ababa, including former detainees, eyewitnesses to arrests, and relatives and lawyers of those still in detention. 
One man, who was arrested in the Merkato area on Friday 2 July, told the organization that police raided his snooker game business at around 7pm. They began to harass and beat customers and employees and demanded to see their identity documents, before taking five people, all ethnic Tigrayans, to the nearby Woreda 6 police station. Identification cards in Ethiopia identify the ethnicity of the holder. The shopkeeper, who was among those arrested, said: 
“They kept us on the open air and it was raining the whole night. We also stayed there the next day on Saturday. More people of Tigrayan origin joined us during the daytime on Saturday. We were 26 Tigrayans arrested in the station that day.” 
Nineteen people were released the next day – some after presenting a bond – but the rest were taken to Awash Arba area in Afar Region, 240 kilometers east of Addis Ababa, according to the people Amnesty International has interviewed. The shopkeeper was released on Saturday evening, only to learn that his brother was among those being held at Awash Sebat. He said: 
“The next day I was told my brother is also arrested. He called us from Awash Sebat using a phone line of another person. He told us he is taken there by the police with many people. I know some of the people arrested with him.” 
Tsehaye Gebre Hiwot, who works at a tyre maintenance shop near Gotera, was arrested by police together with a relative, Haile Girmay, on 3 July. A family member told Amnesty International that she had visited Tsehaye Gebre Hiwot in the nearby police station. 
She said: “When I visited him, I saw many other Tigrayan broomsticks and mopper vendors [a business traditionally associated with people of Tigrayan origin] arrested there. They were all speaking in Tigrinya. I don’t know if they are released or taken with him.” 
A further nine witnesses told Amnesty International that they had seen dozens of Tigrayans detained in Tekle Haimanot – 5th Police Station, Gerji, Federal Police Remand Centre, and Merkato police stations when visiting detained friends and relatives. One man, who said five of his friends had been arrested in a raid on a dormitory hall on 2 July in Tekle Haimanot, said he saw about 50 Tigrayans in the 5th police station when he visited on 3 July. 
Amnesty International also heard of similar pattern of arbitrary arrests targeting Tigrayan residents in Awash Sebat, a town in Afar Region 200 kilometres to the east of Addis Ababa. One witness told Amnesty International that five Tigrayan business owners in the town, including her husband, were arrested on 3 July. She said: 
“He and many other Tigrayans in the town were arrested that day. They stayed in the police station of the Federal Police until 7 July before they were transferred to Awash Arba Prison at a place called Berta. They were taken to a court in Awash Arba on 7 July and the court remanded them until 19 July. Then the police took them to the prison. The prison is around 35 kilometers away from Awash Sebat. We visit and deliver them food and clothes in the prison.” 
Activists and journalists targeted 
Tsegaze’ab Kidanu is an Tigrayan living in Addis Ababa, who has been coordinating humanitarian assistance for people affected by the conflict in Tigray. He is also a volunteer managing media relations for an association called Mahbere Kidus Yared Zeorthodox Tewahido Tigray. On 1 July, a day before his association released a statement on the human rights situation in Tigray, he was arrested at his home. 
Tsegaze’ab’s family and lawyer visited him at the Federal Police Remand Centre on 2 and 3 July, but when they returned on 4 July he was not there. According to Tsegaze’ab’s lawyer, they later heard from another detainee that he had been taken to Awash Arba. His lawyer was also never informed of charges brought against Tsegaze’ab. 
The lawyer also shared with Amnesty International the names of 24 Tigrayans who were arrested from various neighbourhoods of Addis Ababa, including 22 Mazoria and Tekle Haimanot, between 30 June and 8 July. The lawyer told Amnesty International that one detainee, released on bail on 5 July, was charged of having ‘links with TPLF (the Tigray People’s Liberation Front)’ which is designated as a terrorist group by the Ethiopian government. 
Journalists and media workers who have been reporting on the situation in Tigray have also been detained without due process.  On 30 June, police arrested 11 journalists and media workers for Awlo Media and Ethio Forum, You Tube based media who have been covering the conflict and the human rights situation in Tigray, along with their lawyer. A lawyer and family members interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were able to visit the detainees on 1 July, but since 2 July their whereabouts are unknown and they also have no information whether the detainees have been charged with any crime or not. A relative of one detainee said: 
“On Friday [2 July], the police told us that they released them early in the morning around 6 pm. But none of them came to their house or called us. When we asked them repeatedly, the police said, we[police] don’t know where they are, don’t ever come again’. We have been looking for them since then.” 
“Ethiopian authorities must reveal the whereabouts of detainees to their families and lawyers. Not disclosing the fate or whereabouts of detainees is committing the crime of enforced disappearance. Authorities must also ensure that all detainees are protected against torture and other ill-treatment.” said Deprose Muchena.

Maura was detained for over 800 days in a facility accused of medical neglect and failing to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks.  
Following her release, Maura said: 
I am so, so happy. I still can’t believe it. I thought I wasn’t going to get out of that place, I thought I wasn’t going to get out of that hell. It was very difficult, very traumatic, very horrible. I thought I was alone in this world. I thought it wasn’t worth it to keep fighting. And then I realized that there were people around the world, who I didn’t even know, very good people who have been very supportive. They supported me by sending me letters, they gave me moral support. I am very happy for all that, very grateful. 
A campaign consisting of Amnesty International, American Friends Service Committee Colorado, the National Immigrant Justice Center, and the TransLatin@ Coalition, succeeded in advocating for ICE to re-review Maura’s case.   
A lawful permanent resident for over 25 years in the U.S., Maura attended high school in San Diego, held numerous jobs in the food service industry, and built a community that accepts and embraces her. She is seeking humanitarian protection to stay in the United States as she fears for her life if returned to Nicaragua, a country she has not known for decades, as a trans woman. ICE detained her for over two years at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in California, where she was subjected to abuse and the facility failed to provide adequate medical care. 
Now, Maura can return to the things she loved to do: dancing, singing along to Celia Cruz’s La Vida Es Un Carnaval, and producing and performing in shows.  
“Maura has finally been able to reunite with her friends and loved ones in freedom and join her sponsors—individuals who support community-based solutions over detention—in California as she continues to pursue her right to seek humanitarian protection to stay in the United States,” said Denise Bell, the researcher for refugee and migrant rights at Amnesty International USA. “While we celebrate Maura’s freedom and resilience, the work is not done until all trans people are released from ICE custody and the detention of trans people ends once and for all.”  
Thank you to everyone who has taken action for Maura’s freedom!

“In a historic day for Cuba, thousands of people took to the streets to demonstrate peacefully in several parts of the country, exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. It’s unacceptable that the Cuban government has denied these rights for decades and continues to do so today.” 
“During yesterday’s spontaneous demonstrations, which spread across different areas of the country, Amnesty International received with alarm reports of internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force – including police firing on demonstrators – and reports that there is a long list of missing persons.” 
“Instead of repressing the population, the Cuban authorities have an obligation to protect their right to demonstrate peacefully. President Miguel Díaz-Canel’s inflammatory rhetoric of ‘war’ and confrontation creates atmosphere of violence against those who demand accountability and the free enjoyment of their human rights.” 
“The Díaz-Canel government must address the social demands of its citizens, given the economic crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, the collapse of the health system – which is not responding to the current COVID-19 crisis – and the accumulation of historical demands for respect of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.”

Thanks to your support and efforts, three more prisoners of conscience: Nassima al-Sada, Germain Rukuki and Paing Phyo Min are free! In February, another prisoner of conscience, Algerian journalist Khaled Drareni, was released.  
Thank you for all of your efforts during Write for Rights 2020! Here are the latest updates: 
Human rights activist Germain Rukuki was finally released from prison on July 1 after more than four years behind bars in Burundi. Last month, an appeals court reduced his sentence from 32 years to one year. Germain should never have been jailed in the first place – he was arrested, prosecuted and convicted simply for his human rights work. 
Amnesty supporters around the world took more than 436,000 actions calling for Germain’s freedom, including nearly 10,000 actions from Canada. On behalf of herself and their three young children, Germain’s wife Emelyne Mupfasoni shared her thanks with you: 
“From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all to have mobilized and made it possible for Germain to reunite with us soon. 
On June 27, 2021, Nassima and another prominent women human rights defender, Samar Badawi, was released from prison in Saudi Arabia. They had both been detained since 2018 for their peaceful women’s rights activism. 
More than 777,000 actions were taken for Nassima’s freedom during Write for Rights, including nearly 13,000 letters, emails and tweets from Canada. Thank you! 
While Nassima and Samar have been released conditionally, they face a five-year travel ban and strict bail conditions that restrict their right to freedom of expression. These courageous human rights defenders should never have been jailed in the first place, and we will continue to campaign until they are truly free.  
ACT NOW: You can keep the pressure up now to have their bail conditions and travel ban removed >> 
On April 17, 23-year-old Paing Phyo Min was released from prison in Myanmar! Two years ago, he was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison for peacefully making fun of the Myanmar military with his satirical poetry troupe, the Peacock Generation. He should have never been imprisoned for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression.  
Paing Phyo Min’s father has shared his thanks: 
“I just wanted to say as a parent thanks so much for helping my son.” 
On Earth Day 2021, April 22, Amnesty International published a “Letter from the World” demanding protection for earth defender, Jani Silva. To create the letter, Amnesty used an algorithm to condense the hundreds of solidarity letters sent to Jani Silva into a single letter that symbolizes global solidarity and demands that Colombian authorities take strong and effective measures to protect her life and guarantee her safety. 
In a video, 14 public figures, including artists, singers and comedians from seven countries, read aloud the letter to Jani Silva. Watch the video here:   
Jani shared her thanks for your continuing solidarity: 
“From the bottom of my heart I can say that this campaign is what has kept me alive, because I’ve been very close to death but it’s never happened. In spite of everything, today we are alive and that’s what counts. Because I defend my territory, people have held a gun to my head [and threatened] to kill me. But I’m staying in my territory, we can’t run away or let fear defeat us. We have to keep fighting as when there are threats against our territory, it’s not just us that’s under threat but the whole world, because we have to protect the earth that gives us life.”

Four years on from the murders of Popi Qwabe and Bongeka Phungula, their families finally received some positive news. On March 8, International Women’s Day, the South African Police Service committed to investigating Popi & Bongeka’s case.  
The commitment followed a meeting with Popi’s sister, mother and Amnesty staff, who handed over 316,796 actions taken by supporters during Write for Rights.  
The families have campaigned tirelessly for justice since 2017, maintaining that the police failed to properly investigate the women’s murders, and key suspects were released for lack of evidence.

“The killing of President Jovenel Moïse must be immediately and impartially investigated alongside the grave human rights violations and chronic impunity that ordinary people have suffered under his watch,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
“This is a wake-up call for the international community, and for the Haitian authorities who have overseen chronic impunity and ignored the calls of human rights defenders that has paved the way for such a serious crisis.” 
Amnesty International is concerned at the potential escalation of violence in coming days and will be carefully monitoring any potential protests that ensue, attacks against human rights defenders, and attacks against ordinary Haitians. The organization calls on the Haitian authorities to put human rights at the centre of their response to the political crisis. 
The international community must also provide all assistance to the country to find ways to de-escalate violence and provide human rights protection, including for journalists and human rights defenders. States also have an obligation to allow those who leave the country in search of international protection to seek asylum. 
Background 
Protests and widespread violence have been ongoing in Haiti since at least 2019, as Amnesty International previously documented. 
In this context, human rights defenders and journalists have been under increasing attack. 
In July, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists condemned the killing of journalist Diego Charles. An activist, Antoinette Duclair, was also killed. In May, Amnesty International also documented the case of Milostène Castin, a defender of the rights of subsistence farmers who have suffered land seizures, displacement, and violent attacks in north-eastern Haiti. 
The Observatoire Haïtien des Crimes contre l’humanité (OHCCH) and Harvard Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic also issued a report in April alleging complicity of the Haitian government in three massacres targeting impoverished neighbourhoods carried out between 2018 and 2020. The report points to evidence that the attacks, carried out by gangs, were supported by state actors, including President Moïse, and alleges these acts could amount to crimes against humanity. 
A UN report, published in January 2021, found a sharp increase in human rights violations and abuses of the right to life during the 2018 and 2019 protests and called on the authorities to address underlying concerns including “impunity, corruption, structural inequality and adequate standard of living in order to restore public confidence and prevent future unrests.” Civil society organizations, including the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti have repeatedly raised concerns about chronic impunity and judicial dysfunction in Haiti, including in a hearing before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights held in December 2020.

“At least four million lives have now been lost to Covid-19. This devastating milestone must spur richer governments and companies into immediate action. How many more millions must die before the knowledge and technology to produce enough vaccines for everyone are made universally available? 
“The life-saving impact of vaccines is clear. Since January, the number of people dying in countries that have managed to give at least one dose to over half the population has reduced by over 90 per cent. 
“Yet, because vast swathes of the world have little or no access to vaccines, one person is still dying from Covid-19 every 11 seconds – mostly in lower-income countries. Equal access to vaccines shouldn’t be based on where you live, it’s a basic human right. 
“With many rich countries moving towards the lifting of restrictions, the deadly impact of Covid-19 is still rife. The death toll continues unabated in Latin America, while India and Nepal have faced deadly surges, and health systems in Indonesia and Southern Africa are at risk of being overwhelmed. 
“Many of these countries are still facing acute vaccine shortages which can only be resolved by both urgently sharing doses and removing the barriers preventing the scale up of global production. 
“World leaders must further support moves to lift intellectual property restrictions on life-saving products and push pharmaceutical companies to share their knowledge and technology. This is a global issue that requires urgent global action now. No one is safe, until everyone is safe.”

Notes to editors: 
As of 6 July 2021, 33 countries had provided at least one vaccine dose to over half of their population, according to figures published by Our World In Data. All but three (Mongolia, Maldives and Bhutan) are high income countries. (The analysis excludes countries and territories with populations of lower than 200,000 people.) 
Compared to the week of 11 January 2021, when world deaths passed 2 million, the numbers of people dying each week in these countries reduced from 51,614 to 4,015 – a reduction of 92% – according to figures collated from the World Health Organization. 
Globally, 53,861 are reported to have died of COVID-19 during the week of 28 June, 1 person every 11 seconds.  
The ten countries with the highest number of deaths over the last week are Brazil, India, Colombia, Russia, Argentina, Indonesia, USA, Peru, Mexico and South Africa. 
85 percent of vaccine doses have been administered in high- and upper-middle-income countries. Only 0.3 percent of doses have been administered in low-income countries, according to the New York Times vaccine tracker.

0,Palestinian security forces escalate brutal campaign of repression,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/palestinian-security-forces-escalate-brutal-campaign-of-repression/,"The Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank have launched a chilling campaign of repression cracking down on peaceful protests with unlawful force, targeting journalists, civil society activists, and lawyers with arbitrary arrests and torturing detainees, said Amnesty International today....","The Palestinian authorities in the occupied West Bank have launched a chilling campaign of repression cracking down on peaceful protests with unlawful force, targeting journalists, civil society activists, and lawyers with arbitrary arrests and torturing detainees, said Amnesty International today. 
Tensions in Palestine have spiked since the death in custody of prominent Palestinian critic and activist Nizar Banat on 24 June. Security forces responded to protests sparked by his death with excessive force. Most recently, on the evening of 5 July, Palestinian security forces detained at least 15 people, including protesters, journalists and a lawyer, after violently dispersing a peaceful gathering in front of the Ballou’ police station in Ramallah. 
“Over the past two weeks, Palestinian authorities have launched a deliberate campaign of repression, clamping down on peaceful protesters and carrying out arbitrary arrests in an attempt to instil a climate of fear and crush dissent,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“President Mahmoud Abbas must order an immediate end to this chilling crackdown and ensure that police and other members of the security forces are held accountable for these human rights violations. This must start with a thorough, independent and impartial investigation into the death of Nizar Banat, allegedly after being tortured, and the violent repression by Palestinian forces in the aftermath.” 
Preliminary autopsy results indicate Nizar Banat suffered injuries and bruising to many areas of his body, including “binding marks on the wrists and rib fractures”, according to the Independent Commission for Human Rights, Palestine’s ombudsman. This pattern of injury indicates he is likely to have been beaten in custody. 
Attack on peaceful sit-in 
In one of the most serious incidents of unlawful force documented so far, Palestinian security forces attacked a peaceful sit-in in front of the Ballou’ police station in Ramallah on the evening of 5 July. Family members and supporters had gathered there to protest against the detention of six men who had planned to attend a peaceful demonstration in al-Manara Square in Ramallah that evening. 
Police dispersed the gathering with wanton force beating protesters, dragging them on the ground, spraying them with pepper spray and pulling their hair.   
Shawan Jabarin, director of the human rights organization Al-Haq, witnessed the attack. He told Amnesty International: “I saw police officers brutally attack men and women there without any reason except that they were peacefully protesting the detention of their family members and colleagues. An older person, a father of a detainee, was sprayed with pepper spray on his face; women were pulled on the ground from their hair. I saw one journalist pulled towards the police station by police officers and get severely beaten on the head and body with batons. It was one of the ugliest, most shameful scenes.” 
Police first tried to persuade protesters to leave the area without providing any legitimate reason to disperse the protest. When they refused, a police vehicle arrived and announced that they had 10 minutes to leave the area. Shortly afterwards, dozens of police officers in riot gear holding shields, batons and pepper spray rushed towards the protesters and began attacking them. 
Hind Shrayedeh was among those protesting outside the police station with her three children after she heard that her husband, Ubai Aboudi, the director of Bisan Center, a research and development organization, was one of six men arrested by the police. She told Amnesty International: 
“We were all standing on the pavement across from the police station. I started to chant: ‘You country of freedoms, no to political arrests’. I was the only one chanting, no one else had chanted anything else, there were no signs, and everyone was standing peacefully.” 
Diala Ayash, a lawyer from Lawyers for Justice, was also detained on 5 July. She had attended the sit-in as a human rights monitor when police officers in riot gear attacked and called her name searching for her.  
“When they found me, I was violently dragged towards the police station by male officers, one of whom was sexually harassing me by grabbing and hitting me on my bottom and chest,” she told Amnesty International. 
Both Diala Ayash and Hind Shraydeh described how they witnessed police officers beating detained peaceful protesters on their head and bodies with batons inside the police station. At least one of them, Haitham Syaj, was hospitalized due to injuries he received. 
“Now I fully understand how Nizar Banat was killed,” Hind Shraydeh said. 
Escalating repression 
On at least six occasions, Palestinian security forces have used unlawful force to disperse peaceful protests. Some protesters resorted to throwing rocks and other objects in response to the use of force by the authorities. 
Amnesty International researchers present during demonstrations on, 24 June, the day of Nizar Banat’s death, witnessed Palestinian security forces beating protesters and bystanders, as well as using sound grenades, tear gas, and other force to disperse them. 
Palestinian security forces – some in civilian clothes -also attacked peaceful protesters on 26 and 27 June, including by beating protesters with wooden sticks, batons, using pepper spray and seizing mobile phones of people attempting to film the events. 
On 26 June, immediately after the initial protest dispersal, groups of men in civilian clothes also began attacking demonstrators and bystanders. Some were believed to be members of the security forces and others individuals affiliated to the political party Fatah. On 27 June, protesters came under attack from men in plainclothes again before they had even had time to gather properly. On both occasions, women were particularly targeted, many of them journalists, including with sexual assault. 
Palestinian police officers failed to intervene to protect protesters from these attacks. 
On 3 July, hundreds of Palestinians gathered in Ramallah for a peaceful demonstration against President Mahmoud Abbas. Security officers arrested Ghassan al-Saadi, a vocal critic of the Palestinian authorities, while on his way home following the protest. During his arrest they punched, kicked and beat him with batons. 
Three activists, Jihad Abdou, Izz Al-Din Z’oul, and Salem Al-Katsh, participating in a peaceful demonstration against Ghassan’s detention before the Ramallah court complex the next day were also detained. All were charged with causing “internal strife” and “insulting the authorities” according to the repressive electronics crimes law.   
“Palestinian authorities must not be allowed to continue to commit abuses unchecked. EU member states, the US, and the UK must immediately halt security assistance and military aid for Palestinian security forces and police until accountability and respect for human rights is ensured,” said Saleh Higazi.

“The long-awaited prosecution of David Castillo, convicted as co-author of the murder of Berta Cáceres, is an important step towards justice and the result of her family and COPINH’s tireless efforts to secure truth, justice and reparation. However, justice for Berta will never be truly complete until everyone who took part in the crime, including those who planned it, is brought to justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.  
“We urge the prosecutors to keep uncovering the truth. Until all those responsible are held accountable, other human rights defenders in Honduras will continue to lose their lives, for raising their voices and defending the most vulnerable. The Honduran authorities must put an end to impunity.” 
The Sentencing Court has yet to decide on David Castillo’s sentence, pending the resolution of previous appeals filed by his lawyers. According to COPINH, the defence has adopted delay tactics on multiple occasions, slowing the judicial process to date. It took the justice system nearly a year to sentence the seven individuals found guilty of Berta’s murder on 28 November 2018.  
During Castillo’s trial, the court did not consider evidence that Berta’s family lawyers submitted against other people allegedly involved in ordering her murder. The GAIPE, an independent team of international lawyers hired by Berta’s family, exposed serious flaws in the official investigation in 2017. Their report included evidence that would implicate high-level business executives and agents of the state in the crime. 
Human rights defenders in Honduras continue to face attacks with impunity. For instance, four Garífuna activists, members of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), were victims of an enforced disappearance at the hands of five individuals wearing Police Investigations Directorate (DPI) vests on 18 July 2020. Their whereabouts remain unknown. With 20 killings last year, Honduras is the third world’s deadliest country for human rights defenders, according to Frontline Defenders’ latest report. It is also the most dangerous country for defenders of land, territory, and the environment. Fourteen environmental defenders were killed there in 2019, giving Honduras the highest per capita rate of killings of environmental defenders in the world, according to the 2020 Global Witness report.  
Despite this context, Honduras has not signed the Escazú Agreement, the first environmental human rights treaty in Latin America and the Caribbean, which requires signatory states to protect environmental defenders and entered into force on 22 April 2021. 
“The Honduras government seems to look the other way when human rights defenders are attacked instead of fulfilling its obligation to protect them. Authorities must take this seriously and do whatever is necessary to keep human rights defenders safe from harm, so that a crime like the murder of Berta Cáceres is never repeated,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Additional Information 
On 2 March 2016, Berta Cáceres, a courageous defender of the environment and Indigenous rights, was shot dead by gunmen in her home in Intibucá, Honduras. She was the coordinator of the Civic Council of Indigenous and Popular Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) and campaigned against the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam project and the impact it would have on the territory of the Indigenous Lenca People. 
Berta Cáceres and other members of COPINH had faced threats and aggressions before she was killed and were beneficiaries of precautionary measures ordered by the IACHR since 29 June 2009. More recently, on 3 April 2021, COPINH denounced the detention of Bertha and Laura Zúniga, daughters of Berta Cáceres, and Camilo Bermúdez by the Honduran National Police in Santa Rosa de Copan, three days before the trial of David Castillo began.

‘In the Name of National Security’ details how the law enacted on 30 June 2020 has given the authorities free rein to illegitimately criminalize dissent while stripping away the rights of those it targets.  
“In one year, the National Security Law has put Hong Kong on a rapid path to becoming a police state and created a human rights emergency for the people living there,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director. 
“From politics to culture, education to media, the law has infected every part of Hong Kong society and fomented a climate of fear that forces residents to think twice about what they say, what they tweet and how they live their lives. 
“Ultimately, this sweeping and repressive legislation threatens to make the city a human rights wasteland increasingly resembling mainland China.” 
Based on analysis of court judgments, court hearing notes and interviews with activists targeted under the NSL, Amnesty’s briefing shows how the legislation has been used to carry out a wide range of human rights violations over the past 12 months. 
In this time, the government has repeatedly used “national security” as a pretext to justify censorship, harassment, arrests and prosecutions. There is clear evidence indicating that the so-called human rights safeguards set out in the NSL are effectively useless, while the protections existing in regular Hong Kong law are also trumped by it. 
Bail reversal violates right to fair trail 
On 1 July 2020, the first full day of the law being in force, police arrested more than 300 protesters, including 10 on suspicion of violating the NSL. Since then, the government has continued to arrest and charge individuals under the NSL solely because they have exercised their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 
Worse still, people charged under the law are effectively presumed guilty rather than innocent, meaning they are denied bail unless they can prove they will not “continue to commit acts endangering national security”. 
Consequently, defendants are being held in extended periods of pretrial detention. 70% of those officially prosecuted under the NSL are currently being held in custody after having been denied bail. The presumption of innocence is an essential part of the right to fair trial. 
The briefing also outlines how authorities have used the NSL to: 
“The Hong Kong government must stop using its excessively broad definition of ‘endangering national security’ for the blanket restriction of freedoms. As a start, it must drop all criminal charges against those currently facing prosecution for exercising their human rights,” said Yamini Mishra. 
“The onus is also on the United Nations to start an urgent debate on the deteriorating human rights situation in China, including with regards to the implementation of the NSL in Hong Kong.” 
Background 
The NSL was unanimously passed by China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee and enacted in Hong Kong on 30 June 2020 without any formal, meaningful public or other local consultation. 
The law targets alleged acts of “secession”, “subversion of state power”, “terrorist activities” and “collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security”. 
This sweeping definition of “national security”, which follows that of the Chinese central authorities, lacks clarity and legal predictability and has been used arbitrarily as a pretext to restrict the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association and liberty, as well as to repress dissent and political opposition. 
The NSL’s arbitrary application and imprecise criminal definitions effectively make it impossible to know how and when it might be deemed as violated, resulting in an instant chilling effect across Hong Kong from day one. 
Between 1 July 2020 and 23 June 2021, police arrested or ordered the arrest of at least 114 people under the NSL. As of 23 June 2021, 64 people have been formally charged, of whom 45 are presently in pretrial detention.

Military exports from Canada to Colombia in the past have included helicopters and armoured vehicles. In light of the troubling human rights record of Colombian police and military, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations call into question such exports. 
In 2020, the value of Canadian military exports to Colombia was $460,338.87, according to the Government of Canada’s 2020 Report on Exports of Military Goods from Canada. 
Since national protests began in Colombia on April 28, Amnesty International has verified excessive use of force by Colombian security forces leading to human rights violations and crimes under international law, including enforced disappearances and sexual violence, amounting to torture and ill-treatment. 
“It is imperative that Canada investigates and makes public independently verified information detailing the use of Canadian military exports to Colombia,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Directrice générale of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “Going forward, exports from Canada of equipment that could be used to commit human rights violations must be suspended until the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of speech is respected, and Colombian security forces fully comply with international law and standards on the use of force.” 
Background 
A national strike (“Paro Nacional”) started on April 28 in Colombia and has continued with multiple massive demonstrations across the country. The government responded to the protests by deploying the military and the police anti-riot squad (Esquadrones Móviles Antidisturbios de la Policia Nacional, ESMAD). 
Following rigorous investigation, analysis and verification of audiovisual evidence, Amnesty International concludes that Colombian law enforcement officers have frequently used excessive and unnecessary force to control the demonstrations. Moreover, the organization can confirm that officers carried out forced disappearances and sexual violence, which are crimes under international law. 
From the onset of protests in April until June 16, Colombian civil society organizations have documented 4,285 acts of violence alleged to have been committed by Colombian security forces, including 1468 victims of physical violence, 215 victims of gunshots, at least 43 people killed (the possible role of security forces in 21 other homicides is currently under investigation), 70 people with eye injuries, 28 cases of sexual violence, and at least 106 cases of gender-based violence, among others. At least 1,832 people have been arbitrarily detained, and 346 people have been reported disappeared.

Indeed, climate change threatens the rights of hundreds of millions of people to water, food and health. The risks to people and nature are greater with each passing year.  
Indigenous peoples in Canada and around the world are on the front lines of this emergency — and at the forefront of vital efforts to avert it. 
Their courageous voices together with those of other affected communities have become a powerful, collective call for action to protect humanity and our planet.  
Business as usual is simply not an option. Far reaching transformation is needed to an emissions-free future that protects the environment and human rights. 
Amongst other things, governments, businesses, investors and civil society must transition quickly away from fossil fuel use and extraction. However, energy alternatives must not cause human rights harms of their own or fuel further victimization and discrimination. Moreover, people who denounce negative impacts, challenge projects and press for justice must be protected from the dangerous reprisals that many now face. 
It is with these goals in mind that Amnesty International Canada is rolling out new actions in solidarity with environmental human rights defenders during the weeks between the International Day of Action for Rivers (March 14), World Water Day (March 22) and Earth Day (April 22). 
Developed in coordination with rights holders, the actions focus on three emblematic struggles: 
Join Amnesty as we advocate for energy solutions that are not only green, but consistent with human rights standards. Join us as we take action for climate justice, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, women’s rights, and the right to remedy. Join us as we advocate together to ensure that environmental human rights defenders can peacefully take action without fear of harassment or violence. 
The massive Hidroituango dam cuts across the Cauca River in a region of Colombia hard hit by decades of armed conflict and horrendous human rights violations. The company building the dam received millions of dollars in loans from Export Development Canada, a crown corporation.  
Families and communities dependent on the Cauca River for fishing and other livelihoods joined together in a movement called Rios Vivos – Spanish for Living Rivers – to speak out against environmental impacts of the dam and destruction of ancestral ways of living, along with forced evictions and worsening violence. Their protests have been met with threats and attacks, including the assassination of six community leaders. 
Use your online voice to support Rios Vivos.

In August, 2014, the tailings dam at the Mount Polley copper and gold mine burst, sending 25 million cubic metres of tailings and waste water into pristine Quesnel Lake, causing the largest environmental mining disaster in Canadian history. The company in charge of the mine has not been fined or charged, the tailings remain in Quesnel Lake and the company has a permit to discharge mine water into the lake until 2022. Residents fear exposure to toxins if they fish or drink water from the lake. 
Indigenous peoples – particularly Indigenous women – have reorted experiencing racist, sexist, and homophobic harassment and violence, including sexual violence, on the construction site of the Keeyask megadam in northern Manitoba, in the camp housing workers building the dam, and in nearby urban centres. Some of these incidents have been reported to police. Others have been reported to media. Fearing reprisals at work and mistrusting police, many incidents have been reported to trusted community memebrs.  
First Nations partners in the dam project have called on Manitoba Hydro to urgently address the harassment and violence at the project site. Manitoba Hydro has stated it has “numerous initiatives to combat these issues,” but Manitoba Hydro’s efforts have not put an end to the harassment and violence. 
We must take action. Learn more about this issue and why your support is needed.

Israeli police have also failed to protect Palestinian citizens of Israel from premeditated attacks by groups of armed Jewish supremacists, even when plans were publicized in advance and police knew or should have known of them. 
“The evidence gathered by Amnesty International paints a damning picture of discrimination and ruthless excessive force by Israeli police against Palestinians in Israel and in occupied East Jerusalem,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“Police have an obligation to protect all people under Israel’s control, whether they are Jewish or Palestinian. Instead, the vast majority arrested in the police crackdown following the outbreak of intercommunal violence were Palestinian. The few Jewish citizens of Israel arrested were dealt with more leniently. Jewish supremacists also continue to organize demonstrations while Palestinians face repression.” 
Amnesty International researchers spoke to 11 witnesses and its Crisis Evidence Lab verified 45 videos and other forms of digital media to document more than 20 cases of Israeli police violations between 9 May and 12 June 2021. Hundreds of Palestinians have been injured in the crackdown and a 17-year-old boy was shot dead. 
Discriminatory crackdown 
From 10 May, as demonstrations spread to towns with Palestinian populations inside Israel, intercommunal violence broke out. Scores were injured, and two Jewish citizens of Israel and one Palestinian citizen were killed. Synagogues and Muslim cemeteries were vandalized. In Haifa, 90 cars owned by Palestinians were destroyed on 13 May and rocks were thrown at Palestinians in their homes. In East Jerusalem Israeli settlers continued to violently harass Palestinian residents. 
In response on 24 May, Israeli authorities launched “Operation Law and Order” primarily targeting Palestinian protesters. Israeli media said the operation aimed to “settle scores” with those involved and to “deter” further demonstrations.   
According to Mossawa, a Palestinian human rights group, by 10 June, police arrested more than 2,150 people – more than 90% of them Palestinian citizens of Israel or residents of East Jerusalem. The group also said 184 indictments were filed against 285 defendants. According to Adalah, another human rights group, a representative of the State Attorney’s Office said on 27 May that only 30 Jewish citizens of Israel were among those indicted. 
Most Palestinians arrested were detained for offences such as “insulting or assaulting a police officer” or “taking part in an illegal gathering” rather than for violent attacks on people or property, according to the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel. 
“This discriminatory crackdown was orchestrated as an act of retaliation and intimidation to crush pro-Palestinian demonstrations and silence those who speak out to condemn Israel’s institutionalized discrimination and systemic oppression of Palestinians,” said Saleh Higazi. 
Unlawful use of force against demonstrators 
Amnesty International has documented unnecessary and excessive force used by Israeli police to disperse Palestinian protests against forced evictions in East Jerusalem as well as against the Gaza offensive. The protests were mostly peaceful though a minority attacked police property and threw stones. In contrast, Jewish supremacists continue to organize demonstrations freely. On 15 June, thousands of Jewish settlers and supremacists marched provocatively through Palestinian neighbourhoods of East Jerusalem. 
Witness accounts and verified videos confirm that at a 9 May protest in the German Colony neighbourhood of Haifa, northern Israel, a group of around 50 protesters were peacefully protesting when armed police attacked them, unprovoked, beating some of them.    
On 12 May, Muhammad Mahmoud Kiwan, a 17-year-old boy, was shot in the head near Umm el-Fahem, northern Israel, and died a week later. Eyewitnesses said he was sitting in a car near a protest when Israeli police shot him. The police dispute the claim and said they were investigating.    
On the same day, police officers violently dispersed a peaceful protest of around 40 people in St Mary’s Well Square in Nazareth, northern Israel, without warning, physically assaulting protesters. 
“Israeli police should be protecting the right to freedom of assembly, not launching attacks against peaceful demonstrators. The UN Human Rights Council’s Commission of Inquiry set up in May 2021 must investigate the alarming pattern of violations by Israeli police,” said Saleh Higazi. 
Israeli police have also used unlawful force in occupied East Jerusalem. On 18 May, police shot 15-year-old Jana Kiswani in the back as she entered her home in Sheikh Jarrah. A protest had taken place a few hours earlier in front of their house. Her father, Muhammad, told Amnesty International that her vertebrae were shattered and that doctors do not know if she will walk again. Verified video footage shows Jana Kiswani falling to the ground as she is shot from behind. Another verified video shows an Israeli police officer casually firing a Stand Alone IWI GL 40 grenade launcher at a person off-screen, followed by screaming.   
Police violence, torture and other ill-treatment 
Ibrahim Souri was shot in the face by Israeli police officers while using his mobile phone to film police patrolling the street from the balcony of his home in Jaffa, south of Tel Aviv, on 12 May. 
In a verified video, one of the police officers is heard saying: “What is he holding?” Ibrahim Souri shouts in response: “I’m filming, isn’t that permitted? Shoot, it’s all recorded.” He later told Amnesty International: “I did not imagine that they would actually shoot. I thought I had rights, and that I was safe, in a democratic country.” Photographs reviewed by Amnesty International’s forensic pathologist and medical reports indicate he was most likely hit by a 40mm KIP, fracturing his facial bones. 
Amnesty International also documented torture at the Russian Compound (Moskobiya) police station in Nazareth on 12 May. An eyewitness said they saw special forces beating a group of at least eight bound detainees who had been arrested at a protest: 
“It was like a brutal prisoner of war camp. The officers were hitting the young men with broomsticks and kicking them with steel-capped boots. Four of them had to be taken away by ambulance, and one had a broken arm,” he said. 
The lawyer of Ziyad Taha another protester detained at Kishon detention centre near Haifa on 14 May, said his client was tied by his wrists and ankles to a chair and deprived of sleep for nine days. 
Failure to protect Palestinians from Jewish supremacist attacks 
Police also failed to protect Palestinians from organized attacks by groups of armed Jewish supremacists, whose plans were often publicized in advance.  
Amnesty International verified 29 text and audio messages from open Telegram channels and WhatsApp, revealing how the apps were used to recruit armed men and organize attacks on Palestinians in cities with Jewish and Arab populations, such as Haifa, Acre, Nazareth, and Lod between 10 and 21 May.                                  
Messages included instructions on where and when to gather, types of weaponry to use and even clothing to wear to avoid confusing Jews of Middle Eastern heritage with Palestinian Arabs. Group members shared selfies posing with guns and messages such as: “Tonight we are not Jews, we are Nazis”. 
On 12 May, hundreds of Jewish supremacists gathered on the Bat Yam Promenade, central Israel in response to messages received from political party Jewish Power and other groups. Verified video footage shows scores of activists attacking Arab-owned businesses and encouraging attackers. One of those beaten was Said Musa who was also run over with a scooter by Jewish attackers. Only six Israelis are facing prosecution over the attack. 
Politicians and government officials have also incited violence. On 11 May riots broke out after Itamar Ben-Gvir, parliamentary representative for the Jewish Power party, rallied supporters to come to Lod and other towns and called for stone-throwers to be shot. 
A day earlier, Musa Hassuna was shot dead by a Jewish citizen of Israel in Lod during intercommunal violence. A video shows him being shot while he was near a group of Palestinians throwing rocks. His father blamed the town’s mayor, Yair Revivo, for “calling up extremists to do this thuggery” in reference to a statement in which the mayor described events in Lod as a pogrom on Jews. Four suspects were arrested over the killing but released on bail three days later. Israel’s Minister for Public Security, Amir Ohana openly condemned the arrests, calling them “terrible”. 
In an illustration of discrimination, Kamal al-Khatib, deputy leader of the Northern Islamist Movement, was arrested on 14 May and charged with incitement to violence and supporting a terrorist organization over public comments in which he expressed pride at solidarity with people in Gaza and East Jerusalem and said changes to the status of Jerusalem’s holy sites have led to violence between Palestinians and Jews. 
“The repeated failure of Israeli police to protect Palestinians from organized attacks by groups of armed Jewish supremacists and lack of accountability for such attacks is shameful and shows the authorities’ disregard for Palestinian life” Molly Malekar, Director of Amnesty Israel. 
“The fact that Jewish citizens of Israel, including prominent figures, have been allowed to openly incite violence against Palestinians without being held accountable highlights the extent of institutionalized discrimination faced by Palestinians and the urgent need for protection.”

Nathalie, who Amnesty International considers to be a survivor of gender-based violence, has unsuccessfully been trying to return to Canada with her children for 15 years. Amnesty International spoke with Johanne about her tireless advocacy to bring her daughter and grandchildren to Canada, and about her recently released book outlining her struggle for family reunification. 
She met him in the beginning of October 2001. He said he was a student at Concordia University. She got pregnant right away. Saeed was very smiley and said it wasn’t a problem because they would get married. I was in shock. I couldn’t believe that at age 17 she was pregnant. He said he was 24 years old but we were never really sure of his age. 
 
I explained to them that my daughter was too young to get married. I asked Saeed to please be with my daughter for two years and then get married. I didn’t want them to marry because they didn’t even know each other yet. He got mad and left my house and never spoke to me again while he was in Canada. He reacted very aggressively. 
Nathalie found a place in Montreal to live, a house for young mothers, with social workers on site. Partners were not allowed to live there, though they could visit. I paid for Nathalie to live there and covered all her costs. At that time, Saeed wasn’t on very good terms with Nathalie. Sometimes they were on speaking terms and sometimes not. He said that Muslim people couldn’t date, but he couldn’t marry Nathalie without my consent because she was only 17 years old. 
Saeed was deported from Canada right after Samir’s birth in 2002. When he went back to Saudi Arabia he phoned many times and said he would come back to Canada. Sometimes he sent money at the end of the month. He sent clothes for Samir. He started to be nice to her. Nathalie went to Saudi Arabia to visit him with Samir twice. We started to feel more comfortable with him. 
Saeed wanted to marry Nathalie in Saudi Arabia when she visited in 2003. He lied and said they had been married in Canada, because they could not have married after having a child out of wedlock. Because of his lie they are considered married in Saudi Arabia. Nathalie decided to move to Saudi Arabia. 
When she moved to Saudi Arabia she very much missed Canada and wanted to come back. She said Saeed was depressed and wanted to come to Canada. I went to visit her for one month at the end of 2005. She had been there for nine months when I arrived. 
I was shocked when I arrived and saw how he was treating Nathalie and Samir. Nathalie is very proud. She knew no one wanted her to move to Saudi Arabia. People gave her advice before she left, so I think she was shy about telling me what was really going on. She told me the truth in person. He beat her. Three weeks after arriving in Saudi Arabia, Saeed beat her badly with a broom. He told her to tell people she was beaten by a taxi driver. He took photos of the bruises and asked her to send them to me and the Canadian embassy and said, ‘tell her Saudi Arabia is too dangerous for you and you need to come back to Canada.’ He did this because he wanted to come back to Canada with her. 
He slapped her in front of me. Nathalie was crying and screaming. He went out every night. I thought he was crazy. I didn’t want my daughter to stay with that man. He was very rough, very controlling. 
One day he brought me to the police station. I was surprised and I didn’t understand why. The police wrote something in Arabic and asked me to sign it. I said no. He said it was a declaration that I wouldn’t kidnap the children and that he wouldn’t kick me out of his house. I got an English translation and then signed it. But afterwards he didn’t want to go home. He said he wouldn’t go home until I left. 
After I arrived back from that trip I started my battle for Nathalie. 
When I came back to Canada I spoke to the federal government and told them my daughter wanted to come back to Canada. Nathalie said she wanted to come back to Canada with Samir. Saeed wouldn’t let Nathalie speak on the phone. A Canadian diplomat asked her to sign a document saying her file was confidential, because he thought that I was calling Ottawa too much and was a problem. 
In Saudi Arabia it’s possible to lock the door from the inside so you can’t leave your house. Nathalie was locked inside the apartment. The apartment was cement so no one could hear her screaming. She lived years like this. I was battling to try and speak with her. Sometimes she would email me saying she wanted to come home. Sometimes she would call and say she hadn’t eaten for two days. Sometimes she wouldn’t be in contact. 
She had Abdullah in 2006. She was depressed and in bad shape. She still said she wanted to come back to Canada. She came back in October 2006 to visit Canada on her own. Saeed phoned daily. She went back to Saudi Arabia. She said she would lose her life there but she couldn’t be separated from her children and she couldn’t leave her children alone with Saeed. When she got back to Saudi Arabia the kids were in bad shape and having nightmares. She was scared. She told me she would never leave again without them. 
In 2008 I was doing a big battle for Nathalie in Canada. Canada negotiated with the Saudi government, and the Saudi human rights commission helped out. They received a car. Saeed was receiving money because Nathalie was always saying in the media that they were poor, so the Saudi government gave them money but Saeed kept it for himself and Nathalie didn’t even have money for food. 
The abuse continued. The poverty continued. 
In 2008, Saeed went to work for the Saudi government. In 2013 things changed. He stopped working for the government and stopped receiving money from the government. Since 2013 the family has lived off the charity of others. They have no income. 
Saeed used to say he wanted to come back to Canada with the children. He wanted to leave Saudi Arabia. They got his visa, but there was a travel ban on the children so they couldn’t come to Canada. I now know the travel ban is from the Saudi government. 
When I visited Nathalie in Saudi Arabia in 2019, it was clear the Canadian government knows the travel ban on the children was imposed by the Saudi government. 
Saeed has said he will let the children come back to Canada. He has to sign their passports and consent for them to travel, including consenting for them to have an exit visa. But they can’t get passports because they’re subject to a travel ban. We’ve been asking Canada to negotiate with Saudi Arabia for the travel ban to be removed. 
I was hoping to finalize the paperwork so they could come back to Canada. The Canadian government was saying that Nathalie didn’t want to come back to Canada and that I had another version. So I asked for a meeting with me, Nathalie, and the Canadian government. When I went to Saudi Arabia we had that meeting. Nathalie, Saeed, the children, someone from the embassy in Riyadh and her colleague, and me, all met. In front of everyone Saeed said he consented for the children to come back to Canada. Nathalie and the children clearly said they wanted to come back to Canada. Nathalie provided paperwork to get the Canadian passports and citizenship documents for all the children. It was clear that Nathalie and I were saying the same thing. 
At the beginning, Saeed didn’t want Nathalie to speak to me. Now, when Nathalie doesn’t want to talk to me, she said she is worried for her life and her security and she is afraid of the Saudi government. She is very afraid for her security so she doesn’t use social media anymore. She often doesn’t talk to anyone outside of Saudi Arabia. In the past, Saeed was public in the media. But he was asked not to by the Saudi government. He doesn’t even speak to people from outside Canada now. 
The travel ban on the children. We need the Saudi government to remove the travel ban. We need Saeed to sign the exit visa for the children. He is allowed to change his mind. We worry about that. We can’t predict what he will do. He is very manipulative. 
When I visited in 2019 he was very nice to me. But I still don’t trust him. 
What actions would you like to see Canadian officials take to facilitate Nathalie and her children re-locating to Canada? 
I want the Canadian government to negotiate with the Saudi government to remove the travel ban. My grandchildren are both Saudi and Canadian citizens. 
I put so much time for so many years into this work. Sometimes 20-30 hours per week. It impacted my marriage and now I’m not married anymore. It’s impacted my health. 
In 2013, a women helped Nathalie in Saudi Arabia, and she and a friend were jailed for helping her. She gave her food, and money, and she let Nathalie use her phone. This woman helped my daughter because I asked her to, and because of that she and her friend spent 10 months in jail and were subject to a three-year travel ban. One of the women has children in the US and now can’t visit them. People are afraid to help Nathalie because they didn’t want to be jailed. The women who helped are women’s rights activists and journalists in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government used Nathalie’s case to stop their activism. 
I wrote my book because I want everyone to know about Nathalie and other women in the same situation. I want Global Affairs Canada to take action for my daughter. And for this to happen I need the public to know about the situation and press the government to take action. 
Global Affairs Canada isn’t transparent enough. They pick and choose whose cases they do more work on. I have many access to information requests. I have proof that they think poorly of my daughter. I found notes saying that they aren’t sure the children would be better with a young mother with no education in Canada. The way they talk about my daughter and me, I’m sure my daughter has been discriminated against. They discriminated against her because she stutters, and they don’t think she’s very smart. I found notes saying that they don’t want to put more energy on the file and that the file will only move forward if they have the total collaboration of Saeed. 
At first, I had all my trust in the Canadian government. We thought they were the specialists. Now we see it’s not that.

“This important statement delivered by Canada on behalf of 43 countries is a welcome reflection of growing international concern over evidence of crimes against humanity being committed in Xinjiang. It sends a crucial message to China’s authorities that they are not above international scrutiny,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“These states must now move beyond handwringing and take real action to address this egregious situation. Human Rights Council members must build on this statement to establish an independent, international investigative mechanism that can pave the way for holding to account those responsible for the human rights violations in Xinjiang. There’s not a moment more to lose. 
“When crimes against humanity are committed, the international community has a duty to respond to them resolutely, without fear or favour. Just because a state like China is powerful and goes to great lengths to cow its critics is no reason to shield it from international justice mechanisms. 
“Regrettably, some states chose not to join today’s statement; even worse, some chose to use their platform at the Human Rights Council to defend China’s shocking record. This effectively contributes to China’s well-documented efforts to discredit the survivors, victims’ families, and brave activists who speak out at significant personal cost. They must not give in to pressure and should join other states to work to launch an effective international investigation.” 
The joint statement at the HRC follows a landmark Amnesty International report published on 10 June, which presented convincing evidence of China’s commission of crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. The statement identified a number of the violations documented in that report, including mass arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance, torture and other ill-treatment and collective repression of religious and ethnic minorities. 
The joint statement also expressed grave concern “about the deterioration of fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong under the National Security Law and the human rights situation in Tibet”. In total, 43 countries signed onto the statement, which was a significant jump compared to just 28 that signed onto a similar statement at the Council last June. 
The following states signed on ahead of its delivery by Canada: Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Haiti, Honduras, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. 
Background 
On 10 June 2021, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team published the report, ‘Like We Were Enemies in a War’: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang. 
Based on a 20-month investigation and including dozens of new testimonies from former detainees, the report found that Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities face systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity. The report also details the extreme measures taken by Chinese authorities to essentially root out the religious traditions and cultural practices of the region’s Muslim ethnic groups, as well as to cover up the truth of what has been happening in the region. 
Amnesty International has also launched a new campaign, featuring the case files of more than 60 missing people believed to be detained in Xinjiang’s internment camps or prisons, calling for the release of all those arbitrarily detained.

“This is fantastic news, not only for Germain and his family, but also for hundreds of thousands of human rights campaigners around the world who have tirelessly campaigned for his release over the past four years. 
“The appeal court’s decision to reduce his prison term from 32 years to one is a step in the right direction. But Germain should never have been jailed in the first place, and his conviction on the charge of rebellion still needs to be quashed.” 
Germain has spent four years behind bars simply for his human rights work. He was convicted and jailed in 2018 on trumped-up charges. In a decision dated 4 June, but only publicly announced yesterday, the Ntahangwa Court of Appeal overturned Germain’s conviction for “participation in an insurrectional movement”, “threatening internal state security”, and “attack on the authority of the State.” His conviction for “rebellion” was, however, upheld. With his sentence reduced to one year in prison and a fine of 50,000 Burundian francs (roughly 25 USD), Germain is expected to be released soon.

Mujeres Modatima, as they are known in Spanish, are dedicated to working together in an antipatriarchal movement for water as a human right, confronting extractivism which they say has “dried up entire communities, depriving them of such a vital element”.  
The University Austral de Chile reports that the Petorca Basin has become an icon of unequal access to water, amidst a water crisis 
In response to their efforts to defend access to life giving water, leaders of Mujeres Modatima have suffered surveillance, intimidation, smear campaigns and threats. Meanwhile, authorities have failed to investigate or to protect the women. 
Here are just some of the alarming incidents that represent a pattern of persecution: 
Lorena Donaire Cataldo is a physical education teacher and mother of 3, who is currently the national spokesperson for Mujeres Modatima. 
  Verónica Vilches is a subsistence farmer and president of Rural Drinking Water (Agua Potable Rural or APR), a public program that works to supply drinking water to rural localities, promoting community organisation. Since she took on this work, Verónica began suffering increased surveillance and harassment. 
Carolina Vilches is a geographer, mother, and environmental advocate. In addition to Mujeres Modatima, Carolina belongs to the feminist collective of Petorca, the Union of Rural Drinking Water of the Petorca river basin and a hydro-feminist collective. Carolina was recently elected to form part of the Constituent Convention, the body responsible for drafting a new Chilean constitution following massive demonstrations across Chile in 2019. Like Veronica and Lorena, Carolina has suffered numerous troubling incidents. 
The experience of Carolina, Lorena, Verónica and other members of Mujeres Modatima has taught them to have little faith in the authorities. In some instances, the women have not even been allowed to report crimes committed against them. In other instances, when they were able to make official complaints, investigations were not carried out. The police have failed to provide protection and have told the women there is nothing they can do. 
Send a short, polite letter to the Valparaíso Regional Prosecutor’s Office, the authority responsible for issuing protection measures and investigation orders, with copies to the police authorities responsible for carrying out these orders.

The 100-page report, “‘I Didn’t Feel Like a Human in There’: Immigration Detention in Canada and Its Impact on Mental Health,” documents how people in immigration detention, including those fleeing persecution and seeking protection in Canada, are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. With no set release date, they can be held for months or years. Many are held in provincial jails with the regular jail population and are often subjected to solitary confinement. Those with psychosocial disabilities – or mental health conditions – experience discrimination throughout the process. 
“Canada’s abusive immigration detention system is in stark contrast to the rich diversity and the values of equality and justice that Canada is known for globally,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada. “Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch call on the Canadian authorities to end the inhumane treatment of people in the immigration and refugee protection system by gradually ending immigration detention in Canada.” 
The research included 90 interviews with former immigration detainees and their relatives, mental health experts, academics, lawyers, civil society representatives, and government officials. Researchers also reviewed relevant reports and UN documents, as well as unpublished government documents obtained through 112 access to information requests. 
Immigration detainees are not held on criminal charges or convictions, but many experience the country’s most restrictive confinement conditions, including maximum-security provincial jails and solitary confinement. They are handcuffed, shackled, searched, and restricted to small spaces with rigid routines and under constant surveillance. 
“I felt like the world was ending for me. I wasn’t told what was happening, what I did wrong,” said a woman from a country in Africa who was detained upon arriving in Canada in 2019. “I told [the border officer] everything that happened to me back home, and how I escaped for my life … But she didn’t understand me, and she didn’t let me explain … I thought, ‘Maybe I should have stayed back home and died there.’” 
Between April 2019 and March 2020, Canada locked up 8,825 people between the ages of 15 and 83, including 1,932 in provincial jails. In the same period, another 136 children were “housed” in detention to avoid separating them from their detained parents, including 73 under age 6. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International found that, since 2016, Canada has held more than 300 immigration detainees for longer than a year. 
“Canada prides itself on welcoming refugees and newcomers with open arms, even though it’s one of the few countries in the global north where people seeking safety risk being locked up indefinitely,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “This leaves many without the certainty – or even hope – of knowing when they will be free again, which can have a devastating impact on their mental health.” 
The groups found that people with psychosocial disabilities are more likely to be detained in provincial jails rather than immigration holding centers. In Ontario provincial jails, they are often placed in solitary confinement. They may not be allowed to make independent decisions about their legal matters, with legally appointed representatives making decisions on their behalf. Many also face significant barriers to release and, once they are released, must adhere to stricter release conditions, which can lead to re-arrest if breached. 
“To put it simply, immigration authorities discriminate against people with disabilities by making the conditions of their detention harsher and the terms of their release more onerous than for many other detainees,” Muscati said. “Instead of subjecting people with psychosocial disabilities to punishing conditions in immigration detention, the government should provide psychosocial, legal, and other support services that respect their autonomy and dignity in the community.” 
The groups also found that many immigration detainees develop suicidal thoughts as they begin to lose hope that they will be released. Those fleeing traumatic experiences and persecution are particularly affected. Many former immigration detainees continue to live with the effects of psychosocial disabilities they developed during incarceration months and even years after their release. 
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) remains the only major law enforcement agency in Canada without independent civilian oversight. CBSA’s unchecked exercise of its broad mandate and enforcement powers has repeatedly resulted in serious human rights violations in the context of immigration detention, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. 
Immigration detainees who are from communities of color, particularly detainees who are Black, appear to be held for longer periods, often in provincial jails. In 2019 the largest portion of immigration detainees held for longer than 90 days was from countries in Africa. 
“There should be no place in Canada for racism, cruelty, and human rights violations against people coming to this country seeking safety and a better life,” Nivyabandi said. “We call on Canada to sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture to further prevent these violations and open detention sites for international inspection.” 
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has said that immigration detention “must not take place in facilities such as police stations, remand institutions, prisons,” and it “must not be punitive in nature.” 
The Canadian government should stop holding people with physical or psychosocial disabilities in immigration detention, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. No one should be treated in a punitive manner for immigration-related reasons, including being held in solitary confinement or facilities used for criminal law enforcement, such as jails, or in jail-like facilities. 
“Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, Canadian authorities have released immigration detainees at unprecedented rates,” Muscati said. “Instead of returning to business as usual as the pandemic comes under control in Canada, the government has a real opportunity to overhaul its immigration and refugee protection system to prioritize mental health and human rights.”

With the trial of Aung San Suu Kyi having started on 14 June, the organization further urges all ASEAN member states to finally get behind calls for the release of all those arbitrarily detained in the country and support measures to stop the flow of weapons to the Myanmar military. 
“ASEAN’s usual commitment to non-interference is enabling the military’s deadly rampage, fuelling a human rights and humanitarian crisis that will sink both ASEAN’s credibility and the very stability it seeks to uphold,” said Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research. 
“Millions of people in Myanmar are losing faith in ASEAN. The regional bloc must change course and offer a lifeline to people in Myanmar by getting behind international efforts to protect civilians and urge the release of all those arbitrarily detained, including Aung San Suu Kyi.” 
Aung San Suu Kyi is currently facing a total of seven charges. If found guilty, she can face decades in prison and will effectively be barred from holding office again. Her charges include violating Section 55 of the Anti-Corruption Law, the Official Secrets Act, Section 67 of the Telecommunications Law and the Export and Import Law (possessing walkie talkies in her home). She also faces two charges under Section 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law and “incitement” under Section 505 (b) of the Penal Code. 
“The military is digging deep into its arsenal of repressive laws, including those from the colonial-era, in a desperate attempt to silence Aung San Suu Kyi, opposition leaders and many other vocal critics who have been arbitrarily detained,” said Emerlynne Gil. 
The Myanmar security forces continue to kill, injure and arrest civilians. Since the 1 February coup, an estimated 863 civilians, including 58 children, have been killed and a countless number of people have been injured, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners – Burma (AAPPB). Reports of torture and deaths in custody keep emerging. Internet restrictions remain in place, and media freedom is severely restricted. 
Meanwhile, fighting between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) and groups of protesters taking up arms is escalating and spreading across the country, killing or injuring civilians, damaging civilian properties, and displacing hundreds of thousands of women, men and children. Recent clashes, including air raids, in Karenni or Kayah State alone has displaced estimated 100,000 civilians who are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Approximately 200,000 civilians have been displaced so far this year, adding to over 300,000 existing displaced persons reliant on humanitarian aid. 
High-level meeting exposes faltering ASEAN diplomacy 
On 4 June, a high-level delegation comprised of ASEAN Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi and Erywan Pehin Yusof, the second minister for foreign affairs for Brunei, the current chair of ASEAN, met with coup leader and head of the Myanmar military authorities, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar’s capital. 
The high-level meeting in Nay Pyi Taw reported little tangible progress on ASEAN’s “Five-Point Consensus” on the Myanmar crisis, including calls for the cessation of violence, humanitarian access and the appointment of an ASEAN special envoy on Myanmar. 
ASEAN must implement a call for Myanmar to release arbitrary detainees 
In one welcome advance, in a statement after the meeting, the Chairman of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting, Erywan Pehin Yusof, called for the release of political detainees in Myanmar. 
According to AAPPB, as of 13 June, 4,863 people are currently detained or have been sentenced in in the wake of the 1 February coup, including the country’s elected civilian leadership. 
“The belated commitment of a senior ASEAN official to the release of the political opposition is welcome and essential and we hope that this view is adopted as consensus by ASEAN,” said Emerlynne Gil. “It should also be clear that ASEAN’s mediation efforts would be all but impossible if key stakeholders are all behind bars.” 
“ASEAN should place top priority on demanding that the Myanmar military immediately release not only prominent political detainees, but all of the thousands of people arbitrarily detained, and call for their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” said Emerlynne Gil. 
Shocking lack of progress since ASEAN emergency summit 
The Five-Point Consensus was agreed at an emergency summit in Jakarta attended by Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on 24 April, but the Myanmar military authorities have since repeatedly stated that it would not act upon the plan until the country had reached “stability.” Between the ASEAN summit and 13 June, 115 more people have been killed and 1,474 more people are arbitrarily detained or sentenced. 
“Myanmar’s generals are making a mockery of ASEAN’s meek efforts to lead the international response – continuing to kill, jail, and drive the country into the ground before the ink had dried on ASEAN’s ‘Five Point Consensus’,” said Emerlynne Gil. 
“The regional bloc must get behind efforts at the UN to protect civilians, ensure their humanitarian needs are adequately met, urgently stop the flow of weapons to the military and secure the release of all those arbitrarily detained.” 
Growing calls at the UN for a global arms embargo on Myanmar 
ASEAN states continue to negotiate with the states sponsoring a UN General Assembly resolution to address the human rights crisis in Myanmar, of which only some of the ASEAN members are supportive of a comprehensive arms embargo. 
“ASEAN must support the passing of a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a halt of weapons transfers to the Myanmar military. Anything less is an abdication of ASEAN’s leadership role on the Myanmar crisis, and shows ASEAN is siding with a military that is continuing to kill and imprison unarmed protesters and other civilians. 
Even if adopted, a call for halting transfers by the UNGA has only moral force and may not deter the major arms suppliers to the military – including China, Russia and India. The UN Security Council must urgently then make a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar mandatory for all states to stop the military’s killing spree against its own people. 
“Whether through willful obstruction or internal disagreement, ASEAN has become the Myanmar military’s shield at the highest levels of global diplomacy. Instead, ASEAN states must stand together against rampant military atrocities and urgently get behind the calls for a global and comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar.”

Dear Prime Minister Trudeau, 
June 6th, 2021, marked yet another lethal attack on the Canadian Muslim community. As you are aware, a family was the victim of a premeditated, hate motivated terror attack as they were on a night-time walk. They have been survived solely by a nine-year-old son. Our community lost three generations in a single night. 
The event signals the ongoing reality of Canada’s deeply rooted systemic Islamophobia. Community organizations rallied and asked for concrete action in the aftermath of the Quebec City Mosque shooting in 2017. Unfortunately, these efforts, as seen with the presentation of M-103, were often met with great resistance. The legitimacy of the violence Canadian Muslims experience was questioned, and the reality of Islamophobia was often ignored. 
Outside of our borders Islamophobia continues to be a growing international phenomenon and an industry supported by many governments and organizations globally. Shootings motivated by anti-Muslim hate, paralleling the tragedies in Canada, have taken the lives of our community members in Chapel Hill and Christchurch. To take real action against Islamophobia is to be part of the solution not only nationally but internationally. 
We strongly believe that putting an end to Islamophobia requires that all levels of government take concrete action in addressing Islamophobia at an urgent and systemic level. 
This requires a whole of government approach. We need fundamental change at the federal, provincial, and municipal level to prevent another attack. From appointing a Special Envoy on Islamophobia, to removing discriminatory laws in Canada, to ensuring that anti-racism and anti-Islamophobia becomes part of our education system, to changing the way that municipalities deal with street harassment, a whole of government approach is needed. And change needs to happen now. 
We ask that the Canadian Government immediately host, on an emergency basis, a National Action Summit on Islamophobia convening leaders from all levels of government to chart a path forward for Canada in ending violence against Muslims. The summit is a start. The outcome of the summit, in terms of concrete policy, will be the test of whether all governments and political parties are truly committed to preventing further loss of life. 
As this issue has affected both our community here at home and abroad, in your powers as Prime Minister we ask that prior to the upcoming G7 meeting, you publicly commit to hosting a National Action Summit on Islamophobia, and work with the leaders of the G7 nations on sharing best practices and resources at the National Action Summit on Islamophobia.

0,Guatemala: International organizations demand end to criminalization of justice officials and human rights defenders,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/guatemala-international-organizations-demand-end-criminalization-justice-officials-and-human/,The undersigned organizations express our concern over the increase in criminalization in Guatemala as a strategy to frighten and intimidate those who play significant roles in the fight against impunity in cases of serious human rights violations and corruption. As a result of our work monitoring...,"The undersigned organizations express our concern over the increase in criminalization in Guatemala as a strategy to frighten and intimidate those who play significant roles in the fight against impunity in cases of serious human rights violations and corruption. 
As a result of our work monitoring the human rights situation in the country, we have documented and reported the improper use of criminal law and other legal mechanisms against human rights defenders, prosecutors, former prosecutors, judges, magistrates, former employees of the International Commission against Impunity (CICIG), and defense lawyers, who have been in charge of processes that demonstrate significant advances for justice and the guarantee of human rights. 
We note with concern that these practices appear to constitute a pattern in which the Public Prosecutor’s Office simply processes criminal and administrative complaints that are manifestly unfounded or improper and keeps them open indefinitely. These complaints are generally preceded or accompanied by intense smear and stigmatization campaigns on social networks and in certain media outlets. The purpose of this is to present the people identified as “enemies”, “dangerous”, “criminals” or “terrorists” in the eyes of public opinion and to justify the criminal prosecution against them. On occasions, statements have also been made by public officials against the work carried out by these individuals or the institutions they represent. 
This pattern of criminalization has been observed with greater frequency in recent years, being used especially against members of the Human Rights Prosecutor’s Office and the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity (FECI), against judges of high-risk courts and tribunals that have heard emblematic cases of serious human rights violations linked to the internal armed conflict or those from more recent times; and investigations into large-scale corruption, such as those promoted by the now defunct CICIG, as well as against magistrates of the Constitutional Court (CC). In addition, some of these complaints are driven by the state authorities themselves. 
Recently, on 19 May 2021, a former CICIG analyst who has worked on important investigations – such as the La Línea case against former President Otto Pérez Molina – was arrested along with the former head of the Superintendency of Tax Administration (SAT). These individuals remain in pre-trial detention and, given their profile, are in a high-risk situation, having already received threats in prison due to having investigated many of the people currently in pre-trial detention or convicted. 
We recall that the IACHR has reiterated that “it is the responsibility of the State to protect justice operators against attacks, acts of intimidation, threats and harassment, investigating those who commit violations against their rights and effectively punishing them. If States do not guarantee the security of their justice operators against all kinds of pressures, including reprisals directly aimed at attacking their person and family, the exercise of jurisdictional function may be seriously affected, frustrating effective access to justice.” 
These abusive strategies of criminalization are framed in a context of setbacks and obstruction by some sectors opposed to the fight against impunity in the country, which have expressed their aversion towards those who have contributed to outstanding judicial investigations, even participating in the dissemination of messages and images that constitute discrimination due to race, gender or sexual orientation. 
We recall that state authorities must ensure that disciplinary and criminal proceedings to which individuals may be subjected for alleged misconduct or crimes are not instrumentalized and used in an abusive manner to the point of becoming tools of harassment to hinder the work of these officials. In this regard, the United Nations Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Magistrates has repeatedly expressed his concern about the improper use of legal measures that interfere with the work of justice operators and undermine judicial independence in the country. 
In light of the above, the undersigned organizations urge the Guatemalan authorities to take action to guarantee the independence of justice officials, the right to due process and to guarantee the right to defend human rights in general. In particular, we consider it essential that the Attorney General take urgent steps to dismiss pending criminal complaints that are unfounded and to generate clear guidelines to prevent the use of the criminal justice system as a tool to harass those who oppose impunity in Guatemala. 
Guatemala cannot regress into impunity. The work of human rights defenders and justice officials is essential to sustain and consolidate the progress that has been made in access to justice and the strengthening of the rule of law.

0,China: Draconian repression of Muslims in Xinjiang amounts to crimes against humanity,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/china-draconian-repression-muslims-xinjiang-amounts-crimes-against-humanity/,"Hundreds of thousands of Muslim minority men and women subjected to mass internment and torture Millions of Muslims subjected to systematized mass surveillance Muslim ethnic groups forced to abandon their religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages More than 50 former camp...","Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region face systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity, Amnesty International said as it launched a new report and campaign today. 
In the 160-page report, ‘Like We Were Enemies in a War’: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang’, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team released dozens of new testimonies from former detainees detailing the extreme measures taken by Chinese authorities since 2017 to essentially root out the religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages of the region’s Muslim ethnic groups. Carried out under the guise of fighting “terrorism”, these crimes have targeted ethnic Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Hui, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Tajiks. 
Chinese authorities have built one of the world’s most sophisticated surveillance systems and a vast network of hundreds of grim “transformation-through-education” centres – actually, internment camps – throughout Xinjiang. Torture and other ill-treatment is systematic in the camps and every aspect of daily life is regimented in an effort to forcibly instil a secular, homogeneous Chinese nation and Communist party ideals. 
“The Chinese authorities have created a dystopian hellscape on a staggering scale in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities face crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations that threaten to erase their religious and cultural identities.” 
“It should shock the conscience of humanity that massive numbers of people have been subjected to brainwashing, torture and other degrading treatment in internment camps, while millions more live in fear amid a vast surveillance apparatus.” 
Mass imprisonment 
The report documents how, since early 2017, huge numbers of men and women from predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang have been arbitrarily detained. They include hundreds of thousands who have been sent to prisons in addition to hundreds of thousands – perhaps even a million or more – who have been sent to internment camps. 
All of the more than 50 former detainees Amnesty International interviewed were detained for what appears to be entirely lawful conduct, such as possessing a religious-themed picture or communicating with someone abroad. A government cadre who participated in mass arrests in late 2017 told the organization how police took people from their homes without warning and detained them without any due process. 
Most survivors who spoke to Amnesty International were first interrogated at police stations, where they had their biometric and medical data recorded before being transferred to a camp. They were often interrogated in “tiger chairs” – steel chairs with affixed leg irons and handcuffs that restrain the body in painful positions. Beatings, sleep deprivation and overcrowding are rampant in the police stations, and detainees reported being hooded and shackled during their interrogation and transfer. 
From the moment they entered the prison-like internment camps, detainees’ lives were extraordinarily regimented. They had no privacy or autonomy, and they faced harsh punishments – sometimes collectively with their cellmates – for trivial disobedience. Internees were forbidden to speak freely to each other, and they were severely punished when they responded to prison guards or other officials in their native tongues instead of Mandarin. Every activity in the detainees’ daily routine was pre-ordained and their behaviour was constantly monitored and evaluated. 
One woman who was detained for having WhatsApp on her phone said: “[Every day] you get up at 5am and have to make your bed, and it had to be perfect. Then there was a flag-raising ceremony and an ‘oath-taking’. Then you went to the canteen for breakfast. Then to the classroom. Then lunch. Then to the classroom. Then dinner. Then another class. Then bed. Every night two people had to be ‘on duty’ [monitoring the other cellmates] for two hours… There was not a minute left for yourself. You are exhausted.” 
In the early weeks or months of internment, detainees are typically forced to either sit still or kneel in the same position in their cell, in complete silence, for most of their waking hours. Following this, they generally undergo forced “education”, where they are indoctrinated to disavow Islam, forgo using their language and other cultural practices, and study Mandarin Chinese language and Chinese Communist Party propaganda. 
Other than being escorted under armed guard to and from canteens, classes or interrogation, detainees practically never leave their cells and rarely see sunlight or have outdoor access or exercise. 
Systematic torture 
Every former detainee Amnesty International interviewed suffered torture or other ill-treatment. 
This included the cumulative psychological effect of their daily dehumanization, as well as physical torture in the form of beatings, electric shocks, solitary confinement, deprivation of food, water and sleep, exposure to extreme cold, and the abusive use of restraints, including torture tools like tiger chairs. Some reported being restrained in a tiger chair for 24 hours or more. 
An older woman who was punished for defending her cellmate said she was taken to a small, dark, cold and windowless room where she had her hands and feet cuffed and was forced to sit on an iron chair for three days straight. 
Two former detainees said they had been forced to wear heavy shackles – in one case for an entire year. Others described being shocked with electric batons or sprayed with pepper spray. 
Some detainees reported being tortured multiple times, while others were forced to watch their cellmates being tortured. Amnesty International learned of one case where a detainee is believed to have died as a result of being restrained in a tiger chair, in front of his cellmates, for 72 hours, during which time he urinated and defecated on himself. 
Surveillance state 
Both inside and outside the camps, Xinjiang’s Muslims are among the most heavily surveilled populations in the world. 
For at least several months after being released from a camp, all former internees are under near-constant electronic and in-person surveillance, including invasive “homestays” by government cadres who monitor them and report “suspicious” behaviour. This could be peaceful religious practices, the use of unauthorized communications software (such as VPNs or WhatsApp), or purchasing an “unusual” amount of fuel or electricity. 
Freedom of movement for released internees is also heavily restricted, with a massive number of security forces patrolling the streets and operating thousands of checkpoints, euphemistically known as “convenience police stations”. 
Religious persecution 
Muslims are not free to practice their religion in Xinjiang. Dozens of Muslim men and women told Amnesty International the regional Chinese authorities showed extraordinary hostility towards their Islamic faith. Basic religious and cultural practices have been deemed “extremist” and used as grounds for detention. 
As a result, most people have stopped praying or showing any outward signs of observing Islam. This extends to dress, grooming and even speech. “We couldn’t say ‘as-salamu-alaykum’ [a typical greeting in many Islamic cultures meaning “peace be upon you”] …anymore,” one man told Amnesty International. Qur’ans, prayer mats and other religious artifacts have effectively been banned. 
Former Chinese government cadres told Amnesty International how they barged into people’s homes to confiscate religious items. “We told them to remove photos [of mosques] and put up [Chinese] flags,” one said. 
Those interviewed by Amnesty International described how mosques, shrines, gravesites, and other religious and cultural sites have been systematically demolished or repurposed throughout Xinjiang. 
Massive cover-up 
The Chinese government has gone to extraordinary lengths to cover up its violations of international human rights law in Xinjiang. Authorities threaten, detain and mistreat anyone who speaks out. 
The fate of hundreds of thousands of detainees is not known. Many may remain in detention in the camps. Others have been given long prison sentences – Chinese state data shows significant increases in prison sentences and satellite imagery shows significant new prison construction in Xinjiang since 2017. Others have been transferred to situations of forced or coerced labour. 
“China must immediately dismantle the internment camps, release the people arbitrarily detained in them and in prisons, and end the systematic attacks against Muslims in Xinjiang,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“The international community must speak out and act in unison to end this abomination, once and for all. The UN must establish and urgently dispatch an independent investigative mechanism with a view to bringing those suspected of responsibility for crimes under international law to account.” 
NOTES TO EDITORS 
1. The report’s findings are based primarily on first-hand testimonies gathered from October 2019 to April 2021, as well as analysis of satellite imagery and data and leaked government documents. Amnesty International interviewed over 50 former detainees, most of whom had never spoken out before, as well as many other people who had been to Xinjiang since 2017, more than 70 family members of people missing or detained, government informants, journalists and others. 
2. As a result of security concerns, nearly all of these interviews were conducted on the condition that Amnesty International refrain from publishing the interviewee’s name and/or any information that could be used to identify the interviewee, the interviewee’s family, or anyone else who might be at risk if they were to be identified. Pseudonyms have been used in all cases in the report. 
3. Alongside the report, Amnesty International is launching a new campaign with case files of over 60people from Muslim minorities who are missing and believed to be detained in Xinjiang’s internment camps or prisons. The organization will actively campaign for them, and all those arbitrarily detained in the camps or prisons, to be released. 
Amnesty International collaborated with the renowned artist Molly Crabapple to create a series of 30 stunning original illustrations depicting the harrowing scenes described in the former detainees’ testimonies. These can be seen throughout the report and on the multimedia site.

Two years later, on June 3, 2021, the government of Canada released the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+...","On June 3, 2019, the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls released its final report, with 231 Calls for Justice. 
Two years later, on June 3, 2021, the government of Canada released the 2021 Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People National Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People. 
The National Action Plan (NAP) was expected to outline how all levels of government will transform the National Inquiry’s 231 Calls for Justice into concrete actions to end the staggeringly high rates of violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit people. It is accompanied by C$2.2 billion in the 2021 federal budget, to be spent over five years to address the violence. 
The NAP articulates guiding principles and government commitments to ways of working with Indigenous peoples to implement the plan. It also provides a high-level summary of some short-term federal, provincial and territorial government commitments to action. A network of working groups comprised of and led by Indigenous peoples provided guidance to government on the actions needed to implement the Calls for Justice and summaries from each working group are included in the plan. 
The NAP, however, falls short of articulating a comprehensive list of government priorities, with associated goals, objectives, and implementation timelines clearly connected to each of the 231 Calls for Justice. 
The federal government acknowledged that the NAP is incomplete, stating that “The first step in the National Action Plan is to identify short-term priorities which are similar among the Contributing Partners. Following this, an implementation plan will be developed which will include medium- and long-term priorities, as well as specific actions for each priority, timelines, resources, and who will be responsible for achieving each action. Further, as an evergreen document, it is recognized that the National Action Plan will continue to grow and change as priorities shift or change, or as new priorities are identified.” It further stated that, “reporting and accountability mechanisms will be created, including regular updates to ensure the plan remains meaningful and effective and to track progress in a way that captures the impact of actions “on the ground”.” 
Indigenous organizations had a broad spectrum of responses to the NAP. Some organizations applauded the plan’s distinctions-based approach and commitment to co-creating action plans with Indigenous peoples. Some organizations cautiously welcomed the NAP, calling for further details and concrete action without delay. And some organizations condemned the plan for being so delayed and short on action, and were concerned about the exclusion of some Indigenous activists and organizations in the plan’s creation. Some organizations wondered how 2021 budget commitments could be implemented in the absence of a detailed implementation plan. 
When the National Inquiry concluded its work, Amnesty International called on Canada to “move beyond the piecemeal approach to ending the violence that has tragically failed First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, two-spirit people, families, and communities.” The incomplete plan released on June 3 is a continuation of the piecemeal approach, with disconnected plans continuing to be developed by each level of government. There is a need for locally adapted, distinctions-based approaches to action. But there is also a need to ensure consistency, so that no matter where a person lives, they have access to the same level of services and supports. 
The solutions to ending violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people been known for a long time. Indigenous womens’ organizations, human rights groups, Parliamentary Committees, and international human rights bodies made recommendations for many years on concretely what needed to be done to end the violence. The National Inquiry’s final report reiterated many of these recommendations. And yet, two years after the National Inquiry concluded its work, government still does not have a clear and detailed plan to address the violence. This is unacceptable.   
Amnesty International is disappointed to see so little reference to policing reforms called for by the National Inquiry. Actions needed to address violence associated with resource development projects received scant mention. And while the NAP did address the need to address racism in healthcare, it did not specifically address forced and coerced sterilization, which the UN has affirmed is a form of torture that Canada must specifically address. 
Canada has also committed to developing a separate action plan to prevent and address all forms of gender-based violence in Canada. It remains unclear how the NAP will be connected to this related action plan. 
As Canada moves forward with implementing the NAP, Amnesty International would like to know: 
The NAP is over 100 pages and included summaries from working groups. Where publicly available, the full submissions from these entities are provided here: 
Only the Yukon and Ontario provided complete action plans. Some provinces and territories provided details in the NAP on the timeline and process to create their action plans.

Additional Information 
Despite taking welcome steps to roll back some discriminatory and xenophobic policies of the past, President Joseph Biden and his administration in the USA have yet to follow through on a number of immigration reforms pledged and must immediately change course on immigration detention. Shortly after he took office, ICE had detained 13,860 people in early February. As of June 2, this number has skyrocketed over 66 percent to 23,107. Furthermore, thousands of others are being summarily expelled without being given the opportunity to request protection.  Black and brown immigrants and asylum seekers make up the overwhelming majority of those detained, and they have long faced added discrimination and human rights abuses at the hands of ICE. 
Amnesty International is calling on the Biden administration and its relevant agencies to release people in immigration detention through an affirmative file review process with a presumption of liberty, phase out ICE contracts with private prison companies and county jails, and end family detention. Instead of immigration detention, the presumption should be liberty, with asylum-seekers and immigrants allowed to live in the community, supported by sponsors, community-based services, and case management programs. 
Detention of asylum seekers should only be a measure of last resort, after other non-custodial alternatives have proven or been deemed insufficient in relation to the individual. According to the UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the detention of asylum-seekers solely on the base of their immigration status can “very quickly, if not immediately” constitute ill-treatment against individuals in situations of increased vulnerability, specifically including women, older people, persons with medical conditions, or social minorities including LGBTI persons. 
Under international law, the USA government has an obligation to ensure that the human rights of migrants and asylum seekers are respected, protected, and fulfilled. In its July 2017 report on a country visit to the US, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said that: “the mandatory detention of immigrants, especially asylum seekers, is contrary to international human rights and refugee rights standards.[…] The Working Group has observed that the current system of detaining immigrants and asylum seekers is, in many cases, punitive, unreasonably long, unnecessary, costly when there are alternative community-based solutions, […] not based on an individualized assessment of the necessity and proportionality of detention, carried out in degrading conditions, and a deterrent to legitimate asylum claims.” 
The United States of America government is under an obligation not to return individuals to a situation in which they would be at risk of torture or other serious human rights abuses: the principle of non-refoulement. Such safeguards are imperative for protecting refugees fleeing violence and persecution. Persecution of LGBTI people in Nicaragua has been consistently observed and documented by Amnesty International and virtually every other organization that closely reports on the conditions of the country, including the USA Department of State. 
For at least the past 10 years, the US Department of State’s Nicaragua County Reports have highlighted the widespread “attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons” Among the findings of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) report was that persecution of the LGBTI people in Nicaragua led to their forced migration; LGBTI organizations in Nicaragua experience a number of attacks; and  LGBTI people from the Atlantic Coast were subject to “debasement, humiliation, and instances of stoning.”  Nicaragua has a history of systemic persecution of the LGBTI community, and this has accelerated since the Spring 2018 protests. Maura’s status as a transgender woman puts her at risk of violence and persecution at the hands of Nicaraguan authorities if she is returned to Nicaragua.

Amnesty International is continuing to monitor, verify and document...","The voices of victims of violence, abuses and police repression must dominate the agenda of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) during its visit to Colombia between 8 and 10 June, said Amnesty International today. 
Amnesty International is continuing to monitor, verify and document the excessive use of force and human rights violations against peaceful demonstrators in Bogotá, Cali, Pereira, Popayán, Madrid and Facatativá, among other cities. The organization has verified audiovisual material showing the indiscriminate and disproportionate use of lethal and less lethal weapons by the Colombian police, in particular ESMAD (mobile riot police units), which have resulted in serious injuries and the deaths of dozens of people, according to reports by human rights organizations on the ground. 
“In addition to the complaints of victims of human rights violations in the context of the violent repression of protests by the security forces, we have received grave reports of continuing violence against communities in rural areas of the country. The repression against Indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombian communities, community leaders and human rights defenders continues. These voices have been ignored for decades; it is time for the Colombian authorities to acknowledge that social discontent is a consequence of that violence and abandonment,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The IACHR must hear first-hand the testimonies of hundreds of victims who are demanding truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-repetition for the human rights violations committed in the context of the repression of protests; guarantee the space to listen to the voices of historically marginalized communities; and include analysis of the structural causes that have fuelled social discontent.” 
Reports from human rights organizations and platforms highlight the constant police repression since the start of the National Strike. The campaign Defender la Libertad es Asunto de Todas has reported that between 28 April and 2 June there had been 76 homicides, mostly of young people, 34 of which were allegedly caused by the actions of the security forces in the context of the demonstrations. The campaign also reported that 988 people sustained injuries as a result of the excessive use of force by ESMAD; 74 of those wounded had eye injuries. The NGO Temblores reported that as of 31 May, there had been 3,789 cases of unwarranted police violence and 1,649 protesters had been arbitrarily arrested. 
Reports indicate that there have been 151 attacks against human rights defenders in the context of demonstrations. They include Daniela Soto, a young Indigenous woman from the Sa’th Tama Kiwe reserve, leader of the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council (CRIC) and a human rights defender, who was seriously injured on 9 May in Cali; and the killing of Sebastián Jacanamejoy, a young Indigenous defender, on 28 May during a demonstration in Cali. 
There are also an alarming number of reports of people feared missing in the context of the National Strike. At the end of a month of mobilizations, the Working Group on Forced Disappearances had recorded 775 people feared disappeared, the whereabouts of 327 of whom remain unknown, and urged the relevant institutions to activate the search and location mechanisms urgently. The Working Group has documented cases indicating that members of the police and ESMAD were responsible for carrying out hundreds of arbitrary arrests which were not registered or overseen by supervisory bodies. 
“The Colombian authorities must act with due diligence to investigate reports of enforced disappearances in the context of social mobilization and activate search mechanisms, as a matter of priority. These practices are aimed at instilling fear to silence the voices of peaceful protesters. The silence of Iván Duque’s government in the face of these crimes is unacceptable. The IACHR’s visit is a beacon of hope for thousands of families who are still looking for their loved ones,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
The Ombudsperson’s Office reported that it has verified 106 cases of gender-based violence against women and people with diverse sexual orientation and gender identity. Such incidents have been reported in various parts of Colombia, including the departments of Valle del Cauca, Cauca, Antioquia, Nariño and Boyacá, among others. The accounts of survivors of sexual violence committed by members of the security forces are heartrending, and describe torture, cruel and inhuman treatment, psychological violence and sexual abuse and harassment, aimed at instilling fear and punishing them for their participation in the demonstrations. 
Amnesty International is also concerned at repeated statements by national authorities that criminalize social protests – which are largely peaceful – and thereby justify the excessive use of force against the population. The authorities have an obligation to recognize that peaceful protest is a right and that it must be protected. 
The statements of President Duque and other high-ranking officials about the alleged “terrorist purposes” of the peaceful marches must stop. The militarized response to the protests in Colombia, provided for by Decree 575, issued on 28 May, is in breach of Colombia’s international human rights obligations. 
In addition to an environment in which those who exercise their right to peacefully protest are stigmatized, there are credible reports that people in civilian clothes, acting with the acquiescence and acceptance of the security forces, have killed and injured protesters in several cities. The situation in Cali is of particular concern, where images and videos have circulated of heavily armed civilians repressing protesters with the acquiescence and acceptance of police officers. Amnesty International has received worrying reports of more than 55 violent deaths in Cali in which members of the security forces and armed civilians were allegedly implicated. 
In this context of violence, the Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP) reported that, between 28 April and 4 May, there were 87 physical attacks against journalists covering National Strike demonstrations. They also reported 42 threats, nine cases of arbitrary detention and 13 instances of material being deleted. Amnesty International is concerned about the reported attacks on journalists and reiterates that the authorities must respect the freedom of the press and guarantee that those engaged in journalistic activities are able to cover events safely. 
The IACHR has an opportunity to help ensure that impunity does not prevail in the cases of the thousands of people demanding justice, truth and reparation. Amnesty International believes that the visit can make a fundamental contribution to overcoming the human rights crisis in the country. In this context, victims must have accessible channels to obtain information on the visit to ensure that their testimonies are heard by the IACHR. 
Finally, Amnesty International calls on the Colombian authorities to guarantee that the IACHR can carry out its visit without undue interference, so that it can meet with all the authorities, organizations, individuals and communities that it deems necessary and pertinent to fulfil its mandate. The authorities must also provide the necessary travel facilities and refrain from using security as an excuse to restrict the IACHR’s work, as well as guaranteeing the safety of people who come before the IACHR and ensuring that they are not subjected to threats, reprisals or actions aimed at discrediting them.

“Five family members were simply out for a walk and now four of them are dead – all, according to police reports, because they were targeted and attacked for their Islamic faith. Not only were four innocent lives taken, but a young 9-year-old must face life without his parents, grandparent, and sibling. It is horrific and deeply disturbing that such an egregious act of Islamophobia could still occur today. Hatred and discrimination, regardless of who it targets, must be condemned. We join the National Council of Canadian Muslims in calling for justice in what is reported to be a hate-motivated crime.    
“Our hearts go out to the loved ones of this family, and the broader Muslim community, who are now grieving this tragic loss. No one should be made to feel unsafe in their community. We call on everyone in Canada, and beyond, to come together in solidarity, denounce Islamophobia and white supremacy in all its forms and for governments to work together and adequately resource a concrete and robust action plan to address Islamophobia and other forms of hate.” 
Background 
On Sunday, June 6, five family members were walking in London, Ontario, when they were struck by a pickup truck. Three adults and one teenager have died, and a child is in hospital with serious injuries. A 20-year-old man has been charged with four counts of first-degree murder. London police have said they believe the attack was intentional and that the family was targeted because of their faith. 
A campaign has been launched to support the surviving boy and his family.

“Raman Pratasevich’s forced ‘confession’ on Belarusian state TV was devastating to watch. He was plainly on the edge of breaking down, in tears and with visible wounds on his wrists, as he was forced to incriminate himself and praise his captors. It was a televised coercion.”  
“Yesterday’s degrading and humiliating ‘interview’, showing Raman Pratasevich to be under intolerable psychological pressure, amounts to ill-treatment and those behind this travesty must be held accountable. Raman Pratasevich has been deprived of his liberty and is facing a lengthy prison term solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression.  
“We note the strong international condemnation of Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s regime, including by European Union countries, and call on governments to do their utmost to end the human rights crisis in Belarus. All perpetrators of torture, killings and other crimes under international law in Belarus must be held accountable in accordance with international law, and available transnational justice mechanisms must be enacted.”  
Background  
The Belarusian journalist and blogger Raman Pratasevich, who co-founded the popular opposition Telegram channel NEXTA, was arrested on 23 May after his Lithuania-bound flight was diverted and forced to land in Minsk. On the evening of 3 June, Belarus’ state-run TV channel ONT aired an ‘interview’ with him during which he confessed to plotting anti-government protests and praised Belarusian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka. As he was questioned by Marat Markau, the TV host, Raman Pratasevich cried several times and covered his face with his hands. This made it possible to see visible marks on his wrists. 
Raman Pratasevich is charged under Articles 293(1) (“Organization  of  mass  disorders”),  342(1) (“Organization or active participation in group actions that severely violate public order”) and 130(3) (“Incitement of racial, ethnic, religious or other social hatred or enmity”) of the Criminal Code.

Salutation:           Dear Mr. Raisi 
Additional Information 
Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari maintain that they peacefully participated in protests that took place in Shiraz, Fars province, between late December 2017 and early January 2018, and also between late July and early August 2018. The protesters expressed a mix of grievances ranging from complaints over poverty and corruption to outright rejection of the Islamic Republic system, which many protesters denounced as a “clerical dictatorship”. 
Following extensive review of court documents and other legal documents pertaining to Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari cases, Amnesty International has concluded that their convictions and sentences are flagrantly unjust and amount to a miscarriage of justice. The authorities have violated the fair trial rights of Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari, including the rights to access effective assistance of an independent lawyer of their own choosing; to be promptly informed of charges against them; to remain silent and not to incriminate themselves; to challenge the lawfulness of detention before an independent, impartial tribunal; to be protected from torture and other ill-treatment; to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence; to obtain full access to relevant evidence; to call, examine and cross-examine witnesses; to challenge the authenticity of evidence; to receive a fair, public hearing before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal; to have a meaningful review of their convictions and sentences by a higher court. 
Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari were arrested in September and December 2018, and subsequently forcibly disappeared for 12 days and 35 days, respectively. They reported in written complaints and in court that between their arrests and the April 2019 completion of the investigation stage, they were repeatedly tortured and otherwise ill-treated to “confess”. They said they were held in prolonged solitary confinement, repeatedly punched, kicked, and beaten with sticks and cables while blindfolded, and psychologically tortured, including through death threats and threats to imprison, kill, sexually assault or otherwise harm their family members. Habib Afkari has reported that for several days in a row, intelligence agents also chained him to a chair and wrapped his face and head in a plastic sheet in a way that made him feel like he was suffocating. According to an official medical note dated 30 October 2019, Habib Afkari’s left shoulder was dislocated and his left wrist and one of his toes were fractured. Vahid Afkari attempted suicide on 26 October 2018 and 2 April 2019; both times, authorities failed to provide him with adequate physical and mental health care and prematurely interrupted his hospital treatment against written medical warnings. The brothers’ repeated requests for their allegations of torture to be investigated were dismissed and ignored. 
Seven of the eight charges that Habib Afkari was convicted of by Criminal Court 2 of Shiraz in July 2019 and the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in June 2020, and five of the six charges Vahid Afkari was convicted of by Criminal Court 2 of Shiraz in July 2019 and the Revolutionary Court of Shiraz in December 2020, are vague and overly broad “national-security” related charges. They are not internationally recognizable charges and have been consistently used to criminalize the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in Iran. They include “disrupting public order”, “criminal” conduct falling short of “spreading corruption on earth”, “insulting the Supreme Leader”, “defying public officials on duty”, “insulting public officials on duty”, “membership in a group for the purpose of disrupting national security”, and “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against people’s lives and properties”. Some of the alleged activities cited in the prosecution’s case involved peaceful conduct such as “repeated” participation and chanting in protests characterized as “unlawful” by the authorities and writing slogans on walls. The other cited activities involved alleged discussions that the authorities claim the brothers had at various times in 2018 about possibly committing arson and assault to fight against the Islamic Republic system, but never carried out. The authorities do not provide any evidence in this relation and solely rely on the defendant’s forced “confessions”. 
The only charges which are internationally recognizable offences are “accessory to murder” in the case of Vahid Afkari, which accounts for 25 years of his prison sentence, and in the case of Habib Afkari “deliberately inflicting injuries with a sharp object”, which accounts for eight months of his prison sentence. Amnesty International’s research shows that the prosecution authorities failed to present any credible evidence for these charges; Vahid Afkari and Habib Afkari were convicted of these charges essentially on the basis of their torture-tainted “confessions” by Criminal Court 1 of Fars in October 2019 and Criminal Court 2 of Shiraz in July 2019, respectively. In dismissing the requests of Vahid Afkari to exclude his torture-tainted “confessions” as evidence and order investigations, Criminal Court 1 of Fars province said he and his brother Navid Afkari had raised allegations of torture “under the influence of what they had been taught [by inmates] in prison and their idea was that by denying the reality, they may be able to evade punishment”.

Mustafa Al-Darwish was arrested in 2015 for allegedly participating in anti-government riots in the Shi’a majority Eastern Province.

Additional Information 
On 28 March 2018, Mustafa al-Darwish was sentenced to death over charges including “participation in armed rebellion against the rulers, blocking roads and sowing discord”, “forming… an armed terrorist network and firing at security officials”, “seeking to disrupt national cohesion through his participation in more than 10 riots”, “making Molotov cocktails for the purpose of undermining state security and throwing them at security patrol” and violating Article 6 of the Anti-Cyber Crime Law by “storing information that prejudice public order.” He told the judge in one of his trial sessions that “my confession is not valid as I was threatened, beaten and tortured into giving a confession. I was also tortured in sensitive areas of my body that made me lose consciousness. I confessed in fear for my life.” Mustafa Al-Darwish also told the court that while confirming his confession before a judge, the judge also threatened him with further beating and torture if he didn’t sign the confession. 
Amnesty International has documented the pattern of repression targeting the Shi’a community in Saudi Arabia, namely through the Specialized Criminal Court that has issued harsh prison sentences and death sentences following grossly unfair trials, marred by allegations of torture during detention which the prosecution has failed systematically to investigate. 
In a shocking execution spree on 23 April 2019, Saudi Arabia executed 37 people convicted on “terrorism” charges by the Specialized Criminal Court, among them was a young Shi’a man who was convicted of a crime that took place while he was under the age of 18. Also among those executed was Abdulkareem al-Hawaj – a young Shi’a man who was arrested at the age of 16 and convicted of offences related to his involvement in anti-government protests. Under international law, the use of the death penalty against people who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime is strictly prohibited. 
The majority of those executed then were Shi’a men who were convicted after sham trials that violated international fair trial standards which relied on confessions extracted through torture. They were subjected to prolonged pre-trial detention and told the court that they were tortured or otherwise ill-treated during their interrogation to have ‘confessions’ extracted from them. Amnesty International understands that the families of the executed men were not informed about the executions in advance and were shocked to learn of the news. 
Additionally, three young men from the Shi’a minority continue to be detained for crimes they committed when they were under 18, they are: Ali al-Nimr, Dawood al-Marhoon and Abdullah al-Zaher. The three men were on death row and at imminent risk of execution for over six years following grossly unfair trials, until the Specialized Criminal Court commuted their death sentences in February 2021, and re-sentenced them to 10-year prison terms inclusive of time served, meaning that they could be released in 2022. 
It remains important to note that in April 2020, Saudi Arabia issued a Royal Order announcing plans to end its use of the death penalty for people under the age of 18 in discretionary cases not involving the counter-terror law. This follows the issuing of a 2018 Law on Juveniles, which prevents judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those under 15 years old. These announcements must be followed by clear implementing regulations which do not exclude any minors from the reform. 
The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. Amnesty International always opposes the death penalty, regardless of who is accused, the crime, their guilt or innocence or the method of execution.

Additional Information 
Shahnewaz Chowdhury, 37, was arrested from his Gandamara residence in Banshkhali, a sub-district in the southeast of Bangladesh, at 12:05am on 28 May 2021. Police lodged a case against him under the draconian Digital Security Act for a Facebook post where he shared his personal opinion that was critical about a power plant in his area. 
In the Facebook post, he stated, “Breaking News: The people of Banshkhali thought that the environmentally destructive coal power plant, which became the cause of the killing of 12 people, would have set afloat the Gandamara Union in the tide of development. But in reality, Gandamara is drowning in the tidal surge. The youth of Banshkhali must resist injustice and support development through fearless writing.” 
In April 2021, a writ petition filed by five rights organizations said that at least 12 people were killed in different incidents at the power plant in Banshkhali in 2016, 2017 and most recently in April 2021. In 2016, at least four people were killed when police opened fire at protesters for resisting the construction of the power plant. In April 2021, at least seven more people were killed when police again opened fire at protesters who were demanding from the plant authorities unpaid wages and reduced working hours during Ramadan, observed by Muslims worldwide as the month of fasting. 
An official of the Banshkhali Power Plant accused Shahnewaz Chowdhury of publishing “false and offensive” information, “tarnishing the reputation of SS Power 1 Limited (power plant company)” and “creating animosity, instability and chaos” with his Facebook post under sections 25, 29 and 31 of the Digital Security Act. 
Shahnewaz Chowdhury’s defence counsel has argued that the Facebook post does not carry any direct allegation against the power plant or any hate speech or derogatory element. It means that 12 people have been killed due to protest related to the power plant, he stated. Yet, a lower court in Banshkhali sent Shahnewaz Chowdhury to jail on 30 May 2021 after rejecting the bail application filed by his defence counsel. 
The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that the right to freedom of expression protects the expression of every form of idea and opinion including political discourse, commentary on public affairs and discussion of human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Bangladesh is a state party. The UN Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression and on the situation of human rights defenders have said that the sections in the act, including those used against Shahnewaz Chowdhury, criminalize large categories of speech in vague and broad terms. They said that the Digital Security Act affords Bangladesh’s “Government broad discretion to unduly penalize individuals for holding or sharing personal opinions, creating a chilling effect on legitimate exercises of the right to freedom of expression.” 
Despite Bangladesh’s international commitment to protect the right to freedom of expression, Shahnewaz Chowdhury is being punished simply for expressing his opinion on Facebook. 
The Digital Security Act is a law consisting of vague and overbroad provisions that are increasingly being used to target people from all walks of life solely for expressing dissent and exercising their right to freedom of expression online. In February 2021, Mushtaq Ahmed, a Bangladeshi writer died in prison after languishing there for 10 months in pretrial detention for criticizing on Facebook the Bangladeshi government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Additional Information 
The enforced disappearance of hundreds of boys and men in the city of Saqlawiya in June 2016 was not an isolated incident. Since the emergence of the group calling itself the Islamic State (IS) and other armed groups, including al-Qa’ida, in Iraq, thousands of Sunni men and boys have been subjected to enforced disappearance by Iraqi security forces and state-backed militias against the backdrop of ongoing armed conflict, insecurity and rising sectarian tensions. 
According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Iraq has the highest number of missing people in the world. The number could range from 250,000 to one million. Amnesty International has documented dozens of enforced disappearances since 2014 in the governorates of Anbar, Baghdad, Diyala and Salah al-Din. On 21 September 2016, Amnesty International sent details of 105 individual cases of enforced disappearance which took place between September 2012 and August 2016 to previous Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, calling on him to ensure that prompt, independent and impartial investigations are carried out with a view to establishing the fate and whereabouts of the disappeared and bringing those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts. 
Previous government led investigations into serious human rights violations committed by the PMU also failed to provide remedy and reparation for victims. For instance, results of announced investigations into the unlawful killings and other abuses by the PMU in Barwana village and Muqdadiya city in Diyala governorate, that took place on 26 January 2015 and on 11 January 2016, respectively, have neither been made public nor held any members of PMU accountable, to the best knowledge of Amnesty International. 
Iraq is a party to the International Convention on the protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.  Iraq’s Law on Mass Graves Affairs stipulates that mass graves should be investigated by an inter-governmental committee that includes a judge. However, to this date, authorities exhuming mass graves in the surrounding areas of Saqlawiya could not confirm if the remains found belong to any or all of the 643 men and boys.

The NYPD has used facial recognition in 22,000 cases since 2017 – but refuses to disclose details. One of these cases involved the harassment and attempted arrest...","The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has the ability to track people in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx by running images from 15,280 surveillance cameras into invasive and discriminatory facial recognition software, a new Amnesty International investigation reveals today. 
Thousands of volunteers from around the world participated in the investigation, tagging 15,280 surveillance cameras at intersections across Manhattan (3,590), Brooklyn (8,220) and the Bronx (3,470). Combined, the three boroughs account for almost half of the intersections (47%) in New York City, constituting a vast surface area of pervasive surveillance. 
“This sprawling network of cameras can be used by police for invasive facial recognition and risk turning New York into an Orwellian surveillance city,” says Matt Mahmoudi, Artificial Intelligence & Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International. 
“You are never anonymous. Whether you’re attending a protest, walking to a particular neighbourhood, or even just grocery shopping – your face can be tracked by facial recognition technology using imagery from thousands of camera points across New York.” 
East New York in Brooklyn, an area that is 54.4% Black, 30% Hispanic and 8.4% White according to the latest census data, was found to be the most surveilled neighbourhood in all three boroughs, with an alarming 577 cameras found at intersections. 
Facial recognition technology threatens the right to protest and risks supercharging racist policing 
The NYPD has used facial recognition technology (FRT) in 22,000 cases since 2017 — half of which were in 2019 alone. When camera imagery is run through FRT, the NYPD is able to track every New Yorker’s face as they move through the city. 
FRT works by comparing camera imagery with millions of faces stored in its databases, many scraped from sources including social media without users’ knowledge or consent. The technology is widely recognized as amplifying racially discriminatory policing and can threaten the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and privacy. 
In the summer of 2020, it was likely used to identify and track a participant at a Black Lives Matter protest, Derrick ‘Dwreck’ Ingram, who allegedly shouted into a police officer’s ear.  Police officers were unable to produce a search warrant when they arrived at his apartment. 
Amnesty International, and coalition partners of the Ban the Scan campaign, submitted numerous Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) requests to the NYPD, requesting more information about the extent of facial recognition usage in light of Dwreck’s case. They were dismissed, along with a subsequent appeal. 
“There has been a glaring lack of information around the NYPD’s use of facial recognition software – making it impossible for New Yorkers to know if and when their face is being tracked across the city,” says Matt Mahmoudi. 
“The NYPD’s issues with systemic racism and discrimination are well-documented – so, too, is the technology’s bias against women and people of colour. Using FRT with images from thousands of cameras across the city risks amplifying racist policing, harassment of protesters, and could even lead to wrongful arrests.” 
“Facial recognition can and is being used by states to intentionally target certain individuals or groups of people based on characteristics, including ethnicity, race and gender, without individualized reasonable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing.” 
Amnesty International research has modelled the extensive field of vision of New York’s CCTV network. For example, the intersection of Grand Street and Eldridge Street sits near the border of Chinatown and was near a key location in the Black Lives Matter protests. Our investigation found three NYPD-owned Argus cameras around the site, in addition to four other public cameras and more than 170 private surveillance cameras, which our modelling suggests have the capacity to track faces from as far as 200 metres away (or up to 2 blocks). 
Digital army of volunteers exposes true scale of surveillance 
More than 5,500 volunteers have participated in the investigation, launched on 4 May 2021 as part of the innovative Amnesty Decoders platform. The project is ongoing to collect data on the remaining two New York boroughs, but already volunteers have analysed 38,831 locations across the city. 
It was a global effort – volunteers from 144 countries participated, with the largest group of volunteers (26%) being in the United States. In just three weeks, volunteers contributed an eye-watering 18,841 hours – more than 10 working years for a researcher working full time in the USA. Participants were given Google Street View images of locations around New York City and asked to tag cameras, with each intersection analysed by three volunteers. The total figures include a mix of both public and private cameras, both of which can be used with FRT.  
“The case is clear – people across the world are deeply concerned about the risk that facial recognition poses to our societies,” says Matt Mahmoudi. 
“That is why Amnesty International, and coalition members from over a dozen NYC-based organisations, are calling on authorities to outlaw the use of facial recognition technology by all government agencies in New York City.” 
“State Senators, City Councillors and prospective mayoral candidates have one choice – ban the scan, or risk turning New York into a surveillance city right out of the authoritarian playbook.”

Hong Kong’s annual Tiananmen vigil on 4 June has been banned on Covid-19 grounds for the second year running, but thousands are still expected to mark the event. Twenty-four activists who participated in last year’s peaceful vigil have since been arrested, and some have been jailed. 
“Once again, the Hong Kong authorities are using Covid-19 as a pretext to muzzle the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. People must not be punished for the simple act of lighting a candle in memory of the victims of the Tiananmen crackdown,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director. 
“The arrests and convictions of those who took part in last year’s vigil, which was socially distanced and entirely peaceful, have been a violation of international law. This travesty of justice must not be repeated.” 
Every year since 1990, tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of people have joined a candlelight vigil on 4 June in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park, a large expanse close to the city centre, to remember the protesters killed by Chinese troops in and around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
“For 30 years, Hongkongers have come out in support of the right to peaceful protest in mainland China. Now they are being denied that right themselves,” said Yamini Mishra. 
“The Hong Kong authorities must allow people to peacefully mark the horrific events of June Fourth, and they must end their politically motivated prosecutions against those targeted for attending last year’s vigil.” 
Background 
On the evening of 3–4 June 1989, hundreds – possibly thousands – of people were killed in Beijing when troops opened fire on students and workers who had been peacefully calling for political and economic reforms as well as an end to corruption. An unknown number of people were killed and jailed in similar crackdowns throughout the country. No one knows the exact number of fatalities since the Chinese authorities have stifled and censored discussion of the crackdown for the past three decades. 
Hongkongers attending the city’s Tiananmen vigil since 1990 have called on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and take responsibility for the killings. 
Media reports have suggested that people who try to attend the banned vigil this year could be arrested for illegal assembly, facing sentences of up to five years in jail, and barred from voting in elections. Some pro-Beijing figures have said participation could violate the city’s draconian national security law, which was adopted shortly after last year’s cancelled vigil. 
Authorities arrested 24 people for taking part in the “unauthorized” vigil last year, and four people – Joshua Wong, Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen and Jannelle Leung – have already been sentenced to jail. 
Twenty more, including newspaper owner Jimmy Lai and several members of vigil organizers the Hong Kong Alliance, face trial later this month for participating in the event. 
An annual June Fourth vigil in neighbouring Macau has also been banned for the second successive year. However, authorities there – who prohibited the 2020 event solely due to Covid-19 concerns – have this year said the gathering would also “incite subversion”.

Amnesty International mourns these children and and those who never came home. We are in solidarity with residential school survivors, their families, and all First Nations, Inuit and Métis people who are grieving and mourning. These children should never have been taken from their families. 
Residential schools were part of a colonial policy to eradicate Indigenous cultures, languages and communities. While the last school closed in 1996, intergenerational trauma, ongoing harms and discriminatory practices continue. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, national investigations, the United Nations, and several other international human rights bodies have repeatedly called on Canada to address these human rights violations and ensure justice for survivors and their families. The bulk of these recommendations remain unimplemented. Canada must act on these recommendations now. 
Amnesty International urges Canada to act on these recommendations without delay, including the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action and the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ 231 Calls for Justice. Canada must also, without delay, implement the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal’s decision on providing equal funding for child and family services in First Nations communities. 
“While flags have been lowered to half mast in honor of the 215 children killed in residential schools, this is far from enough,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English branch). “Other schools need be investigated, burial sites need to be located and protected, and those responsible held accountable for these grave human rights violations. The Canadian government and institutions must finally act on the numerous calls to action spelled out in the Truth and Reconciliation commission, national inquiries and reports. It should not take such a tragic discovery to spur action.” 
We further call on the government to press forward with and pass Bill C-15 which requires the current government – and future governments – to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples to develop a national implementation plan with priorities and deadlines, as well as to bring federal laws into line with the requirements of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Bill C-15 is an important foundation for confronting colonialism and addressing the urgent needs of Indigenous peoples and communities.

The draft model law, if adopted, would require Canadian companies to prevent human rights and environmental harm throughout their global operations and supply chains. 
Similar laws are in place or being developed in several countries. Canada, however, is falling behind. Instead of legally requiring companies to respect human rights and the environment, Canada encourages them to voluntarily take measures to do so. 
“All around the world, people are being harmed by the business practices of Canadian companies and their subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers,” said Jean Symes, from the feminist social justice organization Inter Pares. “We are calling on Canadian lawmakers to catch up to global leaders by adopting our model legislation, a comprehensive law that would help respond to the widespread and egregious abuses linked to Canadian companies including forced labour, sexual violence, and murder.” 
Under the CNCA’s proposed law, if a company causes harm or fails to do its human rights and environmental due diligence, those affected would have the statutory right to bring a civil lawsuit against that company in Canadian court. 
“Canadian businesses that are already doing what’s needed to protect human and environmental rights will welcome this legislation,” said Hassan Yussuff, President of the Canadian Labour Congress. “Those that aren’t will now be held accountable for their failure to act.” 
Over 150 organizations and unions that work with people impacted by the activities of Canadian companies in 32 countries around the world have endorsed the CNCA’s proposed law. 
“The CNCA’s proposal stands in stark contrast to the modern slavery reporting law currently being examined by the Canadian Senate,” said Catherine Coumans, co-manager at MiningWatch Canada. “The proposed law released today moves beyond reporting and requires companies to change their behavior – and stop profiting from human rights and environmental harm – or face significant consequences.” 
The CNCA released a draft of the model Corporate Respect for Human Rights and the Environment Abroad Act at a virtual press conference in Ottawa today.

Additional Information 
Milostene Castin is an activist who coordinates the organization Action to Reforest and Defend the Environment (Action pour la Reforestation et la Défense de l’Environnement, AREDE) in Trou-du-Nord, a town in north-east Haiti. Since 2013, the organization has been involved in campaigning against land seizures, intimidation and forced displacement of subsistence farmers by armed groups suspected to be connected with business interests and the government. For this he has suffered attempts by armed gangs to beat or kill him on numerous occasions, including a stabbing at the hands of armed men during a peaceful protest in 2019, a year in which violent repression of protests against corruption and impunity took place across the country. 
In 2020, as more subsistence farmers faced expropriations, threats, and violence, Mr. Castin supported their demands with documentation and advocacy, and organized peaceful protests. On 10 October, after one such protest, six men stood outside Mr. Castin’s home for several hours and began shooting around the house and smashed a window while he and his family were inside. Later in October, on three separate occasions a man went to the school of one of Mr. Castin’s children and asked the school staff for his child by name in an apparent kidnapping or intimidation attempt. The child had to be pulled out of school for their safety. 
During the last two months of 2020, armed men went to Mr. Castin’s house regularly at night and shot their weapons nearby. This also happened on 31 December, when the men, in addition to firing gunshots in front of the house, also threw rocks and bottles smashing all the windows and injuring another of Mr. Castin’s children. He called the police, but no one came to the house to protect the family and arrest the attackers. 
Since then, Mr. Castin and his family had to leave their home and their children are unable to attend school for their safety. After leaving, armed men continued to come to his house for some time looking for him. 
On 12 May of 2021, Mr. Castin was told by an affiliate of the ruling party that government officials “want him dead” because of his defense of farmers in a community facing expropriation. Based on information he has received from trusted contacts, Mr. Castin believes these attacks are motivated by his activism in favour of dispossessed subsistence farmers and that the attackers are linked to government and business actors.

Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed in a statement the repatriation on 19 May 2021 and Amnesty International also independently verified the return of the women to Sri Lanka. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
The last of the remaining women migrant workers were returned to Sri Lanka on 19 May 2021. Of the 41 women and children, 29 detainees were repatriated on two earlier flights on 29 April and 2 May. While most of the women have been able to reunite with their families after many months apart, 12 of the returnees are currently undergoing Covid-19 quarantine in Sri Lanka. 
At least 41 Sri Lankan women migrant domestic workers were detained for up to 18 months at the Exit 18 Deportation Detention (Tarheel) Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia awaiting repatriation. While the authorities did not disclose the legal basis for the women’s detention, it was believed that many of the women had been detained due to their migration status under the notorious kafala system in place in Saudi Arabia. That included reasons such as the expiration of their work permit, their employer’s failure to obtain an exit permit or because they fled from an abusive employer. 
After Amnesty International issued a press release and initiated an urgent action appeal, several media outlets in Sri Lanka carried the news. It is believed that this national and international attention on the women’s plight led the government representatives to respond and commit to repatriating the women migrant workers at the earliest. 
“We faced many hardships for several months being detained away from our families and children back home with no hope in sight. We are thankful to Amnesty International for raising our issue, which helped to get attention from the government”, said one of the women migrant workers who returned home in Sri Lanka. 
Sri Lankan foreign ministry in a statement said that as part of the repatriation initiative since April 2021, around 180 individuals in deportation camps, including 49 women, have been repatriated from several places in Saudi Arabia.

He was on death row in Texas in connection with the 1999 murder of his 83-year-old great aunt when he was just 20 years old. The sentencing jury was presented with a since discredited theory regarding his “future dangerousness”, which proved to be a key factor leading to his death sentence. His first postconviction attorney filed both the state habeas application and federal habeas petition late, which prevented meaningful review of his case. The victim’s sister and great-nephew called for clemency for Jones. Unfortunately, Texas authorities denied that request. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
Quintin Phillippe Jones, a Black man, was executed on 19 May 2021. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for the 1999 murder of an 83-year-old woman, his great aunt, Berthena Bryant, in Tarrant County, Texas. The death occurred during a botched robbery attempt.   
In the sentencing phase of his trial, the State largely relied on the testimony of a psychologist who diagnosed Jones as a “psychopath” and equated “psychopathy” to a propensity for future dangerousness to the jury based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), a 20-item checklist/rating scale intended to be used by trained professionals to measure the personality disorder of psychopathy that has since been discredited as unreliable, unscientific, and misleading in capital cases, because the PCL-R/Hare Checklist cannot reliably predict future behavior in prison. Quintin Phillippe Jones sentence came after ineffective assistance of counsel prevented the timely filing of appeals leading to a substantive review of issues related to his conviction. 
Berthena Bryant’s lone surviving sibling, also Quintin Jones’ great aunt, and Quintin’s twin brother provided declarations for Quintin’s appeal for clemency noting Quintin’s transformation in prison and pleading not to revictimize the family with his execution. Quintin Jones’ lawyers filed a civil rights complaint against the Board, noting the similarity between Quintin Jones’ case and Thomas Whitaker, a white man, who was granted clemency by the Board in 2015 and spared execution; however, US District Judge George C. Hanks Jr. dismissed the complaint. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as a violation of human rights. The US has executed 1533 people since 1976, and the State of Texas has now accounted for 577 of those executions. This was the first state execution in the USA in 2021.

His acquittal marks a victory for the right to peaceful protest in France. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
On 20 May, Frédéric Vuillaume was acquitted by the court in Dijon soon after the end of his first trial hearing. The judge dismissed the charges against him and pronounced him ‘not guilty’. Frédéric Vuillaume was on trial with charges of ‘attroupement’ (participation in an assembly that is likely to disrupt public order) for exercising his right to peaceful assembly by attending a demonstration in December 2019 in Dijon. He was risking up to one year in prison and a stern fine. 
On 20 May, Frédéric Vuillaume was supported by Amnesty France’s staff and local activists, as well by many friends and supporters who came to offer their voices and solidarity for his fight for justice. He told Amnesty: “I thank everyone, and this is a victory for the right to peaceful protest in France. It is also a great victory for me too. It doesn’t erase the violent arrests, the hours in police custody, but at least I am done with trials… for now. I thank everyone for all the efforts, all the emails sent to the Prosecutor to defend the right to protest and the right to freedom of expression. This was very important. It is thanks to you all, to your mobilization, that we got there. I could not have done it by myself. Without your solidarity, your determination. Today is a victory, a really great victory, Thank you all!” 
Anne Sophie Simpere, advocacy officer in Amnesty France, said: “We went to support Frédéric at the court in Dijon. There were dozens of supporters, trade unionists, Yellow Vests and Amnesty activists welcoming him. He was very moved by our support. For him it is essential to defend the right to peaceful protest. He has been fighting for social rights for years as a unionist and wants to continue doing so. Frédéric thanked Amnesty activists for their presence, for the messages of solidarity, and for the thousands of emails sent to the Prosecutor. It is important for him not to feel alone in the authorities’ sight. When the verdict was announced, people in the room applauded. Normally you are not allowed to do that, but there was such a relief, surprise, joy, that people could not hold back. And outside the others were waiting for Frédéric, singing slogans of freedom. He looked so relieved and lighter as he left the court. After two years of harassment against him, we remain vigilant. Amnesty’s mobilization sends a signal, and we hope that it will protect him in the future and allow him to demonstrate peacefully without risk of being arrested.” 
Frédéric’s case is illustrative of the harassment that thousands of peaceful protesters faced and continue to experience systematically due to provisions in the French law that criminalize conduct protected under international human rights law and standards, as documented in Amnesty’s report ‘Arrested for protest. Weaponizing the law to crackdown on peaceful protesters in France’ (available at https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur21/1791/2020/en/).

Their Athens-Vilnius flight was diverted and forced to land in Minsk under false pretext. Raman Pratasevich was wanted by the Belarusian authorities on trumped-up “terrorism” charges solely for his journalistic work. If convicted, Raman Pratasevich is facing up to 20 years’ imprisonment. A televised “confession” may indicate torture and other ill-treatment. 
The pair were arrested on 23 May 2021 after their Athens-Vilnius flight was forcibly diverted by the Belarusian authorizes to Minsk under false pretext. Raman Pratasevich was charged under Articles 293(1) (“Organization of mass disorders”), 342(1) (“Organization or active participation in group actions that severely violate public order”) and 130(3) (“Incitement of racial, ethnic, religious or other social hatred or enmity”) of the Criminal Code. The grounds for Sofia Sapega’s arrest have not been disclosed. It appears that they have been detained in retaliation for Raman Pratasevich’s critical journalistic work. 
There is no evidence that Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega have committed an internationally recognized crime, and their detention is arbitrary. Their arrest was conducted in an unlawful and reckless manner, putting all passengers of the plane at risk when a Belarusian Air Force fighter jet diverted their flight and escorted it to Minsk.

Additional Information 
Raman Pratasevich is a Belarusian journalist, co-founder of the popular NEXTA Telegram channel, which became a key tool for information-sharing, mobilization and coordination of peaceful protests against widely-disputed presidential election results in August 2020. He left NEXTA in September 2020 and has been editing the Belamova Telegram channel since then. 
Since 2019, Raman Pratasevich has been living outside Belarus out of fear for his safety. On 5 November 2020, he was charged with “organization of mass disorder”, “organization of group actions that severely violate public order” and “inciting hatred towards social groups” (these “groups” being police officers and government officials). On 19 November, he was put on the country’s official “List of Terrorists” becoming the first Belarusian citizen included on the list. 
On 23 May 2021, Raman Pratasevich was travelling to Vilnius from Athens with his partner Sofia Sapega. When their RyanAir flight was flying over Belarus, it was diverted by Belarusian air traffic controllers and ordered to land in Minsk Airport, ostensibly due to a report of a bomb on board. A fighter jet belonging to the Belarusian Air Forces was deployed “to accompany” the civilian aircraft to Minsk. After landing, Raman Pratasevich and Sofia Sapega were detained by the Belarusian security services, while their Ryanair flight was allowed to proceed to Vilnius, some five hours later. If convicted, Pratasevich is facing up to 20 years’ imprisonment. He is also at serious risk of torture and other ill-treatment. 
Charges against Sofia Sapega, who is a Russian citizen and a student at the European Humanitarian 
University in Vilnius, are unknown. As of 25 May, there have been no reports of either of them having been visited by a lawyer. 
On 24 May, pro-government media issued a video depicting Raman Pratasevich in a room with his face swollen and with what looks like a bruise on his forehead. In the video, he says that he is being held at SIZO-1 detention centre in Minsk and is “cooperating with the investigators” and “giving confessions related to organization of mass disorders in the city of Minsk”. He also says that he is being treated “in a correct and lawful way by the officers”. Such video “confessions” extracted under torture and other ill-treatment or duress have been repeatedly used by the Belarusian authorities to intimidate their opponents and discredit detainees. 
Torture and other ill-treatment have been widespread in Belarus against detained opponents of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, who claims to have won the August 2020 elections. During the protests that followed the disputed election, over 30,000 people were arbitrarily detained. Scores were sentenced to so-called administrative detention or given hefty fines. Hundreds complained of torture or other ill-treatment. Several hundreds have been prosecuted under politically-motivated criminal charges, and many have been given long prison sentences following unfair trials. The number of individuals prosecuted under criminal charges as part of the authorities’ crackdown on peaceful dissent is constantly growing.

Once again, missiles and rockets flew between Israel and Gaza. When the ceasefire was finally declared on Thursday, at least 242 Palestinians – including at least 66 children – in Gaza had been killed, along with 10 Israelis, including two children. At least 14 Palestinians in the West Bank protesting the violence in Gaza were killed by Israeli security forces. Gaza suffered immense property destruction. And 75,000 Palestinians were forced to seek shelter in UN schools and other locations to escape the missiles. 
As international human rights observers, we believe that the firing by Israel of missiles and shells into heavily populated areas of Gaza, its dreadful toll on civilians, property destruction and bombing of international media offices constitute war crimes. We also believe that the firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israeli urban areas violates international law. These actions must be investigated by the International Criminal Court. 
The international community’s utter failure to reach an immediate ceasefire is inexcusable. During the 11 day violence, the United Nations Security Council failed to agree on a common statement after four meetings – let alone to adopt a binding resolution demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities by the parties – betraying the current limits and inequity of our international rules-based order. 
But more crucially, we are appalled by the Security Council’s refusal to address the root causes of this latest bloodshed. 
The underlying reality of the Gaza violence and the demonstrations in East Jerusalem against the forced evictions of Palestinian inhabitants from their homes is that of a deeply unequal struggle: 54 years of occupation by one of the best equipped militaries in the world, ruling over a people who have the right to end a protracted and illegal alien rule. There can be no just and durable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without recognition of this fundamental fact. 
The latest attacks are eerily familiar to the previous wars in Gaza in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2018. Israel’s far superior firepower is inflicting far higher death tolls and injuries and a much larger scale of property destruction upon Gaza. 
Much of the culpability for this failure rests with the United States. This past week, it has repeatedly blocked a statement agreed upon by the other 14 members of the Council. Since 1973, the US has vetoed 31 resolutions critical of Israel at the Security Council, resulting in a perpetual paralysis at the world’s most important political body.  
As Barack Obama acknowledged in his recent memoirs: “Our diplomats found themselves in the awkward position of having to defend Israel for actions that we ourselves opposed. U.S. officials also had to explain why it wasn’t hypocritical for us to press countries like China or Iran on their human rights records while showing little concern for the rights of Palestinians.” 
Canada’s diplomatic laryngitis on this issue is just as startling. Canada’s statements during the Gaza violence offer no direct criticism of Israel and made no mention of the occupation. Canada holds one of the weakest voting records on the Israeli occupation at the UN General Assembly, which contributed to its failed bid for a seat on the UN Security Council. 
This exceptionalism towards Israel violates the universal essence of human rights. The two million Palestinians living in Gaza have been closed off from the outside world by Israel’s comprehensive 14-year land, sea and air blockade which has resulted in a 45 percent unemployment rate, among the world’s highest. 
Gaza’s sole source of drinking water – an underground aquifer – is almost completely undrinkable. Its inhabitants have power for only six to ten hours daily. 
Most alarmingly, Gaza’s health care system is flat on its back. During the blockade, it has been starved of equipment, medicines, and trained staff. It was already collapsing under the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, it is struggling to treat the almost 2,000 Palestinians injured during this latest violence. 
Two recent Secretaries General of the United Nations described the Israeli blockade as collective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza, a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention, the primary source of international humanitarian law. Gaza is a unique human rights crisis in modern history.  Where else in the world are so many people under occupation penned up in what has been called an open-air prison?  
More importantly, when will Canada have the diplomatic courage to hold Israel accountable for its occupation and its resulting cycle of violence? 
The only path to secure a just and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians is not realpolitik, but a rights-based approach which addresses the illegal occupation of Palestinian Territories.

“This is yet another illustration of Israel’s criminal policy of forced displacement of Palestinians in motion. 
“By continuing to pursue this court case – after the outcry over the planned forced evictions in Sheikh Jarrah in occupied East Jerusalem – Israel is fanning the flames of the latest upsurge in violence and perpetuating the same systematic human rights violations against Palestinians that are at the root of the latest violence. 
“For years Israel has sought to expand illegal settlements in the area of Silwan, forcibly displacing more than 200 Palestinians from their homes. 
“The recent protests locally and worldwide against forced evictions in Sheikh Jarrah send a clear message that Israel’s land grabs will not go unnoticed. Israel’s authorities must immediately halt plans for forced evictions in Batn al-Hawa in Silwan and any other areas of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Such forced evictions flagrantly violate the prohibition in international humanitarian law of forcible transfer and amount to war crimes.  
“Let us be clear, the USA, UK, EU countries and the international community at large have a responsibility to stop Israel from continuing with its policies of forcible transfer and dispossession. Instead of allowing Israel to trample over Palestinians’ rights with impunity, there must be a concerted effort to address the systematic oppression and dispossession of Palestinians which are among the root causes of these repeated cycles of violence and civilian bloodshed.”  
Background 
In 2020, seven eviction rulings were issued by the Jerusalem Magistrate Court ordering the eviction of seven Palestinian families in Batn al-Hawa to be replaced by settlers. Two of the families, the Najah family and the Kayed al-Rajabi family are due to have their appeal cases heard on 26 May.  
Ateret Cohanim, a settler organization, has been seeking, with the support of Israeli authorities, to forcibly evict some 100 Palestinian families from the Batn al-Hawa area in Silwan, claiming the land is rightfully owned by a Jewish trust active in the area more than 100 years ago. While Israeli law allows for property to be transferred to Jews, it denies the same right to Palestinians who have been dispossessed of their property following the establishment of the state. 
East Jerusalem is part of the occupied West Bank that Israel illegally annexed in 1967 and where Israeli civil law applies, contrary to the provisions of the international law of occupation. 
Silwan, home to around 33,000 Palestinians, is located outside the walls of the Old City and its holy sites. Several hundred Israeli settlers now live there as well in heavily protected settlement compounds. Israel has been moving its citizens into the neighbourhood since the 1980s. This has resulted in numerous human rights violations, including the forced eviction and displacement of Palestinian residents.

In a new publication the organization describes brutal reprisals against students and reveals the disruptive impact of the state’s repression of academic life in Belarus.  
“Students and teachers who protested across Belarus began their current academic year in a country radically transformed by events over the summer. From the outset, it was clear that their dissent would not be tolerated by either the authorities or many university administrations. On 27 October, Alyaksandr Lukashenka called for universities to dismiss them. We then saw with dismay how universities did exactly this to scores of students,” said Aisha Jung, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner on Belarus.  
As of 17 May 2021, according to the Belarusian Students’ Association, an independent student union, at least 466 students have been detained, almost a third of whom are women. Many were put under administrative detention or fined an average of 120 Euros, a quarter of the average monthly salary in Belarus. At least 153 students have been arbitrarily expelled from universities and many have fled to neighbouring countries fearful for their safety. Forty-two students have become suspects in criminal cases and six have been sentenced to terms of imprisonment.  
In one of the most brazen attacks on student organizations, the authorities launched a criminal investigation against 11 student activists and one teacher, many of whom were apprehended at their homes on 12 November 2020, a date which has since become known as “Black Thursday.” Their trial started on 14 May and is expected to continue until mid-June. All are facing charges under Article 342 of the Criminal Code of Belarus (“organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order”) which carries a prison sentence of up to two years.  
Anastasia Bulybenka, 19, is one of the defendants. On the day of her arrest, Anastasia was sleeping in her bed in the apartment she shares with her mother when she heard a voice telling her to get up. She opened her eyes to see six unknown men standing around her bed after they had forced entry into her apartment. Anastasia has been held in pre-trial detention since her arrest more than six months ago – in all that time, her mother, Aksana, has been granted only one forty-five minute meeting with her.  
“For me, the whole world stopped, and I just looked at her … She is a grown up now, the child was completely gone from her face. And she wrote this to me later in a letter saying, ‘I left our home on 12 November as a child and I will return as an adult,’” Aksana told Amnesty International recalling that meeting.   
The targeting of politically active students and teachers is not a new tactic of the Belarusian authorities or educational establishments. However, as with all those currently speaking out against the government in the context of the presidential election, the scale of harassment, persecution and violence against them is unprecedented in Belarus’ post-independence history.   
Amnesty International calls on the Belarusian authorities to immediately end the repression against students, academics and all peaceful protesters.  
“The Belarusian authorities must abide by their obligations under international human rights law and respect students’ rights to peacefully express their opinions, together or in association, and to peacefully demonstrate without fear of harassment or reprisals,” said Aisha Jung.  
“We call on student unions and student leaders across the world to show solidarity with their peers in Belarus and demand that their countries’ authorities take immediate steps to put pressure on Alyaksandr Lukashenka’s government to end the strangulation of public life, of academic life, of the brightest youth in the country.”  
Background   
This campaign briefing is the sixth in a series of briefings, part of the #StandWithBelarus campaign, which Amnesty International is producing to highlight how different sectors of Belarusian society are being targeted by the repressive government of Alyaksandr Lukashenka, after he claimed victory in the 9 August 2020 presidential election despite mounting evidence of mass electoral fraud. The human rights crackdown in Belarus following the election has gone far beyond targeting “the usual suspects” of the political opposition, independent media and civil society.

“The situation here is simple. There is little doubt that the Belarusian authorities used a false bomb threat and a MiG fighter jet to force an airplane flying from one country of the European Union to another to land with the apparent sole purpose of detaining an exiled critical journalist whom they badly wanted silenced.   
“While it sounds like an extraordinary Hollywood plot, it’s not. The reality of this apparent act of air piracy is chilling. The European Union and the rest of the world must react without delay and call for the immediate release of Raman Pratasevich. He should be allowed to leave Belarus and travel to the country of his choice.”  
Background  
On 23 May, Raman Pratasevich, 26, who until September 2020 led the biggest Belarusian opposition Telegram channels NEXTA and NEXTA Live, was detained at Minsk airport after his Lithuania-bound flight made an emergency landing over a purported bomb threat which was promptly reported as false. A MiG-29 fighter jet belonging to the Belarusian Air Forces escorted the civilian plane to the alternate airfield in Minsk.    
Last year, NEXTA and its sister channels were declared “extremist” and subsequently banned in Belarus by the country’s security services, as part of the authorities’ brutal crackdown on peaceful dissent in the country after the widely-disputed results of the 9 August presidential elections. Raman Pratasevich and his associate Stsyapan Putsila were arbitrarily added to Belarus’s list of “individuals involved in terrorist activity.” The two were also charged with “incitement of mass riots”, “gross violation of public order” and “incitement od social hatred” against public officials and law enforcement agents. These crimes carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison.

Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara was taken by state security officials on 2 May 2021 from his home, the headquarters of the San Isidro Movement, where he was carrying out a hunger strike reportedly in protest over his artwork being confiscated from his home. According to information from the NGO Cubalex and state media, he was taken to a hospital in Havana, the Centro de Urgencias del Hospital Universitario “General Calixto García.” 
As far as Amnesty International can ascertain, Luis Manuel has been held at the hospital, under supervision or control of state security officials and with very restricted visits from immediate family. He does not seem to have access to his telephone or the outside world. Pending his release, Luis Manuel Otero should be provided with medical care of his choice, be granted regular visits from family and friends, not be tortured or otherwise ill-treated, and granted access to lawyers of his choosing. 
According to Cubalex, and Amnesty International documentation, state security officials have repeatedly had Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara under surveillance for months and he faced arrest by police if he tried to leave his house, in practice amounting to house arrest. Luis Manuel’s latest detention has occurred within a context of reports of harassment and intimidation against other members of the SIM and shows Cuba’s ongoing repression of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression in the country. 
Luis Manuel has been named a prisoner of conscience of Amnesty International twice already, in both cases for being detained solely for peacefully exercising his freedom of expression. He and members of the San Isidro Movement, as well as allies and journalists have also been under constant and frightening surveillance, which Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Team and researchers documented in December 2020.

0,Global Health Summit: Leaders must waive intellectual property rights and push pharma companies to share life-saving technology,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/global-health-summit-leaders-must-waive-intellectual-property-rights-and-push-pharma-companies/,"G20 leaders must waive vaccine patents and other intellectual property restrictions now to save lives 60,000 people dying weekly across South America and South Asia – mass loss of life where vaccines are scarce cannot be ignored Waiver must include diagnostics and treatments G20 leaders meeting...","G20 leaders meeting tomorrow at the Global Health Summit must face up to the harsh reality that the clock is ticking and without waiving intellectual property rights now Covid-19 may not be brought under control for years, Amnesty International warned today. 
More than 60,000 people died from Covid-19 across South America and South Asia last week, accounting for over 70 per cent of deaths globally in that period. Oxygen is in short supply and health systems in these regions are reaching breaking point. In Pakistan, just one in 75 people have been vaccinated, compared to the US where one in two people have received at least one jab. 
With reports revealing that the current draft declaration, known as the “Rome Declaration” to be agreed at the summit, includes no mention of waiving vaccine patents, Amnesty International is calling for urgent action to address this glaring omission. 
“Agreeing principles to prevent future pandemics has its place, but it is hard to have confidence when states and companies are failing to take the crucial measures needed to tackle the pandemic ravaging the world today,” said Tamaryn Nelson, Health Advisor at Amnesty International. 
“The best way to prepare for public health crises is to prevent them altogether, and vaccines play a crucial role in this effort. Some 100 countries including the USA have understood the importance of waiving intellectual property rights to boost supply of vaccines and end Covid-19. Yet, states such as Germany, Australia, the UK and across the EU are failing people around the world by refusing to do the same. 
“With thousands of people dying every day, it’s clear that profit should not be put ahead of people’s health. States must take responsibility and pressure big pharma companies into sharing their technology and know-how – so everyone has a fair shot at a vaccine. 
“According to current vaccine distribution plans, less developed countries will not receive enough doses to achieve widespread coverage until at least 2023 – and millions of people will continue to die without the medicines and treatments they need. If the whole world is not protected the health of people everywhere will be jeopardized, as variants are likely to arise, evading current vaccines. 
“There is a solution. If pharmaceutical companies fulfilled their human rights responsibilities and stopped lobbying against efforts aimed at widening access and started sharing their knowledge and technology, more vaccines could be produced at a fairer price. Yet, not one company has agreed to share their intellectual property and know-how through the World Health Organization. It is discriminatory and short-sighted to suggest that developing countries cannot produce safe and good quality, bioequivalent vaccines, with the necessary resources. 
“Given our devastating reality, Amnesty International is calling for leaders at the Global Health Summit to address the elephant in the room and tackle head on the importance of waiving intellectual property restrictions to end Covid-19.   
“The only way to end the pandemic is to end it globally. It’s time for rich states and pharmaceutical companies to put people before profit.” 
Background 
In October 2020, India and South Africa requested a waiver that would allow countries to neither grant nor enforce patents and other specific intellectual property rights related to COVID-19 products until global herd immunity is achieved. A significant number of lower- and middle-income countries supported this proposal. Most high-income countries including the EU and its member States opposed it. The EU is a member of the WTO, and its member states are also WTO members in their own right.  The European Commission represents the EU at WTO meetings. 
If agreed, the waiver would suspend the implementation, application and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights, such as patents on pharmaceutical products, and facilitate the development and manufacture of more and lower-cost COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines. 
On 5 May 2021, the USA changed its position and said it would support a waiver – but limited to vaccines only. 
International human rights standards and trade rules are clear that protecting intellectual property must never come at the expense of public health.  
The WTO’s Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) sets out minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property that are pertinent to pharmaceutical companies, such as copyrights, trademarks, patents, undisclosed information (including trade secrets and test data) and anti-competitive practices.  
The World Health Organisation has set up the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) scheme so companies could pool data and knowledge, and then license production and technology transfer to other potential producers with the aim of ensuring people everywhere could access vaccines quicker. So far, not a single pharmaceutical company has joined the data-pooling scheme.

“The latest ruling in Hassan Diab’s case is deeply disappointing. France’s Court of Cassation has chosen to uphold a Court of Appeal ruling that Hassan Diab must face trial for a case that is clearly based on weak and uncredible evidence. This is not justice. 
It is shocking that this ordeal continues to drag on. Hassan Diab spent more than three years in solitary confinement in a prison in France, only for investigating judges to dismiss his charges. Further, a Canadian extradition judge had previously called the evidence ‘very problematic’, ‘convoluted’, ‘illogical’, and ‘suspect’. In fact, there is credible evidence that shows Hassan Diab was in Beirut writing exams at the time of the bombing. 
Amnesty International is strongly urging the Canadian government to intervene on behalf of Hassan Diab and his family. 
Amnesty International continues to call for justice in the horrific 1980 bombing of the Rue Copernic synagogue in Paris. But relentlessly pursuing Hassan Diab is not the way forward.”

0,Russia: Parliamentarians must reject new bills threatening rights to freedom of association and expression,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/russia-parliamentarians-must-reject-new-bills-threatening-rights-freedom-association-and/,"Three bills adopted today in the first reading by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, drastically restrict rights and liberties in the country by imposing new muzzles on individuals who criticize the government and barring them from participating in public life, Amnesty...","Three bills adopted today in the first reading by the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament, drastically restrict rights and liberties in the country by imposing new muzzles on individuals who criticize the government and barring them from participating in public life, Amnesty International said today.  
The bills are intended to target Russians who have supported civil society and religious organizations that were later declared “extremist” or “terrorist” and widen the scope of the law on “undesirable” organizations.   
“Vladimir Putin’s regime aims to fully purge vocal critics from the civic space. The main target of this latest, particularly brazen attack is the movement led by Aleksei Navalny. Having unjustly imprisoned its archfoe, the Kremlin is now targeting all those who had the nerve to support him,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director.  
Under the first bill, the authorities aim to punish the exercise of the right to association by barring from public life those who share a critical view of the government and are working together to bring change. According to the law, those who founded, led, worked for, or otherwise participated in the activities of an organization which is later designated as “extremist” or “terrorist” and subsequently banned, will be barred from running for the country’s lower house of Parliament for a period of between three and five years after the organization’s ban comes into force. Moreover, the bill provides for its retroactive application.   
Aleksei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, which has already been declared a “foreign agent”, is now fighting against the authorities’ attempt to designate it as an “extremist organization.” According to Leonid Volkov, who led Navalny’s regional network before its dissolution in April, up to 200,000 people who contributed to its crowdfunding efforts could fall afoul of the new law. While Navalny’s allies and supporters are certainly the main target, the bill will also affect many other civic and religious groups who have been or may be targeted under Russia’s vague “counter-extremism” and “counter-terrorism” legislation.   
“This is nothing but a desperate move to annihilate any shred of visible dissent. The authorities are ready to punish a significant proportion of the population for exercising their right to freedom of expression and association by further reducing their avenues to effectively participate in public life,” said Natalia Zviagina.  
The two other bills broaden the scope of the law on “undesirable” organizations by introducing a prohibition on participation in their activities abroad, assigning the status of “undesirable” to the organizations who are believed to be intermediaries in financial transactions with those already banned, and toughening criminal sanctions. They propose that criminal liability should come after only one administrative prosecution, not two as at present, and, in some cases, immediately.    
“This bill seems to have been drafted to target another opposition group, Otkrytaya Rossiya (Open Russia). It is another networked structure that has managed to get on its feet in the political vacuum created by Vladimir Putin’s regime. Its activists and supporters have already paid a dear price and now the stakes will be even higher,” said Natalia Zviagina.  
“We urge Russian parliamentarians not to adopt these bills. They are a grave threat to human rights and should be of the most profound concern to Russian society and the international community.”

The plans for returns has to stop immediately and Denmark must give dignified protection to all Syrians, says the common call. In Copenhagen, the demonstration takes place on the Town Hall Square. 
Activists and organizations are now joining forces in a joint protest against the Danish government’s plans for returns of Syrian refugees. Haifaa Awad, Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke, Dansk Flygtningehjælp Ungdom and Amnesty International Denmark convene demonstrations across the country on Wednesday. 
The message is clear: The Danish government should immediately stop plans to withdraw Syrian residence permits. 
Hundreds of Syrian refugees, including children, have been told by the Danish Immigration Service to return to Syria, assessing that Damascus and the surrounding areas are safe to return to. At least 39 Syrians have received their final assessment in the Refugee Board – and are now in a deportation position. 
But Syria is far from a safe country. Although military hostilities have diminished in most of the country, Syrian citizens continue to risk persecution and human rights abuses – including in Damascus and the surrounding area. 
“In Damascus, the Assad regime has consolidated its power now, not with bombs, but with horrific human rights violations, extremely arbitrary arrests and extensive torture laboratories. Can our Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen guarantee the lives of Syrian refugees when they cross the border when the UN and the United States cannot? ” said activist, Dr Haifaa Awad. 
For years, Amnesty International has documented gross and systematic human rights violations by the regime in Syria. The human rights organization is shocked by Denmark’s unilateral action: 
“It is difficult to comprehend that the Danish authorities, contrary to virtually everyone else, have reached the conclusion that Damascus and the surrounding area are safe enough to return to. Our research shows that Syrians who have been send back are routinely subjected to interrogation by Syrian security forces. The security forces are known and notorious for being behind arbitrary detention, torture and murder. Wanting to send people back to such a risk is contrary to Denmark’s human rights obligations,” said Dan Hindsgaul, Acting Secretary General of Amnesty International Denmark. 
“Denmark was once a pioneer internationally in the UN’s protection of refugees. Now the Danish government, unlike all other countries, will send back Syrians and thus de facto legitimize President Assad’s regime. We must say the opposite, and fortunately there are now also members of the Social Democratic governing party who are doing this,” said Secretary General of Mellemfolkeligt Samvirke, Tim Whyte. 
“Young people who have fled to Denmark, and who after a few years in the country, have begun to dream and think in Danish, are now facing another violent trauma caused by the Danish government’s current deportation policy. No one should be deported to the same dictator that they fled from,” said Natasha Al-Hariri, Director of DFUNK – Danish Refugee Council Youth.

The organization has documented four deadly attacks by Israel launched on residential homes without prior warning and is calling for the International Criminal Court (ICC) to urgently investigate these attacks. The death toll in Gaza continues to climb with at least 198 Palestinians killed including 58 children and more than 1,220 injured. Ten people in Israel, including two children, have been killed and at least 27 injured by Palestinian attacks. 
“There is a horrific pattern emerging of Israel launching air strikes in Gaza targeting residential buildings and family homes – in some cases entire families were buried beneath the rubble when the buildings they lived in collapsed. In the cases documented below, no prior warning was given to the civilian residents to allow them to escape. Under international humanitarian law, all parties must distinguish between military targets and civilian objects and direct their attacks only at military objectives. When carrying out attacks, parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Although the Israeli military has given no explanation of what military objectives it was targeting in these attacks, it is hard to imagine how bombing residential buildings full of civilian families without warning could be considered proportionate under international humanitarian law. It is not possible to use large explosive weapons, like aircraft bombs that have a blast radius of many hundreds of meters, in populated areas without anticipating major civilian casualties. 
“By carrying out these brazen deadly attacks on family homes without warning, Israel has demonstrated a callous disregard for the lives of Palestinian civilians who are already suffering the collective punishment of Israel’s illegal blockade on Gaza since 2007.” 
The Israeli army claims that it only attacks military targets and has justified airstrikes on residential buildings on that basis. However, residents told Amnesty International that there were no fighters or military objectives in the vicinity at the time of the attacks documented. 
“Deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian property and infrastructure are war crimes, as are disproportionate attacks. The International Criminal Court has an active investigation into the situation in Palestine and should urgently investigate these attacks as war crimes. States should also consider exercising universal jurisdiction over those who commit war crimes. Impunity only works to fuel the pattern of unlawful attacks and civilian bloodshed, which have we have repeatedly documented in previous Israeli military offensives on Gaza,” said Saleh Higazi. 
At least 152 residential properties in Gaza have been destroyed since 11 May, according to the Gaza-based human rights organization, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Gaza, Israeli strikes have destroyed 94 buildings, comprising 461 housing and commercial units while 285 housing units have been severely damaged and rendered uninhabitable. 
According to United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) more than 2,500 people have been made homeless due to the destruction of their homes and more than 38,000 people have been internally displaced and have sought shelter in 48 UNRWA schools across Gaza. 
Indiscriminate rocket-fire by Palestinian armed groups towards civilian areas of Israel has also killed and injured civilians and damaged homes and other civilian properties. The rockets fired from Gaza into Israel are imprecise and their use violates international humanitarian law which prohibits the use of weapons that are by nature indiscriminate. These attacks should also be investigated by the ICC as war crimes. 
Amnesty International has previously published evidence that the Israeli military had a deliberate policy of targeting family homes during the 2014 conflict. 
Devastating attacks on family homes 
In one of the heaviest episodes of bombardment since the latest fighting began, between 1am and 2am on 16 May Israel carried out airstrikes against residential buildings and streets in Gaza City. The attacks completely destroyed two residential buildings belonging to the Abu al-Ouf and al-Kolaq families – killing 30 people – 11 of them children.  
Gaza’s Ministry of Labour building was also destroyed in the attacks. The attack blocked al-Wehda Street, one of the main roads leading to the main hospital in Gaza, al-Shifa. 
The families residing in the four-storey al-Ouf building, which included residential apartments and shops, received no prior warning – they were buried beneath the rubble in the attack. 
Yousef Yassin, a medic from al-Shifa Hospital, was one of the first to arrive on the scene of al-Ouf Building after the attack and helped pull survivors from the wreckage with the Red Crescent. He described the scene to Amnesty International as one of “great destruction”. 
“I helped get out four dead [bodies], but there were many more. It was very hard. There was no warning, so people were inside their home sitting together, and this is a lively, bustling area,” he said. 
Shortly before midnight on 14 May Israeli air strikes hit the three-storey building of the al-Atar family in Beit Lahia killing 28-year-old Lamya Hassan Mohammed al-Atar her three children Islam, seven, Amira, six, and Mohammed an eight-month-old baby. 
Lamya’s father, Hassan al-Atar, a civil defence officer told Amnesty International he headed to the scene of the attack with an ambulance and rescue team after a relative called him with news of the attack.  “He told me that our home had been bombed and [he was] stuck under the rubble [with his] wife and children,” he said. 
“I arrived at the house, which is made up of three stories – 20 people live there – I tried to find people, but I could not. Then the rescue team arrived to help and we eventually found my daughter, a mother of three, with her children, one of whom was a baby, under one of the cement pillars of the house; all of them were dead. The other residents seem to have managed to escape from an opening after the bombing and got to the hospital. I was shocked,” he said. 
Nader Mahmoud Mohammed al-Thom, from al-Salatin neighbourhood in Beit Lahia, described how his home where he lives with eight others was attacked without any warning shortly after midnight on 15 May. 
“There was no warning missile, no warning call, the house was bombed, and we were inside. Thank God that the civil defence by sheer chance was close by and saved us from under the rubble, thank God no one died. We had injuries but not serious, when we got out I saw a fire at the gate of the house, then the ambulance took us to the hospital. I think this is when I lost consciousness. Thank God no one was badly hurt but we lost our house. We are now in the street; we do not know where to go what to do.” 
His family sought shelter at an UNRWA school but the school they arrived at was closed when they arrived and they had to sleep outside in the school yard. His entire home was destroyed including his clothes, money and paperwork and all their belongings. 
In addition to residential homes, Israeli attacks have damaged water and electricity infrastructure as well as medical facilities and halted the operations of the North Gaza Seawater Desalination plant, which supplies water to more than 250,000 people.

Ahnaf Jazeem, a Sri Lankan poet and teacher, was arrested by the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) on 16 May 2020, under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). He was arrested in connection to a Tamil-language collection of poems he published under the title Navarasam, as well as other unsubstantiated claims of exposing his students to ‘extremist’ content and ideology. 
Ahnaf did not have any legal representation close to eight months since his arrest. After securing a legal counsel, he was permitted access to his lawyer only on 8 March 2021—after two months of continuous appeals by his lawyer. Even then, his meeting with his lawyer was monitored with officers of the TID listening in and recording their privileged conversations. According to his lawyer, while in detention, Ahnaf was also made to sign documents written in a language he doesn’t understand. 
Authorities have attempted to get him to make self-incriminating, forced confessionary statements. Denied access to his family for close to five months since his arrest, he continues to be denied unrestricted and regular access to family. According to his lawyer, Ahnaf has been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment while in detention and had been kept in unsanitary conditions. On 16 March 2021, his lawyer also wrote to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRSCL) about the violation of Ahnaf’s fundamental rights, due process, and inhuman and degrading treatment. 
The arrest of Ahnaf comes amidst the background of increased marginalization, discrimination and targeting of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community. Amnesty International has recorded recent incidents of cabinet proposals, decisions, and government regulations that from the outset discriminate against the country’s Muslim minority community which make up approximately 9% of Sri Lanka’s population. 
In 2017, then UN Special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, Ben Emmerson, highlighted the history of Sri Lankan authorities of prosecuting minorities on charges of terrorism, noting that “the Prevention of Terrorism Act had been used to commit some of the worst human rights violations, including widespread torture and arbitrary detention, in the run-up to and during the conflict, particularly to target minorities and suppress dissent”. The report also highlighted the history of Sri Lankan authorities persecuting individuals under terrorism related law with “various real or perceived links or associations with armed groups, and detaining for years without charge or trial, without any judicial review of their detention, and with almost no possibility of release”. 
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), in its 2016 submission to the UN Committee against Torture, highlighted the use of torture within Sri Lankan context with “torture being routinely used in all parts of the country regardless of the nature of the suspected offence for which the person is arrested.” A more recent prison study done by the HRCSL, published in December 2020, found that PTA detainees faced a continuum of violence. The study found that “violence in police custody was found to be an inherent element of the investigation process, whereby torture is inflicted to extract information, confessions and evidence from detainees.

Additional Information  
The Kurdish security forces Asayish arrested all five activists and journalists in October 2020 and they were immediately charged with “being spies” and “destabilizing national security”. In the case documents made available to the lawyer, Sherwan Sherwani was accused of being a spy based on his activism and travel to attend journalism trainings abroad. The lawyer was not able to review the case documents of the others.  
On 16 February, the Erbil Criminal Court sentenced the five activists and journalists based on apparently trumped-up charges of “destabilizing the security and stability of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I)” under Article 1 of Law No. 21 (2003).  
KR-I Prime Minister Masrour Barzani had previously claimed the detainees were spies and saboteurs and accused them of working for foreign governments to plot terrorist attacks. Dr. Zebari, KRG’s Coordinator for International Advocacy, denied that the five activists and journalists were sentenced for their journalistic work.  
According to information available to Amnesty International, Asayish forces raided the homes or place of work of all five journalists and activists, arrested them and in some cases the arrests were accompanied by violence. In one case, the Asayish pulled Guhdar Zebari from his bed, covered his eyes and handcuffed him without even presenting an arrest warrant. In another case, the Asayish and local Erbil police- arriving in six police cars and 4-wheel-drive cars- surrounded the home of Sherwan Sherwani at approximately 4:30pm on 7 October 2020, in the city of Erbil, and immediately trapped members of his family in a room in the house. Asayish members proceeded to raid Sherwan Sherwani’s home, confiscating electronics, including his laptop, camera, phone and documents before putting him in handcuffs. They held him at gun point and then dragged him out of the house.  
Amnesty International has received a copy of the verdict which stated that all five men were sentenced to prison based on the provisions of Article 1 of Law No. 21 of 2003 issued by the Parliament of the Kurdistan Region and Articles 47, 48 and 49 of the Iraqi Penal Code. The court also decided to place them under police surveillance for a period of five years after the completion of their sentences, and to confiscate their mobile phones, laptops and cameras. Following the sentencing of the five journalists, the court issued an arrest warrant for the brother of Shvan Saeed, Ayhan Saeed. Two additional arrests warrants were also issued for journalist Difaa Harki and activist Qaidar Hussein. All three arrest warrants mention charges of national security under the Law 21.  
Amnesty International has in the past documented the violent dispersal and mass and pre-emptive arrest of protesters in the KR-I and specifically in the governorate of Duhok. In January 2020, Asayish members carried out a wave of arrests in the governorate of Duhok, of tens of protesters, activists, journalists, and individuals who may have been bystanders during a protest. Asayish members also arrested a journalist and two online activists in the area of Baadre, Duhok governorate, who according to their relatives, were on their way to Duhok to join a peaceful gathering.

0,Open Letter to Colombia’s President Ivan Duque Marquez,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/open-letter-colombias-president-ivan-duque-marquez/,"Your Excellency, I am writing to express Amnesty International’s deep concern about the serious human rights crisis facing Colombia in the context of the “national strike” and the massive demonstrations across the country since 28 April. Our organization has documented excessive use of force...","Your Excellency, 
I am writing to express Amnesty International’s deep concern about the serious human rights crisis facing Colombia in the context of the “national strike” and the massive demonstrations across the country since 28 April. Our organization has documented excessive use of force by the security forces leading to human rights violations and crimes under international law, including enforced disappearances and sexual violence amounting to torture and ill-treatment. I call on you to intervene immediately to put an end to these human rights violations. 
The massive and mostly peaceful demonstrations are the result of increasing social discontent over the failure of the Colombian State to respond to historical demands against deep social and economic inequalities. They reflect too outcry against failure to respond to the devastating consequences of the ongoing internal armed conflict. Those matters have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially called for by several trade unions to continue social demands that had been postponed since 2019, the “national strike” has developed into a broad popular rejection of the tax reform proposal to address the effects of the pandemic that was presented by your government but without broader consultation. Despite withdrawal of the proposed fiscal reform, people continue to take to the streets largely in protest against violent repression by security forces and the lack of engagement from your government with legitimate demands for fair access to economic social, and cultural rights, the full implementation of the 2016 Peace Agreement and genuine action to stop the murdering of human rights defenders and social leaders. 
Amnesty International has received evidence in the form of videos and testimonies, and through our rigorous research, analysis and digital verification of more than 100 audio visual items, has further confirmed, that in several parts of the country, Colombian security forces used lethal weapons and resorted to indiscriminate use of tear gas, water cannons and other less lethal weapons against demonstrators. International human rights standards are clear in requiring that the use of force by the police when handling demonstrations should be a last resort and should be guided by the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, precaution, and accountability. The use of force to maintain order in situations that do not pose a direct threat to the life or physical integrity of others is considered a disproportionate use of force. Any resulting death constitutes arbitrary killing for which the State is responsible. 
According to civil society organizations, there are credible reasons to believe that as of 9 May, 39 people have been killed during demonstrations as a result of action by security forces, a further 28 have sustained eye injuries while 963 people have been detained. There are also reports of 913 cases of excessive use of force against protestors, some of which could constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In addition, there were reports of sexual violence against at least 12 women. The Attorney General’s Office and the Ombudsman’s Office have activated the Urgent Search Mechanism (MBU) for 168 requests they received about persons reported missing, in the context of the “national strike”. 
On 9 May our organization received several reports of attacks by armed civilians allegedly acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of state agents, against an Indigenous Peoples collective – Minga Indigena – for joining the demonstrations in Cali. Several members of the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC) were seriously injured consequently. 
Amnesty International is particularly concerned by the fact that your Excellency warned Indigenous Peoples that “civilians could attack them” but then took no measures to protect them. Instead, you called on them to go back to their territories Reference: AMR 23/4121/2021 President Iván Duque Márquez President of the Republic of Colombia 14 May 2021 www.amnesty.org 2 and to avoid blockades. At no point did you request that all measures be taken to prevent attacks by armed non-State actors, and neither did you condemn these attacks. 
Amnesty International is particularly concerned by your declarations on 1 May when, accompanied by the Army commander, you announced “military assistance to combat those who seek to intimidate society through violence, vandalism and terrorism,” clearly pointing to the people who were demonstrating. As state party to the American Convention on Human Rights, Colombia is obliged to ensure that the participation of the armed forces in patrolling demonstration is extraordinary, subordinate and complementary; regulated, through legal mechanisms and protocols on the use of force, by the principles of exceptionality, proportionality and absolute necessity; and audited by competent, independent and technically capable civilian bodies. 
Even when faced with allegations of violence perpetrated by some demonstrators during the protests, the authorities have the duty to take all appropriate measures to deal with such violence while ensuring that those who protest peacefully can continue to do so. The guarantee of the rights to life and integrity of people who demonstrate peacefully should be the central focus of the authorities’ actions, in accordance with international human rights standards. 
Already in 2019, in the context of protests then, the Colombian Supreme Court warned about the use of force leading to violations of human rights. In its recent resolution STC 7641-2020, the Court found that “the Public Force [had] engaged in constant, repetitive and persistent conduct aimed at undermining, discouraging and weakening the right to public demonstration”. Despite the explicit order by the Court to avoid repetition, similar patterns of abuse of force and human rights violations are occurring in the context of the current demonstrations. 
This pattern of human rights violations against peaceful demonstrations over time and the large number of people killed and injured in less than two weeks, suggest that the excessive use of force is premeditated with the aim of punishing protestors and dispersing them at any cost. This widespread, unnecessary and disproportionate use of force suggest that this is not the result of rogue actions by individual officers but instead a rehearsed and planned approach to the management of the protests and therefore a chain of command responsibility for the human rights violations and crimes against international law committed. 
Finally, Amnesty International is extremely worried by the use of stigmatizing language against demonstrators as uttered by yourself and other public officials – language such as “vandals”, “criminals” and suggesting that the demonstrations are organized by illegal armed groups or that they are “a horde of bandits”. Such language, coming on top of the absence of official condemnation of the human rights violations committed by security forces, suggests that the Government is condoning and justifying the excessive of use of force, and by extension shielding those responsible from accountability and thus enabling impunity. 
Amnesty International calls on your government to: 
Yours sincerely, 
Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International

Since 10 May Palestinian armed groups have fired more than 1,500 rockets striking civilian areas in central Israel and towns near the Gaza border killing and injuring civilians. Israeli forces have carried out air strikes killing and injuring civilians in Gaza. They have also damaged or destroyed at least two residential buildings housing tens of Palestinian families and one office building in Gaza, in targeted attacks amounting to collective punishment of the Palestinian population. In total at least 53 people, including 14 children, in Gaza and seven people in Israel have been killed in the violence. 
“The intensification of armed hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups in Gaza raises fears of a further spike in civilian bloodshed and destruction of homes and infrastructure over the coming days. All sides in the conflict have an absolute obligation to protect civilians. They must remember that there is an active investigation before the International Criminal Court and must not assume they will enjoy past impunity for violations,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.  
“This escalation is reminiscent of horrific hostilities from 2008, 2012, and 2014 where civilians bore the brunt of the suffering, with massive death and destruction in Gaza, which has been under an illegal blockade amounting to collective punishment since 2007. 
“Both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups have carried out war crimes and other violations with impunity. Israel has a deplorable record of carrying out unlawful attacks in Gaza killing and injuring civilians including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Palestinian armed groups have also committed violations of international humanitarian law with impunity.” 
Amnesty International has consistently condemned indiscriminate rocket fire by Palestinian armed groups. 
“Firing rockets which cannot be accurately aimed into populated areas can amount to a war crime and endangers civilian lives on both sides of the Israel/ Gaza border,” said Saleh Higazi. 
In Israel a 50-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel and his 15-year-old daughter were killed in a suspected rocket attack in the unrecognized village Dohmosh outside the city of Lydda in central Israel. The community does not have access to shelters, and the alarm system of sirens warning of oncoming projectiles from Gaza does not function in these communities. 
Collective punishment 
In Gaza, Israeli forces carried out attacks on a number of residential buildings from the early hours of 11 May. One 13-storey high rise residential building – Hanadi Residential Tower – was completely destroyed and reduced to rubble. Civilians had been warned to evacuate the area before it was hit. Al-Jawhara office building was also severely damaged on and Al-Shurouq building was also destroyed and reduced to rubble on 12 May. Other buildings were partially damaged as specific apartments were targeted. 
“Deliberate targeting of civilian objects and extensive, unjustified destruction of property are war crimes. Destroying entire multi-storey homes making tens of families homeless amounts to collective punishment of the Palestinian population and is a breach of international law,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“Even if part of a building is being used for military purposes Israeli authorities have an obligation to choose means and methods of attack that would minimize risks posed to civilians and their property.” 
An attack targeting an apartment on the top floor of the seven- storey “Tiba Apartments” building killed one woman and her son, a 19-year old with special needs, who lived on the floor below.  
An attack on the 14-storey residential tower called “al-Jundi al-Majhoul” killed three Palestinian members of Islamic Jihad. One civilian resident in the building who was woken up by the attack said:  
“The building was shaking crazily… When we got to the windows…we saw everyone looking at us and then people screaming ‘vacate the building immediately’ because it was hit… minutes afterwards I was outside, with people pulling me away from danger … which now feels funny to say, as we have no idea where a safe place would be to seek refuge in. 
“So far [the building] hasn’t [ been destroyed], but the terror of the thought alone is enough. We haven’t slept a wink, the strikes have been non-stop. I have a two and a half year old daughter and this is her first war, I was terrified myself and did not know what to do to calm her,” she said, adding “what drives me crazy, is that they can easily just target precisely whoever they want as they’ve done with our building, and yet they choose to level entire buildings to the ground. What does that tell you? I’m sure not an entire building is a security threat.”  
Amnesty International is calling on the international community, UN Security Council members – including the United States – to publicly denounce violations of humanitarian law and pressure all sides to the conflict to protect civilians. The United States needs to stop stalling and allow the UN Security Council to release a strong statement immediately.  
“UN Security Council members must take a strong and public stand and immediately impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups with the aim of preventing further serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights by the parties to the conflict,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“The international community must also press Israel to address root causes of the latest flare up in violence which include longstanding impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law as well as Israel’s ongoing illegal settlement expansion, the blockade of Gaza, and the forcible eviction and dispossession of Palestinians such as those in Sheikh Jarrah.”

The actions – held both online and in person on the 10th anniversary of the Istanbul Convention – have been organized by women’s and human rights groups worldwide. 
“Exactly ten years after it was signed, women are speaking today with one voice to demand that the Turkish authorities reverse a decision that will put the safety and even the lives of millions of women and girls in peril,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General, Agnes Callamard. 
“In the weeks since President Erdoğan’s announced his decision to quit the Istanbul Convention, women in Turkey and around the world are coming together. Rather than being cowed, women have been on the streets. Rather than being discouraged women have been galvanized. More than ever, people are talking about the Convention and understanding its importance.” 
In March, President Erdoğan announced Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention in a presidential decree. The decision is to come into force on 1 July, but campaigners are demanding that Turkish authorities reconsider their decision. 
Amnesty International is concerned that Turkey’s withdrawal is just the tip of a dangerous populist iceberg. Using a backward-looking and misrepresented frame of “family values” several governments are attempting to roll back women’s and LGBTI+ rights across Europe. 
The voices of women in Turkey and around the world have been supported by strong condemnation of the decision to withdraw from world leaders including Joe Biden and European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen. 
Despite lockdowns in many countries, physical actions are planned in some capital cities and virtual protests will take place on social media with people wearing purple in solidarity with women and girls in Turkey. 
“In the decade since it was first signed, the Istanbul Convention has been a crucial instrument that has helped protect women from violence. Withdrawal would spell uncertainty, fear and real danger for millions of women and girls in Turkey,” said Agnes Callamard. 
“The threat of violence is something faced by women and girls around the world on a daily basis. This is why the ratification of the Istanbul Convention is so significant and it is why international solidarity to protect it is so vital.”

BACKGROUND 
The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, known as the Istanbul Convention, opened for signature in Istanbul, on this day in Turkey in 2011. 
The Istanbul Convention is the first European treaty and the most far-reaching international treaty to tackle violence against women and domestic violence. The Convention sets minimum standards on the prevention of violence, protection of women and girls at risk, and the criminal prosecution of perpetrators as well as establishing protection and support services such as shelters and medical help for survivors. 
Thirty-four Council of Europe countries have now ratified the Convention, which came into force in 2014, and twelve more have signed but not yet ratified. Yesterday, Lichtenstein’s Parliament approved ratification of the Convention. 
In March, the Turkish government attempted to justify their decision to withdraw from the Convention by claiming it is being used to ‘normalize homosexuality’ which they claim is ‘incompatible with Turkey’s social and family values’. See Amnesty International’s response here. 
Turkey was the first country to sign and ratify this crucial treaty that bears the name of its biggest and most iconic city and if it doesn’t reverse its decision, it will be the first country to leave. 
ACTIONS 
There will be protests and stunts outside Turkish embassies organized by Amnesty International groups several countries including the UK, the Netherlands, Austria, Italy and  Belgium (see https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FEUytN_TulAgnzmFyDR7OLpLPkLXHs8K)

At least 21 Israeli police officers and seven Israeli civilians were also injured, according to Israeli police. 
The organization calls on Israeli authorities to immediately halt forced evictions in the neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah and end the ongoing forced displacement of Palestinians from East Jerusalem. 
In the latest escalation, Palestinian armed groups have fired rockets and missiles into Israel injuring at least one Israeli and there have been reports of several people killed in Gaza from retaliatory attacks by Israel. Amnesty International calls on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and take all feasible precautions to avoid harming civilians. 
“Evidence gathered by Amnesty International reveals a chilling pattern of Israeli forces using abusive and wanton force against largely peaceful Palestinian protesters in recent days. Some of those injured in the violence in East Jerusalem include bystanders or worshippers making Ramadan prayers,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“The latest violence brings into sharp focus Israel’s sustained campaign to expand illegal Israeli settlements and step up forced evictions of Palestinian residents- such as those in Sheikh Jarrah – to make way for Israeli settlers. These forced evictions are part of a continuing pattern in Sheikh Jarrah, they flagrantly violate international law and would amount to war crimes.” 
Eyewitness testimonies – as well as videos and photographs taken by Amnesty International’s researchers on the ground in East Jerusalem –show how Israeli forces have repeatedly deployed disproportionate and unlawful force to disperse protesters during violent raids on al-Aqsa mosque and carried out unprovoked attacks on peaceful demonstrators in Sheikh Jarrah. 
Since the beginning of Ramadan on 13 April tensions have been steadily rising as Palestinians protested against Israeli restrictions limiting their access to Damascus Gate, a main entrance to the Old City of Jerusalem. On 26 April, Israeli authorities removed the restrictions in response to the continuous demonstrations. Anger has also been rising over the imminent plans to forcibly evict four Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah to make way for Israeli settlers. 
Unlawful use of force 
Tensions reached boiling point on 7 May, when more than 170 Palestinians were injured as Israeli forces stormed the al-Aqsa mosque compound in dispersing worshippers along with protesters, firing 40mm kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs) and concussion grenades into crowds gathered there for prayers on the last Friday of Ramadan.    
A Palestinian journalist present at the scene described how Israeli forces went on the rampage firing projectiles and tear gas. He also said they stormed the clinic at the mosque and beat protesters. He told Amnesty International: “I’ve been covering events taking place in Jerusalem for the past 10 years… and I’ve never been this scared in my life.  Everyone was a target, I want to say that the shooting was random, but that would be a lie. They knew exactly who and where they were aiming their bullets and grenades at. Most of the people were targeted in their upper bodies (eyes, face, and chest).” 
He was also shot in the back – while holding up his camera and attempting to leave the area.  
In response, protesters at al-Aqsa threw stones and lit fires as Israeli forces on horseback and in riot gear used stun grenades to repel them. 
On 10 May, more than 300 Palestinian protesters were injured when Israeli forces stormed the al-Aqsa compound for the second time in days. A Red Crescent spokesperson told Amnesty International that the violence led to the hospitalisation of at least 250 Palestinians, with seven in a critical condition. 
One eyewitness said Israeli forces began breaking windows and firing tear gas and stun grenades, leaving many people inside struggling to breathe. 
Another witness on the scene said Israeli forces started firing tear gas from rooftops before more forces stormed al-Haram square from al Magharbeh gate. “They kept moving in pushing people into al-Aqsa mosque, locking [the doors] with metal chains… and then breaking a window to throw in tear gas at people literally locked up with not much room to breathe or get medical assistance… on top of it they started to  shoot rubber bullets at worshippers inside,” he said. 
He also reported seeing Israeli forces beating passers-by and stopping cars evacuating the wounded to photograph the injured before letting them go. He himself was shot in the chest while he approached a medic on the scene who had been injured.  
Sheikh Jarrah  
Over the past week Palestinians in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood have held nightly demonstrations in response to the imminent threat of forced eviction. Amnesty International has documented arbitrary arrests of peaceful demonstrators, the use of excessive force, arbitrary use of sound and stun grenades as well as the arbitrary spraying of maloderant (skunk) water canons at demonstrators and homes in Sheikh Jarrah.    
Four Palestinian families in the neighbourhood are under imminent threat of forced eviction after a Jerusalem court rejected their appeal against an eviction order. Nahalat Shimon International, a settler company, has filed lawsuits to seize the homes of dozens of families in Sheikh Jarrah using inherently discriminatory laws, such as the Legal and Administrative Matter Laws as well as the Absentee Property Law of 1950, to confiscate Palestinian land or property and transfer it to settler groups. Forcible transfer of the occupied population is prohibited under international humanitarian law and constitutes a war crimes according to the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court. 
Amnesty International researchers witnessed an unprovoked attack by Israeli forces against a group of peaceful demonstrators in Sheikh Jarrah on 9 May. Israeli forces arrived shortly before iftar, the evening Ramadan meal. After the meal tens of peaceful protesters formed a circle and began chanting against the imminent plans to evict Palestinian families from their homes. The demonstrators were at least 10 metres away from the Israeli forces who were stationed by a nearby Israeli settlers’ home. A short while later Israeli forces launched a coordinated attack to disperse the crowd of Palestinian protesters. Israeli forces on horseback began to sprint towards the crowd. One man limping in pain said he was trampled on by police horses as he tried to run away from the area. Residents were pushed into the walls of their homes and five men were arbitrarily arrested. 
Israeli forces began to shove and hit the group – including an Amnesty researcher observing the protest. At around 10pm they brought the skunk water canons and sound grenades and began to arbitrarily fire at demonstrators. 
Osama Dweik, was arrested during a nightly demonstration in Sheikh Jarrah on 6 May when Israeli police suddenly charged at the group of protesters and immediately detained him. At the police station, he saw Israeli police kicking and beating with batons four Palestinians detained during the Damascus Gate clashes and Sheikh Jarrah protests. Seven other people were arrested at Sheikh Jarrah that night alone. 
Gil Hammerschlag, an Israeli activist demonstrating against the forced evictions at Sheikh Jarrah on 7 May, was shoved and kicked by Israeli forces who threw sound grenades at peaceful demonstrators from less than 10 metres away. 
On the same day, a middle-aged Palestinian man was left badly bruised in the leg when Israeli forces threw a stun grenade that struck him in the thigh. A photographer also on the scene told how Israeli forces, including police on horseback, charged towards a crowd peacefully chanting after one of the protesters threw a plastic water bottle at them. 
“Amnesty International researchers witnessed deplorable conduct by security forces at Sheikh Jarrah including entirely unprovoked attacks on peaceful protesters standing up for rights and calling for respect of international law. Instead of further violating the rights of Sheikh Jarrah’s residents and solidarity activists, Israeli authorities must immediately scrap planned forced evictions,” said Saleh Higazi. 
Amnesty International is calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its systematic violations under international law. 
“Israel must not be allowed to continue its rampage against Palestinians who are simply defending their right to exist and protesting against their forced displacement. Mere expressions of concerns about Israel’s utter disregard for its obligations under international law are not sufficient. There must be clear and strong denunciations of the flagrant violations, including forced displacement, the expansion of illegal settlements and the brutal repression of people protesting against such grave violations,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“As an immediate step we call on the United Nations Security Council members to convene an open session and for the Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process to brief member states.” 
Nabil el-Kurd, one of the residents under threat of forced eviction in Sheikh Jarrah, told Amnesty International: 
“Sheikh Jarrah is sending a message to the whole world, including the US Congress, the UK Parliament, the French Parliament, the EU Parliament, the International Criminal Court, that what is happening to us is a war crime. It is not just an eviction, but a war crime. Remember that. I do not know why the entire world is watching what is happening and letting Israel get away with it. It is time they stopped spoiling Israel.”

“The attacks by armed civilians, some in the presence of the police, against the Indigenous Minga in Cali are a reflection of the ceaseless dynamics of violence in Colombia that have been accentuated during the social protests related to the National Strike. Since 28 April, there have been reports of dozens of people killed, hundreds injured and disappeared, acts of sexual torture and scenes of horror amidst the repression of mostly peaceful demonstrations, without Iván Duque’s government even publicly recognizing these human rights violations.” 
“Historically, Indigenous and Afro-descendant people have suffered disproportionately from the consequences of violence, the armed conflict and the lack of state protection. It’s unacceptable that the authorities have not immediately heeded the urgent calls on them to prevent armed violence; on the contrary, several authorities, including the National Police have issued stigmatizing statements about the Indigenous Minga and those peacefully demonstrating in Cali.” 
“Besides the excessive repression, there has also been constant stigmatization of those who demonstrate, which incites and justifies the violent response against them. The Indigenous Minga fears for the lives of its members, including those who are hospitalized. We call urgently on Iván Duque’s government to stop the repression and the stigmatization of protest, and to guarantee and protect all the human rights of the Indigenous and Afro-descendant people participating in the National Strike.” 
According to a joint report by the NGO Temblores and Indepaz, 47 killings have been reported during the National Strike from 28 April to 9 May. Of these cases, 36 occurred in Valle del Cauca (35 in Cali and one in Yumbo). The joint report denounces that the security forces and authorities have not heeded citizens’ calls to prevent attacks by armed persons against demonstrators, the presence of plainclothes police officers among demonstrators, and the repression of peaceful demonstrations.

Police have used force indiscriminately and disproportionately, and there are alarming reports of sexual violence and disappearances, Amnesty International denounced today. Enforced disappearance and sexual violence perpetrated by authorities are crimes under international law that any state should investigate and prosecute. 
“The Colombian authorities must guarantee the right to peaceful assembly and refrain from stigmatizing and repressing the demonstrations that have been taking place across the country since 28 April. Guaranteeing peaceful demonstrators’ right to life and their safety must be central to the authorities’ response, in accordance with international human rights standards,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Amnesty International has previously denounced incidents of security forces using lethal and less lethal weapons indiscriminately, and despite multiple international condemnations of this evidence, the organization continues to document serious cases of excessive use of force against demonstrators. Through analysis and verification of audiovisual images, the organization has confirmed, for example, the use of tear gas grenade launchers fired by ESMAD officers at close range against demonstrators in Cali. In another incident Amnesty International was able to verify in Bogotá, police used a firearm against a person as they fled. The organization has also received reports that on the night of 4 May in Cali’s Siloé neighborhood there were shots fired directly at demonstrators, threats and acts of torture. 
As of 6 May, the NGO Temblores has reported the violent death of 37 people, 1,708 cases of abusive use of force, 26 victims of eye injuries, 234 victims of physical violence and 934 arbitrary detentions against demonstrators. It also denounced that 11 people were victims of sexual violence. For its part, the Ombudsman’s Office of Colombia sent out an alert about 87 people reported missing during the demonstrations, although this figure is due to be updated. As of 4 May, the Working Group on Forced Disappearances, formed by victims’ organizations, documented 135 reports of possible forced disappearances. At least 28 of these persons have since been located. 
There have been multiple reports of sexual abuse during arrests by security forces. For example, a woman demonstrating in Cali on 30 April reported on social networks that she was sexually abused by ESMAD agents. During a confrontation, several agents fired gas to disperse the protesters and although she had her arms raised in a peaceful manner, ESMAD agents separated the women from the men and one agent sexually abused her in front of his companions. 
“We share the outrage of all those who have been victims of gender-based violence in the context of the protests in Colombia. Iván Duque, as commander in chief of the security forces, must speak out about these events. Silence leaves only a veil of impunity and complicity. We have received several complaints of sexual abuse by ESMAD agents and we strongly condemn the use of force against women’s bodies as a form of punishment,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“The Colombian authorities must investigate all allegations of human rights violations and crimes under international law in a prompt, impartial and exhaustive fashion, guaranteeing the rights and safety of victims and witnesses. Impunity must not prevail in the face of these grave crimes.” 
International human rights standards are consistent in demanding that police should only use force when controlling demonstrations as a last resort and they must adhere to the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality, and accountability. The use of force to maintain order in situations that do not pose a concrete threat to the life or physical safety of third parties is considered disproportionate use of force, and therefore contrary to international standards. 
Although most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, there have also been reports of destruction and damage to public and private urban furniture, as well as obstruction of public roads. However, some isolated violent acts cannot be a reason to stigmatize all demonstrations as violent, nor to repress them violently. 
Amnesty International is concerned that national government authorities have publicly stated that the demonstrations have “terrorist” purposes and that, for this reason, excessive use of force against the population is justified. Furthermore, statements by local authorities calling for civilians to take up arms against demonstrators are alarming and appear to justify the use of paramilitary strategies. This not only violates human rights standards but is an affront to all victims of paramilitary groups in a country that has the longest running internal armed conflict on the continent. The stigmatization of social protest only generates repression and human rights violations, as well as an atmosphere of distrust in the authorities that does not lead to the genuine establishment of channels of dialogue. 
Amnesty International has signed a global petition along with 650 civil society organizations demanding a thorough investigation into human rights violations in the context of the repression, and calling on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to request the Colombian state’s consent to visit the country and install an independent body of experts to assist in the investigation of the events and ensure justice for the victims. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
The disproportionate use of force by National Police officers has been widely documented by Amnesty International in Colombia. The organization condemned acts of torture and excessive use of force in the context of peaceful demonstrations that occurred in November 2019 and September 2020. 
Last September, the Colombian Supreme Court of Justice issued a landmark ruling urging the security forces to refrain from systematic, arbitrary and violent interventions in public demonstrations after verifying the excessive violence that occurred in November and December 2019. According to reports from human rights organizations and networks, the Colombian authorities have not yet complied with this ruling.    
The Colombian authorities have an obligation to respect the human rights to peaceful assembly and protest, which are closely linked to the rights to free expression and political participation. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has noted that failure to respect and guarantee the right to peaceful assembly is often an indication of repression.

No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
In late March 2021, Nicolás Maduro’s government published an administrative regulation requiring the registration of all natural or legal persons of a nonfinancial nature before 1 May, emphasizing the obligation of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to register to ensure the surveillance and supervision of their work. The regulation as published, imposed strict and abusive controls that included listing all their beneficiaries and other organizations with whom they work with. In case of non-compliance, NGOs could face criminal charges and non-specific sanctions from the Law against Organized Crime and the Financing of Terrorism. 
A few days after its entry into force, on 3 May, the government issued a new administrative regulation changing the core concerns that NGOs and international organizations condemned publicly and in conflict with human rights standards. 
Public pressure by Amnesty International, local partners and international organizations, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), had a direct impact in the government reversing its attack on civil society and striking this regulation down. Although the regulation still requires NGOs in Venezuela to register and concerns remain over the use of the Law against Organized Crime and the Financing of Terrorism to control civil society organizations, lack of compliance with the regulation does no longer imply an explicit criminal sanction. 
This step back in the policy of repression comes in a context in which the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that by June 2021 it would announce whether it would open an investigation into crimes against humanity in Venezuela. 
We will continue to monitor and mobilize against any governmental attempt to impede the right to defend rights in Venezuela.

They have provided the Court with legal arguments on how government climate policies must protect the rights of people outside their borders. 
The Court will decide on whether it agrees to proceed with the case filed not only against Portugal, where the applicants live, but also 32 other countries – which comprise of EU members as well as Norway, Russia, Turkey, Switzerland, UK and Ukraine. 
“The climate crisis does not respect borders and our laws and policies must reflect this. To ensure justice for people most affected by heatwaves, drought and forest fires – particularly children – states must be required to tackle climate change and its impacts at home and abroad,” said Ashfaq Khalfan, Amnesty’s Law and Policy Director. 
“Governments can no longer act as if people outside their borders do not matter when they design their climate policies.” 
The crowdfunded case, Duarte Agostinho and others v. Portugal and others, in which the group is intervening, has been brought by six youth from Portugal who are accusing 33 European countries of violating their human rights, including their right to life, by not taking adequate steps to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
“Those affected by climate change should be allowed to make claims against governments other than their own. If governments are only required to act on the rights of people living within their borders, it is easier for them to ignore the impacts on people in the most affected countries and be more lethargic in their work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions” said Professor Mark Gibney, of the University of North Carolina Asheville. 
If allowed to proceed, the case could set an important precedent, clearing the way for other climate lawsuits based on human rights arguments. 
“This case is also important to ensure governments are required to design climate policy in a way that recognises the particular climate risks to children and take the ambitious climate protection measures needed to protect their rights,” said Gamze Erdem Türkelli, of the University of Antwerp.

Additional Information 
A national strike (“Paro Nacional”) started on 28 April, triggered by a tax reform proposal from President Duque aimed at increasing tax revenues to counter the economic crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The “Paro Nacional” also reiterated several demands from Colombian civil society expressed in similar protests in late 2019, such as measures to stop the killing of social leaders, the fulfillment of the Peace Accords, establishing an accessible, safe, and comprehensive health system, and thorough police reform, among others. 
On 1 May, the president announced the deployment of the military in “urban centers where there is a high risk to the integrity of citizens”, and stated: “I want to issue a clear warning to those who, through violence, vandalism and terrorism, seek to intimidate society and think that by this mechanism they will break the institutions.” On 5 May, the president also said “the vandalism threat we face consists of a criminal organization that hides behind legitimate social aspirations” and added “the extreme vandalism and urban terrorism we are observing is financed and articulated by drug trafficking mafias.” 
Since the beginning of the “Paro Nacional,” several protests in key cities like Bogotá, Cali, and Pasto have been met by excessive use of force, including armed and lethal force, resulting in 31 persons killed, 216 injured and 814 arbitrarily detained. There are also concerning reports of acts of sexual violence and people disappeared. 
Amnesty International verified videos where the Colombian police used lethal weaponry and indiscriminately used less lethal weapons such as tear gas, water cannons, and other materials against protestors in several parts of the country. 
This pattern of repression of this year’s “Paro Nacional” mimics that seen in the protests in 2019, when several people were killed after been shot with tear gas-grenades and firearms with live and potentially lethal ammunition. It also mimics the repression in late 2020 when the National Police reported that 403 people were injured, among them 194 members of the security forces, and 10 people were killed in the context of protests in response to the lawyer Javier Ordonez’s killing by the police. 
Several investigations for crimes committed by law enforcement officers in the context of protests are on their way, but human rights violations committed by police are often investigated under military jurisdiction, such as the case of Dilan Cruz killed during a protest in 2019, impeding tangible progress towards truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-repetition to the victims, their relatives, and society.

“Donald Trump repeatedly encouraged violence and disorder by his supporters affecting journalists, activists, faith communities and others using his social media platform. While the Oversight Board upheld Facebook’s January 7 decision to restrict Trump’s access to Facebook and Instagram, it criticized the ‘standardless’ and open-ended nature of the suspension. 
“Crucially, the decision doesn’t solve any of the fundamental problems with Facebook’s disastrous handling of hateful and violent speech on their platform. The Oversight Board’s decisions only apply to specific cases – and while it can offer recommendations, it lacks the power to change Facebook’s overall approach to such content, particularly its inconsistent application of its Terms of Service globally. 
“Facebook and other social media companies have enormous power when deciding what can and cannot be said on their platforms. They have a responsibility to protect people from content on their platforms that incites violence or hatred. Yet Facebook’s surveillance-based business model can incentivize the spread of hateful and violent speech, which drives user engagement. The Board does not have a say about how Facebook’s recommendation algorithms work to demote or privilege certain content or ads, and today’s decision does not change that fact. 
“We are long past the point when we can rely on Facebook or any other social media platform to police itself. Urgent government regulation is needed to tackle unaccountable algorithms and a core business model based on invasive surveillance and profiling.” 
Background 
After the storming of the Capitol, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, announced that Donald Trump would be blocked from using both Facebook and Instagram “indefinitely” for violating its policy by using the platform “to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government.” The case was then handed to the board for review.

Additional Information 
Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, born on 28 May 1983, is a Saudi national. He holds a university degree in business and works as an assistant to the Head of the Saudi Arabian Red Crescent Society in Riyadh. He is currently held in Al Ha’ir Prison in Riyadh where he is serving a 20-year prison sentence issued by the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh on 5 April 2021. 
In his first session on 3 March 2020, the charges against al-Sadhan included “funding terrorism”, “support for a terrorist entity (ISIS) and advocating for it”, “preparing, storing and sending what would prejudice public order and religious values, “adopting an extremist approach calling for the exclusion of women and depriving them of the rights guaranteed to them by law” and “offending state institutions and officials and spreading false rumours about them”. 
On 11 March, a second hearing took place and was attended by Abdulrahman al-Sadhan’s father and a court-appointed lawyer who was only permitted a 40-minute meeting with Abdulrahman al-Sadhan before the hearing. For an hour only, his father and lawyer were allowed to examine a list of “evidence” against him, which consisted of over 200 pages of tweets extracted from the satirical twitter accounts and a two-page document containing “confessions” made by Abdulrahman al-Sadhan, likely under duress, his family believes. He had been forced to sign and stamp the “evidence” documents which neither his father nor his lawyer received a copy of. 
On 17 March, a third hearing took place during which Abdulrahman al-Sadhan’s lawyer presented the defence and his father submitted a request for a temporary release of his son, but this request was ignored. The fourth session took place on 22 March in the absence of Abdulrahman al-Sadhan’s father and lawyer, whom the authorities failed to inform on time. On 5 April, the Specialized Criminal Court sentenced Abdulrahman al-Sadhan to 20 years in prison followed by 20 years on travel ban. He plans to appeal the verdict. 
Amnesty International’s research shows that through the Specialized Criminal Court, which was initially set up as an anti-terror court, peaceful activists, religious clerics and members of the Shi’a minority are often subjected to grossly unfair trials, given lengthy prison sentences, and even sentenced to death based on so-called “confessions” that are extracted under torture. Several individuals have already been executed. This court is one of the Saudi Arabian state’s most powerful tools for muzzling critical voices in Saudi Arabia. 
Amnesty International is calling on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all individuals detained solely for peacefully advocating for reforms and defending basic human rights.

0,Myanmar: UN Security Council must urgently impose arms embargo,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/myanmar-un-security-council-must-urgently-impose-arms-embargo/,"Amnesty International joins call for #NotOneBulletMore with over 200 organizations The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) must immediately impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar to bring an end to the mass killing of largely peaceful protestors by the Myanmar security forces, said...","The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) must immediately impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Myanmar to bring an end to the mass killing of largely peaceful protestors by the Myanmar security forces, said Amnesty International today in a joint call with over 200 civil society organizations. 
“Mere condemnation by the international community has had no effect. It is time for the UN Security Council to use its unique powers to impose a comprehensive global arms embargo in order to try and end the military’s killing spree,” said Lawrence Moss, Senior UN Advocate for Amnesty International. 
Since the 1 February coup, at least 769 protestors have reportedly been unlawfully killed by the military, and thousands more arbitrarily detained, including the country’s elected civilian leadership, human rights defenders, activists, journalists, and other critics of the military coup. 
After examining over 50 clips from the ongoing crackdown, Amnesty International found that the Myanmar military, including units implicated in crimes under international law against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities, is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country. Many of these killings amount to extrajudicial executions.  
On 10 March 2021, the UNSC issued a Presidential Statement that “strongly condemns the violence against peaceful protestors, including women youth and children,” and “calls for the military to exercise utmost restraint.” On 24 April, the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) released their consensus statement calling for the “immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar.” 
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also strongly condemned “the continuing brutal violence by the military in Myanmar,“ and said the “continuing military crackdown (…) is unacceptable and demands a firm, unified and resolute international response.” The Secretary-General’s Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener, who has been barred from even entering Myanmar by the military has strongly condemned “the continuing bloodshed in the country as the military defies international calls, including from the Security Council, for restraint, dialogue and full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.” 
In April 2021, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet warned that the situation in Myanmar clearly echoes that of Syria in 2011. “There too, we saw peaceful protests met with unnecessary and clearly disproportionate force. The State’s brutal, persistent repression of its own people led to some individuals taking up arms, followed by a downward and rapidly expanding spiral of violence all across the country,” she said. 
“The Myanmar military has ignored calls from the leadership of the international community to halt its murderous rampage. The generals are defying the unanimous demands of the UN Security Council and Myanmar’s ASEAN neighbors to halt the bloodshed,” said Lawrence Moss. 
“Had the Security Council imposed and enforced an arms embargo in Syria a decade ago, the bullets would have run out long ago. This time the Council must act before the grave situation in Myanmar becomes a similar catastrophe.” 
Background 
Amnesty International is renewing its call for the UN Security Council to impose a comprehensive arms embargo as part of the #NotOneBulletMore campaign together with over 200 civil society organizations. 
Amnesty International has also called on the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, as well as impose targeted financial sanctions against Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing (Myanmar’s military chief now in charge of the country) and other military leaders responsible for atrocity crimes against various ethnic minorities across the country, including the Rohingya.

0,An average of 7 in 10 across G7 countries think their governments should force big pharma to share vaccine know-how,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/average-7-10-across-g7-countries-think-their-governments-should-force-big-pharma-share-vaccine/,"G7 governments still refusing to waive intellectual property on Covid-19 vaccines, despite widespread public support People’s Vaccine Alliance calls for G7 leaders to support a vaccine patent waiver at today’s foreign and development ministers meeting in London. A supermajority of people in G7...","A supermajority of people in G7 countries believe that governments should ensure pharmaceutical companies share the formulas and technology to their vaccines, according to new polling from the People’s Vaccine Alliance. 
The public believes that pharmaceutical companies should be fairly compensated for developing vaccines, but should be prevented from holding a monopoly on the jabs. 
It comes as G7 foreign and development ministers meet in London, the group’s first in-person meeting in two years, and the general council of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) meets today online, while India’s death toll climbs. 
Across G7 nations, an average of 70% of people want the government to ensure vaccine know-how is shared, according to analysis by the People’s Vaccine Alliance. Support for government intervention is highest in Italy, where 82% of respondents were in favour, followed by Canada, where 76% agree. 
74% in the United Kingdom want the government to prevent Big Pharma monopolies, despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson attributing the country’s successful vaccine rollout to “greed and capitalism”. 
UK support for intervention cuts across political boundaries, backed by 73% of Conservative voters, 83% of Labour and 79% of Liberal Democrats, as well as 83% of Remain and 72% of Leave voters in the EU referendum. 
In the United States, where President Joe Biden has voiced his “hope and expectation” for sharing vaccine know-how, 69% of the public support the measure, including 89% of Biden and 65% of Trump voters in 2020. In Japan, 58% of the public want similar action. 
European Union member-nations were also strongly in favour, with support from 70% in Germany and 63% in France. 
Heidi Chow, Senior Campaigns and Policy Manager at Global Justice Now, said: 
“The public doesn’t want big pharma to hold monopolies on vaccines that were developed largely with public money. These vaccines are a global public good that should be available to everyone, everywhere. That much is obvious to the public across G7 nations, but political leaders are burying their heads in the sand while people die around them.” 
Despite widespread support for sharing vaccine know-how, G7 governments have continued to support pharmaceutical monopolies on Covid-19 jabs. 
More than 100 countries, led by India and South Africa, have supported a temporary waiver of Intellectual Property rights on Covid-19 vaccines at the WTO, but the proposal has been blocked by countries including the US, UK, Japan, Canada, and the EU. 
The Biden administration has confirmed it is reconsidering American opposition to the waiver. 
Pharmaceutical companies have so far refused to share their vaccine know-how with the world. No company with a successful vaccine has joined the World Health Organisation’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), which was established to facilitate sharing blueprints for vaccines and treatments. 
Saoirse Fitzpatrick, STOPAIDS Advocacy Manager said: 
“The horrific situation in India should shake G7 leaders to their core. Now is not the time for an ideological defence of intellectual property rules. Bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies have not worked. Governments need to step in and force pharmaceutical companies to share their intellectual property and vaccine know-how with the world.” 
As G7 chair, the UK has proposed a Pandemic Preparedness Plan, to be discussed by ministers this week, which ignores the issue of monopolies and intellectual property. Pharmaceutical corporations such as Pfizer are on the team preparing the proposal, but developing country governments and vaccine producers have not been asked to join.  
Steve Cockburn, Head of Economic and Social Justice at Amnesty International, said: 
“G7 governments have clear human rights obligations to put the lives of millions of people across the world ahead of the interests of the pharmaceutical companies that they have funded. It would be a gross failure of leadership to continue blocking the sharing of life-saving technologies, and would only serve to prolong the immense pain and suffering caused by this pandemic.” 
Last month, 175 former world leaders and Nobel laureates, including Gordon Brown, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and Francoise Hollande wrote to President Biden to support the temporary waiving of intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines. 
150 faith leaders, including Rowan Williams, the former archbishop of Canterbury, Thabo Makgoba, the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, and Cardinal Peter Turkson of the Roman Catholic Church have called for G7 leaders to treat Covid-19 as a “global common good”. 
Anna Marriott, Health Policy Manager at Oxfam, said: 
“People are dying by the thousands in low and middle income countries while rich nations have jumped the vaccine queue. G7 leaders need to face up to reality. We don’t have enough vaccines for everyone and the biggest barrier to increasing supply is that a few profit hungry pharmaceutical corporations keep the rights to produce them under the lock and key. It’s time to waive the intellectual property rules, ramp up production and put people’s lives before profits. It’s time for a People’s Vaccine.” 
Two-thirds of world-leading epidemiologists surveyed warned that the continued spread of the virus could allow vaccine-resistant strains of Covid-19 to render our current vaccines ineffective within a year. Independent SAGE, who provide independent public health advice in the United Kingdom, have called for a patent waiver to address supply issues. 
Moderna, Pfizer/BioNtech, Johnson & Johnson, Novovax and Oxford/AstraZeneca received billions in public funding and guaranteed pre-orders, including $12 billion from the US government alone. An estimated 97% of funding for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine came from public sources. 
The companies have paid out a combined $26 billion in dividends and stock buybacks to their shareholders this year, enough to vaccinate at least 1.3 billion people, equivalent to the population of Africa. 
The People’s Vaccine Alliance has analysed polling from across G7 countries conducted by YouGov, Leger360, and Nippon Research Center. 
When asked if they support the statement ‘Governments should compensate fairly for any COVID-19 vaccine developed by a pharmaceutical company but ensure they don’t have a monopoly by sharing these formulas and technology with other approved companies’, views reflected by public in each country were:

The article was covering a protest staged by the Tuareg population of the Tamanrasset area, in southern Algeria, contesting the recent transfer of parts of their province into a newly established province. Rabah Kareche has been charged with “spreading fake news or information which threatens public security or public order,” “harming the national security or national unity,” and “creating or supervising an electronic site to publish information likely to cause discrimination and hatred in society.” He is detained in a prison in Tamanrasset awaiting trial and could face up to 23 years in prison if convicted. He must be immediately and unconditionally released.

Additional Information 
Rabah Kareche has been a correspondent for Liberté newspaper in Tamanrasset for almost a decade. His publications in Liberté cover a range of issues including social justice, governance, corruption, and migration. His coverage of events in Algeria’s most southern region and military zone brought attention to the struggle of the Tuareg populations who regularly protest against their economic and social marginalization without enough media attention. Rabah Kareche exposed this issue including through interviewing a tribal leader of the district of Tazrouk, in the province of Tamanrasset, who accused the authorities of not having taken into account a report on the historical territorial limits of the province when deciding to establish new territorial division in the region. 
Rabah Kareche’s detention is an example of the Algerian authorities’ renewed crackdown on human rights, particularly the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and media freedom in the country. In February 2021, President Tebboune pardoned dozens of activists who had spent months in prison for nothing other than peacefully participating in the popular Hirak protest movement- which demands political change in Algeria- . Among those released was journalist Khaled Drareni who had spent almost a year behind bars simply for covering the Hirak protests. Since the Hirak protests resumed in February 2021 after months of rupture, due to COVID-19 restrictions, the Algerian authorities resumed repressive tactics by targeting journalists, human rights defenders, activists, and protesters through arbitrary arrests and various other means that limit their rights to peaceful expression and assembly. According to the National Committee for the liberation of detainees, a local watchdog group, at least 63 activists are currently in detention in Algeria, with 48 arrested since February 2021. 
Algerian legislation is rife with repressive provisions that enable the prosecution of journalists, bloggers and activists. These laws are often vaguely worded and overly broad, allowing them to be applied arbitrarily against people criticizing the authorities. In a report published on 22 February 2021, Amnesty International found that courts relied on at least 20 such articles, with the most commonly used being “harming national unity”, “harming national interest”, “demoralizing the army”, “incitement to unarmed gathering”, “offending public officials”, “offending the President” or “harming Islam”, under Penal Code Articles 79, 96, 74, 75, 100, 144, 144 bis, and 144 bis 1 respectively. The authorities used the COVID-19 pandemic as excuse to pass new laws which further curtail the rights to freedom of expression, online and offline, and peaceful assembly, by adding article 196 bis to the Penal Code to punish the spread of “fake news”. 
As a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)- which in its Article 19 guarantees everyone’s right to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any media- Algeria is obligated to respect, protect, promote and fulfil the right to freedom of expression and media freedom.

“The Colombian authorities must promptly, independently and impartially investigate all allegations of excessive and unnecessary use of force against demonstrators, which has resulted in dozens of people being killed and injured, arbitrary detentions, acts of torture and sexual violence, and reports of people disappearing. They must also respect freedom of expression and the press, and ensure that journalists can cover the news in safety,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Since 28 April, there have been demonstrations, mostly peaceful, in different parts of the country in response to the tax reform bill presented by President Iván Duque, which have often been violently repressed. On 1 May, the president announced a military presence in “urban centers where there is a high risk to the integrity of citizens”, and stated: “I want to issue a clear warning to those who, through violence, vandalism and terrorism, seek to intimidate society and think that by this mechanism they will break the institutions”. 
“The population’s discontent over economic measures that they perceive as unfair and may put their human rights at risk should not be labeled ‘vandalism and terrorism’, as President Iván Duque has done, nor be used as an excuse for violent repression,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
As of 3 May, civil society organizations reported 26 people killed as a result of repression by the National Police and 761 arbitrary detentions. They also reported 142 victims of mistreatment, nine victims of sexual violence and 56 reports of people disappearing in the context of the demonstrations. In addition, there were reports of attacks against journalists, including acts of physical violence, arbitrary arrests, and the deletion of journalistic material. 
Through analysis and verification of audiovisual images, Amnesty International has confirmed that Colombian police have used lethal weaponry in several incidents, as well as indiscriminate use of less lethal weapons such as tear gas, water cannons and other materials against demonstrators in several parts of the country. For example, the use of the Galil Tavorn rifle was identified in Cali during the repression of demonstrations on 30 April, as were police pointing semi-automatic weapons directly at unarmed demonstrators on 2 May in Popayán. In another incident, on 1 May in Bogotá, an armored vehicle was seen firing live ammunition. All such weaponry is prohibited for the dispersal of protests under international standards. 
Amnesty International considers that the human rights violations and crimes under international law committed by the security forces are not isolated or sporadic events but fit a consistent pattern in the modus operandi and the kinds of violations committed across the country. 
The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has established that states that are party to the American Convention on Human Rights, such as Colombia, must “restrict to the maximum extent the use of armed forces to control domestic disturbances, since they are trained to fight against enemies and not to protect and control civilians, a task that is typical of police forces”. Likewise, the Court has established that the exceptional participation of the armed forces in these tasks should be extraordinary, subordinate and complementary, regulated, through legal mechanisms and protocols on the use of force, under the principles of exceptionality, proportionality and absolute necessity and in accordance with the respective training in the matter and audited by competent, independent and technically capable civilian bodies. 
Even in the face of allegations of violence perpetrated by demonstrators in some protests, the authorities have the duty to take all appropriate measures to deal with such violence while ensuring that those who protest peacefully can continue to do so. 
In light of the withdrawal of the tax reform bill and the announcement of a new one, the government must ensure that any public tax policy it adopts is designed and implemented in line with Colombia’s international human rights obligations. This means ensuring that measures are temporary, reasonable and proportionate, that less restrictive alternative measures have been exhausted, and that the genuine participation of the individuals and groups involved is guaranteed. The government should urgently undertake a human rights impact assessment of these measures to ensure that they are non-discriminatory and that they respect, in particular, the rights of historically marginalized groups, and take into account the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its differential impact. 
In light of the announcement of more demonstrations, Amnesty International calls on the authorities to guarantee the Colombian people’s right to peaceful protest and reminds President Iván Duque that deploying the armed forces to control demonstrations only increases the risk of further human rights violations and crimes under international law.

Since the fighting...","African and other world leaders must urgently speak out and do more to stem the ferocious tide of human rights and international humanitarian law violations in the armed conflict that has now raged for six months in Ethiopia’s Tigray region, Amnesty International said today. 
Since the fighting broke out on 4 November 2020, thousands of civilians have been killed, hundreds of thousands of people have been internally displaced within Tigray, and 63,000 refugees have fled to Sudan. Amnesty International and other organizations have documented a string of serious human rights violations that include war crimes and likely crimes against humanity. There are also numerous credible reports of women and girls being subjected to sexual violence, including gang rape by Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers. 
“Six months on from the start of the conflict in Tigray, there is no lack of credible evidence of human rights and international humanitarian law violations, but the response from the African Union and United Nations has been woefully insufficient,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The UN Security Council stalled for months before finally expressing concern about the increasingly dire situation in Tigray. The African Union and governments in the region, meanwhile, have done very little to speak out against the raft of likely war crimes and crimes against humanity.” 
Violations on all sides 
The Ethiopian government has ignored Amnesty International’s requests to access Tigray, making it challenging to verify allegations of human rights violations amid severe, ongoing communications restrictions. 
However, Amnesty International has been able to document numerous atrocities in detail using open source investigative methods – including satellite imagery analysis and verification of video evidence – as well as by interviewing dozens of survivors, either via telephone with people in Tigray or in person with refugees in eastern Sudan. 
Among the atrocities the organization documented was the mass killing of hundreds of civilians in Mai-Kadra in western Tigray on 9-10 November 2020, allegedly by forces loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Subsequently, Amnesty has received reports of reprisal attacks targeting ethnic Tigrayan residents of Mai-Kadra, including extrajudicial executions, looting of property, and mass detention. 
Amnesty International found that Eritrean troops killed hundreds of civilians in Axum – in what likely amounted to a crime against humanity – on 28-29 November, and indiscriminately shot at civilians in Adwa, killing three of them and wounding 19 others, on 12 April 2021. Working in collaboration with CNN, Amnesty International also confirmed that Ethiopian National Defence Force troops carried out extrajudicial executions in Mahibere Dego, near Axum, on 15 January 2021. 
Since being granted access to Tigray in late February, international media outlets have published a string of reports confirming earlier accounts, by Amnesty International and others, of atrocities, as well as revealing harrowing new reports of violations. 
These have included allegations of ethnic cleansing in western Tigray –  an area under the control of pro-government Amhara Special Police and Fano, an Amhara militia – forcibly displacing tens of thousands of people. Amnesty International has not yet independently verified these allegations but continues to research the situation. 
In addition, there have been appalling reports of widespread rape and other gender-based violence targeting women and girls across Tigray. A recent statement by UN agencies and NGOs working in the region said they were “alarmed by reports of increasing violence against women and girls – including harrowing accounts of sexual violence” and that “the response remains wholly inadequate to the scale of need.” Meanwhile, humanitarian agencies have reported attacks on and looting of hospitals and other medical facilities across Tigray. 
“It is unconscionable that women and girls in Tigray are facing sexual violence while the world looks on. Meanwhile hospitals and humanitarian providers have had supplies decimated in the conflict and are ill-equipped to assist,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Humanitarian aid hampered and fears of famine 
Amnesty International has repeatedly called on all parties to the conflict in Tigray to allow unfettered humanitarian access. As of 27 April, the UN cited improvements, but said that “the situation in Tigray remains volatile and is hampering partners’ efforts to deliver timely humanitarian assistance.” 
In late March, workers for the humanitarian agency Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) had one of their missions to the regional capital Mekelle brutally interrupted twice. At the first stop, they witnessed soldiers carrying out extrajudicial executions along the roadside; a short distance away, soldiers again stopped the MSF vehicle, pulling out the Ethiopian driver and beating him with the back of a gun before threatening to kill him. 
The mass displacement of people from agrarian areas of Tigray, as well as allegations that crops have been deliberately destroyed and grain stores looted, have prompted the UN and other commentators to warn of “catastrophic” food insecurity and even the risk of impending famine.  
Meanwhile, there has also been a worrying increase in recent violence and violations against civilians in other parts of Ethiopia, most notably in Amhara, Benishangul, and Oromia regional states. There have been reports of attacks on civilians in Chilga District, North Shewa Zone, and Oromo Special Zone of Amhara region, and armed violence in Metekel Zone of Benishangul-Gumuz Region. In western Oromia Zones, armed people killed and displaced Amhara residents since November 2020. 
“It is imperative that international, independent investigations are carried out into the allegations of serious violations by all sides, with those responsible held to account, to send a clear message that there will be zero impunity,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“If the international community’s tepid response to the conflict in Tigray continues, there is a real threat that the already dire situation could spiral completely out of control.”

Despite this, the Urgent Action mobilized and brought together very important actors, social movements and organizations that will keep monitoring the next steps on discussion of the law. We will continue to demand a public consultation, analysis and public debate around the impacts deriving from this bill. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
On 24 March, parliamentarians Margarete Coelho (PP-Piauí) and Hugo Motta (Republicanos-Paraíba) submitted an Urgency Requirement to process Bill nº 6.764/2002. On 7 April, the presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, respectively Rodrigo Pacheco (DEM-Minas Gerais) and Arthur Lira (PP-Alagoas), stated that the proposed legislation was amongst the priorities of both Houses. Bill nº 6.764/2002 aims to repeal the National Security Law, enacted during the military regime and widely used to persecute opponents; however, it reissues and inserts new penalty types that could be used to reinforce the criminalization of social movements and organizations.  
Voting on this legislation on an urgent basis meant, in practice, that civil society and social organizations would not be able to properly analyze the bill and participate in its debate. Amnesty International considers that any decision-making processes around legislation with such potential impact on human rights should be rooted in transparency and the right to information, involving meaningful and effective participation of interested parties. Besides that, Brazil is going through one of the worst public health crisis in its entire history. At a moment like this, Brazilian authorities should prioritize its obligation to guarantee the right to health and life of its population.  
Although the Urgency Requirement was approved, the actions taken helped to strengthen a network of organizations and movements that will be crucial in time for its formal discussion before Congress.

Arrested on 22 April 2019, they were serving between five-and-a-half and six-year prison sentences under a series of “incitement” and “online defamation” charges in connection with their satirical performances criticizing the Myanmar military. 
No further action is requested. Many thanks to all who sent appeals. 
Three members of the Peacock Generation, Paing Phyo Min, Paing Ye Thu and Zayar Lwin were released from Insein prison in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, on 17 April 2021. They were among reportedly over 23,000 prisoners released in a general amnesty on Myanmar New Year. 
Arrested on 22 April 2019, Paing Phyo Min and Zayar Lwin were sentenced to six years in prison, while Paing Ye Thu was sentenced to five and a half years in prison after satirical performances criticizing the military. They were released after receiving a reduction of a quarter of their sentences in this year and last year’s Myanmar New Year amnesties. They were the latest members of the Peacock Generation released from prison. 
Three other members of the Peacock Generation; Zaw Lin Htut, Su Yadanar Myint, and Kay Khine Tun, have already been released. Sentenced to between two years and two and a half years in prison, they were released on 26 June, 19 August, and 1 October respectively in 2020. 
Members of the Peacock Generation were arrested after they performed Thangyat, a traditional art form in Myanmar, which fuses poetry, comedy, and music, and is usually performed during Myanmar’s New Year water festival in April and other festive occasions. They should have never been imprisoned for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. They should have not spent a single day behind bars for peaceful satirical performances.

“Lawyers are the last line of defence against the government’s growing crackdown on human rights, and now the authorities are going after one of the country’s most courageous lawyers. They accused him of disclosing information about cases they are arbitrarily treating as a state secret. This is a travesty of justice. The authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Ivan Pavlov from arbitrary detention.  
“Targeting lawyers who defend victims of politically motivated prosecutions has become a dangerous trend in Russia, especially in the North Caucasus. Rarely has it been done in such a brazen manner, with open FSB involvement, as with Ivan Pavlov. If the international community was waiting for a signal to sound the alarm, then that time has come. Ivan Pavlov and his brave Team 29 have helped countless people. Now they themselves need our solidarity and support.” “Lawyers should never be arrested simply for peacefully exercising their human rights and discharging their professional duties. Russian authorities must end the crackdown on the legal profession, and respect, protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of everyone.”    
Background  
Ivan Pavlov, human rights lawyer and the head of the human rights group Komanda 29 (Team 29), has worked on numerous high-profile cases including that of Ivan Safronov, a former journalist charged with state treason, and is now representing Aleksei Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation in the “extremism” case against it. He was detained in the early hours of 30 April after a raid on the hotel where he was staying in Moscow. He was apprehended by the officers of the Federal Security Service (FSB).  
According to Team 29, Ivan Pavlov is charged with “disclosure of materials of the preliminary investigation” (Article 310 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation). It is not yet known over which case he is being prosecuted. The Russian authorities have arbitrarily classified a lot of cases and closed trials to the public, including the Anti-Corruption Foundation case.  
If found guilty, he could face up to two years of compulsory labour and might be disbarred.

Additional Information 
Chang Weiping is a human rights lawyer in Baoji City, Shaanxi, who is known for his work defending the rights of people facing discrimination based on their health status, sex/gender identity and sexual orientation. Due to his outspokenness and the sensitivity of his work, the Baoji City Judicial Administration Bureau suspended his law license in October 2018. As a result of continued pressure and interference from the authorities, Chang Weiping was unable to obtain employment at other law firms in 2019. Finally, in January 2020, the authorities officially revoked his law license. 
Chang Weiping was taken away by the authorities on 22 October 2020. As he was living alone at the time, no one knew about the arrest until the authorities informed Chang’s wife through a phone call later that evening. The authorities have yet to provide any documentation about the details of Chang’s arrest.   
On 26 October, Chang’s father and lawyers Chang’s family had appointed to represent him went together to Gaoxin District Branch of the Baoji City Public Security Bureau to seek information regarding Chang’s arrest. All their requests – including for legal documentation, access to Chang and an application for bail – were rejected. Since then, Chang’s lawyers submitted multiple applications to visit Chang, all of which were rejected.  
The authorities allowed Chang’s father only once to see him for 10 minutes on 25 November 2020. During the short visit, Chang seemed to be unusually discreet about his condition. He told his family not to speak up about his case and expressed his wish that they would take care of each other. According to his father, it sounded like he was saying farewell to them. His family are very worried that Chang might have once again been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. 
Prior to being formally arrested, Chang Weiping was held under “residential surveillance in a designated location” (RSDL). He had been previously detained for 10 days in January 2020 after attending an informal and private meeting in the city of Xiamen in December 2019 at which human rights activists discussed the situation of civil society and current affairs in China. Ding Jiaxi, another human rights lawyer who also attended the Xiamen meeting, has been detained since 26 December 2019. 
Chang Weiping was taken into custody six days after releasing a video clip on YouTube in which he shared details of how he had been subjected to torture during his detention in January 2020. Chen Weiping said that police tied him to a restraining device known as a “tiger chair” for 24 hours a day and that he was interrogated 16 times. He also reported being subjected to heavy surveillance after his release.

Andrei Borovikov was formerly the coordinator of Aleksei Navalny’s regional headquarters in Arkhangelsk, northwestern Russia. In 2014, he shared the music video for Rammstein’s song Pussy on the Russian social network VKontakte. More than six years later in September 2020, the authorities charged him with “production and distribution of pornography”. The prosecution has requested a three-year sentence in a high security penal colony if Andrei Borovikov is found guilty by the Lomonosovsky District Court.   
“The case against Andrei Borovikov is utterly absurd. It is blatantly obvious that he is being punished solely for his activism, not his musical taste,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director.  
“This is not the first time the Russian authorities have used an overbroad definition of ‘pornography’ as a pretext for locking up their critics. Earlier this month, artist and feminist activist Yulia Tsvetkova stood trial on pornography charges over her drawings of women’s bodies – it is astonishing that cases like this even make it to court.    
“The prosecution of Andrei Borovikov is a mockery of justice, and we call for all charges against him to be dropped. The Russian authorities should be focusing on turning around the spiralling human rights crisis they have created, not devising ludicrous new ways of prosecuting and silencing their critics.”  
The Pussy music video which Andrei Borikov posted in 2014 came to the authorities’ attention six months ago, when a former volunteer at Borikov’s office informed the police. The volunteer had secretly recorded his conversation with Borovikov about the video, during which Borovikov had deleted it.   
Nonetheless, the authorities initiated a criminal investigation, which suggests the volunteer was employed as an agent provocateur to help fabricate the case.  The prosecution said the video had been seen by “not fewer than two people” and went on to order “a sexological and cultural examination” of the clip. The experts found it to be of “pornographic nature” and “not containing artistic value”.   
“The Russian government surely has better things to do than try its hand as a cultural critic. For example, it should be improving its dire record on freedom of expression, guaranteeing fair trial standards, releasing those detained for peacefully protesting, and putting a stop the politically motivated prosecution of activists,” said Natalia Zviagina.  
Background  
Andrei Borovikov, an environmental activist and former coordinator of Aleksei Navalny’s Arkhangelsk regional headquarters, was charged with “production and distribution of pornography” (Article 242(3)(b) of the Russian Criminal Code) in September 2020. Before that, in September 2019, he had been sentenced to 400 hours of compulsory labour after being found guilty of “repeated violation of the established procedure of organizing or holding public events” (Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code) for holding peaceful protests against a local landfill project.

“This is a new and extremely disturbing turn of events. Never before have the police been able to cast their net so widely to identify and target peaceful protesters using facial recognition technology. The police detained not only those who had joined the protests but also at least three journalists who were simply reporting on the rally.  
“Previously the protesters’ main risk was being beaten and arbitrarily detained by police at a rally. As of now, avoiding this fate does not mean that you can feel safe – the repressive state knows who you are and can come for you at any point. The risk of attempting to exercise your right to freedom of peaceful assembly has never been so high in Russia.  
“We reiterate our call to ban the development and use of facial recognition technologies for identification purposes. The authorities’ persecution of peaceful protest is now reaching a whole new level in Russia.”  
Background  
Over the last few days, the Moscow police visited the homes of dozens of peaceful activists who attended the rally in solidarity with Aleksei Navalny on 21 April. Some of the people were detained immediately, others were summoned to police stations to have their “unlawful” participation in peaceful rallies documented ahead of a court hearing on these “offences”.  
On the morning of 27 April, the police came to the homes of Aleksei Korostelyov, a reporter for TV Dozhd, an independent news channel, Oleg Ovcharenko, a correspondent for the Ekho Moskvy radio station, and Aleksandr Rogoz, working with Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.   
All men were questioned about “participation” in the protest rally, even though their journalist credentials had been confirmed and their respective employers stated that their journalists were covering the demonstration “in accordance with the editorial assignment.” Participants in “illegal” protests may face up to 30 days in jail or heavy fines, or face criminal prosecution and prison, depending on specific charges and a record of similar previous “offences”.

I graduated from York University in 2019 with an Honors Degree in Political Science and a General Certificate in Law and Social Thought. It was in high school that I discovered my love for human rights and politics from the perspective of change and grassroots activism. I found my passion through one particular class: “Challenge and Change”, a class focused on preparing students for what comes next after high school and encouraging students to volunteer within their communities and learning networking skills. At that time I was unaware of the AI Canada’s National Organizers Program, however I think that had happened for a reason as I was able to reach out to that same class some five years later and do a Zoom presentation for the grade 11/12 class for Amnesty International’s biggest human rights initiative: the annual Write For Rights event.  
My involvement with Amnesty International began with me as an observer, unaware that through my actions, I could be making a huge impact. My eyes being opened to human rights attrocities really started in 2015, when I wrote to the government of Canada calling for more awareness around genocide. At that time I could say I was young and bright eyed, thinking that a few simply worded letters crafted by an eager high schooler excited at the prospects of university, would immediately change the world. This is not to say that I have any regrets or embarrassment towards that time, however it did shape me for the experiences in university and in learning that human rights issues are not as black and white as one might perceive them to be.  
It was the announcement of Covid-19 being a pandemic and feeling trapped, along with being unemployed, that led me to think that there had to be something that I could do, even if it were on a volunteer basis, to give me some experience in the human rights field. Thus began my journey as a Volunteer National Organizer with Amnesty International. I am still what I consider to be a novice in that role and a novice with regards to human rights activism, however that does not stop me in my drive to leave my mark in the human rights field and in being a catalyst for change.  
My very first project with Amnesty International was one that legitimately brought tears to my eyes, because I was so surprised and amazed at the potential young people have with the proper guidance and encouragement. Five years after I had taken the “Challenge and Change” class myself and been challenged to make a difference in my future path I was lucky enough to be able to do a Zoom presentation to the same Challenge and Change class, except with a whole new generation of kids, with a new wealth of information in front of them, thus facilitating their activism if they so choose. To be honest at first I did not think I was going to get any responses, or that they were even listening to me as it was the last day before Christmas break. I thought that they would send just a few letters and do the assignment as they would with any run of the mill high school assignment. What I did not expect was the emails I received saying that I inspired them to look into human rights issues.  
My ultimate career goal is to work in the Immigration and Refugees sector, to focus on grassroots activism and help individuals and families find better lives. I have an opportunity as an Amnesty volunteer to help individuals whose human rights are violated, and learn about the multifaceted ways in which human rights, activism and even politics are connected, so a positive experience would be an understatement in regards to my sentiments.  
The fact that I get to learn myself and to educate the future generation which I will be accompanying for part of their journey is both eye opening and inspiring, and it will drive me to continue to leave a positive mark as I go along, especially when I receive from other young people responses such as: “Thank you so much for presenting the work that you do with Amnesty International to our class! I found it very empowering and decided to take part in it myself and send emails regarding the wrongful arrest of Gemain Rukuki. I really do believe that Write for Rights will make a difference and I look forward to future movements with Amnesty International.” – Liam  
I cannot wait to see what the future holds for me in Amnesty International, and as long as I get to continue to learn myself and create a lasting impact on the youth of my generation, or even future generations I am all in and always ready to continue fighting for Human Rights!

Additional Information 
Against the backdrop of contested country-of-origin reports on the situation in Syria, the Danish Immigration Service and the Danish Refugee Appeals Board consider Damascus – and from February 2021 also the rural Damascus region – “safe” for returns. 
By April 2021, at least 39 Syrians who fled the armed conflict in Syria have received a final decision on their case and have been put in a so-called ‘return position’ in Denmark – meaning that they are at risk of being deported if Denmark re-establishes diplomatic ties with the Syrian regime. 30 days after the denial of asylum, revocation or non-renewal of their residence permits, Syrian refugees will be placed in return centers where they are unable to work or study. Denmark does not have any diplomatic ties with the Syrian regime and cannot carry out deportations. According to the Danish Aliens Act, the Danish authorities could use “motivation-inducing” measures – including detention – to “motivate” foreign nationals without regular migration status to “voluntarily” return. 
Amnesty International is deeply concerned that Syrians without residence permits will face serious restrictions, possibly including detention, to “incentivize” their “voluntary” return to Syria. As people are placed in return centres without access to work or education, the conditions imposed by the Danish government leave them with little alternative and might pressure them to return. Amnesty International believes that stripping individuals of their regular migration status, job and education, imposes on them conditions that pressure them to return to Syria. This is a violation of the international law obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibits states from transferring people, directly or indirectly, to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations. 
Danish Immigration authorities are using the current absence of hostilities in Damascus and the Rif-region as a justification to either revoke or refuse to renew residency permits. According to Amnesty International’s documentation, residents from Damascus and the Rif-region would still face a real risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations upon return – regardless of the absence of conduct of hostilities – and are therefore still in need of international protection. 
Amnesty International is currently conducting research on violations against Syrian refugees who have returned to Syrian government-controlled areas, including to Damascus. Our research to date shows that civilians returning to their place of origin in government-controlled areas are requested to go through a “security clearance” involving interrogation by Syrian security forces. Amnesty International considers these forces to be responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses constituting crimes against humanity, including the use of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances. 
In 2019 the Danish government introduced a so-called “paradigm-shift” in its immigration and refugee policies. The focus changed from supporting integration to emphasizing the hoped-for short duration of protection and using all measures to effect return at the earliest opportunity. Part of the shift was to grant temporary residency permits to refugees in need of protection instead of the permanent status previously granted. In December 2019 the Danish Refugee Appeals Board ruled to deny asylum to three Syrian nationals from Damascus, stating that the individuals were not at risk of persecution due to the “general conditions” in the area.[1] The Board partly based its decision on a report from the Danish Immigration Services of 21 February 2019, according to which Syrians from Damascus were not at risk from ‘general violence in Damascus’.[2] Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Immigration and Integration decided in June 2020 to accelerate the review of residency permits of around 900 refugees from Damascus that had been given temporary protection status due to the general violence in Syria.[3] Since February 2021 this decision has now been extended to also include people from Rif-Damascus.

Article 28 paragraph (2) Law No. 19 of 2016 on the Amendment to Law No. 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions jo. Article 55 paragraph (1) of the Criminal Code. 
Court proceedings have been incredibly slow, with Soon having been detained for 332 days. Soon’s lawyers have only been able to see him after lodging multiple complaints. All legal meetings have with a strict time limit and have been closely monitored. 
The prosecutors read their indictment on Thursday, 15 April 2021, with demands for his imprisonment of 1 year 6 months, a fine of IDR 1 billion, a subsidiary of 6 months imprisonment. On 23 April 2021, the Timika District court sentenced him to 6 months imprisonment and a fine of IDR 1 billion. 
The poor conditions of the detention facilities, namely bad air circulation and poor water quality, has had a negative impact on Soon’s physical and mental wellbeing. His family are only able to visit him once a week, raising fears for his deteriorating health. Responding to why Soon was being held at the Mobile Brigade Command prison, which is not standard procedure, officers stated that it was due to “orders from superiors”.   
The President of the Republic of Indonesia has expressed his concern on the ITE law as it may not be consistent with the public sense of justice. The President has ordered the Chief of Police and all Police personnel to be more selective in responding to and accepting reports that use the ITE Law as a legal reference[1]. 
The Indonesian authorities have used the ITE Law to prosecute hundreds of peaceful activists, media officers and human right defenders who criticize the government. The ITE Law, contains vague language which has been misused by the government to criminalize the rights to freedom of expression, thought, conscience and religion in Indonesia. The criminal defamation and “incitement” provisions under ITE Law have been used to criminalize freedom of expression. These include Article 27(3), which criminalizes “the conduct of anyone who intentionally and without right distributes and/or transmits and/or makes accessible electronic information and/or electronic documents that contains insults and/or defamation”. Article 28(2) of the ITE Law also criminalizes “the dissemination of information that incites hate or enmity among certain individuals and/or groups based on ethnicity, religion, race or intergroup relation”.

He was subjected to serious human rights violations including enforced disappearance, torture, and unfair trial. Wael Tawadros was convicted in April 2019 of killing a Bishop and sentenced to death following a grossly unfair trial. The court relied on torture-tainted “confessions,” even though he retracted them in court. The sentence was upheld on appeal in July 2020. The number of executions more than tripled in Egypt in 2020, compared to the previous year, raising fears that more prisoners on death row are at risk of execution.

Additional Information 
Wael Tawadros was arrested in connection with the killing of a Bishop, which took place on 29 July 2018 at the Monastery of St. Macarius in Wadi al-Natrun, Behira governorate, northwest of Cairo. According to the case file, examined by Amnesty International, authorities claimed that he was arrested on 10 August 2018, at a checkpoint in Behira governorate. However, according to informed sources, police forces arrested him on 5 August 2018 from the Monastery of St. Macarius. The police then took him to an undisclosed location and forcibly disappeared him until 10 August 2018. On 10 August 2018, he was brought in front of a prosecutor and questioned without a lawyer. According to the case file, on 5 August 2018 the prosecution ordered that Wael Tawadros be barred from communicating with anyone during the investigations. The authorities did not allow his family or lawyer to contact him until 28 August 2018. A lawyer, initially secured to represent Wael Tawadros, testified during the trial that he was compelled to withdraw from the case after being barred from communicating with his client. 
According to individuals who attended the trial at the Damanhour Criminal Court and written complaints submitted by his lawyers, the judge exhibited bias against Wael Tawadros, including by addressing him in a derogatory manner and mocking his monastic name and answers. Lawyers also claimed that the judge refused to consider exculpatory evidence and record defence arguments and the name of the police officer the defendant accused of torturing him in the minutes of the hearing. The police officer testified as a prosecution witness. The judge also failed to order investigations into Wael Tawadros’ claims of torture, despite his and his lawyers’ repeated requests. There were no witnesses to the crime; and no CCTV footage or other material evidence was presented in court. Forensic experts who examined the body also gave contradictory statements. Wael Tawadros added in his testimony in court that after he had been taken to a hospital for a medical examination based on the order of the judge reviewing his bail hearing, the police officer ordered a medical worker to write that he was “fine”. 
Despite these fragrant violations and absence of credible evidence, on 24 April 2019, the Damanhour Criminal Court convicted Wael Tawadros and another defendant of killing Anba Epiphanius and sentenced both men to death, relying almost exclusively on his torture-tainted “confessions”. On 1 July 2020, the Court of Cassation upheld the verdict against Wael Tawadros, despite acknowledging the violation of his right to defence counsel and without investigating his claims of torture. The court upheld the conviction against his co-defendant but reduced his sentence to life imprisonment. Following amendments to the Egyptian Code of Criminal Procedures in 2017, the Court of Cassation, which previously had the authority to quash verdicts and order retrials by criminal courts when it found errors in the application of the law at first instance, now itself looks into matters of law and substance and issues final verdicts . Rights defenders and legal experts opposed these amendments on the grounds that they undermine defendants’ rights to a genuine review by limiting stages of appeal. Their concerns were heightened by other amendments introduced in 2017 undermining the independence of the judiciary by granting the President the authority to select heads of judicial bodies, including the Court of Cassation. In October 2020, five UN special procedures raised concerns over allegations of torture and the use of forced “confessions” to sentence Wael Tawadros to death and called for a halt to plans to execute him. They also raised concerns over the denial of his right to freedom of religion. 
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities executed at least 107 individuals, marking a sharp rise in the number of recorded executions in the country from previous years. This shocking death toll is likely to be an underestimate, as Egyptian authorities do not publish statistics on executions or the number of prisoners on death row; nor do they inform families or lawyers in advance of executions. Egyptian authorities have also clamped down on human rights organizations working on the death penalty. While Egypt, like other governments, has a duty to bring to justice those responsible for violent criminal acts, this must be done in full compliance with Egypt’s human rights obligations including rights to a fair trial. Amnesty International has consistently documented a pattern of violations of the right to fair trial in Egypt, including the right to adequate defence; to be brought promptly before a judge; to challenge the lawfulness of detention; to be presumed innocent; to remain silent and not to be compelled to incriminate oneself or to confess guilt; to obtain full access to relevant evidence; to receive a fair, public hearing before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal; and to a genuine review. Torture is rampant in Egypt, and frequently used to extract “confessions”, while courts regularly fail to order investigations into allegations of torture and admit torture-tainted “confessions” as evidence.

At least 380 refugees, including children, have been informed by the Danish Immigration Service that they will have to return to Syria after Denmark deemed Damascus and its surrounding area safe for return. Their temporary protection status, and therefore residence permits, have been revoked. Many of them are still waiting for their case to be finally decided in appeal. 
Amnesty International understands that 39 people have received a final decision on their case and are at risk of being deported as soon as Denmark re-establishes diplomatic ties with the Syrian regime. 
“Having escaped a warzone, at least 39 refugees who have had their final decision, are now facing the stark prospect of ‘voluntarily’ returning to Syria or being taken to return centres to await deportation. The destiny of hundreds more is still unknown,” said Amnesty International’s Europe Director, Nils Muižnieks. 
“It beggars belief that Danish authorities could deem certain parts of Syria – a country where people are routinely detained, disappeared and tortured – safe for return.” 
Between 1 January 2020 and 1 April 2021, Denmark stripped at least 380 Syrian refugees of their residency permits or did not renew their residency permit at the Danish Immigration Service. They were asked to return to so called “safe zones” in Syria. 
Deportations are not happening at the moment due to lack of diplomatic ties. Those affected are supposed to stay in the return centres until deportations resume – or until they decide to return to Syria “voluntarily”. 
Research by Amnesty International has found that civilians who have returned to Syrian government-controlled areas, including to Damascus, are requested to go through a “security clearance”. This involves interrogation by Syrian security forces. Amnesty International considers these forces to be responsible for widespread and systematic human rights violations and abuses constituting crimes against humanity, including the use of torture, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances.  
“Placing refugees in return centres indefinitely, without access to work or education, puts pressure on them to return. Forcing them back to Syria, even indirectly, would put them at real risk of torture and other serious abuses and would constitute a violation of international law,” said Nils Muižnieks. 
“Danish authorities must reverse this unconscionable decision to revoke temporary protection status for Syrians and end the targeting of these refugees who have already been forced to flee their homes and families.”

Today Amnesty International launched a global Urgent Action on this situation – https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur18/4010/2021/en/ 
BACKGROUND 
The Danish conclusion that Syria is safe for returns goes against the assessments of international experts on Syria and the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. 
People in return centres in Denmark are not permitted to work or pursue their education. Due to their irregular migration status, they are also ineligible for government benefits. 
Last year, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she aimed to reduce asylum applications to zero. The country decided to reassess the temporary permits of around 900 refugees last year and with the latest Damascus decision, the number stripped of residency has risen to 380 refugees.

Environment defenders in Latin America risk their very lives to respond to this challenge with hope and enormous courage. Indeed, Latin America is the most dangerous region in the world to defend human rights and the environment. 
Most at risk are Indigenous, black and rural campesino defenders, especially when they confront people intent on taking control of their land to exploit its economic potential or the natural resources found there, no matter the cost. Women environment defenders face the added risk of sexual violence against them or their children because their outspoken efforts challenge traditional gender roles as well as economic interests. 
Amnesty International Canada is responding to appeals for solidarity from environment defenders in Latin America who know their governments often pay more attention to their international image than the voices of their citizens. 
We invite you to support these campaigns, which are built on the rightful demands of the defenders themselves. Scroll down this page for different actions you can take – and important updates about the value of our advocacy.

In the past 5 years since the murder of Lenca leader and river defender Berta Caceres, we have mobilized more than 65,000 messages to Honduran authorities by Amnesty Canada supporters echoing calls for justice by Berta’s inspiring daughters, Bertha Isabel and Laura Zúniga (pictured above) and their organization COPINH.  They have courageously called for everyone behind the crime to be prosecuted, not only the contract killers who are now in jail, in order to end the impunity that continues to fuel vicious persecution of environment defenders. 
At the beginning of April, there was a huge step forward when David Castillo was put on trial. The former military intelligence officer and general manager of DESA, the company building the dam project that Berta had relentlessly challenged on behalf of affected Lenca communities, is accused of being an ‘intellectual author’ of the murder of Berta. Her family has presented evidence alleging that Castillo was the link between the men hired to carry out the killing and a powerful family they believe paid for the crime.  
It is vital that we continue to signal to Honduran authorities that the eyes of the world are watching and expect nothing less than the full truth and justice for everyone responsible!

Our activism in support of persecuted forest and water defenders in the Raramuri Indigenous community of Coloradas de la Virgen has helped to achieve a significant step forward. 
More than 10,000 supporters of Amnesty Canada sent messages to state and federal authorities, denouncing the murder of Julian Carrillo and urging action to bring the killers to justice. As in other countries where environment defenders are under attack, a pattern of impunity in Mexico has served as a green light for yet more violence aimed at paralysing the efforts of communities defending the environment on which their rights depend.  
In March, amidst heightened attention we helped to create, a court in Chihuahua State issued a landmark ruling that not only convicted a second person for the the murder of Julian Carrillo, but underscored the systemic nature of threats against Indigenous communities defending their rights. The judges also underscored the responsibility of Mexican authorities for failing to take action to protect Julian Carrillo from clear and present danger.  
Amnesty Canada met with Canada’s Ambassador in Mexico ahead of the trial to request that Canada speak out. At the online meeting, we ensured that Embassy staff heard directly from the courageous defenders of Alianza Sierra Madre in Chihuahua, who are at risk because of their work with Julian Carrillo and his community to protect Indigenous rights and the environment. 
We were heartened that Ambassador Clark acted on our recommendation that the Embassy use both its diplomatic and its social media channels to publicly communicate concern for the protection of witnesses from Julian’s community as well as the safety of the defenders of Alianza Sierra Madre. 
The situation remains a dangerous one for Indigenous communities in Mexico expressing opposition to resource extraction, including projects of Canadian mining companies, that violate their right to a healthy environment. Stay tuned for future opportunities to support the advocacy of our Indigenous partners.

“The audacity and scale of this cynical attack are unprecedented, effectively suppressing the rights to freedom of expression and association of thousands. If and when the decision is taken to outlaw the targeted organizations, Navalny’s supporters, who are effectively the largest political opposition group in the country, could face criminal prosecution for any legitimate political activism or human rights work.  
“Dozens of employees of Navalny’s headquarters working across 34 Russian regions and hundreds of thousands of Internet users who have shared Navalny’s groups’ materials on social networks, are potential targets for severe reprisals.   
“The objective is clear:  to raze Aleksei Navalny’s movement to the ground while he languishes in prison. It is symbolic and particularly telling of the Russian authorities’ cowardice that the court proceedings have been pronounced ‘secret’ and will be closed to the public without sufficient safeguards of fairness.”  
Background  
On 26 April, the Moscow City Prosecutor’s Office ruled to suspend the activities of the regional headquarters of Aleksei Navalny until the Moscow City Court rules on their request to ban three organizations linked to Aleksei Navalny as “extremist” – the Anti-Corruption Foundation (known as FBK in Russian), the Citizens’ Rights Protection Foundation and “Navalny’s headquarters”. According to the Prosecutor’s press office, these organizations are “engaged in creating conditions for destabilizing the social and the socio-political situation under the guise of liberal slogans”. The court decided to hold the hearing behind closed doors due to case files allegedly containing “state secrets”.  
In the absence of judicial independence, and deep politicization of the Russian justice system by the executive, there is little if any hope that the court will conduct the hearing in accordance with international standards or refuse to grant the Prosecutor’s Office’s request. According to Russian legislation, if the relevant ruling is adopted, all activities of these groups will be prohibited and their assets confiscated. 
Membership of “extremist” organizations is punishable by up to 12 years’ imprisonment. Financing such organizations may lead to up to 10 years in jail, and public use of their symbols and logos risks a year-long ban on running for elected office. The Anti-Corruption Foundation has been uniquely successful in Russia in its crowdfunding, having secured tens of thousands of donors. All these people may be at risk of prosecution, and there have been cases in Russia when criminal sanctions, including prison sentences, have been applied retroactively – for financial contributions made prior to a group being designated “extremist”.

Additional Information 
In Nigeria, the right to freedom of expression has come under attack. The younger generation of Nigerians have activated the power of peaceful protests in demanding justice for police brutality, extortion and extra-judicial executions while authorities continue to respond with violence. Civil rights activists, human rights defenders, and civil society are now left with few alternatives channels of expression to demand accountability from the government. Those who attempt to exercise their right to freely protest on the street face arrest, detention, torture and trumped-up charges. 
The past few months have witnessed a crackdown on peaceful protesters across the country under the #EndSARS movement. In October 2020, at least 12 people were killed, and several others injured at Lekki toll gate and Alausa when security forces opened fire on the EndSARS protesters. Instead of bringing suspected perpetrators to justice and prioritizing genuine police reforms, the Nigerian authorities have been abusing their powers by subjecting those who supported the protests to intimidation, harassment and smear campaigns. The right to peaceful protest is guaranteed under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended), and human rights treaties to which Nigeria is a state party including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights.

Mixed Media: Stephanie Nolen, Félix Márquez,...","OTTAWA – Amnesty International is thrilled to announce the winners of the 26th annual Amnesty International Media Awards in Canada. These awards recognize outstanding human rights reporting by journalists in Canada and Canadian journalists abroad. 
The Globe and Mail’s Gone project is a deep exploration of those disappeared in Mexico, as told by the people they left behind. A large team put together this impressive story, with reporting by Stephanie Nolen and Félix Márquez and digital storytelling by Laura Blenkinsop, Jeremy Agius and Timothy Moore. 
“The use of multi-media was so intentional and impactful — short videos of family members of those disappeared speaking in their own language, for instance, put people first in the story, following many heartbreaking stories of how they found out their loved ones were not just missing, but dead and buried in a clandestine gravesite,” said Sadiya Ansari, an Amnesty International Media Awards judge and co-founder of Canadian Journalists of Colour. 
Broadview Magazine’s Putting Down Roots – filmed and edited by Rudy Gauer and produced by Emma Prestwich – depicts Operation Ezra, a multi-faith sponsorship initiative that provides Yazidi refugees the opportunity to farm on donated land in Manitoba. 
Judges Sadiya Ansari, Shree Paradkar and Olivia Ward wrote that the video was a “human and beautifully humane piece that scores high in all categories. It makes the most of its short format to show how one multi faith project, named Ezra, applied the proverb ‘give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.’” 
Martin Himel’s The Arrest, broadcast on TVO, unpacks the permanent damage that is done by the arrest and judicial process when vulnerable citizens, because of their race or social status, are wrongly charged. The stories are linked by the dedicated efforts of Toronto lawyer Davin Charney, who was drawn to the work by his own experience. The documentary follows Charney in his meetings representing the wrongly charged, shows him demanding justice and winning compensation. 
“It is a noble effort that is given special meaning by the skilled, powerful presentation of the stories in this very well produced documentary,” wrote John Tackaberry, a judge and Amnesty International Canada’s former media relations officer. 
CBC Radio’s Ideas tells the story of Turkish journalist Ahmet Altan, who is among thousands of journalists, writers, academics and other political prisoners imprisoned under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s regime. Featuring interviews with Altan’s loved ones and lawyer, and words directly from his memoir, producer Mary Lynk helps paint a picture of one journalist who has found a way of rising above his imprisonment. 
“The story and writing of Ahmet Altan makes the point that imprisoning people’s bodies can’t crush their resistance, their thoughts and their spirit. And the combination of philosophical, literary and human rights issues was masterfully done,” wrote Media Awards judges Karyn Pugliese, Olivia Ward and John Tackaberry. 
For the Toronto Star, reporter Sara Mojtehedzadeh documents the plight of Amazon warehouse workers who are treated as disposable. At Amazon warehouses in Canada, workers endure injuries, illness and violations of their rights daily amid terrible working conditions. 
“This is a story of ‘crushing workers and cutting bonuses’ during a deadly pandemic in which immigrants and racialized people are especially vulnerable. Mojtehedzadeh has blazed a trail in Canadian labour justice reporting — an area that has been badly neglected since labour beats were superseded in the media in favour of ‘business news,’” wrote Amnesty Media Awards judges Olivia Ward, Parsa Mahmud and Sadiya Ansari. 
Reporter Valérie Ouellet and producer Joseph Loiero investigate the toll of COVID-19 on prison populations in Canada, demonstrating how provincial and federal governments failed to take measures that could have protected vulnerable inmates. 
“It accomplished what good journalism strives for: giving a voice to the vulnerable, truth-seeking, and ultimately holding those in power accountable for their (in)action,” said Karyn Pugliese, a Media Awards judge and journalism professor at Ryerson University. 
In her editorial for Excalibur, a student-run newspaper at York University, Sakeina Syed calls into question the hypocrisy of the Canadian government when it comes to religious versus safety-designed face coverings. 
“Using razor-sharp logic and compelling storytelling, Syed effectively makes her case that face coverings do not impede the safety of citizens and that there is no reason – other than blatant racism – that Muslims in Quebec have been denied the right to wear them for so long,” wrote Samantha Fink, a former Amnesty International Media Award winner and current judge. 
Lastly, Amnesty International is elated to announce the winner of the first-ever Secondary Youth Award. Sophia Rottman’s story for Tigertalk, Harbord Collegiate Institute’s student newspaper, highlights the moral dilemma surrounding attendance at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, where human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims have been rampant. 
“The article dealt with a problem that is all too common today: whether – and how – we can separate our experiences from the actions of those who design them. This story opens its readers’ minds, allowing us to look at how sports are about more than entertainment: they are an opportunity for unity, teamwork, and action,” said Media Awards judge Samantha Fink. 
The winners will be honoured during a virtual ceremony on May 27 at 7:30 p.m. on Zoom and the Amnesty International Canada Facebook page. Amnesty International is also pleased to announce that Nahlah Ayed, an award-winning journalist and host of CBC Radio’s Ideas, will host this year’s event. 
Amnesty International would like to recognize and honour the judges* who put a tremendous amount of time and effort into reviewing this year’s Media Awards submissions. We could not have done it without them. They are:

Last year, as part of Amnesty’s global campaign Write for Rights, the planet’s largest human rights event, more than 415,363 people from dozens of countries around the world took action calling for the protection of Jani Silva, who is at risk of being killed for defending the Amazon and the rights of more than 1,200 people living in the Perla Amazonian Farming Reserve Area in Putumayo. 
In the new campaign launched today, Amnesty International used an algorithm to condense the hundreds of letters of solidarity sent to Jani Silva into a single letter that symbolizes global solidarity and demands that Colombian authorities take strong and effective measures to protect her life and guarantee her safety. In a video released today, 14 public figures, including artists, singers and comedians from seven countries, read aloud the letter to Jani Silva. 
“From the bottom of my heart I can say that this campaign is what has kept me alive, because I’ve been very close to death but it’s never happened. In spite of everything, today we are alive and that’s what counts,” said Jani Silva. “Because I defend my territory, people have held a gun to my head [and threatened] to kill me. But I’m staying in my territory, we can’t run away or let fear defeat us. We have to keep fighting as when there are threats against our territory, it’s not just us that’s under threat but the whole world, because we have to protect the earth that gives us life.” 
Jani Silva has dedicated her life to protecting the Amazon and the life that exists in it from efforts by armed groups and multinational companies to take control of her territory. She has led reforestation programs and advocated for the implementation of the Peace Agreement signed in 2016 between the FARC-EP and the Colombian government. 
She has suffered death threats in retaliation for her work, but the Colombian authorities have not developed a comprehensive and efficient plan to guarantee her safety. Since January 2020, state protection has proven insufficient to prevent seven security incidents that Jani Silva has experienced, including persecution by unknown persons, illegal digital surveillance by the Colombian Army, death threats, multiple gunshots within meters of her home, and the uncovering of a plan to assassinate her.

Additional Information 
The new Administrative Regulation No. 001-2021 for the “Unified Registry of Obligated Subjects before the National Office Against Organized Crime and Terrorism Financing, of the Ministry of Interior, Justice, and Peace”, was published in Official Gazette No. 42.098 of 30 March 2021. It requires the registration of all natural or legal persons of a nonfinancial nature before 1 May 2021, emphasizing the participation of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for the surveillance and supervision of their work. The regulation would impose strict controls that include handing over constitutive documentation, assembly notes, lists of members and personnel, lists of donors, registration of financial movements, and lists of all their beneficiaries and other organizations with which they work. The regulation operates under the presumption of committing crimes such as terrorism or that NGOs are vulnerable to these crimes because they are not subject to the supervision of a specific public body or regulated by a special law. 
This measure is part of the systematic criminalization patterns against civil society organizations, which has intensified during the last year. Without a doubt, this ruling represents the most serious event that we have registered so far, including the explicit purpose of closing civic space through a siege of severe restrictions on civil society’s ability to continue defending rights and providing due assistance and protection to the Venezuelan population. 
Amnesty International and other 662 organizations have called for the regulation to be repealed, bearing in mind that in the last few years any constitutional avenue to pursue its annulment within local courts is futile, due to the lack of judicial independence and the tight control the executive branch has over the judiciary. 
Nicolás Maduro government has continually harassed, prosecuted and censored activists and civil society organizations working to protect the rights of Venezuelans amidst a humanitarian complex crisis and a deep human rights crisis that is making Venezuelans fled in unprecedented numbers in search of safety and a dignified future abroad. By December 2020, over 6 million had fled the country. 
Last year, a report from the independent international fact-finding mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela documented hundreds of cases of extrajudicial executions; enforced disappearances; arbitrary detentions; and torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment committed in the country since 2014, and concluded that these grave human rights violations may amount to crimes against humanity.

Many Uyghur parents overseas have had to leave one or more children in the care of family members in Xinjiang. Some parents have since learned their children were taken to state-run “orphan camps” or boarding schools after the relatives taking care of them had been detained. 
The mass detention campaign in Xinjiang has prevented Uyghur parents from returning to China to take care of their children themselves. It has also made it nearly impossible for them to bring children whose passports have been denied or confiscated out of China to be reunited with them.

Everyone in the world should have access to a COVID-19 vaccine, no matter who they are or where they are from. But the leading pharmaceutical companies won’t deliver enough vaccines for even a fraction of the world’s population this year. On top of this, lower income countries are at the back of the line. 
Billions of dollars of taxpayer’s money have been spent to help companies like AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech to develop and produce vaccines. These vaccines belong to the people and must be shared.  
One way that companies can do this is by joining the World Health Organisation’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), designed to pool resources between companies. So far, no company has joined it.

While there was an overall trend of decline, some countries pursued or even increased the number of executions carried out, indicating a chilling disregard for human life at a time when the world’s attention focused on protecting people from a deadly virus. 
2020 executioners included Egypt, which tripled its yearly execution figure compared to the previous year; and China, which announced a crackdown on criminal acts affecting Covid-19 prevention efforts, resulting in at least one man being sentenced to death and executed. Meanwhile the Trump administration resumed federal executions after a 17-year hiatus and put a staggering 10 men to death in less than six months. India, Oman, Qatar and Taiwan also resumed executions. 
“As the world focused on finding ways to protect lives from Covid-19, several governments showed a disturbing determination to resort to the death penalty and execute people no matter what,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“The death penalty is an abhorrent punishment and pursuing executions in the middle of a pandemic further highlights its inherent cruelty. Fighting against an execution is hard at the best of times, but the pandemic meant that many people on death row were unable to access in-person legal representation, and many of those wanting to provide support had to expose themselves to considerable – yet absolutely avoidable – health risks. The use of the death penalty under these conditions is a particularly egregious assault on human rights.” 
Covid-19 restrictions had concerning implications for access to legal counsel and the right to a fair trial in several countries, including the USA, where defence lawyers said they were unable to carry out crucial investigative work or meet clients face-to-face.   
Top five executing countries  
China classifies the total number of its executions and death sentences as a state secret and prevents independent scrutiny. Therefore, Amnesty International’s figures for all known executions do not include executions in China. However, China is believed to execute thousands each year, making it once again the world’s most prolific executioner ahead of Iran (246+), Egypt (107+), Iraq (45+) and Saudi Arabia (27). Iran, Egypt, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia accounted for 88% of all known executions in 2020. 
Egypt tripled the number of yearly executions and became the world’s third most frequent executioner in 2020. At least 23 of those executed were sentenced to death in cases relating to political violence, after grossly unfair trials marred by forced “confessions” and other serious human rights violations including torture and enforced disappearances. A spike in executions occurred in October and November, when Egyptian authorities executed at least 57 people – 53 men and four women. 
Although recorded executions in Iran continued to be lower than previous years, the country increasingly used the death penalty as a weapon of political repression against dissidents, protesters and members of ethnic minority groups, in violation of international law. 
Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region continued to violate international law and standards which prohibit the use of the death penalty for crimes that do not involve intentional killing. Yet, the death penalty was handed down for drug offences in China, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam; for corruption in China and Viet Nam; and for blasphemy in Pakistan. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, death sentences were imposed by courts established through special legislation and which usually follow different procedures from ordinary courts. In the Maldives, five people who were below 18 years of age at the time of the crime remained under sentence of death. 
The USA was the only country in the Americas to carry out executions in 2020. In July, the Trump administration carried out the first federal execution in 17 years, and five states put seven people to death between them. 
Executions reach lowest number in a decade 
Globally, at least 483 people were known to have been executed in 2020 (excluding countries which classify death penalty data as state secrets, or for which limited information is available – China, North Korea, Syria and Viet Nam). Shocking as this figure is, it is the lowest number of executions recorded by Amnesty International in at least a decade. It represents a decrease of 26% compared to 2019, and 70% from the high-peak of 1,634 executions in 2015. 
According to the report, the fall in executions was down to a reduction in executions in some retentionist countries and, to a lesser extent, some hiatuses in executions that occurred in response to the pandemic. 
Recorded executions in Saudi Arabia dropped by 85%, from 184 in 2019 to 27 in 2020, and more than halved in Iraq, from 100 in 2019 to 45 in 2020. No executions were recorded in Bahrain, Belarus, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore and Sudan – countries that carried out executions in 2019. 
The number of death sentences known to have been imposed worldwide (at least 1,477) was also down by 36% compared to 2019. Amnesty International recorded decreases in 30 out of 54 countries where death sentences were known to have been imposed. These appeared to be linked in several cases to delays and deferrals in judicial proceedings, put in place in response to the pandemic. 
Notable exceptions were Indonesia, whose 2020 recorded death sentences (117) increased by 46% compared to 2019 (80); and Zambia, which imposed 119 death sentences in 2020, 18 more than in 2019 and the highest recorded in sub-Saharan Africa. 
Time to abolish the death penalty 
In 2020, Chad and the US state of Colorado abolished the death penalty, Kazakhstan committed to abolition under international law and Barbados concluded reforms to repeal the mandatory death penalty. 
As of April 2021, 108 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and 144 countries have abolished it in law or practice – a trend that must continue. 
“Despite the continued pursuit of the death penalty by some governments, the overall picture in 2020 was positive. Chad abolished the death penalty, along with the US state of Colorado, and the number of known executions continued to drop – bringing the world closer to consigning the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment to the history books,” said Agnès Callamard.                                                 
“With 123 states – more than ever before – supporting the UN General Assembly call for a moratorium on executions, pressure is growing on outliers to follow suit. Virginia recently became the first US Southern state to repeal the death penalty, while several bills to abolish it at US federal level are pending before Congress. As the journey towards global abolition of the death penalty continues, we call on the US Congress to support legislative efforts to abolish the death penalty. 
“We urge leaders in all countries that have not yet repealed this punishment to make 2021 the year that they end state-sanctioned killings for good. We will continue to campaign until the death penalty is abolished everywhere, once and for all.”

“Today a jury held Derek Chauvin accountable for actions emblematic of a broken policing system. No one should expect an encounter with law enforcement to end in death. And yet for George Floyd — and far too many others — that’s exactly what happened. Officers using excessive force, whatever the result, must be brought to justice. That’s what happened in the Minneapolis courtroom today,” said Paul O’Brien, Executive Director of AIUSA.  
“In addition to our human rights to equal protection of law, security, and life, we have a right to be free from discrimination when interacting with law enforcement. This outcome is not enough, because George Floyd’s tragic death made all too clear the systemic failures of policing in the U.S. and that Black and brown communities bear the brunt of police violence. The truth is that Derek Chauvin being held accountable for killing George Floyd is the exception — not the rule.”  
“Of course, true justice for George Floyd would require him to still be alive. We saw former Officer Chauvin apply deadly force callously even after George Floyd was killed, ignoring pleas for him to stop.  We can no longer tolerate the lack of accountability when it comes to the killing of Black and brown people,” said Kristina Roth, Senior Advocate for Criminal Justice Programs at AIUSA. “Not only did Derek Chauvin deny George Floyd his human rights, he also showed utter disregard for George Floyd’s humanity.” 
“We must acknowledge the racist roots of law enforcement in this country if we are to address the systemic failures of policing and bring about meaningful public safety for those that have been historically overpoliced. This must include shrinking the size and scope of law enforcement in daily life, eliminating qualified immunity that creates a barrier to redress for victims of unlawful policing, demilitarizing law enforcement, and enacting strict limits on the use of force altogether.”

The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls finished its work a year and a half ago, and the issue has largely faded from news headlines during the pandemic. But this human rights crisis has not gone away. In fact, according to a survey conducted last Spring by the Native Women’s Association of Canada, violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has increased during the pandemic. 
The federal government has still not issued a formal response to the National Inquiry’s Final Report. The much-anticipated National Action Plan to implement the National Inquiry’s 231 Calls for Justice, which was set to be released in June 2020, was delayed because of the pandemic. The government has stated that the plan is under development, but the timeline remains unknown. 
As the federal government crafts the National Action Plan it is looking to provinces and territories to see how each jurisdiction plans to implement the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice. In December, the Yukon became the first jurisdiction to release its strategy to end the violence. 
Much of Amnesty International’s advocacy with the No More Stolen Sisters campaign has focused on calling for the federal government to take action. Our calls for federal action remain unchanged, but this year we are pivoting to focus on action at the local, provincial, and territorial levels to encourage these levels of government to review the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice and work with rights holders to develop action plans for their jurisdiction. 
On March 8th, International Women’s Day, we released the No More Stolen Sisters campaign guide to support your activism at the local, provincial, and territorial levels. The guide will include a brief overview of the issues and actions taken to date, and provide guidance for Amnesty supporters building and strengthen connections with rights holders to collectively explore how best to support local, provincial, and territorial initiatives to end the violence. 
Please make space in your activist calendar to review the campaign guide in March. If you are part of a community group that now meets virtually, please build in time to discuss the campaign guide together. Please take time to implement the guide throughout 2021.

Last month the U.S. Department of Transportation put a Texas highway expansion project on hold, because it could violate U.S. human rights law by increasing pollution and displacing people from their homes in lower income Black and Latino neighbourhoods. And, after some intense campaigning by climate justice organizations like the Sunrise Movement, under the Biden administration, U.S. transportation spending is finally being shifted away from highway expansion and toward public transit. 
Now Canada’s government is lagging far behind our southern neighbours in considering the local and global human rights implications of transportation policy and spending. 
The urgency of the climate crisis demands bold action that sacrifices neither people nor the planet. Climate change is not only the great environmental emergency of our time, but also an unprecedented human rights crisis. It threatens a wide range of human rights, including the rights to water, to health, and to life itself. 
Transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in Canada, and emissions have been climbing relentlessly. Globally, GHG pollution from transport has more than doubled since 1970 and is increasing at a faster rate than any other energy end-use sector.  
Local air pollution from transportation is also a crucial human right issue in Canada and around the world. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment recognizes the “right to breathe clean air” as part of the right to health. Amnesty International calls on Canada to join other countries and recognize the right to a healthy environment. Amnesty also recently signed this joint letter calling on the UN Human Rights Council to recognize this as a fundamental right.  
One of the key measures that governments must take to tackle the climate crisis and reduce local air pollution is to urgently prioritize the transition from fossil fuel powered vehicles to electric vehicles. But just shifting to electric cars isn’t a sufficient response to the climate crisis. 
There are about 1.3 billion cars in operation globally, and the manufacturing of automobiles of all types, including electric vehicles, is still mainly powered with climate-disrupting fossil fuels. And the concrete and steel used to build parking structures and urban highways also have a massive greenhouse gas footprint. If the rapid increases in the number of vehicles in Canada and globally were to continue, the climate impact would be catastrophic. 
Instead, governments must implement policies to reduce reliance on car travel and the number of cars on the road while quickly ending sales of new fossil fuel vehicles. The number of cars needs to shrink to make the rapid transition to electric cars practical and just. The battery supply chain must also be transformed to respect human rights, from mining and processing to manufacturing and through to end-of-life recycling.  
Since February, Amnesty members have sent over 4200 letters to Ministers Champagne and Wilkinson calling on Canada to adopt Powering Change: Principles for Business and Government in the Battery Value Chain.   
Governments must redesign city space to make walking, cycling, and public transport convenient and pleasant, and reduce the number of cars on the road. Numerous studies show that when road space is reallocated to public transit lanes, protected bicycle lanes, and space for walking, traffic ‘evaporates’ and traffic speeds usually stay about the same. With fewer cars, cities can become healthier, cooler, more inclusive, and more pleasant. 
Amnesty International’s Recharge for Rights campaign lays out the principles that businesses and governments should adopt to avoid human rights abuses and environmental harms associated with batteries for electric cars and other products. 
There is nothing stopping governments from reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also safeguarding human rights and making communities healthier and more inclusive.

The rights to life, health, food, water, housing, security and the rights of Indigenous peoples. 
While all of us are affected by climate change, disadvantaged communities around the world and right here in Canada –  that have done the least to cause climate change – will be hit the hardest.  From those who live in coastal communities, to poorer communities who experience toxic and polluted air, and indigenous people who frequently live and depend on fragile ecosystems that are in danger. 
Climate change is a crisis. And the Canadian government must act like it is.  
The response of the Canadian government so far has been lethargic in commitment and inadequate in response.  
Simply put –  Canada needs to do more, and do more now!  
Amnesty Canada’s specialised team of climate justice volunteers write letters every month to Canada’s federal, provincial and municipal (local) governments – we demand urgent climate action to safeguard each and every one of our basic human rights.  
What do we ask for from Canada, provinces, territories and municipalities? 
What can you do? 
Write to Canada’s Prime Minister, to your provincial premier, and your municipal government – tell them that the longer we wait, the worse the climate effects will be and the more vulnerable we all become. Letter templates and addresses are provided below.

“Aleksei Navalny’s health has deteriorated rapidly during his time in detention. He is now on hunger strike as the Russian authorities have been denying him an examination by independent doctors of his choice. The transfer of Navalny to another penal colony and the latest official statements appear to suggest that the authorities intend to start force-feeding him as a way to break his hunger strike and further punish him.”   
“We reiterate our call for Aleksei Navalny’s immediate release. While he remains in detention, Aleksei Navalny must be allowed to be examined and treated by qualified, independent medical specialists of his choice. The authorities must ensure that any decision on subjecting him to forcible feeding is taken only after independent medical experts conduct an assessment of his situation without coercion and undue interference, taking into account Navalny’s mental competence and wishes. Otherwise, a decision to force-feed him may amount to torture or other ill-treatment.   
“The Russian authorities cannot escape the global scrutiny that their appalling treatment of Aleksei Navalny has invited.  We address all of our supporters, national governments and international bodies to join our call for Navalny’s immediate release, and urgent medical attention by independent doctors of his choice to save his life.”  
Background  
On 19 April, the Russian Federal Penitentiary service (FSIN) declared that Aleksei Navalny, who is unlawfully imprisoned in Penal Colony No.2 in Pokrov, Vladimir region, has been transferred to the medical ward of Penal Colony No.3 in the regional capital Vladimir. Aleksei Navalny announced a hunger strike on 31 March after prison authorities refused to allow a doctor to examine his worsening health condition, which includes pains in his back and numbness in his legs.  
In a press release today, the Russian penal authorities described Aleksei Navalny’s health condition as “satisfactory” and said that, with his consent, he is receiving “vitamin therapy”. In contrast, Navalny’s attending doctors reported on 16 April “sharply negative” dynamics of Navalny’s blood tests, which, in their opinion, could lead to renal failure or a cardiac arrest at any moment”.

Additional Information 
In 2017, the ruling T- 236 by the Colombian Constitutional Court concluded that there are elements to affirm, provisionally, that glyphosate is a toxic substance that, depending on the level of exposure, can cause cancer or have other health implications. This ruling also sets the requirements that must be met before using aerial spraying to destroy illicit crops. 
In 2019, the Constitutional Court issued the resolution 387 concluding that the government had the obligation to prioritize voluntary substitution over violent forced eradication methods. The Court also established that aerial spraying with glyphosate should be the last option, only if voluntary substitution and manual eradication have failed. The resolution also determined that the Colombian government should frame a decision on the return of  aerial spraying within the framework of point 4 (“Solution to the problem of Illicit Drugs”) of the Peace Accords, signed by the Colombia government and the FARC-EP in 2016. 
On 17 December 2020, ten UN independent experts sent a letter to the President of Colombia asking the government not to resume aerial spraying of illicit crops, as this programwould present “enormous risks” for human rights and the environment and would violate the peace agreement, as well as could go against Colombia’s obligations under international human rights law. 
In 2020, the government failed to significantly implement programmes for voluntary crop substitution, a key component of the Peace Agreement. Instead, the government set a goal of forcibly eradicate coca production on over 130,000 hectares, led by the military. On July 2020, Amnesty International issued a press release calling on the government to stop ground-spraying operations in coca plantations because they could result in human rights violations in the campesino farming communities that depend on coca for their livelihoods. Moreover, Amnesty International argued that beginning a process of forced crop eradication would exacerbate the situation of conflict in the country and leave rural communities and social leaders in an even more dangerous situation. 
Despite the health emergency declared due to COVID-19 and government orders for mandatory isolation; as well as multiple requests by several civil society organizations to suspend forced eradication of coca during the sanitary emergency; the authorities carried out these operations in at least seven departments in the country.

“POSCO’s decision to cut this tie is the latest blow to Myanmar’s military, which continues to impose its rule through murder and heinous human rights violations. Since staging a coup in February, the military has reportedly killed around 700 people, including dozens of children.   
“Given the scale of POSCO’s operations in Myanmar, this announcement is a major step forward. It increases the military authorities’ isolation, and adds to the growing pressure on other companies to end their business links with MEHL.   
“POSCO has yet to announce the full details of its plans to disengage from its steel venture and whether it will continue to pay lease payments to MEHL. The company also has yet to address its broader footprint in Myanmar in other sectors.  However, this is still a warning sign to all companies and investors who have business partnerships with MEHL. All of these businesses should do the right thing and responsibly cut these links immediately.  
“As pressure builds on businesses, and as the military continues to commit appalling human rights violations, the UN Security Council must stop lagging so far behind. It must impose, without further delay, a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar, as well as targeted financial sanctions on senior military officials responsible for atrocity crimes. The Security Council must also urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.”  
Background  
On 16 April 2021, POSCO announced that its Myanmar subsidiary, POSCO C&C, would end its relationship with military-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL). This decision follows months of international pressure from Amnesty International and other organizations, who have engaged POSCO, its investors and stakeholders, calling on the company to cut ties with the Myanmar military.  
On 24 March 2021, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar by consensus, which highlighted that no company active in Myanmar or with business links to Myanmar should do business with the military (also known as the Tatmadaw) or one of their business entities, until and unless those businesses are restructured and transformed.  
In September 2020, Amnesty International’s Military Ltd. report demonstrated that POSCO, as MEHL’s business partner, was linked to the financing of Myanmar’s military units implicated in crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations.  
The Myanmar military staged a coup on 1 February 2021 and has been increasingly using lethal force, including battlefield weapons, against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters and onlookers, reportedly killing over 700 people, including dozens of children. It has also arbitrarily detained over 3,000 individuals, including government officials, human rights defenders, activists, journalists, artists, medical workers and others.

“The wrongful prosecution, conviction and sentencing of these 10 activists underlines the Hong Kong government’s intention to eliminate all political opposition in the city. 
“Having arrested the majority of Hong Kong’s most prominent dissidents using the repressive national security law, the authorities are now mopping up remaining peaceful critics under the pretext of bogus charges related to the 2019 protests. 
“These convictions are a violation of international law, which states that participating in and organizing peaceful assemblies does not require prior permission by the state. Nor does failure to notify the authorities about an assembly make it unlawful to take part in it. The prosecution’s case against these activists is simply not tenable. 
“The Hong Kong authorities must stop bringing unwarranted criminal charges against those who have peacefully exercise their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. All those sentenced today should be immediately released and their record expunged.” 
Background  
Ten pro-democracy activists were sentenced today to between eight and 18 months in prison for organizing and participating in two “unauthorized” protests on 18 and 31 August 2019. 
They were part of a series of mass protests triggered by the so-called Extradition Bill proposed early that year. As protests against the bill became more frequent and larger in 2019, the Hong Kong police adopted a tougher approach to restricting public assemblies, ranging from revoking “notices of no objection” for marches to banning protests outright on the grounds of “public security concerns”. 
An estimated 1.7 million people took part in a peaceful march on 18 August 2019, defying police orders to confine the gathering to a stationary rally in Victoria Park near the city centre. 
Hundreds of thousands of people again took to the streets on 31 August 2019, defying a total ban by the police and despite organizers calling off the protest. The latter demonstration was largely peaceful but ended in clashes between police and protesters, some of whom threw bricks and petrol bombs. 
Three of those sentenced today, newspaper owner Jimmy Lai and former lawmakers Au Nok-Hin and Leung Kwok-hung, are also facing prosecution under Hong Kong’s national security law, which was enacted on 30 June 2020 and has since been used to systematically crack down on human rights. Lai was in fact handed an additional charge under the national security law during today’s hearing. 
The others sentenced were former legislators and activists Martin Lee, Lee Cheuk-yan, Leung Yiu-chung, Margaret Ng, Cyd Ho Sau-lan, Albert Ho Chun-yan and Yeung Sum. 
The sentences for Martin Lee, Margaret Ng and Albert Ho were suspended for 24 months, Leung Yiu-chung’s sentence was suspended for 12 months and Yeung Sum’s was suspended for eight months. 
The prosecutions were based on the Public Order Ordinance, the provisions and application of which fail to meet international human rights law and standards on the right to peaceful assembly. The UN Human Rights Committee has repeatedly expressed concern that the application of “unlawful assembly” against Hong Kong protesters risks violating their human rights. 
According to Articles 14–15 of Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance, those wishing to organize a protest are required to obtain a “notice of no objection” from the police before an assembly may proceed. Police have the power to prohibit public gatherings or impose requirements or conditions on public gatherings where the police “reasonably consider it necessary in the interest of national security or public safety, public order or for the protection of the rights and freedom of others”. 
International human rights law stipulates that anyone who wishes to hold a demonstration should be able to do so without requiring permission or authorization from the authorities. 
Amnesty International has long called for relevant provisions of the Public Order Ordinance to be amended to bring it in line with Hong Kong’s obligations under international human rights law.

Amnesty International announced The Dime Box as its 2021 March/April Book Club novel to coincide with International Women’s Day. As a new Canadian author, I am deeply humbled by this remarkable and unexpected honour.  
Set in Ontario, The Dime Box is the story of a young woman, Greta Giffen, who is accused of murdering her father. The novel embodies the theme of domestic violence, yet also includes themes of justice, the search for identity, adoption, and how we, as society, define family. Canadian author Lawrence Hill describes The Dime Box as “a quintessential book club novel, with an unforgettable protagonist, and where every character faces moral dilemmas and is forced to make difficult choices.”  
Though purely a work of the imagination, The Dime Box is inspired by the many students I had the privileged of coming to know throughout my career in public education. As we worked and learned together, I was struck by the power and generosity of their voices, lives and life stories. I strongly believe children and youth are beacons of light for the rest of us, and that our future is in great hands.  
Like the protagonist in The Dime Box, I too am adopted and writing the novel stirred many emotions. I remember as a child often being told on outings or at parties with my parents ‘you look like a chip off the old block.’ At the time, I laughed along. Later, I wondered what it meant. How was that even possible? I stood in front of my bedroom mirror at home wondering who the person was looking back at me. Why did I look the way I did? Who did I look like? Did I look more like my biological mother or father? Like every child who grows up, I struggled with my sense of identity. Back in the 1970s, there were no books with characters who were adopted to take out from the library or to read at school. Who was I and where did I belong? Was water thicker than blood, or was blood thicker than water, and how does society look at, or define family. When the confusion, grief and loss inherent in being adopted occasionally surfaced, they added an additional dynamic to wrestle with as I came to know myself.  
One of the reasons I wrote The Dime Box was to spur conversation about girls’ and women’s issues with the hopes that together, we can help to create a more inclusive world. While it took five years to write the novel, gender inequality has become an even more important issue today. The current COVID-19 pandemic has had an undeniable effect on women. From security and the economy, to health and social protection, women and girls have been disproportionately affected by the crisis. This is having a regressive effect on gender equality. Increased intimate partner violence and loss of jobs are of particular concern, widening existing gender gaps around the world. As a global community, we must take action to protect the safety of women and girls, to improve their social and economic outcomes and to put in place interventions to address the broader societal aspects of gender inequality.  
I hope you enjoy The Dime Box and Greta’s story of resilience, heartache and triumph.  
All the best and take good care, 
Karen

Although it...","The Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and The Canadian Council of Churches responded with disappointment to the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision overturning the lower court’s ruling that the Canada-US Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) is unconstitutional. 
Although it allowed the government’s appeal, the Court pointed to potential shortcomings in the review process for the Safe Third Country Agreement. The evidence is overwhelming that the US is unsafe for many refugees – yet Canada’s review process has not led the government to revoke its  designation of the US as a safe third country. We call on the government to recognize that the US is not safe and suspend the Agreement. 
As was the case in the first legal challenge of the Safe Third Country Agreement, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned the Federal Court’s finding that the Agreement was unconstitutional on the basis of how the arguments were framed. The Court suggests an alternative way the case could have been presented – by attacking the review process for the Safe Third Country Agreement. However, this approach would be impractical, given that the government asserts a right to confidentiality of the evidence about the reviews it conducts. 
The organizations are particularly disappointed that the Court does not engage with the substantial evidence before it that people sent back to the US under the Safe Third Country Agreement suffer serious rights violations in detention in the US. Shockingly, the Court even suggests that because refugees are already suffering psychologically, the impact of suffering caused by detention may not need to be considered when determining whether their treatment is “cruel and unusual”. 
Neither the Federal Court nor the Federal Court of Appeal addressed the evidence that the Safe Third Country Agreement has particularly negative consequences for women because the US does not properly protect people fleeing gender-based persecution. 
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, most refugee claimants who arrive at an official border post seeking protection in Canada are denied entry and turned back to the US. Because the agreement only applies at official border crossings, many refugees have been forced to cross the border in between ports of entry, sometimes in perilous conditions. Withdrawing from the Agreement would not only ensure that Canada meets its Charter and legal obligations, but would also allow people to present themselves in an orderly way at ports of entry, ending the need for irregular crossings.

“The Amnesty movement is saddened that yet another Black father, son and partner was taken from his family as a result of the actions of police.  
“Daunte Wright was reportedly pulled over on the pretextual grounds of having expired registration and having an air freshener dangling from his rearview mirror, neither warranting what escalated into a fatal encounter. Last year Black and Latino Army Lieutenant Caron Nazario suffered a violent traffic stop in Windsor, Virginia. Officers claimed to have not seen his paper license plate on his new car in the rear window. These incidents speak to a common denominator and remind us of systemic failures of policing, resulting in disparate enforcement on people of color, particularly Black people. Plain and simple, armed law enforcement should be taken out of the equation of traffic enforcement. 
“Surviving an interaction with law enforcement shouldn’t depend on where you live or the color of your skin. International standards are clear that in addition to rights to equal protection of law, security, and life, we have a right to be free from discrimination when interacting with law enforcement. Officers responsible for excessive force, whatever the result, must be held accountable. 
“The local community in Brooklyn Center and the Minneapolis region are understandably frustrated and enraged by these recurring incidents of police violence and have taken to the streets demanding accountability for the death of Daunte Wright. Law enforcement must protect and facilitate protesters’ rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and ensure that any decision to disperse a crowd is made as a last resort, when lesser means would be insufficient. Officials must ensure that any measures used to disperse a crowd are necessary, proportional and lawful. They must also take into account the impact on the surrounding residential community, for instance when deciding to use chemical irritants.  
“Protests against police violence should not be met with more police violence, as we saw for months following the death of George Floyd last summer.”   
Background 
Amnesty International USA has been calling for police accountability for the use of deadly force. As protesters took to the streets last summer following the death of George Floyd, AIUSA spoke out against the excessive force used by law enforcement. Amnesty International documented 125 separate examples of police violence against protesters in 40 states and the District of Columbia between May 26 and June 5, 2020. 
In 2015, Amnesty International USA released a report on the use of deadly force by law enforcement and raised serious human rights concerns with regards to the right to life, the right to security of the person, the right to freedom from discrimination and the right to equal protection of the law. This report highlights the need for a nationwide review and reform of existing laws, policies, training and practices on police use of lethal force, as well as a thorough review and reform of oversight and accountability mechanisms.

As human rights advocates, it is unacceptable that Amnesty supporters across our entire movement — from our governance, members, to our staff and volunteers have experienced or witnessed racism at AICES. 
It takes incredible courage to share these difficult experiences and we thank these individuals for coming forward. We take their accounts seriously and unreservedly apologize to all of our colleagues across our organization who have or continue to experience harm and pain. Our mission is to prevent and address racism and discrimination wherever it manifests. 
These issues are not new, and the Board takes full responsibility for our collective failure to hold ourselves accountable. There is more we could have done to address the different layers of individual, systemic and structural instances of racism.   
Racism manifests itself in a variety of forms and at various levels. At the individual level, people can experience it through microaggressions, bullying and interpersonal harm. Yet it also appears in forms that are far more subtle. Understanding racism in an organization requires understanding its structure and systems, and who holds decision making power. The reality is that racialized people within Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking) traditionally have not been in a position to make those decisions. Their voices and perspectives have been at the margin and not at the centre.  
AICES’ roots stem from a settler culture. We too are a reflection of Canada’s colonial past and current inequalities, particularly against Black, Indigenous and racialized people. We have reached a point in our history where this structure can and must no longer continue. Now is the time for transformative action. We need to dismantle the systemic and structural elements of racism that are embedded deeply within our organization in order to credibly lead this work externally.  
We are determined to do better and go beyond increasing diversity. This includes reviewing how issues are prioritized, how we organize, how and who we work with, and how our resources are allocated. 
During this period of reckoning, our Board has been on a journey to respond to the challenges faced by the organization. Thanks to racialized directors and board members, we have been engaging in difficult, yet courageous conversations that have enabled us to take concrete steps forward to build an anti-racist organization. 
The Board fully supports the visionary leadership of our Secretary General to do what is right and expected for our community. We are committed to joining her in taking the necessary steps to create a more equitable, inclusive and anti-racist organization. 
We have begun to do the hard work, to be accountable and hold ourselves to the same standards we diligently ask of others.  
Since focusing on this work, we have made some important changes, which include:  
There is much more we can do. As we move forward on this journey, we commit to keeping our members and the public informed about our progress.  
While we know that this journey is a difficult one, we are ready to meet this challenge. To this end, we will continue to take the steps needed to deconstruct the barriers and structures that perpetuate systemic racism at AICES and create a just, equitable and inclusive environment for all.

Amnesty International Report 2020/21: The State of the World’s Human Rights covers 149 countries and delivers a comprehensive analysis of human rights trends globally in 2020. 
In it, the organization describes those already most marginalized, including women and refugees, as bearing the devastating brunt of the pandemic, as a result of decades of discriminatory policy decisions by world leaders. Health workers, migrant workers, and those in the informal sector – many at the frontlines of the pandemic – have also been betrayed by neglected health systems and patchy economic and social support. 
The response to the global pandemic has been further undermined by leaders who have ruthlessly exploited the crisis and weaponized COVID-19 to launch fresh attacks on human rights, the organization says. 
“COVID-19 has brutally exposed and deepened inequality both within and between countries, and highlighted the staggering disregard our leaders have for our shared humanity.  Decades of divisive policies, misguided austerity measures, and choices by leaders not to invest in crumbling public infrastructure, have left too many easy prey to this virus,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s new Secretary General. 
“We face a world in disarray. At this point in the pandemic, even the most deluded leaders would struggle to deny that our social, economic and political systems are broken.” 
Pandemic has amplified decades of inequalities and erosion of public services  
Amnesty’s report shows how existing inequalities as a result of decades of toxic leadership have left ethnic minorities, refugees, older persons, and women disproportionately negatively affected by the pandemic. 
COVID-19 worsened the already precarious situation of refugees, asylum seekers and migrants in many countries, trapping some in squalid camps, cutting off vital supplies, or precipitating border controls that left many stranded. For example, Uganda, the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa with 1.4 million refugees, immediately closed its borders at the start of the pandemic and did not make an exception for refugees and asylum seekers trying to enter the country. As a result, over 10,000 people were stranded along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). 
The report highlights a marked increase in gender-based and domestic violence with many women and LGBTI persons facing increased barriers to protection and support due to restrictions on freedom of movement; lack of confidential mechanisms for victims to report violence while isolated with their abusers, and reduced capacity or suspension of services. 
Those on the frontlines of the pandemic – health workers, and those in the informal sector – suffered as a result of wilfully neglected health systems and pitiful social protection measures. In Bangladesh, many working in the informal sector have been left without an income or social protections due to lockdowns and curfews. In Nicaragua, over the course of two weeks in early June, at least 16 health workers were dismissed after expressing concerns about lack of PPE and the state response to the pandemic. 
“We are reaping the results of years of calculated neglect at the hands of our leaders. In 2020, under the unique strain of a pandemic, health systems have been put to the ultimate test and people have been left in financial freefall. The heroes of 2020 were the health workers on the frontlines saving lives and those bunched together at the very bottom of the income scale, who worked to feed families, and keep our essential services going.  Cruelly, those who gave the most, were protected the least,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Virulent strain of leaders weaponize the pandemic to further assault human rights  
The report also paints a dismal picture of the failures of global leaders whose handling of the pandemic has been marked by opportunism and total contempt for human rights. 
“We’ve seen a spectrum of responses from our leaders; from the mediocre to mendacious, selfish to the fraudulent. Some have tried to normalize the overbearing emergency measures they’ve ushered in to combat COVID-19, whilst a particularly virulent strain of leader has gone a step further. They have seen this as an opportunity to entrench their own power. Instead of supporting and protecting people, they have simply weaponized the pandemic to wreak havoc on people’s rights,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Authorities passing legislation criminalizing commentary related to the pandemic has been a presiding pattern. In Hungary for example, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government amended the country’s Criminal Code, introducing prison sentences of up to five years for “spreading false information” about COVID-19 for example. 
Across the Gulf states in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates authorities used the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to continue suppressing the right to freedom of expression, including by prosecuting individuals, who posted comments on social media about government responses to the pandemic, for spreading “false news”. 
Other leaders have used excessive force. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had ordered police to shoot “dead” people who protest or may cause “trouble” during quarantine measures. In Nigeria, brutal policing has resulted in security forces killing people for protesting in the streets, demanding their rights and calling for accountability. Under President Bolsonaro, police violence in Brazil escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic. At least 3,181 people were killed by the police across the country between January and June – an average of 17 deaths per day. 
Some leaders have gone a step further, using the distraction of the pandemic to clamp down on criticism – and critics – unrelated to the virus, and perpetrate other human rights violations while the gaze of the world’s media was elsewhere. For example, in India, Narendra Modi, further cracked down on civil society activists, including through counter-terrorism raids on their homes and premises. Meanwhile under President Xi Jinping, the Chinese government continued its persecution of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang unabated and a sweeping national security law was ushered through in Hong Kong to legitimize politically motivated repression. 
“International institutions such as the International Criminal Court and UN human rights mechanisms are there to hold states and individual perpetrators to account. Sadly, 2020 shows that they have been wrestled into political deadlock by leaders seeking to exploit and undermine collective responses to human rights violations,” said Agnès Callamard. 
National self-interest has trumped international cooperation in COVID response 
World leaders have also wreaked havoc on the international stage, hampering collective recovery efforts by blocking or undermining international cooperation. 
These include: 
“The pandemic has cast a harsh light on the world’s inability to cooperate effectively in times of dire global need,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“The only way out of this mess is through international cooperation.  States must ensure vaccines are quickly available to everyone, everywhere, and free at the point of use. Pharmaceutical companies must share their knowledge and technology so no one is left behind. G20 members and international financial institutions must provide debt relief for the poorest 77 countries to respond and recover from the pandemic.” 
Failed by their governments, protest movements the world over have stood up 
Regressive policies have inspired many people to join long-standing struggles as seen by the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, the #End SARS protests in Nigeria, and new and creative forms of protest such as virtual climate strikes. The report details many important victories that human rights activists helped to secure in 2020, particularly across gender-based violence. These include new legislation to counter violence against women and girls in Kuwait, South Korea, and Sudan, and the decriminalization of abortion in Argentina, Northern Ireland, and South Korea. 
“Leadership in 2020 came not from power, privilege, or profiteers. It came from the countless people marching to demand change. We saw an outpouring of support for #End SARS, Black Lives Matter, as well as public protests against repression and inequality in places across the world including in Poland, Hong Kong, Iraq and Chile. Often risking their own safety, it was the leadership of ordinary people and human rights defenders the world over that urged us on. These are the people at the frontier of the struggle for a better, safer and more equal world,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“We are at a crossroads. We must release the shackles that degrade human dignity. We must reset and reboot to build a world grounded in equality, human rights, and humanity. We must learn from the pandemic, and come together to work boldly and creatively so everyone is on an equal footing.”

Police have used rubber bullets, stun grenades, chemical irritants, water cannons and other less lethal weapons against peaceful protesters, resulting in at least four deaths and countless serious injuries. More than 30,000 demonstrators have been detained and scores of have been subjected to torture and other ill treatment. At least one person is known to have died in detention. Many journalists and human rights defenders involved on documenting police crackdowns in Belarus have been imprisoned. Opposition leaders have either fled the country or been detained. 
You don’t have to be out in the streets protesting to be at risk. Passers-by, flower sellers and even people wearing red or white clothes — the colours of the flag of Belarus first adopted in 1918 during a brief period of independence — eating red and white candy or even hanging the red and white Japanese or Canadian flag in their apartments have also been targeted. 
In the lead up to Freedom Day on March 25, 2021 – and yet another wave of mass demonstrations – law enforcement and government figures made chilling statements about a potentially violent response, with Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikalai Karpenkau promising to “deal with them” in a way “already worked out” – a reference to the months-long violent crackdown. 
Not a single official investigation into human rights violations by law enforcement officials in Belarus is known to have been opened. On March 24, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution mandating the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to collect, analyse and preserve information about human rights violations in Belarus during the 2020 presidential vote and the post-election crackdown on peaceful protesters in order to ensure perpetrators’ accountability for crimes and bring justice to their victims. 
WHAT YOU CAN DO 
Last fall, a global petition against police brutality which saw 191,000 people from 144 countries and territories call for an end to police violence in Belarus. The visibility of that international action meant a great deal to people on the ground in Belarus struggling to defend human rights.

“This is just the latest example of the military authorities’ determination to kill their way out of nationwide resistance to the coup. These abhorrent killings again show the generals’ brazen disregard for the inadequate pressure applied so far by the international community. 
“This comes a day after the military announced that further protests would be met with shots to the head.  
“The cost of international inaction is being counted in bodies, including children shot dead in their homes. Amid the horrifying death toll is a nation of over 50 million held hostage, subjected to arbitrary arrest and sweeping surveillance, living in fear of death and torture.   
“The people of Myanmar continue to protest, all while they grieve more killings by the hour. The nations that participated in the military’s Armed Forces Day events today in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw, particularly China and Russia, are the same states that have shielded the Tatmadaw from accountability time and time again, supplying them with the means to carry out mass slaughter.   
“UN Security Council member states’ continued refusal to meaningfully act against this never-ending horror is contemptible.”  
Background    
At the time of writing, media reported that the military killed nearly 100 people in Yangon, Mandalay and other towns today, including a five-year-old boy. On 26 March, state television announced protesters were “in danger of getting shot to the head and back”.  
According to estimates from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) (AAPPB), the minimum death toll since the 1 February coup stood at 328 on 26 March. 
While a small number of protesters have armed themselves with crude homemade weaponry including molotov cocktails, slingshots and homemade air-pressure rifles, the protests have overall remained peaceful and in the incidents that Amnesty International has examined, lethal force used by the military has been unlawful and excessive. 
Elsewhere in the country, armed conflict is escalating between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups. Amnesty International has grave concerns about the potential for further mass atrocities as well as the resumption of large-scale conflict and associated mass displacement adding to the country’s existing internally displaced population of over 300,000.  
Amnesty is calling on the UN Security Council to impose a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar, and refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.   
The Security Council must also impose targeted financial sanctions against Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing (Myanmar’s military chief now in charge of the country) and other military leaders responsible for atrocity crimes against various ethnic minorities across the country, including the Rohingya.   
The UN Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar has previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other senior officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

Dr. Callamard joins the world’s largest non-governmental human rights organization, having recently been the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. In that role, she led ground-breaking investigations including into the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. 
As Secretary General, Dr. Callamard will be the Chief Executive of Amnesty’s International Secretariat and the principal spokesperson of the global Amnesty movement, which has some 10 million supporters, and offices in more than 70 countries. 
“At a time when human rights are under unprecedented threat around the world, Dr. Callamard will lead, excite and rally the entire Amnesty movement to meet these challenges head-on,” said Sarah Beamish, Chair of the International Board, in announcing the appointment. “The combination of her intellectual acuity, her deep global human rights experience, and her courageous voice makes her highly qualified to front our movement. We are delighted she has accepted this challenge to take us boldly into our next phase.”   
The Secretary General is appointed by the International Board of Amnesty for an initial four-year term. Her appointment followed an extensive global search. Dr. Callamard will succeed Acting Secretary General Julie Verhaar. 
 “Where governments and corporations seek to silence those who speak out against their abuses, to obfuscate the truth, and to undermine or reject human rights norms, the rigorous investigations and uncompromising campaigns of Amnesty International are more vital than ever,” Dr. Callamard said. “I am honoured to take up the post of Secretary General and work alongside Amnesty’s supporters around the world so that together we defend and demand respect for all human rights for all.” 
Dr. Callamard, a French national, has built a highly distinguished career in the international human rights and humanitarian sectors, working across NGOs, academia, and the United Nations. Alongside her role as a United Nations independent human rights expert, she held the role of Director of the Global Freedom of Expression Project at Columbia University. Previously, she has been the Executive Director of the Freedom of Expression organization ARTICLE 19 and was the founder and Executive Director of HAP International (the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership). 
Dr. Callamard worked with Amnesty International from 1995-2001, including as Chef de Cabinet for then-Secretary General Pierre Sané. She has led human rights investigations in more than 30 countries and published extensively on human rights, women’s rights, freedom of expression, refugee movements, and the methodology of human rights investigations. 
As Ms. Callamard takes up this role, the International Board thanks Ms. Verhaar for her interim leadership, and wishes her the best as she moves on to new challenges.

Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court of Canada on the Government of Canada’s Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) confirms the constitutionality of the federal carbon pricing backstop.  
This ruling confirms that climate change is a matter of national concern and sets a precedent for the federal government to set nation-wide minimum standards when it comes to climate action. The 130 member organizations of Climate Action Network Canada are enthusiastic about the precedent this decision establishes for ambitious climate policy going forward.  
QUOTES FROM CANADIAN CIVIL SOCIETY REPRESENTATIVES 
“The Supreme Court of Canada dropped a love letter to the planet with today’s favourable ruling on the constitutionality of Canada’s carbon pricing law. This historic ruling sends a clear message that the Canadian Constitution cannot be used by laggards to delay and deny climate action. The climate crisis is a matter of national concern: it’s time for every order of Canadian government to stop partisan politicking and come together in a spirit of cooperative federalism on this critical issue. Carbon pricing is an essential element of any climate plan that will finally get Canada to our fair share of the global effort; I look forward to seeing today’s decision reflected in the new climate target Canada is set to bring to Biden’s earth day summit.” – Catherine Abreu, Executive Director, Climate Action Network Canada  
“Reducing our greenhouse gas emissions is essential to enable healthy people and a healthy planet, and putting a price on pollution is one of the most effective tools the government has to make this reduction happen. We are glad to see the price on pollution upheld, and support innovation at all levels of government to address the climate crisis and ensure the health of all people in Canada.” – Dr. Anjali Helferty, Interim Executive Director, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE) 
“This decision ensures that the federal and provincial and territorial carbon pricing regimes work together harmoniously. It is also a victory for Quebec and British-Columbia, as all legislation will now be able to move in the same direction, thus guaranteeing the success of the system. Nevertheless, we must remember that minimum carbon pricing is an important tool in the fight against the climate crisis, and that it is now up to the provinces and territories to show more ambition and leadership.” Émile Boisseau-Bouvier, Équiterre’s climate policy analyst. 
“The climate crisis poses immense threats to our rights to water, food, health and other human rights. Canada’s obligations under international human rights law must guide its commitments to climate action. In our submission to the court, we argued that constitutional debates or ambiguities with respect to division of powers between provincial and federal governments need to be resolved in a way that maximizes Canada’s compliance with its international human rights and environmental obligations, both at the federal and provincial level. Amnesty International Canada is pleased that today’s Supreme Court decision has confirmed that it is within the federal government’s jurisdiction to identify nation-wide standards when it comes to climate action, which it must do to uphold international human rights obligations.” Fiona Koza, Campaigner, Amnesty International Canada 
“This is great news for public health. Climate change is already harming the mental and physical health of people across Canada. Over the last few decades, millions have been exposed to extremely high levels of toxic wildfire smoke and extreme heat, hundreds of thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes due to floods and wildfires, and hundreds of thousands have been left without electricity for extended periods. Carbon pricing is a pivotal tool needed to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.” Kim Perrotta, Executive Director, Canadian Health Association for Sustainability and Equity (CHASE). 
“This is a small but important win for the planet, one that will allow Canada to move more aggressively to deal with the climate emergency upon us. This entire court case has been an unfortunate distraction, as even a first year law student knows the federal government has shared jurisdiction over issues like environmental pollution. Voters and taxpayers of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario should be asking their provincial politicians what the millions spent on political grandstanding has bought them today.” Andy Blair, Vice-President, Canadian Unitarians for Social Justice 
In order for the federal government to make good on the solemn commitment to emissions reduction it made in Paris in 2015, multiple measures are required, but the broad applicability of carbon pricing makes it a vital part of that toolkit.  We are relieved that our provincial government in Saskatchewan has been unsuccessful in a move which could have had the effect of sabotaging Canada’s ability to meet even the inadequate 2030 target the Trudeau government has set.  We call on both provincial and federal governments to work constructively in rapidly building a prosperous and inclusive economy, based on clean, climate-friendly renewable energy options and respecting natural limits. Mark Bigland-Pritchard, co-organizer, Climate Justice Saskatoon 
For far too long, the impacts of pollution on human and planetary health have been ignored. Pricing pollution is a critical step in the transition towards a fossil fuel free society and will help local government’s create 21st century communities centred in human and planetary health. From accessible active transportation options, electrified mass transit, local energy systems, and healthy affordable housing without fossil fuels, this decision will help Climate Caucus members drive the changes needed to respond to the interconnected crises at speed and scale. Our members celebrate this win for planetary and public health and are committed to ensuring no one is left behind in the transition to a resilient, equitable, and decarbonized future. Megan Curren, Steering Committee, Climate Caucus 
“The Government of Saskatchewan chose to initiate this time-consuming, costly court case instead of crafting a carbon pricing policy that best fit this province’s needs. Evidence of the effectiveness of carbon pricing is extensive and was largely undisputed in this court case. We are happy to see that the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in favour of a decision that enables the federal and provincial governments to act cooperatively on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.” Allyson Brady, Executive Director, Saskatchewan Environmental Society 
“Today’s ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada is an important win for Canada’s ability to combat the worst impacts of climate change. We can now take ambitious steps towards a just transition to a net-zero Canadian economy, with good jobs and thriving communities. All levels of government must take climate change seriously and carbon pricing is part of the solution. Canada’s unions are pleased with today’s decision.” Hassan Yussuff, President, Canadian Labour Congress 
“Today’s decision is important. It’s a victory for women and girls and all Canadians. It ushers in an era of climate legislation and regulation unimpeded by the fossil fuel industry and its political surrogates. We congratulate the Government of Canada and thank our co-counsels and all those who intervened on behalf of climate justice.” Beatrice Olivastri, CEO, Friends of the Earth 
“We are pleased Canada’s highest court has confirmed that the federal government has the legal authority to fight climate change through minimum national standards of price stringency to reduce GHG emissions. Now Canadians can rest assured that all provinces will do their fair share to tackle the climate crisis, getting Canada on the path to meeting our Paris commitments and net-zero emissions by 2050.” Josh Ginsberg, lawyer with Ecojustice’s law clinic at the University of Ottawa 
“This is a tremendously important decision for our national and global fight against climate change, paving the way for the federal government to continue to introduce strong legislation that supports climate solutions. It is now clear that provincial governments can accelerate, but not impede, federal action to deal with the climate crisis.” Priyanka Vittal, Legal Counsel, Greenpeace Canada 
“This is an important day for climate action. Carbon pricing is just one tool in the toolbox for meeting the climate crisis, but it remains an important one. We hope that today’s decision drives forward ambitious federal action to respond to the climate emergency and to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy is a just one.” Larry Brown, President, National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) 
“With this ruling, there is no longer any credible reason for provinces who launched the legal challenge against carbon pricing – Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan – to delay the creation and implementation of strong provincial climate plans that drive down emissions in line with Canada’s 2030 and 2050 targets. Investors are increasingly aware the return on their investment is at risk without realistic strategies for dealing with climate change. Carbon pricing puts companies in a better position to compete for global capital. Along with a healthier environment, pricing carbon pollution can benefit Canadians financially as well. In provinces where the federal carbon pricing system is applied, all the money collected is returned to Canadians to put more money back in the pockets of individuals and families.” Isabelle Turcotte, Director Federal Policy, Pembina Institute. 
“The Supreme Court ruling is precedent setting, and a positive step forward for climate action in Canada. Carbon pricing is a critical tool to reducing our GHG emissions. Our path to a zero-emissions future is only achievable if all levels of the federal government and the provinces work together. No more delays- it’s time to move forward together, and get to work on addressing the climate emergency with every policy tool we have.” Maggy Burn, Executive Director, Ecology Action Centre 
“The Supreme Court ruling is a win for climate action. We call  on the federal government to now ensure it applies its carbon pricing backstop consistently across all jurisdictions and to no longer permit provinces like New Brunswick to undermine the effectiveness of carbon pricing through reductions in other taxes or low emissions standards for industry. It is time to decarbonize and electrify our economies over the next 10 years to stay within the reality of a rapidly declining global carbon budget.” Louise Comeau, Director Climate Change and Energy, Conservation Council of New Brunswick

0,Americas: States can defeat COVID-19 by adopting vaccination plans in line with 10 human rights obligations,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/americas-states-can-defeat-covid-19-adopting-vaccination-plans-line-10-human-rights-obligations/,"Governments across Latin America and the Caribbean must prioritize high risk groups for COVID-19 vaccination and ensure complete transparency in the design and implementation of their vaccination plans and their dealings with pharmaceutical companies, said Amnesty International in a new report...","Governments across Latin America and the Caribbean must prioritize high risk groups for COVID-19 vaccination and ensure complete transparency in the design and implementation of their vaccination plans and their dealings with pharmaceutical companies, said Amnesty International in a new report released today. Vaccines in the Americas: Ten Human Rights Musts to ensure health for all examines the vaccination rollout in 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and outlines 10 key recommendations for governments and companies. 
“The commencement of vaccination against COVID-19 has brought hope to a region that was already experiencing multiple human rights crises, many of which have since been exacerbated by the pandemic. A year on from the beginning of lockdowns in Latin America and the Caribbean, governments must use vaccination as an opportunity to bridge inequalities, not widen them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
With several countries in the region holding presidential or midterm elections in 2021, the report warns that political pressures and corruption could impact access to vaccines and the universal right to health. It also calls on governments to consult widely when designing their vaccine plans and ensure that at-risk groups, including health workers and older people, as well as marginalized groups such as Indigenous peoples, migrants, refugees, Afro-descendant people and people deprived of their liberty, among other discriminated groups, are not left behind in receiving vaccines. 
“As ten countries undergo elections this year in a region where corruption in the health sector is commonplace, there is a real risk of governments using vaccination drives for political gain. Politicians must not use vaccines to reward supporters or put pressure on sectors of society that are critical of them. Health is a human right that must never be undermined by politics,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Amnesty International is calling on states to ensure access to information and transparency, as they are essential for adequate vaccination plans. Pharmaceutical companies, while supplying life-saving vaccines, have also undermined transparency in negotiations with countries in the region, potentially affecting universal access to vaccines. As well as conducting more than two-dozen interviews, the organization submitted information requests to 17 countries asking for specific details of the negotiations and the contracts that governments signed with pharmaceutical companies. While seven governments replied to these requests, not one of them provided full responses. 
“In the context of a global shortage in vaccine supplies, transparency and accountability around how vaccines are developed, produced, purchased and distributed is paramount. Pharmaceutical companies have a responsibility to respect human rights under international law which requires private actors to proactively take measures to avoid infringing on human rights, to share their knowledge and technology to maximize the number of doses of vaccines available, and work together to ensure that those most at-risk of COVID-19 in all countries can access life-saving vaccines immediately. They need to be part of a human-rights based solution,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
At the time of writing, 13 countries in the region had made public their national vaccination plans. Very few of those had consulted with experts, communities, or civil society during their design phase, with some of them overlooking at-risk populations. While all 13 countries’ plans prioritize frontline health workers for vaccination, Amnesty International has received reports from Mexico, Peru and Brazil that administrative or directive staff of hospitals could be receiving vaccines ahead of those on the frontlines treating COVID-19 patients. Only six countries had reasonably updated registers, disaggregated by gender, profession, location, and other data, on the number of health workers affected by COVID-19 during the pandemic. Several countries have severe shortages in terms of healthcare personnel, with numbers of doctors and nurses per capita far below the threshold that the WHO considers necessary for delivering basic health services in the world’s poorest countries. 
“The shocking gaps in the staffing, registry and protection of the healthcare sector in Latin America goes to show once again how economic growth in many countries has not translated into stronger social rights nor more robust healthcare systems. A strong vaccination effort cannot exist without well protected health workers and health systems,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
While several countries have included Indigenous Peoples as priority groups during vaccine rollout, Chile, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico have made no mention of protocols for Indigenous Peoples in their plans. Indigenous Peoples, who comprise a high proportion of the population in several of those countries, have been systematically marginalized and excluded from public policies for centuries. 
Furthermore, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica have either placed significant barriers for migrants and refugees to access vaccines, or overtly blocked their access, despite the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees having affirmed that including these groups in vaccine rollout is key to ending the pandemic.  
While many governments have publicly promised that COVID-19 vaccines will be free for all, only nine of the 17 countries in the report have officially confirmed this in their official plans or passed regulation to this effect. Meanwhile, members of the private sector in several countries have made attempts to buy up vaccines directly from developers, possibly creating parallel vaccine rollout processes that could undermine fairness for all. 
“States must live up to their obligations to ensure that vaccines remain free at the point of care. Governments should prohibit direct private purchases by law and consider sanctioning individuals or private organizations that circumvent the national vaccination plan or otherwise unduly impede the state’s measures to ensure fair access to the vaccines. The vaccine is needed first by those populations who are most at-risk,” concluded Erika Guevara-Rosas.

“This resolution is yet another urgent reminder that vaccine access is a basic human right that every single person is entitled to. The resolution rightly calls for increased international cooperation, and expresses serious concern over the global disparity in access to COVID-19 vaccines. It emphasizes the urgent need for states to fulfil the right to health and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, which includes access to vaccines. 
“States must cooperate to ensure vaccines are developed and manufactured in sufficient supply, and distributed in a timely and equitable manner around the globe. Businesses, especially the pharmaceutical industry, must live up to their human rights responsibilities and make every effort to ensure that vaccines are affordable and accessible to the maximum number of people worldwide. 
“To this end, Amnesty International urges states and businesses to work together to ensure that intellectual property rules do not prevent any countries from upholding the right to health. This includes agreeing to a temporary ‘waiver’ on certain aspects of the TRIPS agreement for the production of COVID-19 health products, and joining the WHO’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), a shared platform for knowledge and technology that aims to increase global supply of vaccines.” 
Background 
The UN Human Rights Council resolution, Ensuring equitable, affordable, timely, and universal access by all countries to vaccines in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, adopted by consensus in Geneva today, also requests that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare a report on the issue and creates further space for discussion at the UN Human Rights Council.

As many journalists who document police crackdowns in Belarus have been imprisoned, Amnesty International is calling on diplomatic representatives in the country to monitor the protests and live-stream events, using their diplomatic immunity to expose expected police violence. The organization also calls on all businesses operating in Belarus to conduct urgent human rights due diligence to ensure they do not cause or contribute to human rights violations in the country.  
“The authorities in Belarus have indicated clearly enough that they are prepared and have every intention of turning Freedom Day protests into yet another scene of appalling violence if they are confronted with protests similar to last year’s. Over the past eight months, the Belarusian government has presided over a human rights crisis marked by mass arbitrary arrests, imprisonment of journalists, unlawful use of force during protests, and torture and killing of peaceful protesters. The message from the top in Belarus is clear: any exercise of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly or expression will be ruthlessly crushed. The world cannot stand by in the face of these threats,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director.  
“World leaders should urge their diplomatic representatives in Belarus to monitor protests on 25 March and to live-stream events. International representatives can tell the stories for which Belarusian journalists have been imprisoned for sharing. It is essential that the abuses unfolding in Belarus continue to be exposed.  
“We also call on international businesses to ensure they do not become involved in any future human rights violations by the Belarusian authorities, by taking concrete action to mitigate any risks. For example, businesses whose services may be used to restrict the free flow of information in Belarus should take steps to effectively prevent such abuses. If telecom companies are unable to prevent internet or mobile coverage shutdown, they should mitigate adverse impacts to the extent possible, for instance by informing users in advance, limiting the duration and geographic spread of the disruption, and finding ways to reduce impact on the most vulnerable and essential services such as hospitals.  
“Solidarity with the Belarusian people requires firm, targeted action from the international community.”    
Amnesty International is closely monitoring the situation in Belarus. On 25 March Amnesty activists around the world will hold protests outside Belarusian embassies and share messages of solidarity with peaceful protesters.  
Background  
Thursday 25 March, known as Freedom Day, is an unofficial public holiday marking Belarus’ 1918 declaration of independence. This year, it is expected to be marked with nationwide protests. Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Belarus’s exiled leading opposition figure, has called for global solidarity with Belarusians on this day.   
Meanwhile law enforcement and government figures have made alarming statements indicating the possibility of a violent response. Belarus’ Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Mikalai Karpenkau described the expected protesters as “fascist henchmen” and promised to “deal with them” in a way “already worked out” – a reference to the months-long crackdown which has seen protesters beaten, detained, tortured and arrested en masse. In January, a leaked audio recording appeared to show Karpenkau telling his subordinates to disregard international human rights law when dealing with protesters, condoning shooting protesters in the head and other vital organs with rubber bullets.  
On 9 March, the Chair of the State Security Committee (KDB), Ivan Tsertsel, declared during a meeting with President Alyaksandr Lukashenka that “specific persons” are planning actions “to destabilize” the situation in the country on 25 March. Tsertsel also said that “fugitives” and “foreign special services” were behind the planned protests. Starting in late 2020, Tsertsel was quoted in the media promising “harsh” responses to protests in Spring 2021, also stating that the authorities were preparing “for a hot war.”    
During the crackdown on peaceful protests that started on 9 August 2020, Belarusian police have used rubber bullets, stun grenades, chemical irritants, water cannons and other less lethal weapons against peaceful protesters, resulting in at least four deaths and countless serious injuries. More than 30,000 demonstrators have been detained and scores of women and men have been subjected to torture and other ill treatment. At least one person is known to have died in detention. To date, criminal proceedings have not been instigated against a single police officer in connection with these alleged violations.

“Speaking with one voice today, the UN Human Rights Council has sent a clear and unequivocal message to the Myanmar military that they must halt their violations, and to businesses with ties to military-owned companies in Myanmar that they must end those partnerships immediately.  
“UN member states have tasked the UN human rights office to investigate the economic interests and business ties of the Myanmar military, and report back to the Human Rights Council with a comprehensive report and recommendations.   
“Now it remains for the UN Security Council to move beyond statements of concern, and take the long-overdue action needed to halt violations and hold perpetrators to account.   
“We urge all members of the Security Council to set aside politics and stand with the people of Myanmar – and not the generals ordering daily killing sprees against peaceful protesters, bystanders and political opponents. The Security Council must urgently refer the situation to the International Criminal Court and impose, without further delay, a comprehensive global arms embargo and targeted financial sanctions on senior military officials responsible for atrocity crimes.  
“As the military further escalates its all-out assault, the people of Myanmar cannot wait another day for justice.”   
Background  
On 24 March, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar by consensus.  
In September 2019, the former Independent International Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) on Myanmar presented a detailed report to the UN Human Rights Council on the economic interests of the Myanmar military, in which they identified businesses with commercial ties to the military-owned Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Limited and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEHL and MEC).   
The resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council today recalls the recommendation made by the FFM that no company active in Myanmar or with business links to Myanmar should do business with the Tatmadaw or one of their business entities, until and unless those businesses are restructured and transformed.  
The resolution also mandates the UN human rights office to follow up on the findings and recommendations of the FFM’s 2019 report on the economic interests of the military, and to report back to the Human Rights Council on a regular basis and to deliver a comprehensive written report in September 2022.   
The resolution renews the important mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, and puts in place more comprehensive and regular monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation on the ground, by the Special Rapporteur and the UN human rights office. Both actors have been asked to keep the Human Rights Council and “other United Nations bodies,” including the Security Council, updated.  
Amnesty International’s Military Ltd. report, published in September 2020, demonstrates how a number of the international and local companies identified in the FFM’s report have been linked to the financing of Myanmar’s military units implicated in crimes under international law. Since then, the Myanmar military (individual members and units of which are shareholders of MEHL) has been involved in the commission of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law following the military coup of 1 February 2021.   
Many of the companies that Amnesty International and the FFM urged to end business ties with MEHL have not yet done so, including South Korean steelmaker POSCO and Chinese Wanbao Mining, which continue to operate in Myanmar in partnership with the military.

0,Sri Lanka: Landmark UN resolution marks crucial turning point on justice and accountability,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/sri-lanka-landmark-un-resolution-marks-crucial-turning-point-justice-and-accountability/,"A new UN resolution on Sri Lanka is an important step forward and offers renewed hope of long-awaited justice for victims of the country’s 30-year civil conflict, said Amnesty International, following its adoption by the Human Rights Council (UNHRC)...","A new UN resolution on Sri Lanka is an important step forward and offers renewed hope of long-awaited justice for victims of the country’s 30-year civil conflict, said Amnesty International, following its adoption by the Human Rights Council (UNHRC) today.  
The resolution not only ramps up international monitoring and scrutiny of the human rights situation in Sri Lanka, but also mandates the UN human rights office to collect, consolidate and preserve evidence for future prosecutions and make recommendations to the international community on steps they can make to deliver on justice and accountability.  
“This is a significant move by the Human Rights Council, which signals a shift in approach by the international community. Years of support and encouragement to Sri Lanka to pursue justice at the national level achieved nothing. This resolution should send a clear message to perpetrators of past and current crimes that they cannot continue to act with impunity,” said Hilary Power, Amnesty International’s representative to the UN in Geneva.  
“While an important first step, the real impact of further monitoring and reporting will rely on other UN member states using the resolution as a basis for concrete action, including investigations and prosecutions under universal jurisdiction and a possible referral to the International Criminal Court.”  
The resolution was adopted in light of what the UN human rights chief described as “insurmountable barriers for victims to access justice” at national level, and the “inability and unwillingness” of the Government to prosecute and punish perpetrators of crimes under international law.  
The resolution comes in the wake of damning reports by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Amnesty International and others, condemning Sri Lanka’s ongoing refusal to address historic crimes and expressing alarm over the deteriorating outlook for human rights in the country.  
As the resolution was being negotiated in Geneva, Sri Lanka continued to issue blanket denials and reject the findings and legitimacy of the UN report. In the meantime, at home the authorities continued to prove the concerns valid, passing new regulations that target minorities.  
“We urge Sri Lanka to engage constructively with the OHCHR, to implement the recommendations of the report and to allow full and unfettered access to the country. Failing this, the Human Rights Council may take more robust action, including the establishment of an independent accountability mechanism,” said Hilary Power.  
Background  
Today’s resolution was adopted by a vote, called by China and Pakistan. The resolution was led by Canada, Germany, Malawi, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and the United Kingdom.   
In February 2020, the Sri Lankan government withdrew from the UN Human Rights Council’s landmark resolution 30/1, which the previous government had co-sponsored, to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights in the country.  
Amnesty International estimates that more than 60,000 people disappeared during Sri Lanka’s 30-year civil conflict. Consecutive UN investigations have found credible allegations of violations and abuses of international human rights and international humanitarian law by both sides, particularly during the final phase of the conflict. See here for further information.   
The resolution responds to an OHCHR report released in January, which warned that Sri Lanka’s persistent failure to address historic crimes is giving way to ‘clear early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation and a significantly heightened risk of future violations,’ and made concrete recommendations for “preventive action” for the Human Rights Council, including enhanced monitoring and reporting, and the collection and preservation of evidence, which have been mandated by this resolution.   
Prior to the UNHRC session, Amnesty International published an assessment of the situation in Sri Lanka, setting out clear expectations for UNHRC action. Amnesty International also released a report in February, Old ghosts in new garb: Sri Lanka’s return to fear, which details the authorities’ renewed crackdown on dissent and obstruction of efforts to deliver justice for conflict-era crimes, and a statement in March around the worrying trend of increased marginalization and targeting of Sri Lanka’s Muslim community.

In a letter to FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Amnesty called on FIFA to live up to its responsibilities to prevent, mitigate and remedy human rights risks connected to the tournament, and to “use the full extent of its influence” to urge Qatar to fulfil its programme of labour reforms before the World Cup kicks off.   
Qatar has made a number of positive reforms in recent years, partly in response to increased scrutiny after the World Cup contract was awarded, but too often these are not properly implemented and thousands of migrant workers continue to be exploited and abused. Recently Qatar’s Shura Council, an advisory body, put forward a set of recommendations which, if accepted by the government, would undo much of the progress brought about by reforms, including by re-imposing restrictions on the rights of workers to change jobs and leave the country.    
“This World Cup simply would not be possible without migrant workers, who comprise 95 per cent of Qatar’s workforce. From stadiums and roads to hospitality and security, the tournament depends on the hard work of men and women who have travelled thousands of miles to provide for their families. But too often, these workers still find that their time in Qatar is defined by abuse and exploitation,” said Steve Cockburn, Head of Economic and Social Justice at Amnesty International.  
“As the World Cup organizing body, FIFA has a responsibility under international standards to mitigate human rights risks arising from the tournament. This includes risks to workers in industries like hospitality and transport, which have expanded massively to facilitate the delivery of the games. This week’s qualifiers are a reminder that the window for FIFA to influence Qatar is closing – it must act now to ensure that the 2022 World Cup is a tournament to be proud of, and not one tainted by labour abuses.”  
Workers suffering to make World Cup possible  
When FIFA decided to hold the World Cup in Qatar, it knew – or should have known – that there were inherent human rights risks, due to the country’s heavy reliance on migrant workers and its exploitative labour system. Consequently, FIFA knew, or ought to have known, that migrants working in all sectors related to the delivery of the World Cup, whether directly linked to official sites or not, would suffer to make it possible.  
On 15 March, Amnesty wrote to FIFA and called on it to live up to its international human rights responsibilities. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, FIFA must ensure human rights are respected in the organization and delivery of the World Cup, including by carrying out its own independent and regular monitoring of World Cup projects and venues, and conducting due diligence to identify and prevent any human rights abuses associated with the tournament. Crucially, FIFA also has a responsibility to ensure that all harms suffered by workers on World Cup-related projects to date are properly remedied, in cooperation with the Qatari authorities and other relevant stakeholders.   
“FIFA must use its voice to urge Qatar to urgently implement and enforce existing reforms, and to reject proposals to strip workers of their newly gained rights,” said Steve Cockburn.  
Call for football fans to add their voices  
Amnesty acknowledges the steps FIFA has taken in recent years to live up to its responsibilities, including by establishing its 2017 Human Rights Policy and a joint FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Sustainability Strategy in October 2019. FIFA has pledged to leave “a legacy of world class standards and practices for workers in Qatar and internationally”, but the continued prevalence of serious labour abuses shows there is much to be done.   
For example, in 2020 FIFA told Amnesty International that the “day-to-day due diligence” of construction workers’ rights is carried out by the Supreme Committee, the government body overseeing the Qatar World Cup.  
This hands-off approach was shown to be deeply insufficient when Amnesty found that construction workers on the €770m Al Bayt Stadium had worked for up to seven months without pay. The Supreme Committee had known about this for nearly a year, but FIFA admitted that it was unaware, demonstrating why FIFA needs to be far more diligent in independently monitoring World Cup sites.   
Several Amnesty International offices around the world are now calling on football supporters to sign a petition, urging FIFA to do more to help transform conditions for the workers making the tournament possible. Amnesty International offices in 27 countries also wrote to their national football associations in November 2020, urging them to play an active role in ensuring the rights of migrant workers.  
Meanwhile concerns over ongoing human rights issues in Qatar have been growing among football supporter groups in a number of countries, with some calling for a boycott.  
“FIFA must take the concerns of the footballing community seriously and take concrete action. FIFA  has an opportunity to help leave Qatar a better place for migrant workers, but the clock is ticking,” said Steve Cockburn.  
“FIFA and Qatar must put in place a robust plan of action to ensure the migrant workers across all sectors associated with the World Cup have been paid properly, treated fairly, and are free from the control of exploitative employers.”

“The spurious and dangerous rationale put forward by the Turkish authorities for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention by attempting to connect this appalling decision with LGBTI community adds insult to injury. 
“Rather than attacking LGBTI people and withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention, the government should instead re-double efforts to ensure LGBTI people, women and children are protected from violence and abuse.

“We call on Turkish authorities to immediately reverse its retrogressive decision to withdraw from the Convention, and to take action to protect and promote the rights of LGBTI people, women and girls. We further urge the authorities to ensure that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression of all those protesting – including LGBTI people and women – are fully respected and protected.”

Canada’s Order in...","One year after enacting a measure to ban refugee claimants from crossing into Canada from the US in response to COVID-19, Amnesty International is disappointed that Canada continues to violate its international legal obligations by successively renewing anti-refugee measures. Canada’s Order in Council adopting the measure is contrary to the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibits states from transferring individuals to a place where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations. 
On March 20, 2020, Canada adopted a general ban on entering Canada from the United States for the purpose of seeking asylum. The federal government subsequently introduced some limited exceptions to the general ban, including for US citizens, stateless persons and minor refugee claimants. In October 2020, Canada opened the border to broad categories of citizens, permanent residents, students, workers, and professional athletes, but continued to exclude refugee claimants entering from the US – a policy that remains in place to date. 
“There is no justification for Canada continuing to violate its international legal obligations to refugee claimants by turning them away,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada. “Almost six months after Canada opened the border to broad categories of other travellers, the government has given no explanation why refugee claimants cannot be treated like everyone else. Refugee travel is, by definition, essential.” 
According to media reports, there are at least eight cases of people who have been subjected to the border ban and who were detained upon return to the USA, and at least one person has been subsequently deported from the US by American authorities.   
The border measure has been renewed 16 times, without parliamentary oversight. The most recent version of the Order in Council is valid until March 21, 2021. According to official guidance authored by the UNHCR, “denial of access to territory without safeguards to protect against refoulement cannot be justified on the grounds of any health risk.”

The organization spoke to parents who have been completely cut off from their children – some as young as five years old – and cannot return to China due to the threat of being sent to a “re-education” internment camp. 
“China’s ruthless mass detention campaign in Xinjiang has put separated families in an impossible situation: children are not allowed to leave, but their parents face persecution and arbitrary detention if they attempt to return home to care for them,” said Alkan Akad, Amnesty International’s China Researcher. 
“The heartbreaking testimonies of the parents we spoke to only scratches the surface of the scale of suffering endured by Uyghur families separated from their children. The Chinese government must end its heartless policies in Xinjiang and ensure that families can be reunited as quickly as possible without fear of being sent to an oppressive camp.” 
Amnesty International interviewed six exiled Uyghur families currently residing in Australia, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. The families, who left China prior to the intensification of the crackdown against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in 2017, had not dreamed that their children would be prevented from joining them. 
Since 2017, an estimated one million or more people have been arbitrarily detained in so-called “transformation-through-education” or “vocational training” centres in Xinjiang, where they have been subjected to various forms of torture and ill-treatment, including political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation. 
“Uyghurs overseas often hesitate to publicly talk about human rights abuses against them and their families due to fear of repercussions for their relatives back in China. In spite of such challenges, these parents have decided to publicly share their stories in the hope that it will help them reunite with their children soon,” said Alkan Akad. 
Children make perilous journey in attempt to reach Italy 
Parents Mihriban Kader and Ablikim Memtinin fled from Xinjiang to Italy in 2016 after being harassed by police and pressured to give up their passports. 
They left four children in the temporary care of grandparents, but soon afterwards the grandmother was taken to a camp, while the grandfather was interrogated by police. 
“Our other relatives didn’t dare to look after my children after what had happened to my parents,” Mihriban told Amnesty International. “They were afraid that they would be sent to camps, too.” 
The three youngest children were sent to an “orphan camp”: facilities set up across Xinjiang to house – and indoctrinate – children whose parents have been forced into internment camps, prison and other detention facilities. The eldest child was placed in a boarding school subjected to surveillance and monitoring. 
Mihriban and Ablikim were unable to contact them from Italy, but in November 2019 they received a permit from the Italian government to bring their children to join them. 
The four children – aged between 12 and 16 – travelled alone across China to the Italian consulate in Shanghai, but they were seized by police and sent back to the orphanage and boarding school. 
“Now my children are in the hands of the Chinese government and I am not sure I will be able to meet them again in my lifetime,” Mihriban said. “The thing that hurts most is that, to my children, it’s as if their parents don’t exist anymore; as if we passed away and they are orphaned.” 
In another case, Omer and Meryem Faruh fled to Turkey in late 2016 after police demanded they hand over their passports. They left their two youngest children, aged five and six, with grandparents because they did not yet have their own travel documents. Omer and Meryem later found out their relatives had been taken to camps, and they have received no word about their children since. 
“We haven’t heard the voices of our daughters for the last 1,594 days,” Omer told Amnesty International. “My wife and I cry only at night, trying to hide our sorrow from our other kids here with us.” 
Access for human rights monitors vital 
Alkan Akad said: “The tragedy of family separation in Xinjiang exposes the inhumanity of China’s efforts to control and indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups in the name of ‘countering terrorism’. 
“China must end the measures that restrict the rights of all Muslim minorities to freely leave and return to the country. It must close all political ‘re-education camps’ and release detainees immediately, unconditionally and without prejudice.” 
Amnesty International is calling on the Chinese government to provide full and unrestricted access to Xinjiang for UN human rights experts, independent researchers and journalists to conduct investigations about what is happening in the region. 
Meanwhile, the organization urges other governments to do everything they can to ensure that Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Chinese ethnic minorities resident in their countries are provided with assistance in trying to locate, contact, and reunite with their children.

The organization is...","Prisoners around the world have been forgotten during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new report from Amnesty International, as prisons have faced systemic challenges to prevent the spread of the virus, with control measures leading to serious human rights violations. The organization is calling for the millions of people languishing in overcrowded cells to be included in national vaccination roll-outs. 
Forgotten Behind Bars: COVID-19 and Prisons reveals that, with more than 11 million estimated people imprisoned globally, prisons in many countries risk becoming hotbeds for the disease. Many inmates struggle to access soap, proper sanitation, or personal protective equipment, while physical distancing is difficult to achieve and only limited health care is available. 
“As COVID-19 continues to rip through prisons across the world, measures introduced by governments to prevent the spread of the disease have led to human rights violations, including the use of excessive solitary confinement to aid social distancing and inadequate measures to reduce the detrimental effects of isolation,” said Netsanet Belay, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director. 
The full scale of COVID-19 infections and related deaths in prisons is hard to assess as governments have failed to publicly provide up-to-date, reliable information. However, available data indicates worrying patterns of COVID-19 infections in prisons across the world. And as vaccine roll-out strategies and plans take shape, many governments remain silent on their plans to vaccinate prisoners who are particularly at risk. 
Dangerous and unabated overcrowding 
Overcrowding is widely recognized as one of the most serious problems in prisons today. Around 102 countries have reported prison occupancy levels of over 110%, with a significant proportion of prisoners charged with, or convicted of, non-violent crimes. 
Though steps have been taken to release eligible prisoners, Amnesty International’s research indicates that current release rates are insufficient to address the huge risk posed by the virus. 
“Many countries with dangerously high levels of prison overcrowding, such as Bulgaria, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nepal, have failed to address concerns over COVID-19 outbreaks. In other countries, such as Iran and Turkey, hundreds of prisoners detained arbitrarily, including human rights defenders, were excluded from COVID-19-related releases,” said Netsanet Belay. 
Health crisis 
COVID-19 has also laid bare the years of underinvestment in, and neglect of, health services in prisons. Prison authorities have been unable or unwilling to cope with the increased need for preventive health measures and medical services for prisoners. During the early phases of the pandemic, Amnesty International found prisoners in many countries were unable to get a COVID-19 test due to acute shortages, while some detainees in Iran and Turkey were arbitrarily denied medical treatment. 
Countries including Cambodia, France, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Togo and the USA were also unable to put in place adequate preventive and protective measures in prisons to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
“No matter who you are, or where you are, people deserve access to face masks, adequate quantities of soap, sanitizing items and clean running water,” said Netsanet Belay. “In prisons, especially, personal protective equipment needs to be provided free of charge and governments need to increase access to COVID-19 testing and treatments to prevent and manage potential outbreaks.” 
Control measures resulting in abuses 
In many countries, prison authorities have resorted to dangerous measures including excessive and abusive confinement and quarantining measures to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, leading to serious human rights violations. In some places such as Argentina and the UK, detainees were put in isolation for up to 23 hours per day, often for weeks or months. 
“Excessive and abusive isolation and quarantine measures were used to contain the spread of COVID-19 in some prisons around the world. In some cases, these could amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Humane measures to protect prisoners must be put in place now,” said Netsanet Belay. 
Some COVID-19-related lockdown measures in prisons also impacted family visits, increasing the risks to detainees’ mental and physical wellbeing. In some instances, these sparked widespread protests and unrest in prisons, to which authorities often responded with excessive force. 
“While some prison authorities have retained visits by adapting conditions, others have resorted to banning visitors, effectively depriving detainees from their lifeline to the outside world and undermining their emotional and physical wellbeing,” said Netsanet Belay. 
Prioritizing vaccination of people in detention 
At least 71 countries have now put in place a vaccination policy for at least one clinically vulnerable group. While some of these countries have included prison populations and staff among the priority groups to receive vaccines, Amnesty International’s research found that many others, including higher-income countries, are either silent or remain unclear on their plans. 
“Prisons are some of the most at-risk settings for COVID-19 outbreaks and we cannot neglect the right to health of people in prisons any longer. Lack of clarity about vaccination plans, policies and treatment of incarcerated populations is a pressing, global concern,” said Netsanet Belay. “As vaccine roll-out strategies take shape, a failure to prioritize the health of people in detention will have catastrophic consequences for prisoners, their families and the public health care system.”  
Amnesty International is calling on states not to discriminate against those held in detention when developing vaccination policies and plans. Furthermore, it urges states to make every effort to prioritize prisoners in their national vaccination plans, particularly given that their confined conditions do not allow them to physically distance, and ensure that those at particularly high risk of COVID-19 (such as older prisoners and those with chronic health conditions) are prioritized for vaccination on a par with comparative groups in the general population.

“This morning, an entire community and nation are waking up traumatized because of yet another hate-fueled mass shooting. We are witnessing the results of what happens when racist and misogynistic ideologies collide in a society where there is also easy access to guns. This isn’t just trauma — it stands as a blatant assault of the human rights of women, of Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), and their allies.  
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have heard politicians using xenophobic slurs against AAPI people and scapegoating them for the spread of the virus, with crimes against people of Asian descent increasing during this time. We have seen similar hate spread against women, and against Jewish, Muslim, Black, and immigrant communities, and people of color, time and time again leading to violence often perpetrated by white supremacists who have taken those words as marching orders. 
“According to data from Stop AAPI Hate, 3,800 incidents of hate directed at Asian Americans were reported over the course of roughly a year during the pandemic- significantly higher than the prior year. Women were 2.3 times more likely than men to report hate incidents. Nationally, a 2019 study by Mother Jones found that in at least 22 mass shootings since 2011, the perpetrators specifically targeted women, had stalked or harassed women, or had a history of domestic violence. 
“We demand that elected officials forcefully denounce violence against women and hate crimes against AAPI people, and that the perpetrator of the shootings will be held accountable. This incident also is a stark reminder of the need for the U.S. government and Congress in particular to take meaningful steps to curb the human rights crisis that is gun violence in this country and ensure those who shouldn’t possess weapons can’t access them. 
“We can no longer accept the silence and inaction of lawmakers — guns should not be prioritized over the lives of people. Violence against women and hate against the AAPI community must stop immediately. We stand with the AAPI community, and with all those working to stop gender-based violence, and call upon our leaders to join us in the fight to pass meaningful legislation to end the cycle of gun violence.”

Responding to this weekend’s excessive clampdown on peaceful protests and the passage of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in Parliament over the next two days, Kate Allen, Director of Amnesty International UK, said: 
“No-one could fail to be shocked by the Met Police’s actions at this weekend’s vigil for Sarah Everard. Priti Patel has said that lessons must be learned, yet if MPs vote this week to extend policing powers of protests they will show that they have learnt nothing.   
“The apparent excessive use of force by Met police officers is a stark and timely warning about precisely why Parliament must not allow yet more police powers to quash peaceful protest. 
“The proposals being rushed through put enormous and unprecedented powers in the hands of the state to effectively ban even peaceful protests. If that happens, scenes like those this weekend will become more common. 
“The UK cherishes its self-image as a place of liberty which values our rights to expression and assembly.  We mustn’t let the Government take this away.”

We removed the image as soon as the mistake was identified, and we have been in conversations with the individual to make redress and promote grassroots community organizations that the individual works with. The apology letter can be read here. 
We encourage our members and supporters to visit the Dashmaawaan Bemaadzinjin website and fundraiser to learn more, support and get involved in the work they do in their community. 
Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin came about as a community-based Indigenous food sovereignty support effort in June of 2020 to provide healthy, whole, fresh, and traditional foods to local Elders and Indigenous folks that are houseless and living in the encampments in Toronto.  Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin honours the right to nourishment for all Indigenous people, focusing not only on food but also on wellness and community connections and recognize that Indigenous food sovereignty is about more than making sure that people are fed, and that they have opportunities to thrive and honour their spirits whenever possible. Gathering around food, ceremony and celebration has always been important to Indigenous peoples, even more so now because of the impact of colonization and years of not being able to practice their traditions. 
Through their efforts, Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin has provided over 1000 meals and connections with Indigenous Elders in Toronto since July of 2020, which have included traditional meats, fishes, grains, vegetables, and medicines. What started as a weekly event of bringing pow wow dancing, drumming and traditional meals to elders at their housing complex has turned into a full-scale weekly meal drop-off program for them. The weekly mini powwows were done from a distance, allowing the elders to eat, listen and enjoy. Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin did this in response to Elders being isolated and needing creative ways to provide community connections.  
The Initiative recognizes food is one of the most important traditions as Indigenous peoples and that maintaining Elders’ access to traditional food is a natural link to the land and their relationship to it.  Many of these Elders are not only residential school and child welfare survivors, but also of the Indian Day School and the Indian Hospital Systems and today, because of the lack of access to resources, they are not able to eat whole, healthy foods when they want, and rarely have access to traditional foods, like deer, moose meat, lake fish, and wild rice. These foods bring back memories of home for many. 
Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin has provided 2000 meals to Indigenous people in the encampments and on the streets since June of last year. The memories of home and the connection to community are medicine, and each Sunday, when they prepare a feast for houseless people (rain or shine), Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin gathers and honours them, their spirits, and their lives. Many of them are elders who have lived houseless for most of their time in urban centres like Toronto. 
Current Partnerships 
1.  ENAGB Indigenous Youth Agency and Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin are currently developing a vital partnership to grow connections and opportunities for the Elders in our community. Dashmaawaan Bemadzinjin is excited to partner with ENAGB Indigenous Youth Agency on The Maawnjidime (Let us Gather) Youth and Elder Program, working together to support our elders and youth to mentor and learn from each other. Dashmaawaan Bemaadzinjin believes that our Elders and teachings are at the centre of all they do and that the concept of “feeding our people” is about honouring and nourishing all elements of self. By connecting elders and youth, Dashmawaan Bemadzinjin creates an opportunity for intergenerational knowledge to be passed down and understood and an opportunity for personal connections and growth amongst those who participate. 
2.  Toronto Indigenous Harm Reduction and Dashmaawaan Bemaadzimjin partner weekly to host feasts for Indigenous Houseless people in the city, living in the encampments and on the streets. Dashmawaan Bemadzinjin has been working together since June of 2020 to do this work and provides an additional hot, traditional meal for Indigenous people one day each week. 
3.  Toronto Fort York Museum and Dashmaawaan Bemaadzinjin are partnering to make commercial kitchen space available to prepare and provide meal bags for our Elders program. The hope is also to expand into developing space at Fort York for an urban Indigenous garden for Indigenous elders and people living on the streets and in encampments. 
4. Wiigwamen Terrace Elders Housing Complex Meal Bag Program – Dashmaawaan Bemaadzinjin provides meal bags at Wiigwamen Terrace for up to 80 elders weekly, with nutritious, healthy, whole, traditional ingredients. Each bag takes care of 5 days of dinners, lunches, breakfast, snacks, and leftovers. This is a unique service provided to our elders that fills a gap in their ability to have good food. 
TAKE ACTION!!

The request for justice will be handed to the Acting Governor, Claudio Castro, and the Attorney General of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Luciano Mattos. 
Known for organizing street mobilizations with activists, Amnesty International Brazil opted for a mobile action, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The act “Voices for Marielle and Anderson” will be heard throughout the streets of Rio de Janeiro, also on March 12th. A truck carrying a LED panel will circulate in key points of the city (the site of Marielle’s murder; in front of Guanabara Palace, headquarters of Rio’s State Government; and in front of the State Attorney for Rio de Janeiro, besides others) announcing the message: “Three years is too much time without answers! We demand justice for Marielle and Anderson.” Amnesty International Brazil brought together more than 10 different languages in messages coming from countries such as Germany, Spain, France, Sweden, Portugal, Ukraine, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Mongolia, Taiwan, New Zealand, and others. 
“Amnesty International Brazil has been crying out for justice since the beginning of the case. Three years is far too long without knowing who ordered Marielle’s killing and why. Our mobilization demanding justice has crossed Brazil’s borders and gained support from thousands of people around the world. Like us, they take the injustice against Marielle and Anderson personally and come together to demand that the case be resolved definitively and that the commanders and perpetrators be arrested, prosecuted, and held accountable,” says Jurema Werneck, Executive Director of Amnesty International Brazil. 
The Marielle Franco case completes three years on Sunday, March 14, and so far the commanders of the crime have not yet been discovered, and those accused of participating in the deaths have not yet been tried by the Trials Court. Amnesty International Brazil monitors this delay in the resolution of the crimes with great concern. 
“In Brazil and the world, human rights defenders are still threatened, persecuted and murdered. Our country is the third most dangerous country for defenders of human rights and the environment. States must guarantee the security and freedom of action of individuals who fight for human rights and ensure that when their rights are threatened or violated, serious, unbiased, and effective investigations are carried out and lead to the proper identification and trial of the perpetrators. Impunity cannot be the answer to Marielle’s brutal murder. Amnesty International also believes that it is past time for Brazilian authorities to show transparency, enabling society to know and assess the weaknesses, limitations and successes of this investigation so that justice can be expected. Impunity must not be the message sent by Rio de Janeiro and the country to families, to rights defenders, to Brazilian society and to the world.” 
Hearings on the Case  
Amnesty International Brazil and the Marielle Franco Institute sent requests for online hearings to the Acting Governor, Claudio Castro, and to the Attorney General of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Luciano Mattos. These requests also mark the acts on the third anniversary of the murder of councillor and human rights defender Marielle Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes. Both Amnesty and the Institute hope that a line of dialogue is established between the victims’ families and their representatives with the newly innaugurated officers of the state of Rio de Janeiro, and that authorities finally share what measures they have taken for the resolution of the case. This will be the first time Amnesty International Brazil and the families of Marielle and Anderson meet with the State of Rio de Janeiro’s new Governor and Attorney General. 
“Failure to solve this crime sends a clear message from official authorities to Brazilians and the world, that violations against human rights defenders are allowed in Brazil. Demanding justice for Marielle means not accepting that other murders of human rights defenders go unpunished. The Acting Governor, Claudio Castro, and the Attorney General of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Luciano Mattos, must show transparency and inform Brazilian society and the global community about what they did along the last year to guarantee justice for Marielle,” explains Jurema Werneck. 
Marielle and Other Human Rights Defenders 
On March 14th, exactly three years after Marielle’s killing, Amnesty International Brazil will release a video in its official social media profiles. Narrated by actress Taís Araújo, who kindly offered her voice for the project, Marielle’s struggle will be remembered along with the story of 11 other women human rights defenders. 
Among the defenders chosen for the film are women of our time such as quilombola Sandra Maria Andrade and the mothers who struggle for justice for their children killed by State agents, like Débora Maria da Silva, Fátima Pinho, Maria Dalva Correia da Silva, and Rute Fiuza Silva. The video will also include Chelsea Manning, gender equality and information security advocate, a former transexual  officer of the US Army. Jani Silva, defender of the Amazon, who became known worldwide during the 2020 Write for Rights Campaign, is also honoured for her defense of the environment in Colombia. Two other environmentalists are also revered: Dorothy Stang, defender of the right to land in the Brazilian Amazon, murdered on February 12, 2005, and Berta Cárceres, indigenous leader from Honduras, murdered on March 2, 2014. Both were killed for not silencing their voices in the face of injustice in their territories. Also included are the more recent advocates and young activists Malala Yousafzai and Greta Thunberg, who are revolutionizing the struggle for the right to education and against the climate crisis. And finally Anielle Franco, Marielle’s sister and Executive Director of the Marielle Franco Institute. 
“The barriers that human rights defenders have to overcome are still enormous. We gathered a variety of women in this video to show that each one of them has the drive, the engagement, the joy and the hope that we saw in Marielle’s actions and speeches. As a global movement and through the strength of these women, Amnesty International will continue to expose injustice, fighting for the rights of all those who struggle to make our world more diverse, inclusive and fair,” states Jurema.

“Turkish authorities must release Kavala and Demirtaş, allow human rights defenders to do their work and stop putting undue pressure on their judges. It is high time that states across Europe tell Turkey that prosecuting and imprisoning people for political reasons is unacceptable.

Since peaceful protests...","It’s time for the UN Security Council to overcome its veto-paralysis and push for accountability for ongoing violations to ensure perpetrators of these crimes are held accountable, said Amnesty International, ahead of the 10-year anniversary of the crisis on 15 March. 
Since peaceful protests began in Damascus in 2011, Syrian government forces, and later armed opposition groups, with the support of their allies, have subjected millions of civilians to unlawful ground and air attacks, widespread and systematic arbitrary detention, torture leading to deaths in detention, enforced disappearance, sieges leading to starvation, and forced displacement. 
Over the past decade, Russia and China have vetoed UN Security Council resolutions to deter violations in Syria at least 15 times. 
“Members of the UN Security Council have the power and the mandate to help the people of Syria. Instead, they have completely failed them. Ten years on, perpetrators of horrific violations, including crimes against humanity and war crimes, continue to inflict immense suffering on civilians as they evade justice,” said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“Russia and China have repeatedly abused their veto powers to restrict the provision of life-saving cross-border humanitarian aid, to stop a referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, and to block resolutions that would impose arms embargoes or targeted sanctions against individuals on all sides responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity.” 
Russia, as well as Iran and Turkey, have also lent their backing to parties to the conflict responsible for atrocities in Syria, enabling them to continue to commit abuses. Russia and the USA have also directly participated in the armed conflict; Russia conducted unlawful attacks alongside the government of Syria, and the USA led the coalition that fought against the Islamic State armed group in Raqqa and other areas, and was also responsible for widespread destruction resulting from unlawful attacks. 
“For far too long, states have shamelessly put political allegiances and interests before the lives of millions of children, women and men– effectively enabling the horror story in Syria to continue with no end in sight,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
“It is high time for the powers backing the forces on the ground to realise that they can’t continue to ignore justice and accountability if there is to be any hope for a safe and dignified future for the Syrian people.” 
Glimmers of hope for justice  
In 2016, following successive failures at the UN Security Council, the UN General Assembly established an international mechanism to investigate and prosecute some of the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria since March 2011. This has offered Syrians the only avenue for justice to date, as it facilitates pursuing cases through national courts under the principle of universal jurisdiction. 
Despite a decade of stagnation, in recent months the first glimmers of hope for justice emerged. Last month a Syrian government official was convicted of crimes against humanity in Germany for the first time. Eyad al-Gharib, a Syrian security officer, was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in prison for his role in aiding and abetting the torture of detained protesters in Damascus. 
On 4 March 2021, Canada requested formal negotiations under the UN Convention Against Torture to hold Syria accountable for human rights violations. The Netherlands made a similar request in 2020. 
“Without justice the cycle of bloodshed and suffering in Syria will continue. A handful of states are leading the way by taking crucial steps towards justice, now it is time for others to follow suit,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
The situation in Syria today remains bleak. Civilians in the north-west of the country, including Idlib, western Aleppo and north-western Hama governorates, face the imminent threat of another wave of hostilities, meanwhile insecurity and continued repression in Daraa and Sweida in southern Syria has led to arrests, enforced disappearances and unlawful killings. 
The Syrian government continues to restrict access of humanitarian aid organizations to areas under its control, exacerbating a desperate economic and humanitarian crisis. In parallel, arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment and abductions continue by armed opposition groups supported by Turkey and Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham in northern Syria. 
A decade of war crimes 
Throughout the conflict both the Syrian government and armed opposition groups have repeatedly committed violations of international humanitarian law. 
Syrian government forces, responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, have carried out unlawful attacks killing and injuring tens of thousands of civilians and damaging civilian facilities including hospitals, schools and homes. They have used imprecise explosive weapons including barrel bombs and internationally banned cluster munitions, and even chemical weapons. 
In some cases, unlawful attacks were carried out by and with support from Russian aircraft. 
The US-led coalition conducted air strikes during a four-month bombing campaign against the Islamic State armed group in Raqqa. The air strikes, some of which violated international humanitarian law, killed and injured hundreds of civilians and destroyed civilian homes and infrastructure. 
The Syrian government has also arbitrarily detained and forcibly disappeared tens of thousands of people for peacefully exercising their rights, including lawyers, human rights defenders, journalists, humanitarian aid workers, and political activists. Detainees are held in inhuman conditions and routinely face torture leading to thousands of deaths in detention. 
Armed opposition groups have also abducted individuals in areas they control subjecting them to torture and other forms of ill-treatment and concealing their whereabouts or fate. 
All parties to the conflict have also carried out unlawful killings.  
Amnesty International continues to call on the Syrian government and all armed opposition groups to immediately release of all those arbitrarily detained and to reveal the fate and whereabouts of all those forcibly disappeared, abducted or otherwise detained, provide unfettered access to independent monitors to all places of detention, and reasonable access for family members and lawyers for detainees. 
The armed group calling itself the Islamic State (IS), Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, and other armed opposition groups supported by Turkey and Gulf states have also committed war crimes and other violations. Coalitions of armed groups supported by Turkey, have carried out unlawful attacks in areas under the control of the Kurdish People’s Protection Units known as the YPG. The YPG, now part of the Syrian Democratic Forces supported by the US, were also responsible for the forced displacement of civilians and demolishing of civilian homes. 
Since the conflict began, tens of thousands of people have been internally displaced and live in camps or building sites in dreadful conditions lacking basic needs such as food and medicine. At least five million have fled the country – mostly to neighbouring countries where they face restrictions on their access to services or aid, leaving many destitute.

Ever since, Bridget has been advocating for police to be held accountable for her death. She runs Families of Sisters in Spirit, a volunteer-run, grassroots initiative supporting the loved ones of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people across Canada. Since 2006, Bridget has been instrumental in organizing a vigil every October 4 on Parliament Hill, bringing together loved ones to honour their stolen mothers, aunties, sisters, and daughters. 
Bridget is one of the grassroots Indigenous advocates at the heart of the movement to end violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit people in Canada. On February 18, 2021, Amnesty International spoke with Bridget about her many years of art, activism, and her guidance for Amnesty International’s supporters. 
Bridget’s wisdom helped to shape the No More Stolen Sisters campaign guide on supporting Indigenous-led activims to end violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls and two-spirit people. 
I’ve been beading for a long, long time since I was a little girl. My parents had separated when I was a baby, when I was one or two years old. I went to live with my dad and his grandmother (Kokomis) Christine. Kokomis Christine, that’s what she did her entire life – sew and bead. She showed us at a very young age. Back 55 years ago, I started beading headbands with a feather. That’s what people liked then. Then it was other things like earrings and slippers and mitts. Eventually I made my own mukluks. 
Kokomis Christine taught us. She said we would never be stuck for food or anything if we knew how to sew or bead and that stuck with me my whole life. I stopped beading for 30 years. As I grew up, I really struggled to cope with my dad’s suicide which happened when I was 11. I partied a lot, had kids very young, and had no money. It was just a very hard time, including losing my mom, Gladys, 20 years ago. Her death is what led me to stop drinking and doing drugs. But the grief and pain at having lost her in such a violent way with no justice or accountability has taken a toll on my health and wellbeing. This long healing journey is what led me back to beading. It was like riding a bike. You don’t forget. And I still do it today. 
My daughter and granddaughter have their own Facebook pages to sell their art and are continuing Kokomis Christine’s legacy of sewing and beading to keep us going. That’s what Kokomis Christine said and it’s true. Any time I’m stuck I can pick up beads or a piece of leather and make whatever I want and sell them. Lots of time, I give them away as well. 
I bead and I think about all our Stolen Sisters. I can just picture all of them wearing these earrings when I make them. A lot of my time, the money that I make goes towards doing stuff for missing and murdered women. The earrings are something to make our women and kin feel good. 
I know the earrings are native and it makes me feel good. I like to bead feathers or eagles. Stuff like that is very important to me. I love eagles. I know they are protectors of us. It gives me my own healing. I am going to teach beading to my great grand-daughter, Ava. This is what my Kokomis Christine wanted. I know she would be very proud of all of us in our family who are continuing. From Kokomis Christine to my great-granddaughter – that’s seven generations! Seven generations of Algonquin women and girls holding onto our traditions and celebrating who we are as First Nations. This makes me proud. 
A lot of feelings go into my beading. You need a lot of patience because those beads are so tiny. It’s so beautiful to see the creation you make after the earring is done. I know I had a lot of patience when I was a young girl and I think that’s why I’m still here today doing what I do for our Stolen Sisters, because I learned to have that patience and to keep moving forward no matter what. It takes time to do this beading. Even one earring takes a couple hours, sometimes longer. There’s a lot of love. When we make these earrings, we put in a love of love. It’s all from the heart. 
October 4 is very special. October 4 was the day the Stolen Sisters report came out in 2004. October 5 is the anniversary of my mother’s death. This year is the 20th anniversary of her death. My mom passed at the age of 61 and I just turned 61 a month ago, so it’s not only her anniversary but I am now the age she was when she passed. 
I met Amnesty a month after the Stolen Sisters report came out. This is when I started to learn more about the Stolen Sisters. I wanted to honour my mother. I didn’t want people to forget her and what happened in her case. I was fighting for justice. I wanted to honour my mother and everybody else. That’s when we started honouring our Stolen Sisters with vigils. We started in 2006 and it’s still going strong today. 
When we started the vigils, I didn’t know how to get family members inside of Parliament, so I said I’d start outside at first but eventually we’ll get in there! At first, I didn’t know how to get our stories inside Parliament. I figured we would start outside and then come inside and that is what happened! They started talking about us and they haven’t stopped! 
Thank you always being there. I knocked on your door and we’ve been walking with each other ever since. 
Contact family members and ask them what help they need. All family members are at a different place in searching for loved ones. There’s some like me that are decades old and some that are just starting fresh. A lot of people don’t know what to do with the information they find on the web. You don’t have time to read the web when someone you love is missing. 
Ask families, contact grassroots organizations, whoever is doing the work in the community. The grassroots organizations are doing the work. Contact youth. We need youth to take over this movement. I don’t want my grandchildren to be fighting this in another 20-30 years. We have been fighting this for so long. 
Lots of violence happens on evenings and weekends and over holidays and it’s hard to get help. Lots of organizations will write letters. Amnesty did more. Writing a letter is not enough. People want answers and people deserve answers. 
Meet people where they are at. Nothing about us without us. 
I do whatever people ask me even if I don’t’ like it, even if I don’t agree with it sometimes, because it’s up to them. 
We’re still here! We never accepted government funding. We accept donations. We help as many as we can. We can’t help everybody, but we help as many as we can with what we have. 
There’s always little things we need help with. We haven’t updated our website in ages. Whatever help people can provide is great. The important thing is to ask people what help they need. 
I just do my little Facebook page and Twitter and emails. I don’t do all that stuff to update websites. There’s a lot of other people in my boat who don’t know much about the internet to make a page for their loved ones, or posting to them, or making a missing persons poster, etc. Often people just send me a picture with the little information they have and I try to do my best to make a poster. 
Share your skills and ask what help is needed. Everybody is in different places. I know it’s hard, but this is the best way to do it. It’s the families that need the help so it’s very important to ask the families what they need. 
It’s getting worse with police killings. That scares me a lot and hurts me a lot. I haven’t seen much except for reports coming out. Other than that there’s not too much change. 
What hurts the most is that on February 14 it was 30 years that the women in the Downtown Eastside [of Vancouver] started marching. I cried because we are still in the same place. Families are still asking for help. I have to help someone every day. It’s hard and it’s worse with COVID-19 because there isn’t so much help we can provide. 
I’ve been in this movement for 20 years. I know it’s super hard and I see the people just starting and it’s hard to stay strong. I know so many give up. I wanted to give up millions of times too. Even today I still want to quit. It hurts like hell. I don’t know about this national action plan. I talk to people and it seems like it will be another five years before we get that national action plan. How many years is it going to take? 
We don’t see action for a long, long time. It’s sad. It’s been 30 years. Something has to be done now. Now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years.

0,COVID-19: Pharmaceutical companies and rich states put lives at risk as vaccine inequality soars,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/covid-19-pharmaceutical-companies-and-rich-states-put-lives-risk-vaccine-inequality-soars/,"Amnesty launches global campaign calling for universal access to COVID-19 vaccines Rich countries have bought up over half the world’s vaccine supply, but represent just 16 per cent of the world’s population Pharmaceutical companies refuse to share knowledge and technology The actions of...","The actions of pharmaceutical companies and rich countries mean that billions of people at risk of COVID-19 are unlikely to receive a single dose of the life-saving vaccines this year, Amnesty International said as it launched a new global campaign calling for universal access to vaccines. 
The campaign – A Fair Shot: Universal Access to COVID-19 Vaccines – calls for pharmaceutical companies to share their knowledge and technology to maximize the number of doses of vaccines available around the globe. It also calls on states to stop engaging in ‘vaccine nationalism’ and work together to ensure that those most at-risk of COVID-19 in all countries can access life-saving COVID-19 vaccines immediately. 
“Who gets access to a COVID-19 vaccine, when, and at what price, are some of the most significant and contested questions facing our societies today. But the answers are being shaped by the interests of powerful states and companies,” said Stephen Cockburn, Head of Economic and Social Justice at Amnesty International 
“So far they’ve created a dangerous situation with global inequalities in vaccine access spiraling out of control. A few rich countries are racing ahead, while the rest of the world struggles to get off the starting line. Everyone deserves a fair shot at a vaccine — when it comes to our right to health, there’s no place for discrimination.”    
Rich countries have bought up over half of the world’s vaccine supply, even though they represent just 16 per cent of the world’s population. The same countries have administered over 60% of the world’s doses so far, while over 100 countries are yet to vaccinate a single person. 
“Nobody should be denied access to health care, including vaccines, because of where they live, who they are, or what they earn. With enough pressure on the right people, we can ensure COVID-19 vaccination systems guarantee human rights,” said Stephen Cockburn. 
Sharing knowledge and technology  
Billions of taxpayers’ money has been spent to help companies like AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer BioNTech to develop and produce vaccines, yet these companies – and others – refuse to share their research, knowledge and technology. This means that other pharmaceutical companies cannot draw upon these advances in science to step up their own vaccine production, which would in turn increase supply, so they are accessible to countries with smaller budgets. 
For example, in May 2020, the World Health Organization set up the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP) so companies could pool data and knowledge, and then license production and technology transfer to other potential producers, with the aim of ensuring people everywhere could access vaccines quicker. Yet so far, not a single pharmaceutical company has joined C-TAP. 
Governments must fulfill their human rights obligations and support a proposal to waive certain provisions of the TRIPS agreement, a global treaty governing intellectual property rights, which often restricts where, when and how medicines are produced. This waiver would lift the enforcement of patents and intellectual property protections that currently create obstacles for additional manufacturers to produce more COVID-19 vaccines. However, while it is supported by the vast majority of low- and middle-income countries, it is opposed by the wealthy ones. 
As some states refuse to hold vaccine producers to account on their human rights responsibility to extend COVID-19 vaccine access to the maximum number of people, deep divides and inequalities between countries and communities have only become further exposed. And it’s those most at risk who are suffering as some countries and pharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize bilateral deals over ensuring that all people in every country have a fair shot at COVID-19 vaccines. 
“As we mark the one-year anniversary of the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot stand by and watch this tragedy unfold when we have solutions on the table,” said Tamaryn Nelson, Amnesty International’s Health Advisor. “Amid governments’ race to vaccinate their own populations entirely first and the pharmaceutical industry’s tight grip on its patents, we’re forgetting that people’s lives are at stake. No one is safe until we’re all safe.” 
It’s time for pharmaceutical companies and states to fulfil their human rights responsibilities and obligations. Amnesty International is campaigning for companies, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna, to share their knowledge and technology so that everyone in the world will have a fair shot at a vaccine. And states must step up by putting pressure on companies to do their part and work collectively to ensure those most at risk around the globe are vaccinated as soon as possible.

0,Myanmar: Vast arsenal and notorious troops deployed during nationwide ‘killing spree’ protest crackdown – new research,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/myanmar-vast-arsenal-and-notorious-troops-deployed-during-nationwide-killing-spree-protest/,Analysis of more than 50 videos show systematic and premeditated killings amid extensive deployment of battlefield weaponry Soldiers implicated in atrocity crimes against ethnic minorities now operating in Myanmar’s cities Evidence of extrajudicial executions and killings on orders of commanders...,"The Myanmar military is using increasingly lethal tactics and weapons normally seen on the battlefield against peaceful protesters and bystanders across the country, new research by Amnesty International has revealed. 
By verifying more than 50 videos from the ongoing crackdown, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab can confirm that security forces appear to be implementing planned, systematic strategies including the ramped-up use of lethal force. Many of the killings documented amount to extrajudicial executions. 
Footage clearly shows that Myanmar military troops – also known as the Tatmadaw – are increasingly armed with weapons that are only appropriate for the battlefield, not for policing actions. Officers are frequently seen engaging in reckless behavior, including the indiscriminate spraying of live ammunition in urban areas. 
“These Myanmar military tactics are far from new, but their killing sprees have never before been livestreamed for the world to see,” said Joanne Mariner, Director of Crisis Response at Amnesty International. 
“These are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions. These are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open. 
“For years, ethnic minorities – including the Chin, Kachin, Karen, Rakhine, Rohingya, Shan, Ta’ang and more – have borne the brunt of horrific violence meted out by the Tatmadaw. Along with other rights groups, we have called on the UN Security Council to refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court, and bring the Tatmadaw’s senior commanders, including Min Aung Hlaing, to justice. Instead the Security Council has done nothing, and today we see the same military units turn their fire on protestors. 
“The military authorities must immediately cease their deadly onslaught, de-escalate the situation nationwide, and release all those arbitrarily detained.” 
The 55 clips, filmed from 28 February to 8 March, were recorded by members of the public and local media in cities including Dawei, Mandalay, Mawlamyine, Monywa, Myeik, Myitkyina and Yangon. 
According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, the death toll from the protests as of 4 March stands at 61. This official estimate excludes additional known casualties in recent days. 
Planned, premeditated and sanctioned use of lethal force 
Amnesty International has verified multiple clips showing lethal force is being used in a planned, premeditated and coordinated manner. 
In one video taken in Sanchaung township in Yangon on 2 March, a commander can be seen standing over an officer operating a sniper rifle. The commander appears to be giving him orders to direct fire towards specific protesters. 
In a disturbing clip from 3 March in North Okkalapa township, Yangon, officers are seen leading a man towards a larger group of security forces. The man appears to be in the group’s custody and offers no visible resistance, when an officer beside him suddenly shoots him. He immediately drops to the ground and is left on the road, apparently lifeless, for several seconds before officers then walk back and drag him away. 
Two people were killed and several more injured in Myitkyina, Kachin State, on 8 March. In one verified clip, a group of people can be seen running from a thick cloud of smoke as gunshots sound in the distance. Panicked voices can be heard saying, “It burns so much” and “One person has died,” amid screams of shock as a person with a serious head injury is being carried away. Several apparently injured people are then seen being dragged away, leaving significant amounts of blood on the ground. 
In another verified clip dated 28 February, a member of the military in Dawei is seen apparently lending his rifle to a police officer deployed alongside him. The officer crouches, takes aim and shoots, before a group of officers standing with them celebrate. 
“Not only does this incident show a reckless disregard for human life, making sport of shooting live rounds at protesters, it also reveals deliberate coordination among security forces,” said Joanne Mariner. 
Extensive military arsenal deployed 
On 5 March, state-run media quoted military authorities as denying any role in fatalities, claiming that “unscrupulous persons [might be] behind these cases”. 
However, Amnesty International has identified security forces armed with a variety of military firearms, including Chinese RPD light machine guns, as well as local MA-S sniper rifles, MA-1 semi-automatic rifles, Uzi-replica BA-93 and BA-94 submachine guns, and other arms manufactured in Myanmar. These weapons are completely inappropriate for use in policing protests. According to UN guidelines, security forces should refrain from the use of firearms unless there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury, and there is no suitable alternative available. 
“The weaponry deployed by the Tatmadaw reveals a deliberate and dangerous escalation in tactics,” said Joanne Mariner. 
“Not content with indiscriminately using less-lethal weapons, each new day shows an apparent order to deploy semi-automatic rifles, sniper rifles, and light machine guns in increasing numbers. Make no mistake, we are in a deadly new phase of the crisis.” 
This deployment follows the excessive use of tear gas, water cannons, South Korean Dae Kwang DK-44 flashbang grenades and other contentious ‘crowd control’ methods, as well as incidents of egregious beatings at the hands of the security forces, such as in this verified clip filmed in Mandalay on 7 March. 
Photos and videos also show that police have access to traditional less-lethal arms, including “pepperball” launchers, and shotguns loaded with rubber bullets manufactured by the Turkish company Zsr Patlayici Sanayi A.S., using cartridges from Franco-Italian company Cheddite. 
Reckless and indiscriminate use of lethal weapons 
Amnesty International has also verified footage of security forces using lethal weapons in ways that are reckless, indiscriminate, and very likely to cause fatal injuries. 
Verified footage from 1 March in Mawlamyine in Mon State shows security forces riding pick-up trucks while apparently indiscriminately firing live ammunition in multiple directions, including into people’s homes. 
In a clip from Yangon’s Hledan township published on 28 February, the man recording the footage is peering over a balcony and describing the scene below, where armed forces personnel appear to be shooting teargas and ammunition directly at people in the street. Huddled with others on the balcony he continues to record the scene, when a group of officers at street level seem to spot him filming. A single shot can be heard before people on the balcony say “[someone has been] hit! Get inside [the apartment]!”. A woman on the balcony can then be seen lying with a head injury. 
“As the death toll surges, the UN Security Council and the international community must move beyond words of concern and immediately act to halt violations and hold perpetrators accountable,” said Joanne Mariner. 
Notorious military divisions deployed 
Further analysis of photos and videos show that the military units involved in this lethal repression include the Yangon Command, Northwestern Command, and the 33rd, 77th and 101st Light Infantry Divisions (LID), often operating alongside – and sometimes lending their weapons to – police officers. 
According to footage examined by Amnesty International, the 33rd LID is currently deployed in Mandalay, the 77th in Yangon, and the 101st in Monywa. All three cities have seen extreme instances of excessive force, including killings, by security forces in recent days. 
Some of these military divisions are notorious for atrocities and serious human rights violations committed in Rakhine, Kachin, and northern Shan States. Amnesty International has implicated soldiers from the 33rd LID in war crimes in northern Shan State in 2016 and 2017, and in crimes against humanity against the Rohingya in Rakhine State in 2017.

In a statement, Denise Bell, researcher at Amnesty International USA, said:  
“We are incredibly relieved and heartened to learn that Andrea Sahouri has been found not guilty of the bogus charges levied against her. Reporting at a protest as a working member of the media is not a crime, and treating it as one constitutes a human rights violation. This fits into a larger trend of police forces across the United States committing widespread and egregious human rights violations in response to largely peaceful assemblies protesting systemic racism and police violence, including the killing of Black people. 
“Journalists must be able to report on scenes of protest without fear of retribution. The right of the media to do their work is essential to the right of freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly. 
“Clearly, the jury saw these charges for what they are — completely ridiculous. This case should never have gone to trial. In much the same way Sahouri’s unfounded arrest is a part of a larger pattern of police abuses, the decision of Polk County prosecutors to bring her to trial on these charges fits a larger pattern of practices undermining human rights within the United States justice system.” 
“The jury did the right thing by upholding freedom of the press and a just democracy. I’m grateful for them, as well as the support I’ve received from every corner of the world,” said Andrea Sahouri.  
Background and context:  
On the night of May 31, 2020, police in the city of Des Moines, Iowa, pepper-sprayed, arrested, and detained Andrea Sahouri while she was reporting on a Black Lives Matter protest, even after she yelled “I’m press, I’m press.” 
Amnesty documented Andrea’s case in its August 2020 report, The World is Watching: Mass Violations by US Police of Black Lives Matter Protesters’ Rights, detailing how law enforcement officials unnecessarily and unjustly targeted journalists, legal observers, and street medics, as well as protesters, with excessive use of force in numerous primarily peaceful protests in 2020. Such excessive use of force violated their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, causing injuries and endangering all those impacted. 
Amnesty International has been campaigning globally for the charges against Andrea Sahouri to be dropped.

By lowering the cost of production for the oil industry, the tax credit increases oil company profits and promotes the expansion of fossil fuel production. Canada is already falling short on its commitment to eliminate inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. This policy would add yet another taxpayer subsidy for the oil and gas industry.

Climate change, biodiversity loss, ecosystems degradation and toxic pollution of air, water and soil are dramatic and interconnected processes that severely impact the enjoyment of human rights for billions of people, and particularly of those marginalized and facing discrimination. 
In the light of this emergency, it is imperative that the human right of all to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is globally recognized.  The momentum for the global recognition of the right to a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is growing. 
As pointed out by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, most countries have already incorporated the right to a healthy environment in their constitutions and laws. Numerous UN agencies have also called for the recognition of this right at the global level. Canada however has yet to do so. 
Amnesty International urges Canada to join other countries in recognizing the right to a healthy environment. We have also signed this joint letter calling on the UN Human Rights Council to recognize the right to a healthy environment. As the open letter states, the recognition of this right by the Human Rights Council “would play a crucial role for the realization of environmental justice for communities exposed to degraded, hazardous or threatening environments”. 
This week the governments of Costa Rica, Maldives, Morocco, Slovenia and Switzerland delivered a joint statement at the Human Rights Council calling for the recognition of the right to a healthy environment. They are inviting other governments to co-sponsor it by 22 March 2021 with the aim of having 40 governments join in two weeks. If this goal is achieved, there is a good likelihood that the human right to a healthy environment will finally be recognized in September 2021. Amnesty Canada sent a letter to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs last week urging the Government of Canada to endorse this call.

“Loujain al-Hathloul is a brave human rights defender, she should be celebrated for her peaceful activism in the country – not branded a criminal. 
“She has already been held nearly three years in arbitrary detention, enduring torture, sexual harassment and other ill-treatment as well as solitary confinement. 
“Today’s verdict once again exposes Saudi Arabia’s public commitments to human rights reform as a sham. 
“The Saudi authorities must immediately quash Loujain al-Hathloul’s conviction, lift the abusive five-year travel ban imposed on her and her family, and ensure she has adequate reparations for her unjust arbitrary detention and other violations she has faced. Those responsible for subjecting her to torture and other ill-treatment must also be brought to justice.” 
Background 
Loujain al-Hathloul was arbitrarily detained in 2018, along with 12 other women’s rights activists held solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
In December 2020, she was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison –suspended by two years and 10 months- after a grossly unfair trial before the Specialized Criminal Court. She was charged with “spying with foreign parties” and “conspiring against the kingdom” for promoting women’s rights and calling for the end of the male guardianship system. 
In February 2021, after nearly three years behind bars, Loujain al-Hathloul was released on probation. She currently faces a five-year travel ban.

In a letter sent to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, more than 30 organizations called on Trudeau to support a proposed temporary waiver of certain obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).   
The waiver – jointly proposed by India and South Africa – would mean WTO members would not have to grant or enforce patents and other intellectual property rights covering COVID-19 drugs, vaccines, diagnostics, and other technologies such as masks and ventilators. 
While the Canadian government has not rejected this proposal, importantly, it also has not agreed to it. This puts Canada in line with Australia, Brazil, the EU, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. in obstructing the waiver. 
“After all of Canada’s talk about the need for a global effort to fight COVID, the failure to sign on to the WTO waiver is disappointing to say the least. The waiver can speed up the COVID response, making it more accessible and affordable for all. Importantly, it will ensure public health and people’s lives are being prioritized over the profits of pharmaceutical corporations,” says Jesse Whattam, co-ordinator of the Trade Justice Network. 
“Canada’s own COVID-19 legislation in 2020 authorized the temporary suspension of patents and trade secrets to protect public health. The TRIPS waiver would guarantee the same kind of flexibility to all countries, especially those who cannot affordably manufacture or import therapeutic products, PPE and vaccines,” says Stuart Trew, senior researcher and director of the Trade and Investment Research Project at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. 
“While provinces across Canada are rolling out their vaccination plans, a fifth of the world’s population is not expected to receive doses until 2022. Free and equal access to vaccine is a human rights priority and no-one should be denied access to a vaccine because of their economic status or the country they live in. Canada has a responsibility to be part of the global solution and lead wealthier countries in endorsing this waiver,” says Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada.

It might feel like there’s not much to be positive about right now, especially when we consider the harm the pandemic has caused to women, girls and LGBTI people around the world. 
But this year it’s especially important to celebrate women’s achievements – not only because we’re all in need of some good news, but because there is plenty of cause for hope. Here are ten things that happened last year that prove change is always possible – even during a pandemic. 
https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=476&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Famnestycanada%2Fvideos%2F379084989832951%2F&show_text=false&width=267 
After years of tireless campaigning by activists, abortion was finally legalized in Argentina in December 2020. It is now legal in Argentina to have an abortion up to fourteen weeks, and at later stages in cases of rape or health risks. This law will save lives – for the past 30 years, unsafe abortions have been the leading cause of maternal death in Argentina. 
What makes this development especially encouraging is the fact that, just eighteen months earlier, a proposal to legalize abortion was rejected by Argentinian senators. It was a crushing blow, but activists kept fighting. At the time Mariela Belski, Amnesty Argentina’s Director, described the Senate vote as “a stepping-stone, not a setback”.  
The fact she was proved right just two years later should serve as an inspiration to others around the world. In low moments change might seem impossible, but it’s not. 
We need Argentina’s example more than ever. In the past year, several governments have taken draconian steps to restrict sexual and reproductive rights, often using the pandemic as a pretext for crackdowns. 
In October, Poland’s highly politicized Constitutional Tribunal ruled in favour of a near-total abortion ban triggering mass protests by women’s rights activists across the country, while in January lawmakers in Honduras constitutionalized one of the harshest abortion laws in the world. And while some governments made changes to improve access to abortion during lockdowns, including through telemedicine, in many countries reproductive health care ground to a halt. 
But women are not just waiting for their governments to do better; they’re taking matters into their own hands, by starting petitions, organizing protests, running workshops, and providing support and health care. For example, womens’ groups in Poland continue to protest, braving harassment, detention, prosecution and excessive use of force by police. Activists are planning to take to the streets on 8 March, and solidarity protests are also expected outside Polish Embassies or emblematic buildings in Europe, in solidarity with women in Poland and their right to bodily autonomy. 
This activism can have real results, as we saw in January when abortion was decriminalized in South Korea, a decision prompted in part by the rise of the #MeToo movement in the country. And in Thailand, parliament passed a law to allow abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy – a big step in a country where women could previously face prison for having an abortion at any stage of pregnancy. 
In March 2020 Sierra Leone overturned a ban on pregnant girls attending school and sitting exams. Since 2015 many pregnant girls have been stigmatized and denied their right to education, damaging their prospects of future employment. The ban has now rightly been consigned to the history books – an important step towards equal rights to education. 
In December 2020, after years of campaigning by women’s rights and survivors’ groups, the Danish parliament passed legislation defining sex without consent as rape. Like most European countries, Denmark previously had antiquated laws which recognized rape only if there was physical violence, threat or coercion. 
Kirstine, a journalist from Denmark, described how challenging it was to get justice after she reported a rape: 
“The worst aspect of the experience was the focus by the police, the lawyers and the judge on whether there was evidence of physical violence: on whether I had resisted, rather than whether I had consented.”  
The pandemic has been devastating for many LGBTI people. Existing obstacles to health care, employment and housing have been exacerbated, while lockdowns have forced many people to isolate in unsafe environments. But even in this troubling context there have been flashes of good news. 
Last year Costa Rica became the first country in Central America to legalize same-sex marriage, and the first same-sex marriage took place in Northern Ireland. Gabon voted to decriminalize consensual same-sex relationships, and a law overturning a ban on same-sex relationships came into effect in Angola. Montenegro voted to legalize same-sex civil partnerships, and Croatia legalized fostering for same-sex couples. 
And two bills that aim to protect people from discrimination, including LGBTI people, are being proposed and discussed in Japan and South Korea. 
These are crucial steps towards ensuring equal rights for all. Bit by bit, country by country, the picture is changing. 
In June, the US Supreme Court ruled that LGBTI people are protected under the Civil Rights Act from employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. It provided a long-awaited recognition of LGBTI people’s equality under the law, and a much-needed rebuke to the Trump administration’s rollback of protections of their human rights. 
For many trans people around the world, the pandemic has been a terrifying time. Closure of support services and exclusionary social protection measures have heightened the risk of violence and pushed trans people to the margins. In the absence of specific government relief or stimulus packages, many trans people have had to rely on assistance from others in the trans or wider LGBTI communities. 
There are some heartening examples of trans activists and communities coming together to support those most in need, but activists shouldn’t have to step into the spaces where governments have failed. 
Sudan has one of the highest prevalences of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the world, but in July 2020 the practice was outlawed. If the law is properly upheld, millions of girls and women will be protected from a lifetime of potential suffering. 
In February 2021, Loujain al-Hathloul, one of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent women’s rights activists, was released from prison after almost three years. 
Loujain was instrumental in overturning the ban on women driving, but by the time the law changes she was in prison for challenging male guardianship laws. 
Loujain’s family, as well as human rights organizations around the world, campaigned tirelessly for her release, and are now seeking justice for Loujain and others who have been tortured in detention. Loujain remains on probation and under a travel ban. 
Her sister Lina said: 
“Loujain is at home, but she is not free. The fight is not over. I am not fully happy without the release of all political prisoners.” 
Countless people remain behind bars in Saudi Arabia for their activism. True justice will only be possible when the government reforms repressive laws and starts holding torturers to account. But today, we should celebrate the fact that one of Saudi Arabia’s bravest advocates for women’s rights is out of prison. 
In January 2021 the UK government abolished the “tampon tax” after years of campaigning by women’s organizations. Sanitary products had previously been classified as “luxury items” in the UK, meaning they were subject to 5% VAT. The EU is currently in the process of scrapping the tampon tax across all its member states. 
During lockdowns, rates of domestic violence soared worldwide. The pandemic has shone a light on the scale of the problem and prompted activists worldwide to take a stand. In 2020, we saw countless examples of women raising their voices to demand better protection from violence. In Namibia, protesters brought the capital to a standstill when they took to the streets protesting sexual violence and femicide. 
In Turkey and Ukraine there were large protests urging government support for the Istanbul Convention (the regional treaty on violence against women and domestic violence), while millions of women across South America went on strike in March in protest against violence and inequality. 
Accountability is essential for deterring perpetrators of gender-based violence, but you don’t need to join a protest to make your voice heard. 
Amnesty International is campaigning for justice for Berta Cáceres, a Honduran rights defender who was murdered five years ago, and Popi and Bongeka, two students murdered in South Africa. 
You can also add your voice to our campaign to protect Jani Silva, who has received death threats for her work defending the Colombian Amazon.

“Protests in Senegal have already led to the death of at least eight individuals last week, some of them caused by the use of excessive force and firearms by security forces. 
“We reiterate our call on the authorities to launch impartial investigations into the circumstances of these deaths, and we urge them to ensure people can safely exercise their right to peaceful assembly, as protected under the country’s constitution and international law. 
“The use of force by security forces must be exercised with restraint, only when necessary and in a proportional manner. Firearms must only be used as a last resort when strictly necessary to protect against the imminent threat of death or serious injury. Members of the security forces who use excessive force or unlawful lethal force must be prosecuted according to law. 
“Security forces policing demonstrations must wear distinctive uniforms that clearly identify them as such. Individuals in plain clothes armed with sticks, clubs and guns at several sites were observed beating up protesters during last week’s protests in full view of security forces and even using firearms in some parts of the capital. Authorities must also investigate the presence and the role of these individuals.

Background  
The M2D, a coalition of opposition parties and activists groups has planned a protest throughout Senegal from today until Wednesday. This follows protests and violent clashes which erupted in the country after Ousmane Sonko, a leading opposition figure, was arrested on 3 March charged with disturbing public order and participating in an unauthorized demonstration while on his way to court to respond to a summons from a judge in a separate criminal case. 
After his arrest, Sonko appeared before a judge without his lawyers on 5 March. He was charged with “calling for an insurrection” and is due to appear before the judge again today. He was released from custody yesterday as well as two of his supporters. 
Eight people died in the context of the protests and riots during the last five days. Rioters vandalized supermarket, and private residences of public figures perceived as close to the government. A TV station, TFM, was targeted on 5 March.  
In Dakar on 5 March, protesters were prevented from accessing to their planned venue by a heavy police deployment. This led to clashes between security forces and demonstrators in several areas. According to the Senegalese Red Cross, 235 people were injured during the 5 March protests in Dakar. 
According to media reports, around 100 people have been arrested since 3 March including six members of activists group ‘’Y’en  a Marre’’ on 5 March. Among them the rapper and founding member, Cheikh Oumar Touré “Thiat”. 
The Minister of Home Affairs, in a tv statement on 5 March, called the protests “acts of terror and banditry” and denounced the presence of “occult forces” behind the demonstrations. He has not announced an investigation into the deaths linked to the protests, nor the circumstances under which they occurred. He has also stressed that protests are illegal in Senegal due to the state of health emergency, linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Holding the Syrian government accountable for war crimes, crimes against humanity and torture is a critical step to end a culture of impunity that has plagued the country for years and provides a glimpse of justice for Syrian victims,” said Amnesty International (Canada) Secretary General Ketty Nivyabandi.  
Amnesty International previously called on Canada to pursue formal negotiations against Syria through the International Court of Justice (ICJ). While the International Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to try individuals accused of war crimes or crimes against humanity, it can hold states responsible for failing to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice.  
“There is overwhelming evidence that the Syrian government has committed grave crimes and human rights violations under international law. Canada’s decision also sends a strong message of solidarity and hope to Syrians who have endured insufferable violence at the hands of the Assad regime.”

“Everything points to troops adopting shoot to kill tactics to suppress the protests, and with silence from the military administration, there is a growing consensus that this has been authorized by the government.   
“Amnesty has previously implicated Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the coup leader, in crimes against humanity. The harrowing scenes now unfolding across Myanmar shows mounting evidence of more textbook brutality under his command. Everything we know about the Tatmadaw’s command structure, and the absence of any calls for restraint from his office, raises questions that must be answered. 
“For years, the Tatmadaw has acted with impunity in ethnic minority areas, but to see them deploy the same tactics on-camera, in cities, is an alarming new development.   
“We are seeing a surge in unlawful killings, including apparent extrajudicial executions, with no apparent attempt to rein in the use of lethal force. If anything, security forces appear increasingly brazen in their deployment of lethal weapons with each passing day. We are extremely alarmed by credible evidence of machine guns being fired in Yangon, the largest city, as well as military aircraft flying over protest sites in Yangon and Mandalay.  
“There is an acute and urgent need for a prompt, effective, independent and impartial investigation into shocking human rights violations across Myanmar, including the chain of command responsible for these egregious killings. The military leadership has calculated that they will get away with this. The international community needs to ensure that those calculations were wrong.”  
According to the most recent estimates from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPP-B), 22 people are confirmed to have been killed by security forces across Myanmar on 3 March 2021. Seventeen protesters were killed on 28 February 2021, bringing the total number of fatalities since the 1 February coup to at least 48. Local media sources reported a high number of gunshot wounds to the head and back as a leading cause of the killings.  
The UN Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar has previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s military chief now in charge of the country, and other senior officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.  
Amnesty International research has previously shown how the deployment of specific infantry battalions by the military’s senior command resulted in some of the most egregious human rights violations by the Myanmar military. These same battalions have previously been identified at protest sites since the coup.

“Today’s confirmation by the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court that she has opened an investigation into crimes under international law committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is a momentous breakthrough for justice after decades of non-accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
“The ICC investigation provides the first genuine prospect for thousands of victims of crimes under international law to gain long overdue access to justice, truth and reparations. It also offers a historic opportunity to finally put an end to the pervasive impunity that has driven serious violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories for more than half a century. 
“The decision sends a clear message to all perpetrators of crimes under international law in the OPT – you shall not escape justice. 
“We call on governments worldwide to offer their full political and practical support to the ICC as it begins its investigation, and we call on the ICC to immediately commence outreach to affected communities in the OPT and Israel.” 
The investigation will cover crimes committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories comprised of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, since 13 June 2014. 
For decades, Amnesty International and other organizations have gathered and published evidence of crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations by Israel and Palestinian authorities and armed groups in both the OPT and Israel.

The (r)age of women: Stigma and violence against women protesters analyzes five protests that women and feminist groups carried out against gender-based violence last year in the states of Guanajuato, Sinaloa, Quintana Roo, the State of Mexico and Mexico City. 
“The violent response of the various authorities to the women’s protests violated their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. During the arrests and transfers, police officers spoke to the women using violent and sexualized language, threatened them with sexual violence and subjected them to physical and sexual violence. Many women did not know where they were, who was arresting them or where they were taking them, meaning they were at risk of enforced disappearance,” said Tania Reneaum Panszi, executive director at Amnesty International Mexico. 
“The authorities at various levels of government have stigmatized women’s protests, characterizing them as ‘violent’ with the aim of discrediting their activism and questioning their motives. But make no mistake, these protests are a call for women’s right to live a life free from violence. They are a call to combat the impunity that prevails in thousands of cases of femicide and sexual violence that have caused unimaginable pain for so many families in Mexico.” 
The report concludes that police officers arrested more than a dozen women without duly identifying themselves, held them incommunicado for long periods of time, transferred them using unusual routes without telling them where they were taking them, and in some cases without bringing them before the relevant authorities, causing them intense fear of becoming victims of enforced disappearance. Deliberately causing suffering and uncertainty among the protesters about the possibility of being subjected to enforced disappearance is a violation of their right to personal safety and infringes upon the absolute prohibition of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
In addition, on many occasions police officers resorted to the use of sexual violence as a tactic to teach them a lesson about daring to go out to protest in public and for behaving contrary to gender stereotypes, according to which women should stay at home and “not go out looking for trouble”. Amnesty International emphasizes that all sexual abuse committed by a state authority must be considered a form of torture, in accordance with international human rights law, including the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) judgements relating to Mexico. 
Various authorities and some media outlets have stigmatized protests by women and feminist groups as “violent”. In Mexico City, the head of government, Claudia Sheinbaum, labelled the protests “provocations” seeking a more violent response from the state so as to generate more attention and public condemnation. In León, Guanajuato, the Secretary for Public Security said that the city could not be turned into a “violent protest-drome” as a justification for restricting and dispersing protesters. This stigmatization has created a hostile environment for women’s right to peaceful assembly that discredits their activism and encourages both authorities and civilians to carry out violence against them. 
In accordance with international human rights law, authorities must not use the acts of violence of a few people during a protest as an excuse to restrict or obstruct the majority from exercising their rights and must ensure that those protesting peacefully may continue to do so. Amnesty International found that the authorities unduly restricted the rights of the protesters by classifying the protests as violent due to actions that are protected by the right to freedom of expression, such as painting slogans on public walls or modifying monuments. Although authorities may justifiably impose certain restrictions in order to prevent damage to public or private property, they must not take measures that unduly restrict human rights and obstruct those peacefully protesting. 
The report also shows the stigmatization and criminalization of women who participated in protests with their faces covered – including those using masks as a health measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 – or those dressed in black. Amnesty International notes that covering one’s face or dressing in a particular way cannot be equated with committing a crime or used to justify an arrest or the presumption of the use of violence during protests. 
Amnesty International calls on the authorities to acknowledge, continuously and comprehensively, the legitimacy of the protests of women and feminist groups and refrain from making stigmatizing statements against the protesters. 
In relation to the reports of sexual violence filed by women protesters, the authorities must carry out prompt, exhaustive, independent and impartial investigations with a gender perspective in order to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice in fair trials and guarantee comprehensive reparation for the damages to the victims. They must also investigate the unnecessary and excessive use of force during the protests and establish the responsibility of individual police officers as well as the chain of command. 
Finally, the organization calls on the authorities to adopt effect measures to prevent, protect and guarantee women’s right to live a life free from violence, particularly femicide and the various forms of sexual violence, and guarantee adequate access to justice and reparation for those who have suffered from gender-based violence.

By Mary Lawlor, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders 
This article was first published in Al Jazeera on March 2, 2021 
It has been five years since environmental human rights defender Berta Cáceres was murdered in her home in Honduras. 
She was one of hundreds of human rights defenders killed that year because of their peaceful work. Hundreds have been killed every year since, but those responsible have rarely been brought to justice. Although some have been convicted of Cáceres’s killing, others believed to have been involved are still to be held to account. 
It is a familiar and continuing story, in Honduras and across the world, where those responsible for the murder of a human rights defender often enjoy impunity. 
This week I am presenting my latest report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, and it is on the killings of human rights defenders and the threats that often precede them. 
At least 281 human rights defenders were killed in 2019, with a similar number expected to be recorded for 2020. Unless radical, immediate action is taken we can expect hundreds more murders this year. 
Since 2015, at least 1,323 defenders have been killed. While Latin America is consistently the most affected region, and environmental human rights defenders like Cáceres often the most targeted, it is a worldwide issue. 
Between 2015 and 2019, human rights defenders were killed in at least 64 countries, which is a third of all UN member states. Those collecting the data agree that underreporting is a common problem. The number of defenders killed is likely significantly higher than the figures we have. 
We know that on every continent, in cities and the countryside, in democracies and dictatorships, governments and other forces threaten and kill human rights defenders. Many, like Cáceres, are murdered in the context of large business projects. 
Why do so many governments and others kill human rights defenders working peacefully for the rights of others? Partly because they can, because there is unlikely to be the political will to punish the perpetrators. 
While some states, particularly those with high numbers of such killings, have established dedicated protection mechanisms to prevent and respond to risks and attacks against human rights defenders, defenders often complain that the mechanisms are under-resourced. 
And in too many cases, businesses are also shirking their responsibilities to prevent attacks on defenders or are even responsible for the attacks. 
These murders are not random acts of violence that come out of nowhere. Many of the killings are preceded by threats. As Amnesty International has noted, Cáceres’s murder “was a tragedy waiting to happen”, as she had “repeatedly denounced aggression and death threats against her. They had increased as she campaigned against the construction of a hydroelectric dam project called Agua Zarca and the impact it would have on the territory of the Lenca Indigenous people.” 
And yet her government failed to protect her, as so many governments fail to protect their defenders. Since I took up this mandate in May 2020, I have spoken to hundreds of human rights defenders. Many have told me about their real fears of being murdered, and have shown me death threats made against them, often in public. 
They tell me how some threats shouted in person, posted on social media, delivered in phone calls or text messages, or in written notes pushed under a door. Some are threatened by being included on published hit lists, receiving a message passed through an intermediary or having their houses graffitied. Others are sent pictures through the mail showing that they or their families have been under long-term surveillance, while others are told their family members will be killed. 
I have been told by defenders about a coffin being delivered to the office of an NGO; a bullet being left on a dining room table in their home; edited pictures of them being posted on Twitter, showing them having been attacked with axes or knives; and an animal head being tied to the door of their organisation’s office. 
Those advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex rights, and women and transgender human rights defenders, are often attacked with gendered threats, and targeted because of who they are as well as what they do. Women and LGBTQ people demanding rights in patriarchal, racist, or discriminatory contexts often suffer specific forms of attack, including sexual violence, smears and stigmatisation. 
The murders of human rights defenders are not inevitable, many are signalled in advance, and yet governments fail, year after year, to provide enough resources to prevent them, and fail, year after year, to hold the murderers to account. In fact, states should not only end impunity but also publicly applaud the vital contribution that human rights defenders make to societies. 
This week I will again remind the UN that their members are failing in their moral and legal obligations to prevent the killings of human rights defenders. It is no use for government officials to wring their hands and agree that the murder of Cáceres and other defenders is a terrible problem and that someone should do something about it. 
It is not that complicated. It is up to states to find the political will to prevent killings by responding better to threats against human rights defenders, and to hold murderers to account.

The lawsuit, filed by Shin Imai, York University law professor and co-founder of the Justice & Corporate Accountability Project (JCAP), is supported by several civil society organizations. It asks the court to order Global Affairs Canada to remove the redactions on 20 pages of documents the department disclosed in response to an access-to-information request. 
Hidden in those documents are details about Canadian officials’ communications with Goldcorp, the Guatemalan government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) after the commission called for Goldcorp’s Marlin mine to be shut down in 2010. The commission made the unprecedented request in response to evidence that Indigenous communities had not been consulted about the mine and concerns that its operations were contaminating their water resources. 
The portions of the documents that Global Affairs Canada did release suggest that Canadian officials swiftly intervened in the case on Goldcorp’s behalf, lobbying decision-makers in Guatemala and at the IACHR for months following the commission’s request. In 2011 Guatemala announced it would not suspend the mine’s operations, and the commission retracted its request. 
“Although many details are blacked out, these records paint a damning picture,” says Emily Dwyer, Coordinator of the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. “Canadian officials including ambassadors and cabinet ministers went to great lengths to present Goldcorp’s position to the Guatemalan government and the IACHR. We are concerned that Canadian officials may have tried to improperly influence decision makers.” 
“The Canadian government’s decision to go to court rather than disclose this additional information raises the question: what else did it do to support Goldcorp?” says Shin Imai of JCAP. “The public should be able to scrutinize the government’s actions here, to assess the extent to which it undermined Indigenous communities’ efforts to defend their rights.” 
The lawsuit contends that the Canadian government blacked out information that Canadians have a right to see under access-to-information legislation. 
“Communities impacted by the mine tell us that they are still dealing with polluted rivers, the destruction of sacred sites and property damage. Many people lack access to safe drinking water,” says Jean Symes of Inter Pares. 
Mr. Imai is represented by the law firm Major Sobiski Moffatt.

On March 2 the Federal Court of Canada will hear a case alleging that the Canadian government is improperly withholding information about its diplomatic interventions on behalf of a Canadian company accused of human rights abuse at its mine in Guatemala.   
The lawsuit, filed by Shin Imai, York University law professor and co-founder of the Justice & Corporate Accountability Project (JCAP), is supported by several civil society organizations including Amnesty International Canada. 
It asks the court to order Global Affairs Canada to remove the redactions on 20 pages of documents detailing Canadian officials’ communications with the Guatemalan government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) after the commission called for Goldcorp’s Marlin mine to be shut down in 2010.  
The call came after 18 Maya-Mam communities filed a complaint in 2007 with the IACHR over human rights abuses, environmental damages, and health impacts. The petition alleged that the communities were not consulted before mining concessions were granted, and that mining activities were depleting and contaminating their water resources and harming the health of local residents. The commission ordered the shutdown as an urgent precautionary measure while it further considered the case. It also requested that Guatemala take all necessary measures to “guarantee the life and physical integrity” of the affected Indigenous communities, in particular by decontaminating their water sources and ensuring access to potable water and to medical attention, as appropriate. 
Between 2005 and 2011 several people who spoke out against the mine were beaten, injured, shot or killed.  
At first it appeared that Guatemala might comply with the IACHR’s request to shut down the mine. The government announced in June 2010 that it would begin an administrative process to suspend operations. Then in July 2011 it reported that its administrative process had not identified sufficient evidence to support the suspension. 
The IACHR then modified its request, urging the government to “take the necessary measures” to ensure the communities’ water was not contaminated by the mine, but no longer calling for its suspension.  
The mine continued to operate up to 2017, when it reached the end of its commercial viability.  
Impacted communities continue to raise serious concerns about the ongoing impacts of the mine. These concerns relate to contamination, damage to local buildings and lack of access to potable water. Community members also raise grievances about Goldcorp’s local “development” projects and their failure to yield long-term benefits. Finally, local residents express concerns about whether the mine will be closed safely and how they will access remedy for the mine’s adverse impacts.  
Professor Imai made two access-to-information requests in 2014, seeking disclosure of communications between Canadian government officials, the Canadian embassy in Guatemala, Goldcorp, the IACHR and Guatemalan authorities between 2010 and 2011.  
Global Affairs Canada provided five different release packages to Mr. Imai following his requests and his subsequent complaint to the Office of the Information Commissioner. While many of the key details they contain are blacked out, the emails, meeting notes, talking points and other documents obtained show that Canadian officials undertook extensive lobbying of Guatemalan and IACHR decision-makers, and assisted Goldcorp in doing likewise.  
The government refuses to disclose redacted information on 20 pages of documents. It claims that the information is exempt from release under the Access to Information Act because it was obtained in confidence from the government of Guatemala or the IACHR; its release would result in probable harm to Canada’s international relations or to Goldcorp’s competitive position; or its release would undermine the neutrality of the public service and its ability to provide frank advice to government. 
The documents include records of communications with Goldcorp, with Guatemalan and IACHR officials, and between Canadian diplomats and embassy staff, as well as notes from a meeting between the Canadian ambassador to the Organization of American States and Goldcorp’s vice-president.  
In many cases Global Affairs Canada cannot explain how it satisfied established legal tests to justify the exemptions it claims. For example, it is unable to say what factors it considered in determining that disclosure would harm Goldcorp. It made this assessment without consulting the company and continued to provide this justification even after the mine had closed and after Goldcorp was purchased by an American company.   
Mr. Imai’s lawsuit argues that there is a clear public interest in disclosing the records. The public must be able to scrutinize the extent to which the Canadian government acted in the service of Goldcorp’s interests, while undermining Indigenous communities’ efforts to defend their rights. This disclosure would inform broader public debates regarding mining industry influence over Canadian foreign policy and the government’s compliance with its own policies and international human rights law.  
The case also highlights broader concerns regarding Canada’s access-to-information system, notably the broad use of exemptions to avoid accountability, competence and timeliness in government responses to requests, and the Office of the Information Commissioner’s effectiveness in guaranteeing the public’s right to access information. The current review of the Access to Information Act must address these concerns.https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&embedId=twitter-widget-2&features=eyJ0ZndfZXhwZXJpbWVudHNfY29va2llX2V4cGlyYXRpb24iOnsiYnVja2V0IjoxMjA5NjAwLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X2hvcml6b25fdHdlZXRfZW1iZWRfOTU1NSI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJodGUiLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjpudWxsfSwidGZ3X3R3ZWV0X2VtYmVkX2NsaWNrYWJpbGl0eV8xMjEwMiI6eyJidWNrZXQiOiJjb250cm9sIiwidmVyc2lvbiI6bnVsbH19&frame=false&hideCard=false&hideThread=false&id=1366835527597445121&lang=en&origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amnesty.ca%2Fblog%2Fottawa-must-disclose-how-it-aided-canadian-mining-company&sessionId=c68645c197f1d5ae838d7b0975141d7423899b39&theme=dark&widgetsVersion=82e1070%3A1619632193066&width=550px

“It is shocking and deeply alarming that the police and military responded with lethal force against entirely peaceful protesters, leading to a surge in fatalities yesterday. 
“These protesters must be allowed to exercise the right to gather peacefully to express their opinion about the country’s current situation. 
“The duty of all law enforcement, whether police and military, is to facilitate and protect peaceful assemblies. They must not harm protesters and must certainly not apply lethal force. Any measure they take to restrict these peaceful assemblies must be legitimate, proportionate, and necessary. 
“Amid this rapidly deteriorating situation, the Myanmar security forces must immediately cease the use of unnecessary force against peaceful protesters and release all those arbitrarily arrested.” 
According to media reports, 18 protesters were killed on 28 February as security forces used lethal weapons against peaceful protesters in mass assemblies across the country. 
Following the military coup on 1 February 2021, people in Myanmar have been staging nationwide demonstrations, which have been overwhelmingly peaceful. 
The UN Fact Finding Mission previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar’s military chief now in charge of the country, and other senior officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

Over the past year, because of the pandemic, we have seen the number of women experiencing gender-based violence go up, the hours women dedicate to unpaid care work skyrocket, threats faced by women human rights defenders increase, marginalized groups including sex workers become further marginalized, access to sexual and reproductive health services decrease, and the number of women in the paid labour force plummet. 
But we have also seen activists come together to demand that governments address the violence, ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, protect activists, advocate for the rights of sex workers, and demand access to affordable and high-quality childcare. 
International Women’s Day, which every year falls on March 8th, is always a time to take stock of feminist accomplishments over the past year and re-commit ourselves to the work ahead. This year we have much to take stock of, and much to re-commit ourselves to. The coming year will continue to be shaped by the pandemic response, and it will also be shaped by pandemic recovery. The pandemic has forced us to re-think society, and now is the time to re-think, re-envision, and re-build a more just and equitable world. 
In many parts of the world, the pandemic has been a more dangerous time for activists, including women human rights defenders in jail who face a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. Join us in March to watch an inspirational documentary that we’re sure will leave you more re-committed than ever to our collective activism, and take action in support of jailed women human rights defenders.

Amnesty International spoke to 41 survivors and witnesses – including in-person interviews with recently arrived refugees in eastern Sudan and phone interviews with people in Axum – as well as 20 others with knowledge of the events. They consistently described extrajudicial executions, indiscriminate shelling and widespread looting after Ethiopian and Eritrean troops led an offensive to take control of the city amid the conflict with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) in mid-November. 
Satellite imagery analysis by the organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab corroborates reports of indiscriminate shelling and mass looting, as well as identifies signs of new mass burials near two of the city’s churches. 
“The evidence is compelling and points to a chilling conclusion. Ethiopian and Eritrean troops carried out multiple war crimes in their offensive to take control of Axum. Above and beyond that, Eritrean troops went on a rampage and systematically killed hundreds of civilians in cold blood, which appears to constitute crimes against humanity,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“This atrocity ranks among the worst documented so far in this conflict. Besides the soaring death toll, Axum’s residents were plunged into days of collective trauma amid violence, mourning and mass burials.” 
The mass killings came just before the annual celebration at Axum Tsion Mariam, a major Ethiopian Orthodox Christian festival on 30 November, compounding the trauma by casting a pall over an annual event that typically draws many pilgrims and tourists to the sacred city. 
Large-scale military offensive 
On 19 November 2020, Ethiopian and Eritrean military forces took control of Axum in a large-scale offensive, killing and displacing civilians with indiscriminate shelling and shooting. 
In the nine days that followed, the Eritrean military engaged in widespread looting of civilian property and extrajudicial executions. 
Witnesses could easily identify the Eritrean forces. They drove vehicles with Eritrean license plates, wore distinctive camouflage and footwear used by the Eritrean army and spoke Arabic or a dialect of Tigrinya not spoken in Ethiopia. Some bore the ritual facial scars of the Ben Amir, an ethnic group absent from Ethiopia. Finally, some of the soldiers made no secret of their identity; they openly told residents they were Eritrean. 
‘All we could see were dead bodies and people crying’ 
According to witnesses, the Eritrean troops unleashed the worst of the violence on 28-29 November. The onslaught came directly after a small band of pro-TPLF militiamen attacked the soldiers’ base on Mai Koho mountain on the morning of 28 November. The militiamen were armed with rifles and supported by residents brandishing improvised weapons, including sticks, knives and stones. 
Sustained gunfire can be heard ringing out across the city in a video recorded early that day from several locations at the bottom of the mountain. 
A 22-year-old man who wanted to bring food to the militia told Amnesty International: “The Eritrean soldiers were trained but the young residents didn’t even know how to shoot… a lot of the [local] fighters started running away and dropped their weapons. The Eritrean soldiers came into the city and started killing randomly.” 
Survivors and witnesses said Eritrean forces deliberately and wantonly shot at civilians from about 4pm onwards on 28 November. 
According to residents, the victims carried no weapons and many were running away from the soldiers when they were shot. One man who hid in an unfinished building said he saw a group of six Eritrean soldiers kill a neighbour with a vehicle-mounted heavy machine-gun on the street near the Mana Hotel: “He was standing. I think he was confused. They were probably around 10 metres from him. They shot him in the head.” 
A 21-year-old male resident said: “I saw a lot of people dead on the street. Even my uncle’s family. Six of his family members were killed. So many people were killed.” 
The killings left Axum’s streets and cobblestone plazas strewn with bodies. One man who had run out of the city returned at night after the shooting stopped. “All we could see on the streets were dead bodies and people crying,” he said. 
On 29 November, Eritrean soldiers shot at anyone who tried to move the bodies of those killed. 
The soldiers also continued to carry out house-to-house raids, hunting down and killing adult men, as well as some teenage boys and a smaller number of women. One man said he watched through his window and saw six men killed in the street outside his house on 29 November. He said the soldiers lined them up and shot from behind, using a light-machine gun to kill several at a time with a single bullet. 
Interviewees named scores of people they knew who were killed, and Amnesty International has collected the names of more than 240 of the victims. The organization has been unable to independently verify the overall death toll, but consistent witness testimonies and corroborating evidence make it plausible that hundreds of residents were killed. 
Burying the dead  
Most of the burials took place on 30 November, but the process of collecting and burying the bodies lasted several days. 
Many residents said they volunteered to move the bodies on carts, in batches of five to 10 at a time; one said he transported 45 bodies. Residents estimate that several hundred people were buried in the aftermath of the massacre, and they attended funerals at several churches where scores were buried. Hundreds were buried at the largest funeral, held at the complex that includes the Arba’etu Ensessa church and the Axum Tsion St Mariam Church. 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab geolocated a video showing people carrying a dead man on a stretcher in Da’Ero Ela Plaza (14.129918, 38.717113), towards Arba’etu Ensessa church. High-resolution satellite imagery from 13 December shows disturbed earth consistent with recent graves around the Arba’etu Ensessa and the Abune Aregawi churches. 
Intimidation and looting 
In the days following the burials, the Eritrean army rounded up hundreds of residents in different parts of the city. They beat some of the men, threatening them with a new round of revenge killings if they resisted. 
Axum residents witnessed a surge in the Eritrean army’s looting during this period, targeting stores, public buildings including a hospital, and private homes. Luxury goods and vehicles were widely looted, as well as medication, furniture, household items, food, and drink. 
International humanitarian law (the laws of war) prohibits deliberate targeting of civilians, indiscriminate attacks, and pillage (looting). Violations of these rules constitute war crimes. Unlawful killings that form part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population are crimes against humanity. 
“As a matter of urgency, there must be a UN-led investigation into the grave violations in Axum. Those suspected of responsibility for war crimes or crimes against humanity must be prosecuted in fair trials and victims and their families must receive full reparation,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“We repeat our call on the Ethiopian government to grant full and unimpeded access across Tigray for humanitarian, human rights, and media organizations.”

International Day of Action for Rivers on March 14 is a celebrated around the world as a day for solidarity action with communities defending access to the water of clean, flowing rivers. World Water Day, which is celebrated each year on March 22, will focus this year on the value of water for all of us, especially amid the climate crisis.  
On and around these key dates, we are organizing Days of Action in solidarity with unjustly imprisoned indigenous river defender Bernardo Caal Xol in Guatemala and other threatened water defenders. 
Bernardo Caal Xol is a Maya Q’eqchi’ Indigenous community leader, trade unionist and teacher who was persecuted and unjustly jailed in order to silence his peaceful, legitimate efforts on behalf of communities confronting the destructive impacts of a big dam project on the Cahabón River. Bernardo Caal Xol is a prisoner of conscience. He is now at grave risk of contracting COVID-19, amid overcrowded prison conditions. Meanwhile, Bernardo’s people and other communities continue to be attacked for seeking to defend their right to clean water and decision making about projects that will cause irreparable harm.

Despite the challenges with COVID-19 restrictions, thousands of supporters across Canada made their voices loud this year. They organized an incredible 206 virtual and household events or took action on their own, and sent more than 75,000+ letters, emails, solidarity messages and tweets from Canada alone!  
You’re already changing lives – thank you! Here are some recent updates from Write for Rights 2020, as well as one from 2019:  
Algerian journalist Khaled Drareni, jailed for covering protests, has been conditionally released! He’s shared his thanks to you:   
I want to thank everyone who supported me and who supported the prisoners of conscience because your support is essential for all of us. 
We continue to call for all charges against Khaled to be dropped. A hearing to have his file examined by the Supreme Court was scheduled for February 25 but rescheduled to March 25.   
Thank you so much for your dedicated efforts and support for Khaled’s freedom during Write for Rights 2020!  
In January, women human rights defender Nassima al-Sada received a prison sentence of five years with partial suspension of two years. This means that she should be released in early June 2021, but we are continuing to demand her immediate and unconditional release. She’s a peaceful activist and shouldn’t be behind bars in the first place.   
On Friday, February 12 our colleagues from Amnesty Netherlands handed over letters of solidarity received so far for Nassima to her son Mousa. He asked to share his thanks with you:  
“I am overwhelmed. My mom will love all the letters, it will mean so much to her and she will be amazed by all the efforts put into this. I was also surprised that some letters are addressed to me too. One woman wrote ‘And for you I send a mother’s love’, so sweet. I thought first that I would make a selection of them to read to my mom but seeing these bags I realize she will want me to read each single one of them! A huge thanks to all of you for your solidarity.”  
Earlier this month, Popi’s sister, Lihle, and Bongeka’s cousin, Mdu, visited the Amnesty South Africa office to receive your solidarity letters. Our colleagues reported that Lihle and Mdu appeared completely overwhelmed with gratitude and support. You can watch the thank you video below! 
You can also hear more from Popi and Bongeka’s families in this VICE video released in early February.  
Jani was forced into hiding in early December following increased threats to her and her family. In late December, she and her family were forced again to move to a new undisclosed location for their safety.

On January 28, 2021, the appeal for Idris to be tried in a civilian court instead of a military court was denied. Military courts in Pakistan notoriously shun transparency, due process and human rights. Very little information has been shared with his lawyers or family about his case. His whereabouts remain unknown; however, it has been recently disclosed that the espionage charges against him relate to a meeting between Idris and a diplomat in June 2009, well over a decade before his abduction.  
Idris remains at risk of an unfair trial, a lengthy prison sentence or even the death penalty.  
ACT NOW: We’ve issued a new Urgent Action for Idris’ case here.   
The December 10, 2020 trial for the METU Pride defenders was postponed to April 30, 2021. Please watch for updates as we get closer to the date.   
José Adrián, who at age 14 was arbitrarily detained, beaten and mistreated by police in Mexico, has signed an agreement with the government for him and his family that includes supports such as medical care, psychological care and scholarships.

“Today’s historic verdict – the first of its kind for crimes under international law committed by a Syrian government official- is a resounding victory for the tens of thousands of Syrian torture survivors and victims of enforced disappearance as well as for Syrian and international human rights and litigation organizations who together, for years, have fought relentlessly for truth and justice. These organizations helped ensure crimes were documented and legal files built for prosecution and without them this trial would not have been possible. 
“It also sends a clear message to the Syrian government that those responsible for horrific violations will be brought to justice. This verdict comes almost 10 years after the first peaceful protests started in Syria – years during which the state deployed its machinery of cruelty against its own people, across its detention centers and prisons. 
“During these 10 years, the international community has consistently fallen short of taking concrete action in the face of ongoing egregious violations and to hold those responsible accountable. 
“We call on more states to follow Germany’s example by investigating and prosecuting individuals suspected of committing war crimes or other crimes under international law in Syria through their national courts under the principle of ‘universal jurisdiction’. We also reiterate our call to the UN Security Council to urgently refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court to ensure that perpetrators from all parties to the conflict – including those ‘most responsible’ – high-ranking officials and commanders – face justice.” 
In February 2020, Anwar Raslan and Eyad al-Gharib, former Syrian officials, were arrested by German and French police. Both were charged with crimes against humanity, over the torture of detainees held in State Security branch 251, also known as al-Khatib, in Damascus. 
For a decade Amnesty International has documented the systematic use of torture and other ill-treatment in Syrian places of detention – including al-Khatib. These violations, committed in the context of the armed conflict, constitute war crimes, and because they form part of a widespread and systematic attack against the civilian population, are crimes against humanity.

In an investigation of the cases of 73 Hirak activists, protesters or journalists Amnesty International documented how they were arbitrarily arrested, prosecuted and in some cases given lengthy prison terms based on vaguely-worded penal law provisions in the past two years. In some cases, activists were subjected to intrusive phone searches or were dismissed by their employer because of their prosecution. Some reported torture or other ill-treatment while being held. 
On 18 February, in an address to the nation President Abdelmadjid Tebboune announced early legislative elections and said that he had ordered the release of dozens of protesters who had been detained for their participation in the Hirak protest movement or online publications on social media. At least 37 were released on 19 and 20 February, but 31 remain in prison, according to the National Committee for the Liberation of detainees, a local watchdog group. 
Among those released, is prominent journalist Khaled Drareni, who was sentenced to two years in prison for his coverage of the Hirak protest movement, and who featured in Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign. 
“Amnesty International’s findings are evidence of a deliberate strategy to crush dissent by the Algerian authorities that give the lie to the authorities’ promises of upholding human rights. These are the actions of a government intent on censuring its people for peaceful protest and expressing critical views on social media. Such repressive tactics have no place in a rights-respecting society,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Many of those pardoned by President Tebboune in recent days were peaceful activists who were exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly and should never have been detained in the first place. 
“The Algerian government must immediately and unconditionally release any further peaceful protesters, activists and journalists who have been prosecuted or remain in detention for expressing their views or protesting peacefully and drop any outstanding charges against them. We also call on the authorities to amend or repeal provisions in Algerian law that violate the rights to freedom of expression, online or offline, and peaceful assembly.” 
Amnesty International’s findings include: 
Background 
On 22 February 2019, largely peaceful mass demonstrations took place across Algeria, initially opposing then-President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. After Bouteflika stepped down, protests shifted to calling for a radical overhaul of the political system. 
In December 2019, Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected president and promised that his government would “consolidate democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights”.

Amnesty International is intervening in the appeal. It will argue that the Court must consider Canada’s international human rights law obligation to provide effective remedies for human rights violations, such as those caused by the failure to take appropriate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
Founded in 1979, Environnement Jeunesse (EnJeu) is a Montreal-based non-profit focusing on raising awareness and encouraging advocacy among Quebec youth on environmental issues. In November 2018, EnJeu filed an application for authorization to bring a class action lawsuit against the Canadian government on behalf of all Quebecers under the age of 35. It argued that the Canadian government is violating the rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms by failing to meet greenhouse gas emission targets that are sufficient to effectively combat the climate crisis. 
In July 2019, a Quebec Superior Court judge rejected EnJeu’s request to authorize its class action, ruling that it did not meet the requirements to proceed as a class action. In addition to questioning the “theoretical nature” of the violations, the Court also addressed the “arbitrary and inappropriate” cut off age of 35 and whether or not EnJeu had the authority to act on behalf of minors under the age of 18.  
EnJeu has appealed the decision which will be heard by the Quebec Court of Appeal today.  Amnesty International (AI) was granted intervener status in the appeal. It will urge the Court of Appeal to consider Canada’s international human rights law obligations towards children and youth when determining whether the class action ought to be permitted to proceed. 
According to Fiona Koza, of Amnesty International’s Canadian section, “the climate crisis is one of the most pressing human rights issues of our time”. Koza adds “that is why we are intervening in this appeal – to support a human rights-based approach to climate litigation and to ensure that the Government of Canada ceases to violate the fundamental rights of Canadian children and youth, by failing to put in place the necessary measures to address the climate crisis”. 
AI is represented by Giacomo Zucchi and Audrey Mayrand from Power Law and Anne Levesque from the University of Ottawa. The legal team is acting on a pro bono basis. Members of the media who wish to listen to the oral arguments are invited to contact the Québec Court of Appeal in Montreal to obtain the audio link.

Amnesty International (AI), the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), and The Canadian Council of Churches (CCC) will once again join individual refugee claimants as their lawyers reiterate to the court that the STCA violates the right to life, liberty, and security of the person, as well as equality rights guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
“Many refugee claimants are not safe in the US, and do not benefit from the same protection that they would receive in Canada,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “In July 2020, the Federal Court ruled that sending refugee claimants back to the US, where they face detention and mistreatment, shocks the conscience of Canadians, and that being detained in the US exposes these refugee claimants to increased risks of return to persecution. We look forward to the Federal Court of Appeal reaffirming the strong legal conclusion drawn from the clear and extensive evidence that was before the Federal Court.” 
Refugee protection in the US drastically deteriorated under the Trump administration, but many laws and policies that violate refugee rights preexisted his administration, and will not be easily reversed by the new Biden administration. Indeed, AI, the CCR and the CCC have been challenging the STCA since before it was signed and won a previous Federal Court ruling finding the US unsafe for refugees in 2007 (though this decision was subsequently overturned on appeal, based on a technicality). Under the Biden administration, continuing concerns include: 
“Every day that the Agreement remains in force, people are at risk of being sent back to detention and potential deportation to persecution,” said Dorota Blumczynska, CCR President. “The US has never been safe for all refugees, and the fact that President Biden is in the White House does not change that. Women are particularly affected, because of US policies that close the door on women fleeing gender-based violence.” 
At the Federal Court, the organizations submitted extensive evidence that the US system fails in many ways to protect refugees, and that people turned back from Canada under the STCA are at risk of being sent in turn by the US to face persecution, torture and even death in their home countries. 
“Hospitality is a core value of Canadians and they expect people who are seeking protection in Canada to be received, welcomed, heard and treated with respect, not returned to face detention,” said Pastor Peter Noteboom, General Secretary of The Canadian Council of Churches. 
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, most refugee claimants who arrive at an official border post seeking protection in Canada are denied entry and turned back to the US. Because the agreement only applies at official border crossings, many refugees have been forced to cross the border in between ports of entry, sometimes in perilous conditions. Withdrawing from the Agreement would not only ensure that Canada meets its legal obligations, but would also allow people to present themselves in an orderly way at ports of entry, ending the need for irregular crossings.

“The leaders of G7 nations are shooting themselves in the foot by failing to ensure the equal distribution of coronavirus vaccines globally,” said Netsanet Belay, Research and Advocacy Director at Amnesty International. 
“Giving money to COVAX, though welcome, is not enough. And suggestions like sharing a paltry five percent of their vaccine supplies with poor countries are just insultingly small. 
“The promise of “building back better” rings hollow when G7 nations are the major culprits in blocking a proposal at the World Trade Organisation to suspend intellectual property rights during the pandemic, which would make it easier for other countries and companies to manufacture vaccines. 
“Nor has any G7 country pressed vaccine producers, whom they have funded with vast sums of public money, to share their knowledge and technology through the World Health Organization and therefore allow more vaccines to be produced. 
“It is outrageous that these rich nations who have already hoarded most of the world’s vaccine supply are preventing others from producing more of this life-saving medicine.” 
The G7 nations, including the European Union, have bought up over half the world’s vaccine supply, despite representing just 13% of the world’s population, and have enough doses on order to vaccinate their populations almost three times over. To date, half the world’s vaccine doses have been administered in these countries, while 130 countries have yet to administer a single shot. 
“This is an abject moral failure and will ultimately come to harm G7 countries,” said Netsanet Belay. 
“As long as the virus continues to spread and mutate elsewhere, no one is safe until we are all safe. We are calling on G7 leaders to recognize the unique position they are in to change the course of this pandemic and do everything in their power to remove the roadblocks to scaling up global vaccine production.”

Over half (52%) of the world’s vaccine doses have been administered in these countries, while over 130 countries have not yet administered a single dose.  
G7 countries have provided funds to international initiatives such as COVAX that aim to provide vaccines to 20% of people in low-income countries but have blocked other measures that would enable more vaccines to be produced.

I was never charged, let alone convicted, of any crime. The only independent judge I ever faced during my ordeal had ordered my release after seeing the secret evidence that even I wasn’t allowed to see.”Former Guantánamo detainee Mohamedou Slahi, referred to as “The Mauritanian” by intelligence officials 
In early February 2021, the Biden administration launched a formal review of the future of the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay. Will there be a genuine commitment to truth, accountability and remedy? 
Almost 800 men have passed through the US detention facility at Guantánamo Bay. As the facility enters its 20th year, 40 Muslim men remain there facing indefinite detention. Two of them have been there since the facility opened on January 11, 2020, and fifteen since that first year. All 40 men have been held for over 12 years. At least 24 of them were held in secret CIA custody prior to their transfer to Guantánamo, some for over four years. 
Six men have been approved for transfer, but no efforts are being made to relocate them to a country where their human rights are not at risk. The last detainee to leave Guantánamo did so in 2018, based on a plea agreement from 2014. The slow moving Military Commissions set up to bring detainees to trial have only dealt with about a dozen cases and offer no actual justice to anyone involved: they are inherently unfair and deny detainees fair trial rights. 
But if we are looking at the statistics, this is perhaps the starkest one: the number of people held accountable for torture or enforced disappearance – crimes under international law – committed by US personnel against detainees? Zero. 
If anyone still needs persuasion that Guantánamo Bay should be shut down once and for all, the release of The Mauritanian is a timely reminder. 
Mohamedou Slahi was arrested in Mauritania in November 2001, then subjected to rendition to Jordan, where he was held for eight months.  He was transferred to Bagram in Afghanistan in July 2002, then finally to Guantánamo on August 4, 2002. 
In Guantánamo during 2003, Mohamedou Slahi was allegedly deprived of sleep for some 70 days straight, subjected to strobe lighting and continuous loud heavy metal music, threats against him and his family, intimidation by dog, cold temperatures, dousing with cold water, physical assaults, and food deprivation. He was also allegedly subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment in Jordan, Bagram, and during his transfers. In April 2010, a federal judge ordered his release, noting that there is “ample evidence” that Mohamedou Slahi was subjected to “extensive and severe mistreatment at Guantánamo”. It would be six more years before Mohamedou Slahi would return to Mauritania, where he continues to face restrictions on his freedom of movement and ongoing demonization by the US government. 
In 1999, Mohamedou Slahi moved from Germany to Canada, but left in January 2000 to return to Mauritania after what he describes as repeated harassment and interrogation by the Canadian officials. Throughout the following years, he would repeatedly be told that inaccurate information and questions provided by Canadian officials played a role in his interrogations and ongoing detention. He believes he was interrogated in 2003 by officials posing as RCMP officers — something that was known to have happened to Canadian citizen Omar Khadr at around the same time. The role of Canadian officials has never been investigated.

Responding to the conviction Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director, Natalya Zviagina, said:  
“This decision is a travesty of justice. Anastasia Shevchenko has committed no crime. She should have never been deprived of liberty in the first place, as she was criminally persecuted solely for peacefully exercising her human rights. Her conviction must be quashed.”  
“Anastasia Shevchenko has already suffered unimaginably at the hands of Russia’s deeply flawed justice system.  She has been under house arrest for over two years, and been subjected to humiliation and intrusive surveillance in her own home. Tragically, Anastasia’s teenage daughter died during the early days of her house arrest and Anastasia was not permitted to be with her in her final days.   
“Anastasia Shevchenko has been held hostage by a cynical, cruel, and inhumane system whose sole purpose is to suppress, intimidate and crush Russia’s bravest and strongest activists. And she will now have a criminal record.   
“The Russian authorities’ politically motivated persecution of peaceful activists must stop immediately. The discriminatory laws on “undesirable organizations” and “foreign agents”, which have been wantonly abused to crush peaceful dissent, must be abolished.”  
“Russian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all those detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. Authorities should respect, protect, promote and fulfil the human rights of everyone including the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”  
Background  
On 18 February, the Oktyabrsky District Court of Rostov-on-Don (southern Russia) convicted prisoner of conscience Anastasia Shevchenko, former co-ordinator of the Open Russia civic movement, under Article 284.1 of the Russian Criminal Code (“organizing the activities of an undesirable organization”) and sentenced her to four-year suspended imprisonment.  
Anastasia Shevchenko was the first person in Russia to be criminally charged under the law on “undesirable organizations” that came into force in May 2015. The law gives the government the power to arbitrarily ban activities of foreign or international NGOs in Russia, under vaguely defined security pretext and without any judicial review, and criminalize any further association with such organizations, however tenuous. This law was deployed to ban the Open Russia movement, founded by exiled critic and former prisoner of conscience Mikhail Khodorkovsky, alongside 30 other foreign organizations.

The report, Old ghosts in new garb: Sri Lanka’s return to fear, exposes how the Sri Lankan government has targeted human rights organisations, media, lawyers, political opponents, and law enforcement officers in a concerted bid to suppress opposing voices and hamper the transitional justice process for crimes committed during the country’s 30-year armed conflict.   
“Over the past year, the Sri Lankan government has radically transformed the country’s civic space, which is now defined by an increasing hostility and intolerance towards dissenting voices,” said David Griffiths, Director of the Office of the Secretary General at Amnesty International.    
“People from all walks of life have been threatened, intimidated, harassed and jailed, simply for expressing views or doing their jobs in ways that displease the authorities. The Sri Lankan government must cease this campaign against dissent and respect its obligations under international law to protect freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, the right to personal security, and freedom from arbitrary detention.”  
Since withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council-driven justice and reconciliation process for conflict-era crimes in February 2020, the authorities have cracked down on those pursuing justice while deliberately hindering ongoing efforts to secure justice and accountability.   
Amnesty International is calling on the UN Human Rights Council to implement the recommendations of a damning report on Sri Lanka published by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights last month, when it meets from 22 February to 23 March. This includes more robust monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation, and the collection and preservation of evidence for future prosecutions.  
“The international community must not turn a blind eye to the deteriorating human rights situation in Sri Lanka, which is being abetted by the government’s regressive moves on justice and accountability. The Human Rights Council must take steps to end the cycle of impunity by holding the Sri Lankan government fully to account, and launching a new internationally agreed justice process,” said David Griffiths.   
Justice and Accountability 
Amnesty International’s findings reveal a pattern of targeting those who have played an active role in investigating, documenting, litigating, or reporting on human rights violations and abuses, and advocating on behalf of the victims, including at least six incidents where lawyers were targeted.  
The country’s draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act was used, among others, against Hejaaz Hizbullah, a prominent minority rights advocate and lawyer, who has been detained for 10 months, without a shred of evidence of wrongdoing produced before a court.  
Attorney Achala Senevirathne, who appeared on behalf of families of the disappeared in an enforced disappearance case, has been threatened with violence and sexualized abuse not only on social media but also by officials accused in the case.  
Criminal investigators who pursued justice for crimes under international law have also come under increased scrutiny. The former director of the Criminal Investigations Department was demoted and later arrested for allegedly fabricating evidence in a case. He remains in custody and believes he is being targeted in reprisal for leading investigations in cases of abuses allegedly committed by the armed forces.  
Members of the military leadership that were in command during the last phase of the war, when allegations of human rights and humanitarian law violations are widespread, were rewarded with promotions and positions of power under the new administration, including to civilian positions. This has had a chilling effect on victims demanding justice.  
The report also details how legislative amendments brought by government have undermined any credible avenues locally available for justice, and how President-appointed Commissions of Inquiry are attempting to reverse accountability for perpetrators of human rights violations.   
Assault on civic space  
The Sri Lankan government did not waste any time in introducing new instruments and techniques to muzzle dissent.   
State actors have led smear campaigns against NGOs and human rights organisations, while journalists have received death threats and have been summoned for investigations and interrogations after exposing human rights abuses.   
Visits by state security officials to the offices of human rights NGOs have increased over the past fourteen months. Amnesty International recorded 18 such visits in that period, during which officials made enquiries about registration details, staff and donors’ bank details. Some staff members were even visited at their private residences.   
Laws are also being misused to stifle free speech, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act, which was used to arrest and detain Ramzy Razeek for more than five months without charge or proper access to a lawyer, for a Facebook post in which he criticised the forced cremation of COVID-19 victims and called for an ideological struggle using the pen and keyboard as weapons.  
Background  
The report, Old ghosts in new garb: Sri Lanka’s return to fear, is available here.  
The OHCHR report, published on 27 January 2021, is available to download here.  The Human Rights Council will meet for its 46th session from 22 February to 23 March, during which Canada, Germany, Montenegro, North Macedonia and the UK – the current core group of states leading on Sri Lanka – are expected to present a resolution in follow-up to the OHCHR report.

Although neighbours denounced police presence since 6 January, two days later, as many as 650 agents of Venezuelan security forces were deployed in La Vega parish, southwestern Caracas, due to alleged clashes between gangs and police. Officers deployed included the Special Action Forces (FAES) and other members of the Bolivarian National Police, who have been criticized in the past for the systematic extrajudicial executions of young men living in poverty. 
“There are solid reasons to believe that at least 14 of the deaths in La Vega between January 6 and 9 were likely extrajudicial executions, a crime under international law that might constitute crimes against humanity. Despite repeated condemnation by international organizations and the courageous Venezuelan civil society, these crimes continue year after year, hand in hand with utter impunity,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Amnesty International verified nine videos filmed between 8 and 9 January showing police activity in the area of La Vega. Videos filmed on the morning of 8 January show a convoy of police vehicles driving south down Avenida O’Higgins in Caracas toward the La Vega area. Another video shows police and their vehicles by Av. Guzmán Blanco, at the border of La Vega parish. A video posted by local media also on 8 January shows a heavy police presence near the Gimnasio Vertical in the La Vega parish. Police vehicles, weapons, armour and UOTE (Special Tactics Operational Unit by its acronym in Spanish) badges are also visible in the video. Another video filmed on 8 January shows the scene at Calle los Bloques near the centre of La Vega in which gunshots can be heard. A photograph taken from the same vantage point reveals that the vehicles shown in the video are police trucks and that there is a heavy police presence in the area. 
Another uploaded video of the incidents in La Vega is filmed around Calle 1 de Mayo, deep in La Vega. At about the 20-second mark, a gunshot can be heard and a police officer ducks. At about the 30-second mark, the same officer can be seen aiming his gun while seeking cover where other police are waiting. CPNB (Bolivarian National Police Corps, in Spanish) and Bolivarian National Police insignia can be clearly seen on some of the uniforms. Other videos show the same street as gunshots ring out, with one showing armed police patrol the area. A final video, filmed from above the street, shows a police pick-up truck driving westward along Calle Zulia out of La Vega parish with what appears to be bodies in the back. 
At least 14 people died during the operation, which lasted four days, until 9 January, with reports of an additional 10 fatal victims of the police’s actions. Two of the victims reportedly were 17-year-old adolescents. 
Human rights organizations and residents of La Vega denied that the deaths were the result of the confrontation and claimed that they were mostly extrajudicial executions. Other deaths could be due to “stray bullets.” There have been no reports of the death or injury of any members of the security forces involved. 
Amnesty International obtained images that apparently show 14 of the deceased bodies in La Vega. An external forensic pathologist independently verified the details of the injuries sustained and confirmed that seven bodies had gunshot wounds over the heart and a further two bodies had single gunshot wounds immediately above the heart. Two bodies had single gunshot wounds to the head. 
“The location and number of gunshot wounds on the bodies of the victims in La Vega make the official version that these deaths occurred in a confrontation with crossfire even less credible. Instead, they support Amnesty International’s findings on a policy of systematic extrajudicial executions and other crimes under international law in Venezuela. With no sign of any impartial and independent investigation into these events, the examination of the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court becomes more necessary than ever,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
As of the conclusion of Amnesty International’s investigation, there had been no public statements by the Attorney General’s Office, nor the Ombudsman’s Office, on the opening of an independent, prompt and impartial investigation to clarify the truth and individual criminal responsibilities regarding these events. And even if such a step was taken, its credibility would be in question after years of complaints about the lack of impartiality and independence of the Venezuelan judicial system by international organizations, including Amnesty International. 
“The alleged extrajudicial executions that we have investigated in La Vega could constitute crimes against humanity, which involve the authorities at the highest level, including Nicolás Maduro. The policies of repression and social control are based on impunity promoted and enabled by the same authorities that have committed massive violations of human rights in Venezuela,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Additional Information 
Local organizations with whom Amnesty International had contact collected the testimonies of the victims’ families and many of the accounts corroborate the modus operandi that Amnesty International has repeatedly documented in the past. Security forces enter houses without an arrest or search warrant, immobilize the young person inside the house, without any confrontation, and upon leaving – or even still inside the property – they execute them with one or two shots to a highly vulnerable area of ​​the body, such as the thorax or the head. Subsequently, the officials alter the crime scene, simulate a clash, or transfer the body to avoid a crime scene investigation, and classify the death as “resistance to authority.” 
This pattern of extrajudicial executions carried out by state security forces that Amnesty International has been able to verify has been widely denounced by international organizations and human rights organizations for several years. In particular, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, has recommended the dissolution of the FAES due to the numerous reports of extrajudicial executions since its creation. The United Nations’ Fact-Finding Mission for Venezuela determined in its first report that: “the extrajudicial executions [carried out by the FAES and the Scientific, Criminal and Criminal Investigations Corps] have not [been] isolated acts, committed by individuals acting alone. There is information about an agreed practice to kill individuals with criminal records even if they offered no resistance during detention, including in order to demonstrate “results” in the fight against criminality.” This Mission determined that between 2014 and 2020, in Venezuela there existed “a policy to combat crime, including by eliminating individuals perceived as ‘criminals’ through extrajudicial execution.”

Amnesty International, the Canadian Council for Refugees, and the Canadian Council of Churches, will once again join individual litigants in arguing the agreement is harmful to those seeking protection north of the US-Canada border. 
In July 2020, the Federal Court ruled that the Safe Third Country Agreement is unconstitutional, as it violates the s. 7 Charter right to life, liberty and security of the person. Civil society groups and refugees have long maintained that the agreement violates human rights, because many refugee claimants returned to the US are arbitrarily held in appalling conditions in immigration detention centres or county jails, and are not eligible for the same legal protections that are available in Canada. 
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, most refugee claimants who arrive at an official border post seeking protection in Canada are denied entry and turned back to the United States. Because the agreement only applies at official border crossings, many refugees have crossed the border in between ports of entry, sometimes in perilous conditions. 
Date: Tuesday, February 23 and Wednesday, February 24 
Time: 9:30 a.m. 
How to access the hearing: Journalists and members of the public wishing to access a remote hearing should email Information@fca-caf.gc.ca and provide the following information in relation to the hearing that they would like to view remotely: case name (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v Canadian Council for Refugees et al), case number (A-204-20) and hearing date (23 and 24 February).

We hope the implementation of this new declaration, announced by Foreign Affairs Minister Marc Garneau on Monday, will be followed by a binding implementation plan.   
The declaration, and Canada’s effort to build a large coalition of countries to respect international human rights norms, is a welcome step. However, its narrow focus on arbitrary detention over diplomatic matters, namely exercising leverage over a foreign government, does not protect all prisoners abroad, cautions Ketty Nivyaba​ndi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English section: “All forms of arbitrary detentions are contrary to international law. It is important to emphasize that the calls made in this declaration, such as rule of law and respect for human rights, including access to effective remedies and prevention of torture and other ill-treatment, are applicable to any arbitrary detention, regardless of their purpose.”  
For France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone, “Such a declaration signed by a large number of countries around the world helps put pressure on governments to fight against arbitrary detention”.  
Amnesty International calls on states to collaborate and support established human rights multilateral mechanisms to address the practice of arbitrary detentions. “We will closely monitor how well current signatory states live up to their principles and refuse to deal with states that practice arbitrary detention as a means of exerting diplomatic pressure”, concludes France-Isabelle Langlois.

While attending the event, I was incredibly struck by the idea of being able to help people facing injustices around the world and wanted to get involved myself. 
After continuously attending Amnesty International gatherings throughout the year, I applied for and became a National Youth Organizer for Amnesty International Canada. As an organizer, I have helped plan and facilitate events, such as movie screenings and letter writing sessions, as well as spoken to audiences to inform and engage them in Amnesty campaigns. 
The initiative that has had the most impact on my life is the Amnesty International club that I created at my high school. We have hosted various events, including our own Write for Rights, which aim to educate my peers and tell them how to contribute to Amnesty’s work. Whenever we have meetings, there are students who share their experiences with activism and how it has impacted their lives. 
Hearing these stories drive me to continue and expand my work with Amnesty International. I think change starts in communities, so I strive to provide opportunities through my work with Amnesty International for people in my school and in my area to get involved in creating change.

0,Libya: Ten years after uprising abusive militias evade justice and instead reap rewards,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/libya-ten-years-after-uprising-abusive-militias-evade-justice-and-instead-reap-rewards/,"A decade after the overthrow of Muammar al-Gaddafi, justice has yet to be delivered to victims of war crimes and serious human rights violations including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, forced displacement and abductions committed by militias and armed groups, Amnesty...","A decade after the overthrow of Muammar al-Gaddafi, justice has yet to be delivered to victims of war crimes and serious human rights violations including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture, forced displacement and abductions committed by militias and armed groups, Amnesty International said today. Libyan authorities have promoted and legitimized leaders of militias that have been responsible for heinous acts of abuse, instead of ensuring accountability and redress for violations committed both since al-Gaddafi’s fall and under his rule. 
The protests that began in February 2011 were met with violence and quickly escalated into a full-fledged armed conflict, which following an air campaign by NATO, led to al-Gaddafi’s demise. Since then, Libya has been engulfed by lawlessness and impunity for war crimes committed by rival militias and armed groups. Successive Libyan governments have promised to uphold the rule of law and respect human rights, but each has failed to rein in perpetrators. 
“For a decade, accountability and justice in Libya were sacrificed in the name of peace and stability. Neither were achieved. Instead, those responsible for violations have enjoyed impunity and have even been integrated into state institutions and treated with deference,” said Diana Eltahawy, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“Unless those responsible for violations are brought to justice, rather than rewarded with positions of power, the violence, chaos, systematic human rights abuses and endless suffering of civilians that have characterized post-Gaddafi Libya will continue unabated.” 
Since 2014, Libya has been fragmented between two rival entities competing for legitimacy, governance, and territorial control. UN-sponsored talks led to the announcement of a new unity government on 6 February, which has the task of holding national elections in Libya later this year. 
“We call on parties to the conflict in Libya and the incoming unity government to ensure that those suspected of committing crimes under international law are not appointed to positions where they can continue to commit abuses and entrench impunity. Individuals who have been accused of war crimes should be suspended from positions of authority pending the outcome of independent, effective investigations,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
Leader of militia responsible for unlawful killings and torture promoted 
Since al-Gaddafi’s fall, successive governments have integrated militias under ministries of defence, interior or as separate entities answerable to the presidency and included them on official payroll. 
In January, the Presidential Council of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) appointed Abu Salim Central Security Force militia leader, Abdel Ghani al-Kikli, also known as Gheniwa, as head of a new entity called the “Stability Support Authority,” which reports directly to the presidency. 
Gheniwa has emerged as one of the most powerful militia leaders in Tripoli since 2011, in one of its most populous neighbourhoods, Abu Salim. 
In his new role, Gheniwa and his agency will have broad – and vague -powers including law enforcement responsibilities, such as arresting individuals in “national security” cases. Yet Amnesty International has documented war crimes and other serious human rights violations by forces under his command over the past 10 years. 
In 2013 and 2014, Amnesty International researchers found that detainees held by Gheniwa-controlled security forces had been subjected to abductions, torture and other ill-treatment, in some cases leading to  deaths in custody. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) had similar findings, including concerning deaths in custody due to torture, while the Panel of Experts on Libya also reported attacks against civilians by these forces. 
The GNA had already provided legitimacy and salaries to Gheniwa’s militia as early as 2016 by integrating it under its Ministry of Interior, further facilitating unlawful killings, abductions and torture, including sexual violence against women detainees. 
Under international law, a military commander may be responsible for the crimes committed by subordinates if the commander is aware of the crimes, or should have been aware of them, and fails to prevent or punish them. 
Widespread impunity  
Gheniwa and his Abu Salim forces are not the only ones being rewarded despite their grim human rights’ records. 
Haitham al-Tajouri, who headed the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade (TRB) militia, which has been involved in arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and torture, was appointed as Gheniwa’s deputy in January 2021. 
In Tripoli, the Special Deterrence Forces (al-Radaa), under the command of Abdel Raouf Kara, were integrated into the Ministry of Interior in 2018 and then moved under the Presidential Council in September 2020 by the GNA. Amnesty International and other bodies, including the UN, have documented al-Radaa’s involvement in kidnappings, enforced disappearances, torture, unlawful killings, forced labour, attacks on the right to freedom of expression and the targeting of women and the LGBTQ+ community. 
In September 2020, the GNA also promoted Emad al-Trabulsi, who led the “Public Security” militia, to deputy head of intelligence, despite the militia’s involvement in crimes against migrants and refugees, including enforced disappearances. 
Successive governments have also failed to bring to justice members of Misrata-based militias responsible for war crimes including attacks against civilians such as the 2011 attack on the town of Tawergha, in which around 40,000 people were forcibly displaced. Misrata-based militias have also subjected its residents to widespread arbitrary arrests, unlawful killings, torture, sometimes leading to detainees’ death, and enforced disappearances. 
The Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF), an armed group in control of most of eastern and central Libya, has failed to arrest militia leader Mahmoud al-Werfalli who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC),  for murdering 33 individuals, and instead promoted him to lieutenant of the Saiqa Brigade. Several other individuals against whom the ICC has issued arrest warrants on suspicion of crimes against humanity, or subjected to UN Security Council sanctions for their role in human trafficking, remain at large or have even fought alongside the GNA or LAAF. 
The LAAF has also continued to harbor leaders of the Ninth Brigade, known as “al-Kaniat forces”, despite their involvement in mass murders and the dumping of bodies in mass graves, torture and abductions in the city of Tarhuna. 
Third party states also continue to hinder accountability. For example, Egypt continued to harbor ICC-wanted al-Gaddafi-era security chief, Khalid Al-Tuhamy until his death in February 2021. Turkey, Russia, UAE and Egypt have all been involved in violating the UN arms embargo on Libya. 
In June 2020, with the backing of the GNA, the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to establish a Fact-Finding Mission to investigate violations and abuses of international human rights law and violations of international humanitarian law committed by all parties to the conflict in Libya. 
“Accountability must be a central component of the political process in Libya. All parties to the conflict must remove those reasonably suspected of war crimes and human rights abuses from their ranks and fully cooperate with the UN Fact-Finding Mission. The international community must also ensure that the Mission has the sufficient resources, administrative support and time to complete its work,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
Impunity has been deeply entrenched over the past 10 years.  A 2012 law provided blanket immunity to members of militias for acts committed with the aim of “protecting the 17 February Revolution”.  Libya’s judicial system remains dysfunctional and ineffective, with judges and prosecutors risking assassination and abductions for doing their jobs. 
Accountability also remains elusive for crimes committed under al-Gaddafi’s rule, including the 1996 massacre of prisoners in Abu Salim prison. Efforts to bring Gaddafi-era officials to account were marred by serious fair trial breaches, torture and other ill-treatment and enforced disappearances.

Responding to the escalating reprisals against dissenters, Aisha Jung, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner on Belarus said:  
“Having imprisoned or forcibly exiled practically anyone associated with the political opposition in the country, the Belarusian authorities have now set their sights on human rights defenders and journalists whose only crime has been to document the wave of gross human rights violations committed by security forces following last August’s contested presidential election.  
“This is clearly a centrally-organized and targeted attempt to decimate the country’s independent media and human rights organizations through terrifying home raids, harassment and persecution. The authorities are bent on preventing them and discouraging others from carrying out their critical and legitimate human rights and journalistic work. The shocking and unprecedented lawlessness that we have witnessed from the state since last year flies in the face of widespread international concern and criticism.   
“We condemn in the strongest possible terms these brazen attacks under totally false premises and call for all those detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights to be immediately and unconditionally released. People in Belarus and the international community will continue to do all we can to stand for human rights and counter the authorities’ tightening stranglehold over Belarusian civil society.”   
Background  
Police began their raids early in the morning of 16 February on the offices and homes of staff members of the Viasna Human Rights Center, the Belarusian Association of Journalists, the REP independent trade union and dozens of civil society activists.   
The raids were carried out in Minsk, Homel, Mahilyou, Vitsebsk and Brest as part of unfounded criminal proceedings under Article 342 of the Criminal Code of Belarus (“organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order”), which the authorities launched to target activists and monitors of mass peaceful protests. According to Belarus’ Investigative Committee, the investigation is aimed at “establishing the circumstances of the financing of protest activities.”

The Court found that the Ogale and Bille communities can bring their legal claims for clean-up and compensation against Royal Dutch Shell plc (RDS) and its Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC).  
The ruling sets an important precedent for holding other multinationals to account. Mark Dummett, Director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme, said: 
“This landmark ruling could spell the end of a long chapter of impunity for Shell, and for other multinationals who commit human rights abuses overseas. Shell’s own records show the extent of the oil spills which continue to ravage the land of the Ogale and Bille communities, poisoning their water and destroying livelihoods. 
“But until now, Shell has managed to avoid cleaning up or paying compensation by maintaining that it is not responsible for the actions of its Nigerian subsidiary – which it owns in full. Shell is happy to reap huge profits from Nigerian land but denies all knowledge when asked to address the human cost. Today’s ruling has shaken the foundations of a business model based on shirking responsibility. 
“The fight is not yet won, but this ruling is an important step towards justice. It is a testament to the persistence and courage of the Ogale and Bille communities, who have refused to accept Shell’s excuses and have fought for years get Shell in court. Today’s outcome could pave the way for justice for the many others who live with the consequences of Shell’s pollution. After decades of impunity, Niger Delta communities may finally get to see Shell in the dock.” 
Background 
In 2015, 40,000 people from the Ogale and Bille communities of the Niger Delta began legal action against Shell in the UK, alleging serious harm to their human rights and well-being. In 2017 the High Court in London held that RDS is merely a holding company which does not exercise any control over the operations of its Nigerian subsidiary and has, therefore, no duty of care towards the communities affected by those operations. In 2018 the Court of Appeal also found that the English courts do not have jurisdiction over the claims, but allowed the Ogale and Bille communities to appeal at the Supreme Court.

The...","Ahead of tomorrow’s deadline for the US to submit their appeal against the UK decision not to extradite Julian Assange, Amnesty International USA have added their voice to a letter sent to the US Department of Justice calling on President Biden to drop charges against the Wikileaks founder. The letter states: 
“We, the undersigned press freedom, civil liberties, and international human rights advocacy organizations, write today to share our profound concern about the ongoing criminal and extradition proceedings relating to Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, under the Espionage Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. 
While our organizations have different perspectives on Mr Assange and his organization, we share the view that the government’s indictment of him poses a grave threat to press freedom both in the United States and abroad. We urge you to drop the appeal of the decision by Judge Vanessa Baraitser of the Westminster Magistrates’ Court to reject the Trump administration’s extradition request. 
We also urge you to dismiss the underlying indictment. The indictment of Mr Assange threatens press freedom because much of the conduct described in the indictment is conduct that journalists engage in routinely—and that they must engage in in order to do the work the public needs them to do. Journalists at major news publications regularly speak with sources, ask for clarification or more documentation, and receive and publish documents the government considers secret. In our view, such a precedent in this case could effectively criminalize these common journalistic practices. In addition, some of the charges included in the indictment turn entirely on Mr Assange’s decision to publish classified information. 
News organizations frequently and necessarily publish classified information in order to inform the public of matters of profound public significance. We appreciate that the government has a legitimate interest in protecting bona fide national security interests, but the proceedings against Mr Assange jeopardize journalism that is crucial to democracy. 
The Trump administration positioned itself as an antagonist to the institution of a free and unfettered press in numerous ways. Its abuse of its prosecutorial powers was among the most disturbing. We are deeply concerned about the way that a precedent created by prosecuting Assange could be leveraged—perhaps by a future administration — against publishers and journalists of all stripes. 
Major news organizations share this concern, which is why the announcement of charges against Assange in May 2019 was met with vociferous and nearly universal condemnation from virtually every major American news outlet, even though many of those news outlets have criticized Mr Assange in the past. 
It is our understanding that senior officials in the Obama administration shared this concern as well. Former Department of Justice spokesperson Matthew Miller told the Washington Post in 2013, “The problem the department has always had in investigating Julian Assange is there is no way to prosecute him for publishing information without the same theory being applied to journalists.” 
It was reportedly the press freedom implications of any prosecution of Mr. Assange that led Attorney General Eric Holder’s Justice Department to decide against indicting him after considering doing so. It is unfortunately the case that press freedom is under threat globally. Now more than ever, it is crucial that we protect a robust and adversarial press—what Judge Murray Gurfein in the Pentagon Papers case memorably called a “cantankerous press, an obstinate press, a ubiquitous press” in the United States and abroad. With this end in mind, we respectfully urge you to forgo the appeal of Judge Baraitser’s ruling, and to dismiss the indictment of Mr Assange.

0,Saudi Arabia: Withdrawal of death sentences for three Shi’a activists arrested as teenagers a welcome move,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/saudi-arabia-withdrawal-of-death-sentences-for-three-shia-activists-arrested-as-teenagers-a-welcome-move/,"The Saudi Arabian Specialized Criminal Court has commuted the death sentences of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon, who were arrested as teenagers and convicted after unfair trials, and re-sentenced them to 10-year prison terms inclusive of time served, meaning that they could be...","The Saudi Arabian Specialized Criminal Court has commuted the death sentences of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon, who were arrested as teenagers and convicted after unfair trials, and re-sentenced them to 10-year prison terms inclusive of time served, meaning that they could be released in 2022. Responding to the news, Amnesty International’s Deputy 
Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Lynn Maalouf said: 
“The news that these young men will not face execution no doubt comes as an immense relief for them and their families after several agonizing years on death row. 
“All three young men were convicted following grossly unfair trials based on so-called ‘confessions’ extracted through torture. They spent prime years of their lives suffering the dire consequences of an unfair trial, and what must have been a painful ordeal separated from their loved ones for nearly 10 years. 
“Use of the death penalty for offences committed by people under 18 years of age at the time of the offence is a flagrant violation of international human rights law. 
“The decision to commute the young men’s death sentences to prison terms comes after a significant and welcome decrease in the authorities’ use of the death penalty last year. This must serve as a clear turning point for Saudi Arabia. The authorities must ensure this marks a definitive end to the practice of sentencing juvenile offenders to death regardless of the nature of the crime, and must build on these reforms by taking steps towards abolishing the death penalty completely for all crimes.” 
Background:  
Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon were arrested separately in 2012, aged 17, 16 and 17 respectively. They were arrested for offences committed while participating in anti-government protests in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. All three were sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) in 2014 after flawed trials. Since then Amnesty International has been campaigning for the authorities not to execute them. 
In August 2020, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor ordered a review of their sentences. Their death sentences have been commuted to 10 years in prison, according to the Saudi Arabian Human Rights Commission. 
Last month, the Saudi Human Rights Commission announced that the number of executions in 2020 dropped by 85% compared to 2019. It attributed that in part to a moratorium on executions for drug-related offences, “giving more non-violent criminals a second chance”. This moratorium had not previously been announced officially. 
In April 2020, Saudi Arabia issued a Royal Order announcing plans to end its use of the death penalty for people under the age of 18 in discretionary cases not involving the counter-terror law. This follows the issuing of a 2018 Law on Juveniles, which prevents judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those under 15 years old. These announcements must be followed by clear implementing regulations which do not exclude any minors from the reform.

“Loujain al-Hathloul’s release after a harrowing ordeal in prison in Saudi Arabia — lasting nearly three years — is an incredible relief, but long overdue. 
“Nothing can make up for the cruel treatment she has suffered, nor the injustice of her imprisonment. During her time in prison she was tortured and sexually harassed, held in solitary confinement and was denied access to her family for months at a time. Saudi Arabia’s authorities must ensure those responsible for her torture and other ill-treatment are brought to justice. They must also ensure she is not subjected to any further punitive measures such as a travel ban. 
“Loujain al-Hathloul should never have been forced to spend a single second behind bars. She has been vindictively punished for bravely defending women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, and for exercising her right to freedom of expression.” 
Background: 
On 28 December 2020, Loujain al-Hathloul was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison  – partially suspended by two years and ten months – by the Specialized Criminal Court. She was charged with “spying with foreign parties” and “conspiring against the kingdom” for promoting women’s rights and calling for the end of the male guardianship system in Saudi Arabia. 
Amnesty International is calling on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience detained solely for demanding reforms and defending basic rights. Those imprisoned include Mohammed al-Bajadi, founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and prominent human rights defender; and Salman al-Awda, a reformist cleric who faces a death sentence for expressing his opinion in a tweet.

Recognizing and protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples is crucial for respecting the human rights of all. 
We thank them for this history, perspective, and human rights argument in favour of legislation to adopt and implement the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into Canadian constitutional law. 
This is what we fought for: 
An open letter in support of implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
For more than two decades, Indigenous leaders and human rights advocates fought to have the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted by the United Nations. Our goal was always to use the Declaration to bring about fundamental changes for the treatment of Indigenous peoples around the world including in Canada. 
The Canadian Parliament is now debating a proposed new law that, if passed, would begin the process of collaborative implementation of the UN Declaration. 
This bill, Bill C-15: An Act Respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, is a unique opportunity to advance our rights and confront the harms to our people created by colonialism, racism and other forms of discrimination. 
This is what we fought for. 
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
The purpose of the UN Declaration was always to hold governments accountable for recognizing, respecting and upholding our inherent rights as Indigenous peoples. 
This includes the right to self-determination. 
During the long process of negotiating the UN Declaration, many national governments tried to change the text in ways that would water down this right. However, Indigenous peoples fought against any language that would create a lesser standard of self-determination – and we succeeded. 
Article 3 of the Declaration states that Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. There are no conditions or qualifiers in this Article. When you read the Declaration as a whole, it is also clear that the right to self-determination set out in Article 3 is the same right protected for all peoples in the UN Charter and the UN’s core human rights Treaties. 
The right to self-determination is a constant thread throughout the whole Declaration. It is found in articles that affirm our right to determine our own development strategies (Article 23) and to control our education systems (Article 14); our lands, territories and resources (Article 26); and our traditional knowledge (Article 31). 
The Declaration also protects against racism and discrimination, including in its affirmation that Indigenous persons have “an equal right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health (Article 24).” 
The Declaration was drafted with the awareness that Indigenous peoples in many regions of the world have entered into Treaties and other agreements recognizing their rights. The Declaration calls on states to honour, respect, and enforce such Treaties (Article 37). 
The Declaration also explicitly states that measures to implement the Declaration can never be used as an excuse to try to undermine or diminish any rights of Indigenous peoples, including those protected by Treaties. 
Bill C-15 is completely consistent with the UN Declaration. Bill C-15 does not attempt to interpret the UN Declaration or alter its status as a global human rights instrument. Bill C-15 is about the federal government living up to the standards contained in the Declaration. 
Bill C-15 builds on Bill C-262, the private Member’s bill tabled by Romeo Saganash and championed by Indigenous advocates across Canada. Bill C-262 was passed by the House of Commons in 2018 but it never reached the final stage of becoming law because of procedural manoeuvres by Conservative Senators. 
Bill C-15 requires the current government – and future governments – to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples to develop a national implementation plan with priorities and deadlines, as well as to bring federal laws into line with the requirements of the Declaration. 
These were the same key provisions found in C-262. However, Bill C-15 in some ways goes beyond Bill C-262, including the legal provision that an implementation plan “must include measures to address injustices, combat prejudice and eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination, including systemic discrimination.” 
The introductory paragraphs of Bill C-15, its preamble, recognize that self-determination is an inherent right of Indigenous peoples. The preamble also rejects all “doctrines, policies and practices” of racial superiority. This includes the doctrines of Discovery and Terra Nullius that were the foundation of Canada’s colonial laws and policies. 
It should be emphasized that the preamble has legal significance for the interpretation of the Bill and can be used by Indigenous peoples in any dealings with the federal government. 
Some commentators have mistakenly claimed that Bill C-15 tries to limit the Declaration to the confines of current interpretations of section 35 of the Constitution. This is false. Nowhere does the Bill limit how the Declaration can be interpreted and applied. 
The Bill does include a standard clause, known as a “non-derogation clause”, that says that the Bill itself cannot be interpreted in a way that would take away rights already recognized under Section 35. Indigenous peoples have fought to have non-derogation clauses included in all federal legislation concerning our rights. 
Other commentators have argued that Article 46(1) of the Declaration could be used to undermine Indigenous peoples’ rights, including self-determination and Indigenous peoples’ Treaties. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Declaration itself is clear that it cannot be used to diminish or take away rights. Furthermore, Bill C-15 contains strong language on self-determination and Treaty rights. This represents significant progress. 
When the Declaration was first brought to a vote at the United Nations, the Harper government tried to block its adoption. The federal government continued to oppose the Declaration for years before finally reversing its position. After Bill C-262 was passed by the House of Commons, a small group of Conservatives used stalling tactics to prevent it coming to a final vote in the Senate. Now that the federal government has brought forward the new implementation bill that it had promised, a group of provinces have begun lobbying against it. 
Advances in the recognition of Indigenous peoples’ rights continue to be opposed by those forces who want to keep our peoples’ in a state of colonial dependency. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of misinformation about the Declaration. 
In our view, as Indigenous activists, scholars and leaders who have been deeply engaged in the long struggle to advance the Declaration, passage of Bill C-15 would create an important foundation for confronting colonialism and addressing the urgent needs of our Nations and communities. We cannot allow misinformation to stand in the way of realizing our fundamental human rights. 
The opportunity to make fundamental progress in advancing the rights of Indigenous peoples is within our grasp. We must seize this moment.

0,Southern Africa: Homes become dangerous place for women and girls during COVID-19 lockdown,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/southern-africa-homes-become-dangerous-place-for-women-and-girls-during-covid-19-lockdown/,"During the COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by Southern African countries, some homes across the region became enclaves of cruelty, rape and violence for women and girls trapped with abusive family members and nowhere to report or escape the danger, Amnesty International said today in a new briefing....","During the COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by Southern African countries, some homes across the region became enclaves of cruelty, rape and violence for women and girls trapped with abusive family members and nowhere to report or escape the danger, Amnesty International said today in a new briefing. 
Harmful gender stereotypes embedded in social and cultural norms, which suggest that women must always submit to men or that a man who beats his wife does so because he loves her, have fueled the rise in violence against women and girls in Madagascar, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. As one activist in Mozambique said: “Girls are taught that husbands only beat their wives when they love them.” 
Amnesty International also found in its briefing, “Treated like furniture: Gender-based violence and COVID-19 response in Southern Africa”, that women and girls who dare to report violence and abuse risk social rejection for failing to conform to gender roles — and when they do speak out, their complaints are not taken seriously by authorities. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an escalation in gender-based violence against women and girls in Southern Africa. It has also magnified existing structural problems such as poverty, inequality, crime, high unemployment and systematic criminal justice failures,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“Lockdown measures meant that women could not escape abusive partners or leave their homes to seek protection. Across Southern Africa, women who suffered gender-based violence struggled to report abuse because both women and organizations working to provide protection and support to women were not seen as an “essential service”, and so faced severe restrictions of movement, resulting in them abandoning filing cases.” 
Of the five countries where gender-based violence was documented in this briefing, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe stand out as countries where support services to women and girls subjected to violence and abuse were not taken into consideration in the design of the measures to control the spread of COVID-19. 
Rape, beatings and killings during lockdown 
Within weeks of countries being on lockdown, violence against women increased sharply across the region. In the first week of the lockdown, the South African Police Service (SAPS) reported receiving 2,300 calls for help related to gender-based violence. By mid-June 2020, 21 women and children had been killed by intimate partners in the country. 
One emblematic case was the brutal murder of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule, who went missing on 4 June and was found four days later, stabbed and hanging from a tree in Johannesburg while eight months pregnant. 
In Mozambique, civil society organizations received unusually high numbers of domestic violence cases after the start of the state of emergency in March 2020. In one case, a man killed his wife and then himself on 6 June in Matola district in Maputo province.  
Horrifying details also emerged of the robbery, rape and murder of a Maputo Central Hospital employee on 31 May 2020. She was on her way home, late at night because of the scarcity of public transport during the state of emergency restrictions. 
In Zimbabwe, an organization that offers protection for women survivors of domestic violence, had documented 764 cases of gender-based violence in the first 11 days of the national lockdown. By 13 June 2020, the number was 2,768. 
One Zimbabwean woman, Maria* (not her real name), was violently thrown out of her home by her husband after he moved his mistress in during the lockdown. 
In Madagascar, the rise in poverty due to lockdown was a major factor for the increase in gender-based violence during the lockdown period, with women and girls becoming poorer, more economically dependent on abusive partners and therefore more exposed to abuse. 
Zambia was the only country that recorded a slight decrease in gender-based violence during the national lockdown compared to the same period in 2019, according to official police statistics. The country recorded a 10% decrease in the first quarter of 2020, which may reflect the fact that women were unable to call for help rather than a decline in gender-based violence cases. However, one NGO, Young Women’s Christian Association, recorded an increase in sexual violence cases during the first quarter of 2020. 
Barriers to justice  
The briefing identified several barriers to justice for victims and survivors of gender-based violence across Southern Africa. These include a lack of trust in the criminal justice system and secondary trauma which victims and survivors often suffer at the hands of authorities, including the police, and health services when they attempt to report cases. 
These barriers came into sharper focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. In South Africa for example, there has been public outrage about the institutional failures to administer justice for women and girls who are victims and survivors of gender-based violence, even though the country’s Domestic Violence Act of 1998 explicitly states that victims may lay criminal complaints against offenders. 
One rape survivor, Natasha* (not her real name) said violence against women had increased because “police don’t take gender-based violence victims seriously enough when they file cases”. 
South Africa’s Minister of Justice and Constitutional Development, Ronald Lamola, admitted on radio in June 2020 that there were weaknesses in the system that frequently failed victims of gender-based violence. 
In Mozambique, when a gender-based violence complaint is filed, police are required to open an investigation. However, like in South Africa, many victims are reluctant to come forward because of pressure from society to put up with domestic violence, financial dependence on the perpetrator, and a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system. 
According to civil society organisations, in some instances, police officers were accused of dismissing gender-based violence complaints because they saw them as family matters and not crimes. The stigma around sexual violence was also cited as a contributing factor to underreporting. 
“It is shocking that for many in Southern Africa, the most dangerous place to be a woman or a girl during the COVID-19 pandemic is at home. This is simply inexcusable. The leaders of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) must ensure that prevention and protection of women from gender-based and domestic violence is an integral part of national responses to pandemics and other emergencies,” Deprose Muchena said. 
“States must ensure that women and girls continue to have access to police protection and justice as well as to shelters and other support services to escape the blight of gender-based violence.”

The Belarusian authorities are resorting to threats, harassment and prosecution of children in an increasingly desperate attempt to suppress dissent, Amnesty International said ahead of the six-month anniversary on 9 February of the start of protests in the country.  
Some children are facing years in prison, while others live in fear that their parents will be imprisoned, or that they will be placed in state care, Amnesty International revealed. The violent crushing of freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in the country is behind the organization’s #StandWithBelarus campaign.  
“In their brutal crackdown on dissent, the authorities’ treatment of children has been completely unacceptable. Some have ended up in arbitrary detention and are facing trumped-up criminal charges, much like adults,” says Aisha Jung, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner on Belarus.  
“Children as young as eight have been threatened in schools with reprisals against their politically active parents. One of the most insidious forms of harassment and intimidation is the threat to exploit legislation to remove children from families and place them in state care – effectively making them hostages of the government.”  
Fourteen-year-old Aleh (name changed for security reasons) was detained in Minsk on 12 August by riot police in masks, alongside hundreds of peaceful protesters and bystanders. “In the minibus they beat him, pulled his hair and pulled his fingers back to force him to unblock his phone,” his mother told Amnesty International. Police officers found a small flyer with the Belarusian red and white opposition flag in his pocket. This was enough for the child protection services to put the family on a watchlist claiming that Aleh lives in a “socially dangerous situation.” Now, Aleh and his family live in constant fear of separation.  
“This case epitomizes the cruelty of the Belarusian authorities’ crackdown on rights – going to extreme lengths to intimidate their critics after the widely-challenged election. This inhumane treatment of children by the state for political aims and the ugly campaign of intimidation of all dissent must end immediately.”  
Background  
Amnesty International’s #StandWithBelarus campaign was launched on 27 January with the publication of a report revealing how the Belarusian authorities have weaponized the justice system to punish victims of torture rather than perpetrators.

“As the conflict in Yemen enters its seventh year, it is vital for the United States to commit to prioritizing the safety of civilians in the country. Central to these efforts will be stopping the flow of arms from the United States into situations where they will be used to commit war crimes and grave human rights violations. Halting the sale of precision guided munitions is the first big step. The human tragedy of United States arms sales is immense pain and suffering inflicted on civilians in Yemen that must not be continued to be swept aside, and crimes committed with arms sold by the United States must be investigated. 
“Paveway guided missiles were found by Amnesty International to have been used to commit war crimes in Yemen. All arms sales to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia should be blocked lest they be used to commit further war crimes in Yemen.” 
Background and context 
Since Saudi Arabia and UAE-led coalition air strikes began in March 2015, Amnesty International has visited and investigated dozens of air strike sites in eight governorates and repeatedly found remnants of munitions manufactured in the United States. U.S.-manufactured Raytheon Paveway bombs examined by Amnesty International have struck hospitals, schools, and civilian homes, killing healthcare providers, teachers, and entire families, including children as young as two years old. 
In relation to the UAE, Amnesty International has collected extensive evidence that shows weapons are not only being used by the UAE forces in Yemen, but are also being passed on to completely unaccountable militias, some of which stand accused of war crimes.

The organization has published a set of principles for ensuring that lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles and many electronic devices, and which are essential for tackling climate change, are not linked to human rights abuses or environmental harm.  
Previous Amnesty research exposed how cobalt mined by children in the DRC could be entering the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest electronic and electric vehicle brands, while in South America, evidence points to lithium extraction posing risks to Indigenous peoples’ water resources and fragile ecosystems. Meanwhile the growing demand for “green” battery technologies poses new risks to the environment, including pollution of mining areas, damage to the ocean floor, and mounting waste due to inefficient design.  
“While technologies like electric vehicles are essential for shifting away from fossil fuels, the battery revolution carries its own risks for human rights and the planet. This is a critical moment to rethink the way our economies and industries operate – amid the nightmare of the pandemic, there is a chance to build a fairer and more sustainable future,” said Mark Dummett, Director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme. 
“We are calling on businesses at all stages of the battery supply chain to do their bit to ensure they are truly powering change. Human rights must be at the core of their operations – this might mean making supply chains more transparent, providing remedy where they have caused harm, or ensuring Indigenous communities are consulted on mining projects that affect them.  
“Governments also need to show leadership by supporting investments and energy solutions rooted in a just transition. Lack of respect for human rights should be a dealbreaker for any business involved in the battery industry – that means governments need to enforce environmental protection laws, investigate allegations of abuses, and make human rights due diligence a legal requirement.”  
Tara Scurr, Amnesty International Canada’s Business and Human Rights Campaigner, added: “Canadian exploration companies are at the forefront of lithium exploration in South America and have a clear responsibility to ensure their operations don’t harm human rights, including the rights of Indigenous peoples whose traditional territories they wish to exploit. We are approaching the tenth anniversary of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which means companies have had plenty of time to ensure their operations respect rights. The time to act is now.” 
Powering Change  
In Powering Change: Principles for Businesses and Governments in the Battery Value Chain, Amnesty International sets out key principles that governments and businesses should respect to avoid causing, contributing or being directly linked to human rights abuses and environmental harm.  
A number of other human rights and environmental organizations have signed up to the principles – a full list can be viewed in the attached document. 
The principles apply to any businesses involved in the industry, including the finance sector, which is funding a vast expansion of green energy and battery technology through large “ESG” funds.  
Amnesty International calls on manufacturers to design batteries for maximum resource efficiency, including innovations to use fewer materials and minerals, and to work towards 100% safely recycled content in batteries. 
The briefing also highlights the dangers of seabed mining and calls on businesses and governments to proactively support a moratorium on the practice.   
Amnesty International also calls on governments and businesses to work with environmental rights defenders and Indigenous communities, ensuring they are consulted and properly informed about planned operations and potential risks. It is imperative that all companies obtain consent from Indigenous communities before moving forward on development and extractive projects.  
“Businesses should treat environmental and human rights defenders as allies, not opponents,” said Mark Dummett. “Putting corporate interests above protecting human rights and the environment has been the status quo for too long. The result is shocking global inequality, devastating climate change, and a seemingly endless stream of bad news about the future. It doesn’t have to be this way – we must ensure that new technologies put us all on a path to a better place.”

The Simonovsky District Court granted a motion put forward by the Federal Penitentiary Service to replace Aleksei Navalny’s suspended sentence with jail time, and he will be held at a penal colony. 
“In their vendetta against Aleksei Navalny and his supporters, the Russian authorities have shredded any remaining veneer of justice and respect for human rights. The politically motivated sentencing of Alexei Navalny shows the true face of the Russian authorities, who seem intent on locking up anyone who dares to speak out against their abuses and repression of human rights,” said Natalya Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director. 
“Even after years of documenting human rights violations and abuses by the Russian authorities, this latest crackdown stands out for its viciousness and sheer scale. There are now more detainees in Russia than there are prison cells, which means people who have done nothing more than attend peaceful demonstrations are being held incommunicado on overcrowded police buses with inadequate sanitation, and in the face of the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Today’s court ruling is the latest indication that the Russian authorities are spiraling out of control in their desperation to silence their critics.” 
Among the thousands of peaceful protesters detained on 31 January was an Amnesty International staff member, who had attended a demonstration in their private capacity. After being arrested for ‘obstructing road traffic’, the staff member was then held overnight at a police station. They were unable to inform family members of their whereabouts for three hours; after managing to make a brief call to their next of kin, their phone was confiscated. The Amnesty International staff member had no access to a lawyer during their detention at the police station. At the sham “trial” the next day, the judge refused to watch the video of the supposed offence and to question police officers or witnesses of the alleged misdemeanor. The individual was sentenced to ten days of “administrative arrest”. Like many other detainees, they then spent a night on a police bus before being transported in the morning of 2 February to a deportation centre in Sakharovo (70 km from Moscow city centre) which is being used to detain protesters in the absence of prison space. Detainees inside the bus did not have access to adequate food, water or sanitation. 
“Even the head of the police station where our colleague was initially held could not tell us where they had been transferred. With so many protesters detained in unknown locations, we are looking at the prospect of mass enforced disappearance,” said Natalya Zviagina. 
“Amnesty International considers that the conditions of detention of those deprived of liberty during the overwhelmingly peaceful protests of 31 January amount to torture and other ill-treatment. We call on the international community, including UN special procedures, and national governments to respond immediately to these mass human rights violations and to hold the authorities to account. Aleksei Navalny, his associates, and all peaceful protesters arrested ahead, during and following the rallies on 23 and 31 January, as well as today, are prisoners of conscience and should be immediately and unconditionally released.” 
Background 
On 2 February, the Simonovsky District Court, conducting its session in the Moscow City Court premises, granted the motion of the Federal Penitentiary Service and replaced Aleksei Navalny’s suspended sentence with two years and eight months of imprisonment. 
According to the human rights group OVD-Info, at least 5,021 people were detained throughout the country on 31 January, including more than 1,600 in Moscow and more than 1,100 thousand in St. Petersburg. 
Since many of the more than 3,000 people detained during the dispersal of previous protests on 23 January were sentenced to “administrative arrest,” the capacity of detention facilities across Russia, and especially in Moscow, has been severely exceeded.

“What we are witnessing in Myanmar didn’t just suddenly happen. You cannot leave perpetrators of grave crimes under international law on the loose and then act surprised when they trample human rights again.  
“Yesterday, an emboldened military took years of international inaction as a quiet signal that they could oust the civilian government and embark on a spree of baseless arrests without any real consequences.  
“Will Security Council members continue to only talk to each other, and behind closed doors, or finally act firmly to prevent further rights violations and the very real threat of a worsening human rights crisis? Had the Security Council acted decisively and strongly from day one, we might not be in a situation where the lives and liberty of people across Myanmar are now at even greater risk.   
“As we have said before, the Security Council must impose targeted financial sanctions against Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other military leaders responsible for atrocity crimes against various ethnic minorities across the country, including the Rohingya. The Security Council must also impose a comprehensive global arms embargo on Myanmar, and crucially, refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.  
“This is a critical time requiring immediate action from the Security Council, including holding an open session on Myanmar and unequivocally condemning the arrests and other human rights violations by the military. Finally, the Council must demand the immediate release of all those detained in Monday’s raids, if they are not promptly charged with a crime recognized under international law.”

“The arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, senior officials and other political figures is extremely alarming. Unless those detained can be charged with a recognizable criminal offence under international law, they must be immediately released. 
“The Myanmar military must clarify on what legal basis they have been detained. They must also guarantee that the rights of those arrested are fully respected, including against ill-treatment, and that they have access to lawyers of their own choice and to their family. They must confirm their whereabouts and grant them access to medical care. 
“This is an ominous moment for people in Myanmar, and threatens a severe worsening of military repression and impunity. The concurrent arrests of prominent political activists and human rights defenders sends a chilling message that the military authorities will not tolerate any dissent amid today’s unfolding events. 
“Previous military coups and crackdowns in Myanmar have seen large scale violence and extrajudicial killings by security forces. We urge the armed forces to exercise restraint, abide by international human rights and humanitarian law and for law enforcement duties to be fully resumed by the police force at the earliest opportunity. 
“Reports of a telecommunications blackout pose a further threat to the population at such a volatile time – especially as Myanmar battles a pandemic, and as internal conflict against armed groups puts civilians at risk in several parts of the country. It is vital that full phone and internet services be resumed immediately.” 
Background  
Myanmar’s de facto head of state Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior figures from the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) as well as regional government leaders were arrested today in early morning raids. A number of ethnic party and student leaders, as well as prominent activists and human rights defenders were also reported to have been arrested. 
Later in the morning, a military-owned television station announced that a one-year state of emergency was being imposed under the authority of the Commander in Chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing. 
This followed days of reported mounting tensions between NLD officials and military representatives ahead of the first session of the newly-elected parliament scheduled today. 
The military and its affiliate party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), have alleged widespread irregularities and misconduct by the Union Election Commission in the 8 November 2020 election, which saw the NLD increase its parliamentary majority. On 15 November 2020, Myanmar’s Union Election Commission (UEC) confirmed Aung San Suu Kyi’ and the NLD’s victory in the general elections, taking 396 of the 498 seats up for election in both chambers of parliament. 
Amid the early morning arrests, internet and phone outages were reported in several parts of the country, including in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw, the largest city, Yangon, as well as Shan and Kachin States and the Mandalay and Sagaing regions.

The organization’s interactive website Tear Gas: An Investigation has now been updated to include new cases of police committing human rights violations against peaceful protesters around the world. 
Since first launching the site in June 2020, Amnesty International has verified recent incidents of tear gas misuse in several countries, including France, Guatemala, India, Mali, Nigeria, Peru, Serbia and Tunisia. 
“The ongoing misuse of tear gas by police forces around the world is reckless and dangerous, often injuring and sometimes even killing peaceful protesters,” said Patrick Wilcken, Deputy Director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme. 
“Our updated analysis is further proof that security forces continue to misuse this less lethal weapon on a massive scale. Far too often in 2020, peaceful protesters were met with violence, including the widespread, unlawful use of tear gas, which can amount to torture or other ill-treatment in certain circumstances. 
“We are again calling on authorities worldwide to respect the right to peaceful protest, and hold to account those who used tear gas unlawfully against people exercising this right.” 
The update includes 27 new events in 12 countries where tear gas has been misused, with open source investigators verifying the location and date of each instance, and assessing its lawfulness. In total, the website now includes videos of more than 100 incidents of tear gas misuse from 31 countries and territories. 
Misuse causing death and injury 
In Uganda, ongoing political unrest in the aftermath of the contested election has been met with an internet blackout, as well as a crackdown that has included killings, beatings and violent dispersal of opposition supporters using tear gas and rubber bullets. 
In Lebanon, protesters took to the streets following the devastating blast at the port of Beirut in August 2020 that killed at least 204 people. During the protests against the government’s response to the explosion, Lebanese security forces repeatedly used dangerous and unlawful force to attempt to control protests, including the excessive use of tear gas. 
In Nigeria, #EndSars protests broke out in October 2020, with people demanding an end to police brutality, extrajudicial executions and extortion by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian police tasked with fighting violent crime. They were met with unlawful use of force by the army and police forces, including the firing of tear gas, and at least 12 peaceful protesters were reportedly shot dead when the army opened fire on thousands of protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate. 
In dozens of cities across the USA, a range of law enforcement agencies targeted peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters with tear gas and other crowd control agents. There were similar examples of tear gas misuse during protests in Indonesia, Peru and Guatemala. 
Open source investigation  
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab began researching tear gas misuse around the world from 2019, primarily through analysing videos posted to social media platforms. 
Using open source investigation methods, the organization verified and highlighted events where tear gas has been misused. The analysis was carried out by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps, a network of students at seven universities on four continents trained in sourcing and verifying content from social media. 
The site includes a video produced with SITU Research, which analyzes the performance characteristics of tear gas, explains the inner workings of the munitions, and shows how their misuse can maim and kill. 
Amnesty International documented police abusing tear gas in multiple ways, including: firing into confined spaces; firing directly at individuals; using excessive quantities; firing at peaceful protests; and firing against groups who may be less able to flee or more susceptible to its effects, such as children, older people and people with disabilities. 
Poorly regulated trade 
Despite its widespread misuse, there are no agreed international regulations on the trade in tear gas and other chemical irritants. Few states provide public information on the quantity and destination of tear gas exports, hampering independent oversight. 
Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation have campaigned for more than two decades for greater controls on the production, trade and use of tear gas and other law enforcement equipment and weapons. As a result, the UN and regional bodies such as the EU and the Council of Europe have recognized the need to regulate the export of this equipment. 
Following high-level diplomatic advocacy by the 60+ states of the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade, supported by Amnesty International and Omega, the UN is now exploring the potential development of international trade controls on law enforcement equipment and weapons, and other goods, to prevent their use in torture, other ill-treatment and the death penalty. Amnesty International and Omega are now pressing for such measures to include tear gas and other chemical irritants.

Today’s arrests and violent dispersals were the latest crackdown by Russian authorities on overwhelmingly peaceful protesters demanding the release of Alexei Navalny.  
“Russian authorities have arrested so many people in recent weeks that detention centres in Moscow have run out of space, and peaceful protesters are being held in deportation facilities. Trying to lock up every critic in the country is a losing game – the Russian authorities should instead recognize how much the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression mean to a growing number of Russians, and allow people to express their opinions without fear of retaliation.  
“The Kremlin is waging a war on the human rights of people in Russia, stifling protesters’ calls for freedom and change. This is a desperate attempt to silence criticism, and it needs to stop,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director.  
“All peaceful protesters and activists detained for peacefully participating in protests are prisoners of conscience and must be released immediately and unconditionally. Police must stop using unlawful force and instead uphold their obligation to protect the human rights of Russian people.”  
Background  
On 31 January, at least 4,000 peaceful protesters were detained in Moscow, Saint Petersburg and other Russian cities, during brutal dispersals of rallies demanding the release of Aleksei Navalny, a popular opposition figure and prisoner of conscience. This takes the number of people detained for protesting in the past week to more than 8,000. The number of detainees put under “administrative arrest” in Moscow during a previous wave of protests on 23 January was so high that the detention centres became overcrowded and more than 100 detainees were placed in temporary detention facilities where foreign nationals awaiting deportation are held.  
In the lead-up to this latest day of protest, the authorities have arrested dozens of leading opposition activists and associates of Aleksei Navalny from the Anti-Corruption Foundation, on numerous spurious criminal and administrative charges. Aleksei Navalny’s brother Oleg, the Anti-Corruption Foundation lawyer Lyubov Sobol, the head of Navalny’s headquarters in Moscow Oleg Stepanov, Pussy Riot punk band member Maria Alyokhina and the leader of Alliance of Doctors union Anastasia Vasilyeva will remain in detention at least until 23 March after being charged with violation of sanitary and epidemiological standards under Article 236 of Russia’s Criminal Code.

“The crackdown on dissent in Russia has become increasingly brutal – and desperate – even compared to vicious reprisals in recent years. The authorities appear shamelessly bent on violating human rights by silencing their critics. In the last few days, the authorities have detained a young mother, raided the home of a prominent journalist’s elderly parents, and opened criminal prosecutions on dubious grounds, such as the violation of sanitary regulations by demonstrators.   
“This wave of reprisals is obviously aimed at repressing growing popular dissent in Russia. It is a cowardly attempt to prevent further planned peaceful protests against the prosecution of prisoner of conscience Aleksei Navalny, and the allegations of top-level corruption in Russia which he unearthed.”  
“The persecution of peaceful protesters must stop immediately, and Russian citizens must be able to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, on 31 January or whenever they choose – these are fundamental rights.”  
Background  
On the afternoon of 27 January, at least 18 raids were carried out at homes and offices of leading opposition activists, journalists and government critics in Moscow. The security forces stormed apartments where the wife of prisoner of conscience Aleksei Navalny, Yulia Navalnaya, and his brother Oleg live. Simultaneously, they conducted a raid on the Anti-Corruption Foundation office and studio of Navalny Live, the opposition activist’s popular YouTube channel.  
At the same time a number of raids were conducted on the homes of Anastasia Vasilyeva, the head of the Alliance of Doctors union, Maria Alyokhina of the Pussy Riot punk band, the parents of Sergei Smirnov, editor-in-chief of Mediazona, an independent media outlet, among others.  
These actions were taken under the pretext of investigating a criminal case based on Article 236 of Russia’s Criminal Code (violation of sanitary and epidemiological standards, which inadvertently entailed or threatened to result in a mass illness or poisoning of people). Those targeted include organizers and participants of protests that were violently dispersed by the authorities on Saturday 23 January. If found guilty, they face up to two years’ imprisonment.   
This is only one of dozens of criminal cases that have already been opened in Russia against political activists, on contentious grounds – such as road blockages, violation of COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, damage to state property, and the use of violence against police officers. Just today a new criminal case under Article 151.2 (involvement of minors in actions endangering their life) was opened against the head of Alexey Navalny’s movement regional offices, Leonid Volkov.

On Tuesday morning Bridget Tolley did what no mother wants to do—search for her missing daughter. Laura Spence and her friend Nicole Whiteduck were last seen on Sunday morning in Kitigan Zibi, a community north of Ottawa. 
Tolley is the co-founder of the grassroots organization Families of Sisters in Spirit—one of Amnesty International’s key partners in the Stolen Sisters campaign to end violence against Indigenous women in Canada. She provides support to Indigenous families across Canada whose daughters, sisters, mothers, and aunties have gone missing or been murdered. And while she understands very well the pain of losing a loved one—her mother was killed in 2001 by a police cruiser—until this week she had not experienced what many of the families she works with have gone through when a loved one vanishes. 
While dealing with her own fear and grief, Tolley had to contact authorities, liaise with the media, launch a search of the community, and run a social media campaign, all while taking care of her infant grandchild. She was quoted in the media as saying that all her work with families of missing women did not prepare her to launch a search of her own. No one should be expected to know what to do when a loved one goes missing. 
We were relieved when Tolley’s daughter and her friend were found safe on Thursday morning. 
Tolley’s experience underscores the importance of making resources available in a timely fashion not only to help locate missing women and girls, but to provide support services to the family members who have had their lives turned upside down.

Amnesty International interviewed Darlene as part of a series marking the 10th anniversary of the Stolen Sisters report on violence against Indigenous women. We asked Darlene for her reflections on progress made and remaining challenges in making sure that there are No More Stolen Sisters. Here is what she had to say. 
Ten years of inaction on violence against Indigenous women in Canada. What does this statement mean to you? 
Struggle comes to mind. Frustration. Depression. What more can we do to engage more Members of Parliament to get on board to pressure the current government to do an national inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. 
What progress have you seen over the last decade? 
The progress is the increased awareness throughout the country, the task forces that were created and actioned on, in Saskatoon we have 3 missing persons liaisons that are based on missing Indigenous women’s files. Communities are doing their own thing to build monuments like in Winnipeg. Mikisew Cree Nation just announced they are doing their own database. It is those kinds of developments that we see, but there could be more done in terms of police sharing information from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Funds available to help families could be expanded. 
How are you working to address violence against Indigenous women? 
Collaborations with new projects like the REDress Project (red dress exhibit, traveling from campus to campus), Walking With Our Sisters (book chapter and vamp exhibit), and connecting to local Ariel Sallows chairs. Engaging and building rapport with the families, supporting their vigils, marches, searches, trials if need be. Remembering those who are missing and those missing-found-murdered, collaborating with like-minds and creating diverse ways that are not highly bureaucratic and dependant on government and municipalities to provide support. 
What is the importance of families working together? 
Families working together is important as it builds strength. They share tips on searches, work with justice personnel including victim services, judges, investigators, frontline police, media, etc. All these understandings can make for speedier work and put pressure on police services to not let too much time pass when searching and doing missing persons reports. 
Are there things you think most Canadians don’t understand yet about the issue? 
There are myths about the victims. They are given stereotypes and rigged research reports to point to the victims. They portray victims as poor, destitute, unloved, unvalued, and not worthy of having safety surround them like the rest of Canadian citizens. They don’t understand underlying factors such as residential schools, racism, sexism, the 60’s scoop, child welfare, foster parenting, and the loss of cultural connections. 
What action would you like to see at the government level? 
I would like the government to do a national inquiry, quit doing these special committees… and round tables. Families really need to have their own voice, something could be missed if they don’t give a chance for at least 300 families to speak to really, really have an impact similar to what the Royal Commission did back in the early 1990’s. They travelled and travelled and many recommendations were made – it will send a serious message to citizens to know the truth. 
If you had a chance to speak directly to the government what would you say? 
Let a national inquiry take place. Let it be supervised and overseen by a strong body of Indigenous families, Indigenous lawyers, Indigenous health care staff, Indigenous researchers, and Indigenous experts. Build on this by creating some legislation by indigenous MPs and governments. 
What do you want to see ten years from now?

Amnesty International has long called for a comprehensive, coordinated national plan of action to address gaps in current policies, programs and services; involve Indigenous women’s organizations in identifying the necessary solutions; and ensure accountability in their delivery. 
Implementation of a National Action Plan to end violence against women is also necessary to fulfill Canada’s international human rights commitments. 
In January 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that called on all states to eliminate all forms of violence against women “by means of a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained approach, adequately supported and facilitated by strong institutional mechanisms and financing, through national action plans…” The call for comprehensive, sustained National Action Plans has been reaffirmed in subsequent resolutions. 
Canada played a leading role in these UN resolutions calling for National Action Plans. Canada is not exempt from the position, which it has supported at the UN, that all states should adopt National Action Plans to end violence against women. 
The Native Women’s Association of Canada, the Assembly of First Nations and many other Indigenous and civil society organizations have called on Canada to adopt a comprehensive and coordinated National Action Plan to stop violence against women. 
A National Action Plan should include: 
To be successful, a National Action Plan should be developed in collaboration with Indigenous women’s organizations to ensure their full and effective participation in defining needs and solutions and must be accompanied by measures to ensure accountability to Parliament and to the Indigenous women and their families who the plan would serve. 
A National Action Plan is not an alternative to a National Public Inquiry. An independent inquiry would be a powerful tool to ensure that the National Action Plan is well informed and well supported.

According to the report, 1,017 women and girls identified as Indigenous were murdered between 1980 and 2012—a homicide rate roughly 4.5 times higher than that of all other women in Canada. 
In addition, the report states that as of November 2013, at least 105 Indigenous women and girls remained missing under suspicious circumstances or for undetermined reasons. 
These appalling statistics are consistent with previous estimates from sources such as Statistics Canada that have long pointed to a greatly disproportionate level of violence against that First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls. The latest numbers also underline what Indigenous women and advocacy organizations have long been saying–that this violence requires a specific and concerted response from police and all levels of society. 
The RCMP’s release of official, national police statistics confirming these previous estimates is an important and welcome step because such numbers are critical to inform and mobilize police and public response. 
Unfortunately, in the hands of some government officials and media commentators, the new RCMP statistics have become, not a source of clarity and a resource for action, but an excuse for misrepresenting the reality of Indigenous women’s lives and an excuse for continued inaction. 
The RCMP report does not tell us everything we need to know about violence against Indigenous women. The release of this report is not a substitute for a national inquiry. 
The RCMP report does not reflect the voices of affected families and communities. Nor does it provide a vehicle for the consideration and implementation of the solutions that they have identified. And even as a statistical picture of missing and murdered Indigenous women, the RCMP report has important gaps that need to be acknowledged. 
In its statistics on homicide, the RCMP report only includes cases where the original investigating police force has concluded that a murder has taken place. The report explicitly does not include unexplained and suspicious deaths. 
Amnesty’s own research has raised concerns that deaths of Indigenous women and girls are not always fully and properly investigated and that as a result some murders of Indigenous women and girls may have been wrongly classified as accidental deaths. 
In addition, police in Canada do not consistently record the Indigenous identity of victims of crime. Statistics Canada reports that in 2009, for example, police recorded failed to note whether the victims of crime were Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal in 384 out of 610 homicides. Some victims of crime are being inaccurately identified as non-Aboriginal because police have not had proper training on why accurate identification is important and how it’s to be determined. 
The RCMP report acknowledges the unreliability of current police practices of determining Indigenous identity. The report claims that a file review, carried out over a period of several months, established the Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal identity of all but 95 homicide victims whose identity was previously recorded as “unknown.” The RCMP did not review files to determine whether Indigenous women had been inaccurately recorded as non-Indigenous. 
The RCMP report also does not distinguish between First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls. As a consequence, it does not provide any information on whether the homicide rate is the same or differs among these groups. The report provides a number of statistics on the lives of the victims. The nature of many of these statistics—such as history of illegal drug use or involvement in illegal activities—suggests an inappropriate focus on the possible role of the victim’s own actions and behaviours. 
The report does not include any information on how many of the women and girls previously sought help or protection from the police or service agencies or the response they received. 
Although the report breaks down the statistics according to some potentially significant factors—such as whether homicides were committed outside the residence (27% for Indigenous women compared to 20% for non-Indigenous) —it does not provide figures for homicides on and off reserve. 
The report does not identify how many of the perpetrators of the crime were Indigenous and how many were non-Indigenous. The report also does not provide any information on the numbers of perpetrators and the role of others in helping carry out or cover up the crime. 
However, the report does however provide important information on the relationship of the perpetrators to the victims, suggesting significant differences in the threats faced by Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. 
Previous research, including reports by the Native Women’s Association of Canada and Amnesty International’s own research, show that violence against Indigenous women and girls is pervasive, taking place in the home and in the streets of Canadian cities, and that the perpetrators include Indigenous and non-Indigenous men alike. 
Nothing in the RCMP report changes this conclusion. 
The vast majority of murders are committed by someone known to the victim. This is true for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women alike. 
However, there is at least one significant difference revealed by the RCMP report. 
In the case of Aboriginal women, spouses, family and other intimates account for 62% of homicides, compared to 74% of murders of all other women. The difference is largely accounted for by greater number of murders of Indigenous women and girls by people the police categorize as “acquaintances”, including friends, co-workers, neighbours, authority figures and other people known to, but not intimate with the victim. 
In the 22 year period covered by the RCMP, acquaintances were found to be responsible for the murder of more than 300 Indigenous women and girls in Canada. 
The rate of homicide by acquaintances was 7 times greater for Indigenous women and girls than for all other women in Canada. 
During the same period, the RCMP found that strangers were responsible for the murder of 81 Aboriginal women and girls.Clearly, domestic and family violence are critical issues that must be addressed in any meaningful national strategy to address violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
At the same time, it’s also clear that characterizing the threats to Indigenous women’s lives as exclusively about domestic violence – as some government spokespersons and media commentators have done – misrepresents the issues and obscures crucial aspects of these threats. 
Regardless of the identity of the perpetrator, or their relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, it’s clear that their actions needed to be examined in the context of the discrimination, marginalization, and impoverishment that put Indigenous women in harm’s way. Amnesty International’s 2004 Stolen Sisters report concluded that all these factors work together to compound the risks to Indigenous women, encouraging some men to target Indigenous women for acts of racist and misogynist violence, and in denying Indigenous women equal access to services such as shelters that are required for their safety. 
The kind of statistics released by the RCMP need to collected and made public on an ongoing basis. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of this data, specific guidelines and training need to be provided to officers in all police services to ensure that they understand when to record Indigenous identity and how this information is to be used.

From October 20-24, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal will hear the closing arguments in a history-making case on equity for First Nations children. 
At issue is whether the federal government has discriminated against First Nations children living on reserves, and in the Yukon, by consistently providing less money per child for family services than its provincial counterparts provide in predominantly non-Aboriginal communities. 
At stake is the ability of children’s agencies to provide urgently needed prevention programs for at risk First Nations children and to stem the unprecedented numbers of First Nations children being taken from their families and communities and put into state care. 
The human rights complaint was initiated by a national non-governmental organization, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of the Caring Society, recently told Amnesty International, 
“In my view, there is no more important legal case in the country right now.… If the federal government is indeed discriminating against First Nations children in foster care, that should be at the top of everyone’s policy agenda, moral agenda, and political agenda because it’s totally out of step with the values that the country stands for.” 
The closing arguments will be webcast on the Caring Society’s website at www.fnwitness.ca where the hearing can be watched live, or viewed later.  The website also has all the written arguments, including the government’s arguments in its own defence, as well as Amnesty International’s own submission on the issues. 
The Caring Society is encouraging concerned Canadians to make a public commitment to become more informed about the issue and to following the case as it wraps up. You can do this by signing up online as part of the Caring Society’s ever growing list of witnesses, tweeting the hashtag #Witness4FirstNationsKids and by taking a picture of yourself with a message of solidarity, like Cindy’s photo on this page. 
The case will have important implications for the federal government’s relationship with First Nations, since similar patterns of underfunding exist across a wide range of basic services such as education and clean drinking water on reserve.

This includes provincial and territorial governments as well as municipalities. It also includes Indigenous governments and institutions such as Band Councils. All have a shared responsibility to be part of the solution to ending violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
However, the federal government has a particular responsibility to help ensure the safety and well-being of Indigenous women and girls. 
Here are some of the reasons why: 
Amnesty International is standing with Indigenous women’s organizations to demand a comprehensive and coordinated National Action Plan to stop violence against Indigenous women and girls, including an independent National Inquiry to ensure that families and communities are heard and listened to. Please join us in urging the federal government to live up to its human rights responsibilities.

As Executive Director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, Cindy has brought a landmark discrimination case to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to challenge the federal government’s chronic underfunding of children’s services on First Nations reserves and for First Nations children in the Yukon. The closing arguments in that hearing will take place October 20-24 and will be webcast live at fnwitness.ca. 
We spoke with Cindy as part of a series of conversation with Indigenous advocates and leaders to mark the 10th anniversary of Amnesty International’s report Stolen Sisters: A Human Rights Response to Discrimination and Violence against Indigenous Women in Canada. 
You’ve said that the government is removing more First Nations children from their families and communities today than at the height of the residential school era. What’s happening? Why are so many First Nations kids being taken into care? 
What we know from the research is that First Nations children are being removed at astonishing rate because of neglect. When I talk about neglect I mean poverty, poor housing, and substance misuse related to the residential school trauma. All of those are things we could do something about. But unfortunately, like many other programs on First Nations reserves across Canada, child welfare is underfunded – according to the Government of Canada’s own estimates by about 34% compared to what other children in Canada receive. And the Government of Canada says itself that this level of inequitable funding contributes to the growing numbers of First Nations children in care. 
So we can see the direct connection between the multi-generational impacts of residential schools and colonization to the lack of culturally-based resources on reserve to the high numbers of children ending up in foster care. 
That’s why this case is so important. We want to make sure those families have an equal chance to raise their children at home. 
In its official apology to residential school survivors, the Canadian government acknowledged that the harm that was inflicted didn’t stop with the physical and sexual abuse of students, but that there was also a lasting harm caused by the removal of children from their families and cultures. Do you see the continued removal of children from their families and culture today as inflicting new harms to the children and their communities, just like the residential school era? 
Absolutely. 
One of the documents that literally took my breath away when I was a witness at the Human Rights Tribunal was a spreadsheet that was prepared by the Department of Indian Affairs about the number of First Nations children in foster care. It doesn’t just  say that in a given year you have 9000 kids in foster care, it actually talks about it in a way that kids would think about it, which is how many nights have I been away from my family? It added up the number of nights that First Nations kids on reserve and in the Yukon spent in foster care between 1989 and 2012. Cumulatively, First Nations children have spent over 66 million nights away from their families. That’s 187,000 years of childhood. And in too many cases those children are being placed in non-Aboriginal homes where they’re not learning their culture, they’re not learning their connections to their families, they’re not learning their languages. 
So I would argue that we’re going to see many of those same harmful effects in this generation of First Nations children that we saw in residential schools if we don’t stop what we’re doing right now and make sure these kids have a proper chance to grow up with their families because that’s where they learn their cultures. 
There has been a growing movement across Canada demanding action on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, not just about investigating the crimes, but dealing with the root causes that are putting these Indigenous women and girls in danger in the first place. Do you think that the kinds of harm caused by the massive levels of removal of First Nations children from their families are part of these root causes? 
Absolutely. We need to look no further than the tragic recent case of Tina Fontaine who was a child in care.  And all these adults who are at risk and vulnerable today were once children who were at risk and vulnerable. 
There’s a famous study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences study, the ACE study in the United States, which showed that when children have multiple experiences of harm – it could be a child who is in a home where there are multigenerational effects of residential schools, where there is poverty, where there is no clean drinking water as is the case in 1 in 6 First Nations communities, and where they’re going to a lousy school – if you add up all those things, those experiences are going to play out well through their adulthood. In fact, it even puts them at higher risk for things like coronary disease and diabetes. 
So you can see that the seeds we plant in childhood have lifelong consequences. If we plant seeds of discrimination then we set in play a strong likelihood of a tragic and difficult adulthood.  But if we plant seeds of justice and equality and culture that breeds self-confidence, we’re going to see those same positive experiences grow throughout their lives. 
What I don’t want to see is another generation of First Nations adults having to recover from their childhoods as so many survivors of the residential schools have had to do and as so many families of the murdered and missing women are now doing. 
What outcome are you hoping for with the case that’s you’ve brought before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal? 
I’m pretty optimistic that the Tribunal, based on the overwhelming evidence of inequality and the harms to these kids, is going to find that Canada has discriminated against this generation of First Nations children. The most important thing to me though is the remedy. We brought this case because we want the problem fixed. 
We were kind of naïve in that we used to think we could fix the problem by working with the government, which we did for a period of ten years before filing this complaint, and identifying evidence-based solutions that the federal government could more than afford. In fact, when we brought forward the last proposal, developed with 20 leading experts from across Canada, it would have cost less than 1 percent of the surplus budget for the federal government to do the right thing for these kids and the government walked away. 
So I really want that remedy implemented for child welfare. But I also want these same inequalities that affect children in health, education and water to end. As a country we need to do better than continuing this longstanding pattern of discrimination against First Nations children, young people and their families. They deserve equality going forward. 
Thank you, Cindy. Is there anything you wanted to add? 
I would say that the role of the public is really critical. Reconciliation to me is about not having to say sorry a second time. 
If you want to learn about this case that’s before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, you can go online at our website www.fnwitness.ca where you’re going to find all the court documents. And on October 20 to 24th, you’ll be able to watch the closing argument via a live webcast, free of charge, and you’ll hear all sides of the case. 
In my view, there is no more important legal case in the country right now. As the saying goes, this one drives a red hot poker stick into the conscience of the nation. If the federal government is indeed discriminating against First Nations children in foster care, that should be at the top of everyone’s policy agenda, moral agenda, and political agenda because it’s totally out of step with the values that the country stands for, 
So please do watch. Don’t turn away. We really do need all of your help and your support as we move forward to build not only a more just world for First Nations kids, but to build a better future for Canada in the process.

It threatens a wide range of human rights, including the rights to water, to health and to life itself. And unfortunately, many of our current technology-focused climate solutions, such as electric vehicles or solar power, threaten those rights. Climate solutions must not sacrifice people or the planet. 
This February, Amnesty International Canada embarks on a year-long project to bring awareness to these issues and to call on Canada to put human rights and Indigenous knowledges at the centre of climate justice and decarbonization initiatives. 
To bring stories from front-line communities alive, Amnesty partnered with Ad Astra Comix to create a short comic book. Follow Samira and Andy as they learn about rechargeable batteries and human rights.  On this page, you will also find a text-based, accessible version of the comic book. 
Read the comic, share it, and join our campaign for a just energy future: #RechargeForRights!

As companies scramble to obtain land to develop renewable energy projects or lucrative mining concessions, communities and Indigenous peoples are under incredible pressure to protect their sources of water and livelihoods, ensuring there is adequate land to farm or graze animals, or forests where traditional harvesting methods bring in necessary income. Multi-generational contracts and benefit sharing agreements put unknowable burdens on future generations that are difficult to understand and plan for as our climate continues to change. As guardians of the land, many Indigenous peoples are saying no to resource extraction and energy projects in their territories. 
This is a pivotal moment for human rights. Will governments, extractives and renewable energy companies follow the path taken over the last century by oil, gas and mining companies, the one that led to serious and ongoing human rights abuses and environmental harms, or will they chart a new path based on respect for human rights and a centering of Indigenous knowledges? 
For Canada, this question is particularly important as different levels of government and jurisdictions take steps towards ending fossil fuel dependency, protecting jobs and transitioning to renewable energy. All levels of government in Canada must double down on human rights respect as part of their investment strategy in renewable energy and ‘green’ transportation projects. 
Canadian companies are at the forefront of lithium and other mineral exploration around the world. Canada must prevent them from doing harm and hold them accountable for human rights abuses when they do. Legislated mandatory human rights due diligence is one step in the right direction. Learn why this is important and what you can do.

Colleen Hele Cardinal and Elaine Kicknosway, co-founders of the Sixties Scoop Network, launched the e-petition calling for a national apology for the decades-long harmful practice of “scooping up” Indigenous children and adopting them out to mostly white families. The petition, which was presented in the House of Commons today, has garnered 4,862 signatures. 
“We are not just seeking an apology. We want the government to ask for forgiveness,” said Hele-Cardinal. “Canada needs to acknowledge the harms they have done to our communities, families and survivors by removing, displacing, and altering our identities. By asking survivors collectively to forgive the harms, we have the choice to forgive and move on for healing and closure. The little spirits that were hurt as children still need to be acknowledged, and a settlement is not enough. With support from allies, we demand that Canada ask survivors and their families for forgiveness.” 
The Sixties Scoop – which lasted from the 1950s until the 1980s – saw an estimated 20,000 Indigenous children removed from their homes and adopted out, sometimes to families in other provinces or even as far away as the USA, Britain, Germany, and Australia. As a result, many children grew up far away from their Indigenous cultures, losing touch with their languages, ceremonies, traditions, and identities.  
“The federal government must accept responsibility for its role in the Sixties Scoop,” said NDP MP Gord Johns, who sponsored the e-petition and presented it to the House of Commons. “Survivors have waited too long for justice, and this government must meet with survivors in ceremony and ask for forgiveness.” 
In 2018, the federal government announced a settlement agreement with survivors of the Sixties Scoop, but Hele-Cardinal said Trudeau needs to formally acknowledge the historical and enduring harms from that era. Her petition also asks Trudeau to work with the Sixties Scoop Network and all survivors to host a ceremony for the national apology to occur. 
Ana Collins, Indigenous Rights Advisor for Amnesty International Canada, said about the petition, “This call for government accountability and justice comes at a time when the entire world is distracted by personal and localized concerns for health and well-being. And yet, the well-being of Indigenous Sixties Scoop survivors resonated with people and so they chose to remind the Government of Canada of its human rights obligations. Colonial governments must be honourable in their dealings with Indigenous Peoples, especially those who have had their human rights violated as children.” 
An e-petition must have 500 signatures before it can be tabled in the House of Commons, and the government must respond within 45 days. 
Hele Cardinal has co-launched an interactive mapping project, In our own Words: Mapping the Sixties Scoop Diaspora, which shows the extent of the Sixties Scoop era’s displacements. The project also aims to support survivors in finding and reconnecting with family members and accessing services and support resources.

“President Biden’s decision to freeze arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE represents a welcome relief in an otherwise shameful chapter of history. Almost six years of conflict in Yemen, fueled by irresponsible arms transfers, have left 14 million Yemenis in dire need of humanitarian assistance. 
“The suspension of arms sales by the US is a step in the right direction and ups the pressure on European countries, most notably the UK and France, to follow suit and stop fueling the human misery in Yemen. 
“For years, we have been warning Western states that they risk complicity in war crimes as they continue to enable the Saudi-led coalition with arms. The Biden administration is finally acknowledging the disastrous effects of these continued sales, and puts to shame other states that continue to ignore the mountain of evidence of probable war crimes collected by Yemenis, the United Nations, and human rights organization over the course of the past six years.” 
Background 
Since 2015, the Saudi and UAE-led Coalition carried out scores of indiscriminate and disproportionate air strikes on civilians and civilians’ objects, hitting homes, schools, hospitals, markets, mosques, weddings and funerals. Amnesty International has documented over 40 coalition air strikes that appear to have violated international humanitarian law, many of which amount to war crimes. These have resulted in more than 500 civilian deaths and 400 civilians injured. 
In relation to the UAE, Amnesty International has collected extensive evidence that show weapons are not only being used by the UAE forces in Yemen, but are also being passed on to completely unaccountable militias, some of which stand accused of war crimes.

Since the assault by security forces, which killed at least 12 people, Nigerian authorities have targeted supporters of the protests against police brutality by the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) Some of the movement’s supporters have had their bank accounts frozen.   
“The bloody events of 20 October 2020, when Nigerian security forces killed at least 12 people during the violent dispersal of peaceful #EndSARS protesters at Lekki and Alausa, have cast a shadow over Nigerian society that lingers to this day,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.  
“Instead of bringing suspected perpetrators to justice and prioritizing genuine police reforms, Nigerian authorities have been abusing their powers by subjecting those who supported the protests to intimidation, harassment and smear campaigns.”  
Reports from across Nigeria indicate that police violence is still widespread despite government promises of change.    
Amnesty International is concerned that the Nigerian authorities will continue their current ban on protests and reminds the government of its obligations under the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 (as amended) and international human rights treaties – to which the country is a state party – to allow those who gather peacefully to express their views without fear of arrest or intimidation.   
International human rights law also requires the Nigerian authorities to carry out prompt, thorough, independent, impartial and effective investigations into violations of human rights of the protesters including the right to life, such as those committed at Lekki and Alausa, as well as in other parts of the country, and to identify and bring suspected perpetrators to justice in fair trials. 
“Those suspected to be responsible for the killings should be brought to justice in accordance with international fair trial standards,” said Osai Ojigho.  
Amnesty International is calling on the Nigerian government to suspend accused officials, pending investigations, and to ensure that victims access justice and effective remedies.   
Background   
The Nigerian government has set up a panel of inquiry in Lagos State to investigate complaints against SARS and the incidents at Lekki and Alausa on 20 October 2020. However, government officials and the military continue to deny that anybody was killed during the protests while restating their resolve to punish leaders of the #EndSARS movement against police violence.

On Wednesday, France’s court of appeal ordered Diab to face trial for the 40-year-old Paris bombing, even after a lower court cleared his name three years ago due to a lack of evidence. It is possible that such a trial could be held in absentia, or in his absence. 
“The French court’s decision to keep pursuing this prolonged injustice against Hassan Diab is unacceptable,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “His family has been through so much over the past 12 years, only to learn that this painful saga is not over. The Canadian government must do everything in its power to have these charges dropped so Hassan and his family can move forward.” 
In 2014, Diab was extradited from Canada to France, even though the Canadian extradition judge, Robert Maranger, described the evidence presented against Diab as “very problematic”, “convoluted”, “illogical”, and “suspect”. However, given the low threshold of evidence in Canada’s Extradition Act, the judge felt compelled to order Diab’s extradition. 
Diab spent more than three years in prison in France, most of which was in solitary confinement, while the decades-long investigation in his case was ongoing. 
In January 2018, the French investigating judges dismissed all charges against Diab and ordered his release. They stated there was consistent evidence that Diab was writing exams in Lebanon at the time of the 1980 bombing that tragically killed four people and injured dozens in Paris. Further, the other evidence in the case, notably handwriting analysis and fingerprints, are clearly unreliable. 
“There must of course be justice for the terrible 1980 synagogue bombing. But there is every reason to believe that the way this case has progressed is much more about politics than it is about law and justice,” said Alex Neve, senior fellow at the University of Ottawa’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs and former secretary general of Amnesty International Canada. “And as a result, Hassan Diab’s human rights have been subverted, sold short and violated at every turn.”

Almost twelve years on from the end of Sri Lanka’s civil war, the report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), warns that the country’s persistent failure to address historic crimes is giving way to ‘clear early warning signs of a deteriorating human rights situation and a significantly heightened risk of future violations.’   
In February 2020, the Sri Lankan government announced that it would no longer cooperate with the UNHRC’s landmark resolution 30/1, which promotes reconciliation, accountability, and human rights in the country, and would instead pursue its own reconciliation and accountability process.  
“This report lays bare Sri Lanka’s abject record on delivering justice and accountability and the decaying effect this has had on human rights in the country. The seriousness of these findings highlights the urgent need for the UN Human Rights Council to step up its efforts in Sri Lanka,” said David Griffiths, Director of the Office of the Secretary General at Amnesty International.   
“For more than a decade, domestic processes have manifestly failed thousands of victims and their families. Given the government’s decision to walk away from resolution 30/1, and regression on the limited progress that had been made, the Human Rights Council must send a clear message that accountability will be pursued with or without the cooperation of the government.”  
Amnesty International is calling on the UN Human Rights Council to implement the report’s key recommendations to put in place more stringent oversight on Sri Lanka, including more robust monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation, and the collection and preservation of evidence for future prosecutions.  
The report, which accuses Sri Lanka of being in a ‘state of denial about the past’, details how the failure of domestic mechanisms has further entrenched impunity, exacerbating victims’ distrust in the system. Among a litany of failures, the report addresses the rollback of 2015 reforms that offered more checks and balances on executive power, the erosion of judicial and institutional independence, and the failure to reform the security sector and remove and hold to account those responsible for alleged grave crimes and human rights violations.  
The report also offers a withering assessment of regression in other human rights areas, including the increasing marginalisation of Tamil and Muslim minorities, fuelled by divisive and discriminatory rhetoric from state officials, and a shrinking space for civil society, including independent media.  
Canada is among a group of states – including Germany, Montenegro, North Macedonia and the UK – expected to present a resolution on Sri Lanka to the UN Human Rights Council when it meets next month. Amnesty International urges the Canadian government to follow through on its commitment as a member of the core group, and work with partners to present a strong resolution calling for more robust monitoring and reporting on the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. To do otherwise would be a serious abdication of responsibility in the face of this damning new report, and clear recommendations for preventative action in the face of worrying early warning indicators.   
“The onus is now on these countries, with the support of other UNHRC member states, to present a meaningful proposal that responds credibly to the damning findings and concrete recommendations of this UN report, by putting the Sri Lankan government under proper scrutiny and once again working towards an accountability process agreed at the international level,” said David Griffiths.    
“UN member states should learn from past experience, and this time heed the early warning indicators identified by the UN’s top human rights official.”  
Background  
The OHCHR report, published on 27 January 2021, is available to download here.  The Human Rights Council will meet for its 46th session from 22 February to 23 March, during which Canada, Germany, Montenegro, North Macedonia and the UK – the current core group of states leading on Sri Lanka – are expected to present a resolution in follow-up to the OHCHR report.   
Amnesty International published an assessment of the situation in Sri Lanka, setting out clear expectations for HRC action, earlier this month. The High Commissioner’s report supports the call for more robust monitoring and reporting on the situation, as well as the collection and preservation of evidence for future prosecutions.  
Sri Lanka has a long history of domestic Commissions of Inquiry that have repeatedly failed to deliver justice and reconciliation for victims of human rights violations. Findings of past commissions have not led to any prosecutions of those responsible for atrocities. Amnesty International has documented these processes in the past.

The organization described the pursuit of justice inside Belarus as ‘hopeless’, and called on the international community to take active steps to deliver justice for victims and hold perpetrators to account. 
While Belarusian authorities have admitted receiving more than 900 complaints of abuses committed by police since demonstrations began in August 2020, not one criminal investigation has been launched against law enforcement officers. In contrast, hundreds of criminal investigations have been opened against peaceful protesters, many of whom are victims of torture and ill-treatment. 
“Since the start of post-election protests in Belarus, human rights groups have collected evidence of the torture of hundreds of peaceful protesters and documented the deaths of at least four. We have repeatedly called for effective investigations to bring those responsible to justice, but there is little hope of that from a system that not only protects police with anonymity, but also encourages intimidation and further violence against victims and witnesses,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  
“The total failure of the Belarusian justice system to ensure accountability means justice must now be pursued internationally. Governments, international and regional organizations should use all their leverage to pressure the Belarusian authorities to end this assault on human rights. We also urge the international community to take all available measures to deliver justice in Belarus.”  
Arbitrary detention and torture of peaceful protesters  
In the new briefing, Belarus: “You are not Human Beings”, Amnesty International presents harrowing accounts of peaceful protesters being arrested en masse and subjected to torture, stripped naked, mercilessly beaten, held in stress positions, and deprived of food, drinking water or medical care for days.  
During protests and in their aftermath, Belarusian law enforcement used dozens of detention centres to arbitrarily detain peaceful protesters across the country, including the notorious “Akrestsina” facility in Minsk.   
On the night of 13-14 August 2020, relatives of those detained at Akrestsina recorded the sounds of incessant beatings which were clearly audible in the street, and numerous voices screaming out in agony with some begging for mercy.   
Tsimur (name changed), a 25-year-old doctor from Minsk, was arbitrarily arrested on 10 August 2020 and sent to Akrestsina. He told Amnesty International:  
“Whoever cried, begged [the officers] not to beat them—they were beaten even worse.”  
Mikalai (not his real name), who spent five days in police detention in Orsha town, described how together with other detainees he was told to walk through a “corridor” of some 50 police officers who beat them with truncheons. He suffered repeated blows to his head, and his legs turned blue from the blows he sustained.  
The exact number of arbitrarily detained protesters who have passed through Akrestina and other detention facilities throughout Belarus remains unknown. But at the start of December 2020 it already exceeded 27,000 people, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Arbitrary arrests have since continued.  
Impunity, further reprisals and intimidation  
While the Belarusian authorities have admitted receiving more than 900 complaints of abuses committed by law enforcement officers during the demonstrations, not a single criminal investigation related to these complaints has been launched. As well as facing severe reprisals, the complainants have been confronted with bureaucratic hurdles, delaying tactics and clear obstruction from a system designed to discourage and intimidate them, and invalidate and neglect their complaints and their evidence.   
One Akrestsina survivor told Amnesty International that, after she had managed to have her complaint registered and her injuries examined by an official medical forensic expert, she heard from the investigator that he would not start a formal investigation without an “order from above”.  
Instead of ensuring the prosecution of those suspected of human rights violations, the Belarusian Prosecutor General reported on 28 October 2020 that 657 criminal cases had been opened against protesters with more than 200 individuals already charged with mass riots and violence against police officers. Civil society organizations have documented scores of cases against peaceful protesters opened under politically-motivated, trumped-up charges.   
Call for international justice  
Belarus is bound by international law to uphold the human rights of all those on its territory, including ensuring the absolute prohibition of torture and investigating and sanctioning those responsible.   
“The unprecedented scale of the ongoing human rights violations and the total impunity of the perpetrators at home necessitate the enactment or establishment of international mechanisms for investigation and prosecution,” said Marie Struthers.  
“The international community cannot stand by.”

Amnesty Canada...","Amnesty International is extremely concerned about human rights harms resulting from climate change and  we therefore urge governments and companies to cease investments that expand fossil fuel exploration and production, including the development of new infrastructure. Amnesty Canada has joined a coalition representing over 3.5 million Canadians calling on Prime Minister Trudeau to cancel the Trans Mountain pipeline project because it conflicts with Canada’s climate policy goals. Amnesty further urges the Canadian government to ensure that the transition to a zero carbon economy is “just” and done in a way that reduces inequalities and protects the rights of workers and vulnerable communities. 
To the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau,Cc: Federal Cabinet Ministers 
On his first day in office, President Biden canceled Keystone XL (KXL) because, as the climate crisis intensifies, it is irresponsible to build new oil and gas pipelines. Canadians have consistently said and shown they want strong climate action. The federal government has responded to this by creating some bold new policy, like the carbon tax. However, the Canadian government continues to support the expansion of the oil sands, including by building the taxpayer-funded $12.6 billion and counting Trans Mountain pipeline project (TMX). 
Canada must follow Biden’s lead on Keystone XL and cancel TMX because it directly conflicts with the federal government’s recently announced climate plan and it does not have permission or consent from affected Indigenous Nations. 
Two separate federal government reports just released conclude that if Prime Minister Trudeau keeps his promises on climate action, neither the KXL or TMX pipelines will be needed and TMX will never make money for Canadians. 
The world is a markedly different place than it was when the Trans Mountain pipeline was first proposed: different in terms of the growing climate emergency and the changing economic reality. 
Energy giant BP forecasts that oil demand has peaked and will decline by 2050, while the International Energy Agency forecasts that oil demand will peak by 2030 and will have to decline by almost one-third by 2040 to meet Paris climate change objectives. 
ExxonMobil just took the biggest writedown in modern history – $20 billion of oil assets including Imperial Oil. An opinion piece in the Financial Post was titled, “Imperial Oil’s massive write-off suggests the era of stranded Canadian assets is already here”. 
Private companies are responding to declining oil demand by cutting investment. Teck recently canceled their $20 billion Frontier oil sands project and French energy giant Total has canceled future oil investment in Canada. Although they need to reduce much more their emissions in a manner consistent with the Paris Agreement, BP and Shell have started shifting some of their investments from oil to green energy. 
Canada is the US’s largest foreign source of oil and gas and that’s not changing anytime soon. With our economies inextricably tied we must be aligned in our understanding of fossil fuel economics and climate action. We must act together. 
As the Biden administration prepares to rejoin the Paris Agreement on climate and unveil the most ambitious climate plan in America’s history, Canada will be left behind if it does not reconcile the contradiction it has systematically ignored since 2015: you can’t solve the climate crisis while expanding the oil sands by building new pipelines. 
In 2019, you promised a Just Transition Act to help workers, but has barely mentioned it since. Instead of wasting time fighting for pipelines that deliver fewer jobs than green energy, it’s past time we got serious about having the backs of workers, families and communities through the move away from fossil fuels. 
We, a collection of Indigenous leaders, economists, and health, environmental, faith, labour and social justice organizations, representing more than 3.5 million people across Canada, are asking the federal government, which has committed to bold climate action, to cancel the Trans Mountain pipeline project.

The Ban the Scan campaign kicks off with New York City and will then expand to focus on the use of facial recognition in other parts of the world in 2021. Facial recognition systems are a form of mass surveillance that violate the right to privacy and threaten the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. 
The technology exacerbates systemic racism as it could disproportionately impact people of colour, who are already subject to discrimination and violations of their human rights by law enforcement officials. Black people are also most at risk of being misidentified by facial recognition systems. 
“Facial recognition risks being weaponized by law enforcement against marginalized communities around the world. From New Delhi to New York, this invasive technology turns our identities against us and undermines human rights,” said Matt Mahmoudi, AI and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International. 
“New Yorkers should be able to go out about their daily lives without being tracked by facial recognition. Other major cities across the US have already banned facial recognition, and New York must do the same.” 
In New York, Amnesty has joined forces with AI for the People, the Surveillance Technologies Oversight Project, the Immigrant Defence Project, the New York Civil Liberties Union, the New York City Public Advocate’s office,  The Privacy NY Coalition, State Senator Brad Hoylman and Rada Studios to campaign for legislation to ban the use of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance by law enforcement in the city. 
 “Police use of facial recognition technology places innocent New Yorkers on a perpetual line up and violates our privacy rights. Facial recognition is ubiquitous, unregulated and should be banned,” said Mutale Nkonde, Founder and CEO of AI For the People. 
Albert Fox Cahn, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project Executive Director at the Urban Justice Centre, said: “Facial recognition is biased, broken, and antithetical to democracy. For years, the NYPD has used facial recognition to track tens of thousands of New Yorkers, putting New Yorkers of colour at risk of false arrest and police violence. Banning facial recognition won’t just protect civil rights: it’s a matter of life and death.” 
Facial recognition technology can be developed by scraping millions of images from social media profiles and driver’s licenses, without people’s consent. Software then runs facial analysis of images captured on CCTV or other video surveillance to search for potential matches against the database of scraped images. 
While other US cities, including Boston, Portland and San Francisco, have banned the use of facial technology by law enforcement, New York Police Department [NYPD] continues to use the technology to intimidate and harass law abiding residents, as seen during last year’s the Black Lives Matters protests. 
Black Lives Matter 
On 7 August 2020, dozens of NYPD police officers tried to force their way in to Derrick “Dwreck” Ingram’s apartment in an attempted arrest. They accused Dwreck, a co-founder of the social justice organization Warriors in the Garden, of allegedly assaulting a police officer by shouting loudly into a megaphone at a June protest. 
One officer was caught on camera outside Dwreck’s home holding a document titled “Facial Identification Section Informational Lead Report”, revealing that facial recognition had likely been used to inform Dwreck’s arrest. The document featured Dwreck’s face matched to an Instagram photo. 
The NYPD misinformed Dwreck about his rights, threatened to break down his door, attempted to interrogate him without a lawyer, used at least one police helicopter and drones, and stationed dozens of officers in his hallway, on his fire escape, and in tactical positions in and around nearby buildings. The police left only after Dwreck live-streamed the events, a large crowd of protesters gathered, and the media began asking questions. 
Police “Wanted” posters with photos taken without his consent from Dwreck’s private Instagram account, were plastered around Dwreck’s neighbourhood. While the NYPD initially confirmed it had used facial recognition technology, it has yet to adequately disclose documentation in Dwreck’s legal case on the use of facial recognition technology. 
“We’re being specifically targeted with this technology because of what we’re protesting and because we’re trying to deconstruct a system that the police are a part of,” said Dwreck Ingram. 
The discriminatory impact of facial recognition technology goes far beyond its use by law enforcement to target peaceful protestors. In New York, landlords risk using the technology to spy on Black and Brown communities. 
In 2018-19, Atlantic Plaza Towers in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, a predominately Black and Brown community, successfully challenged the installation of facial recognition cameras in the apartment complex by landlord Nelson Management Group. 
Residents who initially campaigned against the use of facial recognition were threatened by the landlord with print outs of their faces from surveillance cameras and told to stop organizing. Led by Tranae Moran and Fabian Rogers, residents refused to back down. After the tenants took legal action to stop the invasion of privacy and theft of biometric data from anyone who entered the complex, combined with sustained pressure generated by Tranae and Fabian’s community organizing and collaboration with civil society organisations and media, Nelson Management Group announced in November 2019 at a tenants association meeting they would not install facial recognition in the complex. 
Amnesty International’s Ban the Scan campaign launch is accompanied by a website where residents of New York can generate comments on the NYPD’s use of facial recognition via the Public Oversight on Surveillance Technologies (POST) act, and later in the campaign, generate Freedom of Information requests to see where facial recognition technology is being used in their communities. 
The site will be expanded in May 2021, when Amnesty Decoders – a worldwide network of  digital activists will help geolocate facial recognition-capable surveillance devices in New York so residents know exactly where the technology is being used.  The site also features resources to help people better protect themselves at protests and against the use of facial recognition technology. 
Amnesty International is calling for a total ban on the use, development, production, and sale, of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance purposes by the police and other government agencies and calling for a ban on exports of the technology systems.

I noticed gender-based discrimination and inequality in the South Asian community when adults rejoiced when a child of the male sex was born and expressed disappointment when it was a female. I also observed members of the community continuously characterizing people according to “their caste.” Very early in my life, I began to recognize that discrimination, especially discrimination based on characteristics that are out of one’s control, such as one’s biological sex, race, and the socioeconomic status that one is born into, was unjust. In conjunction with other experiences in my life, my experience with such discrimination led to my interest in studying law to advance and engage with broader social justice issues. 
My desire to stand up against such injustices in society led to me pursuing an undergraduate education specializing in international relations focusing on international law and human rights. It was during my undergraduate education that I learned more about Amnesty International. Research and related literature published by individuals at Amnesty International helped me develop, for example, many arguments that analyzed the use of torture and indefinite detention at Guantánamo Bay by the American government in response to terrorism. Likewise, Amnesty International campaigns that focus on the abolition of the death penalty also resonated with my interests and values, and so, I began volunteering with Amnesty International Toronto during my undergraduate education. I enjoyed the knowledge-sharing that would take place at Amnesty events, witnessing the sheer passion many students and activists had for the various human rights concerns we discussed, and the efforts of individuals at Amnesty to actively incite positive change.   
This past summer I joined the AI Canada National Organizers Program. At the moment I am focusing on multiple projects with Amnesty, such as the Energy Transition/Ethical Battery campaigning, where I am working with a group of passionate individuals to research ethical battery production and the mining of cobalt and lithium in efforts to make the world’s first “ethical battery” and to advocate for human rights to be essential within a transition to cleaner world economy. I am also working as a Layout Editor and Social Media Strategist for the Matchstick, a recently launched digital arts and human rights publication for youth by youth.  We hope Matchstick will become an open space for creative expression, advocacy, and learning in support of human rights and human rights defenders worldwide. 
I am excited to see how these projects will unfold and look forward to the projects and initiatives that I will take on as I continue to volunteer with Amnesty International.

The report, “What do I care if you die?” Negligence and denial of heath care in the Egyptian prisons released on the 10th anniversary of the start of Egypt’s 2011 uprising, paints a grim picture of the human rights crisis in Egyptian prisons, which president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s government has packed with brave men and women who were at the forefront of the struggle for social and political justice. It also shows how prison authorities have failed to protect prisoners from the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly discriminate against prisoners from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
“Prison officials show utter disregard for the lives and wellbeing of prisoners crammed into the country’s overcrowded prisons and largely ignore their health needs. They leave it to the prisoners’ families to provide them with medication, food and cash to buy basics like soap and inflict additional suffering by denying them adequate medical treatment or timely transfer to hospitals,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. 
“The authorities go further in intentionally depriving men and women detained solely for exercising their human rights and others held for political reasons like health care, adequate food, and family visits. It is deplorable that the Egyptian authorities are seeking to intimidate and torment human rights defenders, politicians, activists and other actual or perceived opponents by denying them health care. When the denial causes severe pain or suffering and is a deliberate act for the purpose of punishment, it constitutes torture.” 
The report documents the detention experiences of 67 individuals, held in three women’s prisons and 13 men’s prisons in seven governorates. Ten of them died in custody and two shortly after their release in 2019 and 2020. 
Amnesty International communicated its findings to the Egyptian authorities in December 2020 but received no response. 
Cruel and inhuman conditions of detention 
Authorities subjected prisoners in the 16 researched prisons to cruel and inhuman conditions of detention, threatening their right to health. 
Former detainees described being cooped up in unventilated, overcrowded cells with substandard sanitation, and guards denying them adequate bedding and clothes, sufficient food, items for personal hygiene including sanitary towels and access to fresh air and exercise. Scores are cruelly barred from family visits. 
“There is evidence that prison authorities, in some cases citing instructions from the National Security Agency (NSA), target certain prisoners to punish them for their perceived opposition to or criticism of the government,” Philip Luther said. 
Reprisals included being held in prolonged and indefinite solitary confinement in abusive conditions for more than 22-23 hours a day; being denied family visits for periods of up to four years and being deprived of receiving any food packages or other necessities from relatives. 
Medical negligence and denial of health care 
Amnesty International’s research revealed the prison officials routinely fail to provide prisoners adequate healthcare – either through neglect or deliberate denial. 
Prison infirmaries are generally unsanitary and lack equipment and qualified health professionals, with prison doctors, only giving painkillers regardless of symptoms and even verbally abusing prisoners, including by accusing them of “terrorism” and “moral delinquency”. Two female former detainees said that prison medical staff sexually abused and harassed them. 
Former detainees also said there was no clear mechanism to seek medical help including in cases of emergencies, and that they were completely at the mercy of guards and other prison officials, who frequently ignored their pleas.  
Virtually no mental health services are provided in prison, while access to external assistance was only made available for a few prisoners who had attempted suicide. 
Prison authorities frequently refuse to transport detainees with political profiles needing urgent medical care to outside hospitals with relevant specialist capacity and withhold medication from them, even when costs could have been borne by families.  
Security officials continued to deny prisoner of conscience Zyad el-Elaimy, a former parliamentarian and one of the leading figures in 25 January 2011 protests from regularly receiving the constant care he needs for his underlying medical conditions. 
Sixty-nine-year-old Abdelmoniem Aboulfotoh, a former presidential candidate and founder of Misr Al-Qawia opposition party, has been arbitrarily detained since February 2018 in solitary confinement and suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and an enlarged prostate, yet the prison authorities have repeatedly denied his requests for transfer for treatment outside the prison, and severely delayed access to doctors inside prison. Prosecutors have dismissed his complaints.  
“It is shocking that all 67 individuals, whose cases are documented in this report, were denied adequate health care in prison or transfer to hospitals with specialist capacity, at least once during their detention, thereby causing a significant deterioration in their health.” Philip Luther said. 
“This gross dereliction of duty by the prison authorities is carried out with the knowledge and sometimes complicity of prosecutors in the absence of any independent oversight.” 
Deaths in Custody 
Amnesty International investigated 12 deaths in custody or shortly after release and is aware of 37 other cases in 2020, where the organization was unable to obtain consent from families for fear of reprisals. Egyptian human rights groups estimate that hundreds have died in custody since 2013 amid the authorities’ refusal to disclose figures or carry out effective, thorough, impartial and independent investigations into such deaths. 
Horrid prison conditions, including in prolonged solitary confinement, coupled with the deliberate denial of adequate health care may have contributed or led to multiple deaths in 2019 and 2020. Lives were also cut short by inadequate or delayed treatment in cases of emergency. 
Shady Habash, a 24-year-old filmmaker, died on 2 May 2020 after prison staff at Tora Investigations Prison failed to urgently transfer him to an outside hospital, despite knowing he was suffering from alcohol poisoning. 
Mass arbitrary detention and overcrowding 
The Egyptian authorities refuse to disclose the numbers of prisoners in the country. Estimates put the number at 114,000, over double the prison capacity of 55,000 indicated by President Abdalfatah al-Sisi in December 2020. 
The number of prisoners mushroomed after the ouster of late former President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013, leading to severe overcrowding. In the 16 examined prisons, hundreds of detainees are crammed into overcrowded cells with an estimated average 1.1m² floor space available per prisoner, much less than the 3.4m² minimum recommended by experts. 
The authorities continue to ignore calls to reduce the prison population amid COVID-19 outbreaks, endangering more lives. In fact, 4,000 fewer people were released in 2020 than in 2019 through presidential pardons and conditional releases. 
Poor response to COVID-19 in prison 
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, prison administrations have failed to regularly distribute sanitary products, trace and screen new arrivals, or test and isolate those suspected of infection. 
Longstanding issues, such as a lack of clean water, poor ventilation and overcrowding, have made physical distancing and preventative hygienic measures impossible to implement. 
Detainees with COVID-19 symptoms were not systematically tested. In some prisons, they were quarantined in small and dark cells used for solitary confinement without access to adequate treatment. In other prisons, they were left in their cells, endangering others. 
No oversight 
Prisons authorities operate with little to no independent oversight. Prosecutors have the authority to carry out unannounced visits to places of detention, but rarely do so and generally ignore prisoners’ complaints. 
Detainees have initiated hunger strikes, which have been met with threats and beatings. Families who have protested in public have been arrested. Human rights defenders and lawyers have faced threats and imprisonment. 
“The authorities must urgently reduce overcrowding including by immediately releasing all those detained arbitrarily and consider releasing prisoners at higher risk from COVID-19 complications due to their age or underlying medical conditions. They must provide all individuals in their custody with adequate health care, including COVID-19 vaccination, without discrimination. Egyptian authorities must allow independent experts unfettered access to prisons and work with them on addressing the abysmal conditions of detention and access to healthcare in prisons, before more lives are tragically lost.” said Philip Luther.

“Russian authorities relentlessly unleash reprisals against peaceful protesters what we saw today has only confirmed this. The police ignored their duty to guarantee the right to peaceful assembly and instead indiscriminately beat and arbitrarily arrested protesters, many of whom were young people.  
Amnesty International monitors witnessed first-hand the viciousness of the police response in Moscow. Low enforcement officers acted roughly and unreasonably against overwhelmingly peaceful protesters, pushing people down the stairs and beating protesters with batons. At one occasion, a policeman hit a man on the head with a baton simply for asking “What are you doing?”  
“This display of unbridled power sought to dampen the wave of discontent prompted by the arbitrary detention of Aleksei Navalny and the publication of his latest investigation, which revealed the gargantuan scale of corruption at the top of government.  
“We demand the immediate and unconditional release of all peaceful protesters and other civil society activists who have been subjected to “preventative” arrests on spurious charges, including staff members of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. All are prisoners of conscience, detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.   
Background  
According to the OVD-Info human rights watchdog, the police detained at least 395 people in Moscow alone by the time of publication. At least 182 were detained in Saint Petersburg, 91 in Novosibirsk and 47 in Krasnoyarsk. The overall number of detainees exceeded 1,330 by 5 p.m. Moscow time.  
Ahead of the rallies, on 21 January, the police detained Aleksei Navalny’s press secretary Kira Yarmysh, Anti-Corruption Foundation staff members Georgy Alburov and Lyubov Sobol, and the Foundation’s lawyer Vladlen Los, as well as numerous others associated with the Foundation across the country. Vladlen Los, who is a Belarusian citizen, was given a deportation order to leave Russia by 23 January.  
The protests were called in response to the arbitrary arrest of Navalny on 17 January upon arrival in Moscow from Berlin and his subsequent detention for 30 days.   
On 19 January, Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation team published an investigation into a billion-dollar palace, allegedly built for President Vladimir Putin on the Black Sea coast. Since its release, the video has been viewed by over 55 million people.

The treaty makes it illegal under international law to develop, test, possess, host, use or threaten to use nuclear weapons, and has been adopted by two-thirds of UN member states.  
None of the world’s nuclear powers have signed the treaty, and Amnesty International is urging these states and others to join the movement to eliminate the most inhumane and destructive weapons ever created.   
“Until now, nuclear weapons have been the only weapons of mass destruction not subject to a global ban treaty, despite the catastrophic harm they inflict. Today’s momentous change in international law – the result of decades of campaigning by civil society – brings us one step closer to abolishing the nuclear threat for good,” said Verity Coyle, Amnesty International’s Senior Advisor on Military, Security and Policing. 
“However, it is deeply worrying that none of the states who possess nuclear weapons have joined this treaty. Nuclear deterrence is a strategy based on the threat of killing millions of people and unleashing humanitarian and environmental catastrophe, and it has no place in today’s world.”  
A historic moment  
The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted by two-thirds of UN member states in 2017 and enters into force today.   
The treaty prohibits a wide range of actions by states, including developing, testing, producing, manufacturing, transferring, possessing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use nuclear weapons, or allowing nuclear weapons to be stationed on their territory.   
These are commonplace activities – according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and Turkey collectively host around 150 U.S. nuclear weapons. None of these states have joined the treaty.  
While the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 prohibits non-nuclear powers from manufacturing nuclear weapons, it does not impose a general ban on the use or possession of nuclear weapons for all its parties.   
Meanwhile, nuclear powers have not kept to their commitments under the NPT — in 2019, according to ICAN, nine countries spent a total of $72.9 billion on nuclear weapons.   
“TPNW plugs a huge gap in international law, and its entry into force must be met with a change of course by those states who still support, in any form, the use of nuclear weapons,” said Verity Coyle.  
“Ending the threat of nuclear weapons is the responsibility of all governments in accordance with their obligation to ensure respect for international humanitarian and human rights law.”

Amnesty redoubled its call for the release of a further 14 people who remain in detention and all those arbitrarily detained. 
Among those released is Mostafa “Moz” Azimitabar, a courageous voice of the #GameOver campaign, who was Medevac’d to Australia at the end of 2019 for urgent medical care and has been in detention ever since. 
“This is the most beautiful moment of my life… after 2,737 days locked up in detention – I am free. 
“Thank you to all of the amazing people who helped me to stay strong. 
“If I am able to obtain my freedom, there should be the opportunity for the others seeking asylum to have their freedom as well. Until all of us are free, none of us are truly free.” 
Amnesty International Australia Refugee Rights Advisor, Dr Graham Thom, said: “The fact that some of these people have been released today and not seven years ago demonstrates the totally arbitrary and cruel nature of locking innocent people up. The timing is curious, to say the least. 
“There are still around 150 refugees and people seeking asylum from Australia’s offshore detention regime detained in APODs and detention centres around Australia, with around 264 still offshore. For them, we must keep up the fight. 
“We’re also concerned about what happens to these people when they’re released – they receive no support, and in many cases have complex medical conditions for which they still need treatment.” 
“Australia is ultimately responsible for these people, people who were fleeing from some of the most dangerous places on earth. During their detention at the hands of our government their physical and mental health has been seriously damaged. Australia is obliged to help them repair the damage done over the past seven years. 
“This is a win for everyone who has worked for the release of these people, all the people who’ve signed petitions, sent messages of support and protested on the street to draw attention to the plight of the innocent people locked up for no reason,” Dr Thom said. 
Amnesty International launched the Game Over campaign in 2019 following a visit to PNG to visit Australia’s refugees with human rights advocate Craig Foster. More than 70,000 Australians and hundreds of community organizations have taken direct action to ensure all those detained by Australia’s cruel immigration policies are freed. 
The latest releases come as the international community criticised Australia’s offshore processing and mandatory detention regime as the United Nation conducted the third Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Australia’s human rights record. 
Among the countries calling for an end to offshore processing and mandatory detention were Germany, Ireland and Finland. 
A final report of recommendations for Australia to improve its commitment to human rights will be delivered by the UN on February 5.

This is an arbitrary detention, said Amnesty International as the post-election blockade entered its 7th day. 
Robert Kyagulanyi, also known as Bobi Wine, was declared runner-up by the Electoral Commission in last week’s presidential election, with 34.8% of the vote, behind President Yoweri Museveni, who it said got 58.6%. Bobi Wine and his National Unity Platform (NUP) party have alleged fraud. 
“Robert Kyagulanyi and his wife, Barbara Kyagulanyi, are being held under house arrest without being presented before a judge and for a non-cognizable offence. This is also having an impact on his ability to challenge the presidential election results, in what appears to be a ploy to prevent the NUP from going to court in time,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“It is neither a crime to stand for president nor to want to challenge the election results in court. This continued confinement is politically motivated and a blatant violation of their human rights. It must be lifted immediately and without any conditions.” 
Security personnel are also preventing people from accessing Robert Kyagulanyi despite him having reported that his family has run out of basic needs, including food. On 18 January, the security personnel stationed outside his house prevented the US Ambassador Natalie Brown from visiting Kyagulanyi’s residence, where she had gone to check on his health and safety, according to a statement issued by the US Embassy in Uganda on 18 January. 
On the same day, security forces also raided the headquarters of the NUP party. 
This is not the first time the Ugandan government has used arrests and detention to undermine opposition leaders’ plans to legally challenge presidential election results. During the 2016 election, the leading opposition presidential candidate at the time, Kizza Besigye, was barricaded in his home without charge the day after polls closed. He was later transferred to a police station when he rejected the presidential election results declaring President Museveni’s re-election and suggested that he would challenge them in court. 
Then, as now, the authorities termed their actions “preventive arrest”. Police Spokesman Fred Enanga has been quoted in the media as saying Robert Kyagulanyi was placed under “preventive arrest” as he “planned to disrupt public order”, but he did not specify what crime was being planned. More than a week now after he was placed in house arrest, the authorities have yet to present any charges against him. 
“The Ugandan government must immediately end the arbitrary detention of Robert Kyagulanyi and his wife. They must also cease and desist from the abusive practice of arbitrarily detaining opposition leaders without charge, which has become routine, especially during elections,” said Deprose Muchena. 
According to the Presidential Elections Act, aggrieved presidential candidates must lodge their petitions in the Supreme Court registry within 10 days of the declaration of the election results. This means Robert Kyagulanyi and the NUP party have until 26 January to file an election petition. 
Campaigning for the 2021 elections was marred by killings, arrests, beatings and disappearances, as well as harassment and intimidation of journalists and a five-day internet shutdown, among other human rights violations. At least 54 people were killed on 18 and 19 November, most of them shot dead by police and other members of the security forces after protests broke out following the arrest of Robert Kyagulanyi in the eastern Luuka district. 
Many organizers and supporters of Robert Kyagulanyi’s party were arrested during and after election day and a number of them remain behind bars, some even after they were granted court bail.

0,DRC: Authorities must immediately and unconditionally release 10 youth activists,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/drc-authorities-must-immediately-and-unconditionally-release-10-youth-activists/,"Democratic Republic of Congo’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release 10 youth activists who are facing malicious charges solely for participating in a peaceful protest to demand the protection of civilians in Beni Town, Amnesty International said today ahead of their sentencing...","Democratic Republic of Congo’s authorities must immediately and unconditionally release 10 youth activists who are facing malicious charges solely for participating in a peaceful protest to demand the protection of civilians in Beni Town, Amnesty International said today ahead of their sentencing by a military court on 20 January. 
Eight of the 10 activists, belonging to the youth movement, Lutte pour le Changement (LUCHA), were arrested in Beni on 19 December after they staged a protest to denounce what they see as the UN peacekeeping force’s failure to protect civilians in the area. Two other activists, also belonging to LUCHA, were arrested in Beni on 7 January, during a peaceful protest against a new taxation on motorcycle taxis. 
“The arrests and subsequent prosecutions of these youth activists for merely asking for the protection of civilians in Beni is a travesty and amounts to persecution. This persecution contravenes the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Congo,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East, the Horn and the Great Lakes. 
“Instead of persecuting them, Congolese authorities ought to have appropriately responded to their demands for effective protection of civilians against ongoing killings and kidnappings in the affected areas. The authorities must drop all charges against them.” 
The eight activists are facing charges of “wicked destruction and sabotage” and have been languishing in prison since 19 December. Their hearing started on 21 December before the Beni-Butembo garrison military court. According to the prosecution, they are being tried by a military court because the destruction and sabotage they are accused of would have occurred inside police facilities, which the activists and witnesses say is a “complete fabrication”. 
During their arrest and detention, the activists were subjected to beatings by police officers and other inmates. Efforts by their lawyers to challenge the competence of the military jurisdiction on their case were rejected. 
The court is expected to pronounce its verdict on Wednesday 20 January 2021. The prosecution last week requested 10 years’ imprisonment against them. 
The eight activists are: 
Mumbere Sikuli Délivrance, a 20-year-old high school student; 
Mukirania Consolée, a 25-year-old businesswoman; 
Kasereka Muhetsya Ezée, a 20-year-old high school student; 
Kakule Mutsuva Clovis, a 27-year-old law graduate; 
Nzila Patrick, an 18-year-old high school student; 
Muhindo Aziz, a 32-year-old moto taxi driver; 
Lwanzo Kasereka Kahongya, a 34-year-old carpenter; 
Mbusa Elie, a 24-year-old moto taxi driver. 
Two other LUCHA activists were arrested in the town of Beni on 7 January, during a peaceful protest against a new tax on motorcycle taxis. Jeanpy Lufungula and Grace Matembela have since been unlawfully detained. They are yet to be brought before a judge to face formal charges. 
“Authorities must drop cynical charges against these activists and respect, protect and ensure the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly as enshrined in the Constitution and international human rights treaties to which the DRC is a state party,” said Sarah Jackson. 
“The Congolese authorities, under the leadership of President Félix Tshisekedi whose start of office in 2019 was marked by some human rights progress, must stop treating peaceful dissent with contempt. The government should not go back to the days of the Kabila government when LUCHA activists and others were routinely arrested and arbitrary detained.” 
Background 
Since 2014, thousands of civilians have been killed in repeated attacks the authorities attribute to the Ugandan militant group, the Allied Democratic Forces-National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (ADF-NALU) in eastern DRC’s Beni region. Despite a heavy UN and Congolese army presence in the region and multiple military operations, killings and abduction continue almost daily. Activists have accused both the Congolese authorities and the UN of failing to protect the population. Their demands for effective protection and justice have often been met with a brutal crackdown.

“This shocking case is yet another serious assault on Thailand’s vanishing space for freedom of expression.   
“The fast-rising number of individuals facing charges and being detained under the lèse majesté law demonstrates the Thai authorities’ relentless drive to silence dissent. Today’s extreme sentence is a case in point, and shows why this law is inconsistent with international human rights law. 
“Defamation should never incur a criminal conviction in the first place, let alone an extremely long jail sentence like today’s. 
“Anchan has already faced appalling treatment since being arrested in 2015, including pre-trial detention for years, some of which incommunicado.  
“The manner of her sentencing is also chilling. The way authorities have evidently sought to maximize the punishments by multiplying criminal charges sends a clear message of deterrence to Thailand’s 50 million internet users.  
“The Thai authorities must halt their crackdown on peaceful dissent. The government must repeal or significantly revise legislation which gags freedom of expression both on- and offline, such as the lèse majesté offence and the Computer Crime Act used in today’s verdict.”   
Background  
Anchan P., a food seller and former civil servant, faced 29 counts of “insulting the monarchy”, or lèse majesté, under Article 112 of Thailand’s Criminal Code and provisions of the Computer Crime Act. She was arrested in January 2015 and detained for nearly four years until November 2018, when she was released on bail.   
Anchan was initially detained incommunicado in a military camp for five days before her transfer to a detention facility and repeatedly denied bail.   
The court convicted Anchan for allegedly sharing and uploading clips on social media of an online talk show alleged to have made defamatory comments about the monarchy.  
Anchan pleaded guilty to the charges and received a consecutive three-year sentence for each of the 29 lèse majesté offences, or 87 years – the harshest conviction under Article 112 to date. The sentence was reduced by half to 43 and a half years owing to Anchan’s guilty plea. Article 112 of the Criminal Code carries between three and 15 years’ imprisonment per violation. 
Amid mounting peaceful protests throughout 2020, the Thai authorities resumed the use of lèse majesté charges in November of that year, having brought no new charges under the law since March 2018.   
More than 220 people, including children, have faced criminal charges for their alleged involvement in peaceful protests throughout 2020.  Of those, dozens have been charged with sedition and lèse majesté.  
Thailand is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects the right to freedom of expression under Article 19. The UN Human Rights Committee, the treaty body responsible for interpreting the ICCPR, has stated that “imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty” for defamation-related offences such as lèse majesté.

“Today’s ‘hearing’ makes a mockery of ​​justice. Not only did the authorities shamelessly bring a judge to the police station to rule on Aleksei Navalny’s detention, but they also denied him access to his lawyer until the last possible moment. No independent media or member of the public was present to witness this farcical ‘hearing’, but to give the illusion of a transparent process, the ‘courtroom’ was packed with representatives of the pro-government press.”  
“These absurd theatrics expose the Russian authorities’ desperation to silence Aleksei Navalny. In anticipation of Navalny’s return to Russia, the authorities authorized a mass police presence at Vnukovo airport to intercept and arrest anyone merely coming to greet him; the closure of the airport; the surprise diversion of his flight to Sheremetyevo airport; the blockage of roads leading there; and finally, Navalny’s detention at border control.”   
“This is the stuff of Hollywood blockbusters, not the behaviour of a government that respects human rights. The Russian authorities must immediately release Navalny and anyone detained in connection with his arrival. They are prisoners of conscience, guilty of nothing other than exercising their right to freedom of expression.”  
Background  
On 18 January, the Khimki City Court remanded Aleksei Navalny to 30 days in custody pending trial for “multiple violations of the terms of his probation”, for his conviction in a previous politically motivated trial. The hearing took place inside a police station where Aleksei Navalny was placed after being detained in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport the previous evening.  
Navalny’s lawyer was denied access to him until one minute before the hearing began in the police station. State-run TV channels were allowed into the police station whereas journalists from numerous independent outlets as well as Navalny’s supporters were kept outside in freezing -20°C degree conditions.

Navalny had been recovering in the German capital after being poisoned in Siberia in August.  
“Aleksei Navalny’s arrest is further evidence that Russian authorities are seeking to silence him. His detention only highlights the need to investigate his allegations that he was poisoned by state agents acting on orders from the highest levels,” said Natalia Zviagina, Amnesty International’s Moscow Office Director.  
“The Russian authorities have waged a relentless campaign against Navalny. While he was recovering in Germany, the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service demanded that he immediately present himself to a probation officer or face prison for violating a non-custodial criminal sentence, which was based on politically motivated charges. He has now been arrested on trumped-up charges of fraud.”  
“The authorities handled Aleksei Navalny’s arrival as a fully blown security operation with hundreds of police officers summoned to the Vnukovo Airport, arresting and pushing out Navalny’s supporters into -20°C cold. They didn’t even stop at redirecting the flight to another airport, Sheremetyevo.  
“All Navalny supporters and journalists detained in Moscow Vnukovo Airport must be immediately and unconditionally released. Their only crime – is wishing to greet Aleksei Navalny or to cover his arrival in Russia.”  
Aleksei Navalny has been deprived of his liberty for his peaceful political activism and exercising free speech. Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience and calls for his immediate and unconditional release. The organization reiterates its call to the Russian authorities to open a criminal investigation into Navalny’s poisoning and ensure that all those responsible are brought to justice in fair trial proceedings. The Russian authorities must end their campaign of intimidation and political persecution against their critics, including the staff members and supporters of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation.  
Background  
Popular political activist, founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation and author of numerous groundbreaking investigations exposing corruption among Russia’s top officials and politicians, Aleksei Navalny narrowly survived what has since been independently confirmed as poisoning by Novichok nerve agent on 20 August 2020.  
He has been tried and convicted in two separate, politically motivated criminal cases in previous years. On 29 December, the Russian Investigative Committee levelled new charges against Navalny, accusing him of embezzling 356 million rubles (4.9 million USD) in donations to the Anti-Corruption Foundation and affiliated non-profit organizations.

Anti-Black racism is prejudice, attitudes, beliefs, stereotyping and discrimination that is directed at people of African descent and is rooted in their unique history and experience of enslavement and its legacy. Anti-Black racism is deeply entrenched in Canadian institutions, policies and practices, to the extent that anti-Black racism is either functionally normalized or rendered invisible to the larger White society. Anti-Black racism is manifest in the current social, economic, and political marginalization of African Canadians, which includes unequal opportunities, lower socio-economic status, higher unemployment, significant poverty rates and overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. [source: https://www.ontario.ca/document/data-standards-identification-and-monitoring-systemic-racism/glossary]

However, this transition carries its own risks of additional environmental harms and the abuse of human rights. Many decarbonization solutions, such as rechargeable batteries, require vast amounts of minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. These minerals are often mined by people whose rights are abused by transnational mining companies and governments and whose lands and livelihoods are put at risk from industrial pollution. 
Similarly, people who recycle spent batteries from laptops, cell phones and electric vehicles may be unnecessarily exposed to toxic chemicals in unregulated recycling facilities. 
Amnesty International firmly believes that human rights and environmental protections must not be sacrificed to advance climate solutions. At the same time, we cannot ignore the urgency of the climate crisis. 
If the energy transition is facilitated by further human exploitation, dispossession, and environmental harm, we will look back on this critical time with regret. A just and truly sustainable energy transition – grounded in human rights – will benefit us all. It is within our grasp. 
On February 4, Amnesty international will launch a set of guiding principles for governments and companies to address the human rights and environmental challenges of increasing our reliance on rechargeable batteries. We invite you to join us in calling on Canada to power a just energy transition that leaves no one behind.

The Armenian and Azerbaijani forces’ repeated use of notoriously inaccurate and indiscriminate weapons – including cluster munitions and explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated civilian areas – violated international humanitarian law and killed scores of civilians, injured hundreds and destroyed homes and key infrastructure in the recent conflict, Amnesty International said today. 
The organization’s new report, In the Line of Fire: Civilian casualties from unlawful strikes in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, is based on an on-the-ground investigation on both sides and details 18 strikes by Armenian and Azerbaijani forces which unlawfully killed civilians. In all, at least 146 civilians, including multiple children and older people, died in the 44-day conflict between late September and early November 2020. 
Armenian forces employed inaccurate ballistic missiles, unguided multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS), and artillery. Azerbaijani forces also used unguided artillery and MLRS. Authorities on both sides have denied launching indiscriminate strikes against civilian areas and using cluster munitions – despite clear evidence that they both have done so. 
“By using these imprecise and deadly weapons in the vicinity of civilian areas, Armenian and Azerbaijani forces violated the laws of war and showed disregard for human life,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
“Civilians were killed, families were torn apart and countless homes were destroyed because all parties to the conflict used notoriously imprecise weapons against towns and cities.” 
Civilian casualties would almost certainly have been much higher were it not for the fact that many people had either fled affected areas or taken shelter in basements when the conflict started. 
Dozens of strike sites visited 
Following the 10 November tripartite agreement ending the conflict, Amnesty International visited dozens of strike sites in Azerbaijan and Armenia in late November and early December 2020. 
The organization interviewed 79 survivors, witnesses and relatives of civilians killed and injured in the strikes, in addition to local civilian and military authorities, NGO workers and journalists. 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team analyzed fragments of munitions used in the attacks and examined videos, photographs, and satellite images taken during the conflict. 
“Our research revealed a pattern of indiscriminate and disproportionate strikes by both sides that killed and harmed civilians and damaged civilian objects. Attacks were repeatedly carried out on civilian residential areas far from frontlines, and where there often did not appear to be any military targets in the vicinity,” said Marie Struthers. 
Attacks by Armenian forces  
Amnesty International documented eight strikes carried out by Armenian forces on towns and villages in Azerbaijan which killed a total of 72 civilians. 
In the city of Ganja on 17 October, 21 civilians were killed and more than 50 injured when a SCUD-B ballistic missile hit the Mukhtar Hajiyev neighbourhood. Sudaba Asgarova’s daughter Nigar was killed in the strike, a day before her 15th birthday. “She was my only child. She was all I had,” Sudaba told Amnesty International. 
Ramiz Gahramanov, 64, told Amnesty International that in the same strike his daughter Khatira, 34, was killed along with her son Orhan, 11, and two daughters Maryam, six, and Laman, 18. In the aftermath of the blast, Ramiz said: “I looked down and when I saw that the house had been completely destroyed, I immediately knew that they had all died because nobody could have survived such destruction. I could not find the bodies of my grandchildren. Parts of their bodies were not found until days later, in the next street, and some parts were not found at all.” 
On 27 October, five people were killed and 14 injured when Armenian forces launched a cluster bomb strike on the village of Qarayusufli, causing widespread damage to homes. One of those killed was seven-year-old Aysu Iskandarli, who was playing on a swing in her garden at the time. 
Armenian forces also fired several large-calibre rockets into the city of Barda on 28 October, more than 20 km from the frontline. Three rockets landed in the city centre, two of them near two hospitals. The third – a Russian-made 9M55 Smerch rocket containing 72 9N235 cluster submunitions – landed in the middle of a busy roundabout, killing 21 civilians. 
On 27 September, the day the conflict began, Armenian forces launched an artillery strike in Gashalti, near Naftalan, killing five members of the Gurbanov family and partially destroying their house. Bakhtiar Gurbanov, who lost his parents, along with his brother’s wife, his nephew and niece, told Amnesty International: “Our family was destroyed. We had started to renovate the house before the war, now we can’t bear to be here anymore.” 
Attacks by Azerbaijani forces  
Amnesty International documented nine strikes carried out by Azerbaijani forces on towns and villages in Nagorno-Karabakh and one in Armenia, killing 11 civilians. According to local de facto authorities, at least 52 Armenian civilians were killed in the conflict. 
The region’s main city Stepanakert came under frequent attack, sometimes several times in a single day. Some of the strikes were carried out using inherently indiscriminate weapons, such as 122mm Grad rockets and internationally banned cluster munitions.  
A series of strikes on 4 October killed four civilians and injured a dozen more. Naver Lalayal told Amnesty International how his 69-year-old father Arkadi was killed in this attack: 
“Since the war started, my parents had been staying in the shelter in the basement of the building with other residents and came up to the apartment regularly to use the bathroom and the kitchen. That morning my father came upstairs and was standing on the balcony when a rocket exploded in the garden. He was killed on the spot and much of the apartment was destroyed.” 
A young woman with intellectual and physical disabilities was injured and traumatized by the same strike. 
An independent weapons expert reviewed munition fragments Amnesty International observed at the site and identified them as “likely parts of an EXTRA ballistic missile,” an Israeli weapon known to have been sold to Azerbaijan. 
Several other locations around the city were struck the same day, including near a school that was no longer in session and near the office of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
In other strikes on Stepanakert, it appeared that Azerbaijani forces deliberately targeted critical infrastructure, including the Emergency Services, a large compound on the city’s eastern edge. On 2 October at around 2 pm a rocket strike hit the adjacent car park, mortally wounding one of the rescuers, 25-year-old Hovhannes Aghajanyan, injuring 10 of his colleagues and seriously damaging the hangar that houses emergency vehicles. 
In Martuni, on 27 September, 12 strikes in the space of four minutes included one that mortally wounded an eight-year-old girl, Victoria Gevorgyan, and left her two-year-old brother Artsvik badly injured and traumatized. 
“Victoria was our little angel. She is gone … My little boy now still wakes up saying that there are planes in the sky bombing,” their mother Anahit Gevorgyan told Amnesty International. 
Davit Khachatran, a resident of Martakert, told Amnesty International how both of his parents and his aunt – all in their 60s – were killed in an instant when a Grad rocket struck the entrance of a building opposite the family’s fruit and vegetable shop on 30 September. The rocket was still lodged in the building’s steps when Amnesty International visited in mid-December. 
“The Armenian and Azerbaijani authorities must launch immediate, impartial investigations into their forces’ relentless and often reckless use of heavy explosive weapons in populated civilian areas. As the Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders begin to work out security arrangements it’s crucial that those responsible for these violations are swiftly held to account and that the victims get reparations,” said Marie Struthers.

Successive Tunisian governments have failed to prioritize accountability for human rights violations committed by security forces. Impunity for acts of torture and other ill-treatment or excessive use of force of the past has contributed to a never-ending cycle of violations. 
Since May 2018, at least 10 trials relating to the violent repression of the revolution were initiated before the Specialized Criminal Chambers created by the Transitional Justice law to address crimes of the past – but no verdict has been handed down. Former and current Ministry of Interior officials have refused to respond to court summons to appear. 
“These trials may be the last chance to achieve accountability for the crimes committed and to deliver justice to the victims and their families. But they have been significantly undermined by the persistent obstruction from the security sector. Security officers have ignored court summons and orders, egged on by their unions who have called for a boycott of the proceedings,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Former or current Ministry of Interior officials accused of arbitrary killing of protesters and other human rights violations committed during the revolution defy the judicial system by failing to appear before court hearings time and again, illustrating the sense of impunity they continue to enjoy in Tunisia today.”  
The creation of the mechanisms of transitional justice will remain one of the notable legacies of Tunisia’s revolution. Amnesty International calls on the Tunisian authorities to support the process by bringing suspected perpetrators to justice and provide guarantees for the diligent prosecution of those accused of the killings and other grave violations against peaceful protesters. 
During Tunisia’s revolution, security forces killed 132 protesters and injured 4000, according to the National Commission to investigate abuses and violations during the revolution. In its aftermath a law on transitional justice was adopted, creating a truth commission called the Truth and Dignity Commission (IVD). The IVD commenced its work in 2016, taking the testimony of thousands of victims and witnesses, and two years later referred 12 indictments to the specialized courts which resulted in 10 trials. 
For the past two years, there have been at least 23 hearings relating to the trials which have taken place before the Specialized Criminal Chambers in different tribunals, including in Tunis, Le Kef and Sidi Bouzid. Dozens of victims and witnesses have testified in court, often in the absence of the accused. However, no case has reached the pleading phase to date and not a single judgment or verdict has been handed down. 
One of the protesters, killed in Thala on 8 January 2011, was 19-year-old Marwen Jamli. His father, Kamel Jamli, told Amnesty International he and his family had spent years shuttling back and forth to the military court in Kef, then in Tunis and now in Kasserine, in the hope of getting justice: 
“Our children did not die for nothing; it is our duty to fight for justice now so that nobody else has to suffer what we are suffering. They sacrificed their lives, we will make the sacrifices needed too … We will now keep going to Kasserine no matter how tired and old we get. We know who killed our sons in Thala, we know that they are still in active duty and that is something we have to live with every day until justice is achieved. At least they have to confess, tell the truth about what they did and express remorse.” 
Mimoun Khadhraoui, whose brother, Abdel Basset Khadhraoui, was shot dead by police on the streets of Tunis on 13 January 2011, said he and his family would never stop their quest for the truth. 
“…the people that believe the most in the transitional justice process are the families of the martyrs of the revolution. The proof is that we are still here 10 years later. We are tired and frustrated but we will not give up. This is beyond our right to justice or my brother’s case, it is the right of the Tunisian people to truth and justice.”  
Tunisia has an obligation, under international law, to guarantee the right to effective remedy for victims of human rights violations. This includes the right to truth, by revealing the facts; justice, by investigating past violations and prosecuting the suspected perpetrators; and reparation by providing full and effective reparation to the victims and their families, in its five forms: restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-repetition. 
“With the risk of judicial rotations further obstructing ongoing trials, the High Judicial Council must ensure that the judges of the specialized criminal chambers are enabled to carry out their duties and that the annual judges’ rotation does not adversely impact the trials underway or result in undue delays,” said Amna Guellali.

Once again, Canada contests the Tribunal orders and rulings and has filed for legal review. This time, Canada disputes the Tribunal definition of a First Nation child. 
In our work to advocate for respect for Indigenous rights, it is crucial to respect self-determination by not relying on colonial definitions and concepts that can diminish Indigenous rights and sovereignty. In this most recent ruling, the Tribunal expressed the desire to respect Indigenous Peoples’ inherent rights of self-determination and self-governance, including their right to determine citizenship in crafting all remedies to respect Indigenous Peoples’ inherent rights of self-determination and of self-governance including their right to determine who their citizens are. The Tribunal also stated that it recognizes that these rights are inherent to Indigenous Peoples and that they are also human rights of paramount importance.

Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, let Amnesty know that the advocacy of our members and supporters has been seen and appreciated.  Stand with First Nations children, youth and families, so they have equitable opportunities to grow up safely at home, be healthy, get a good education and be proud of who they are! 
WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
The federal government is responsible for funding services in First Nations communities that would otherwise be funded by the provincial and territorial governments. However, the federal government’s funding of child and family services in First Nations communities for many years has been at least 22 percent less per child. This underfunding has created a crisis for First Nations children and their families. 
In 2007, the Assembly of First Nations and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society brought a complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. They were referred for a hearing before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, alleging that the underfunding of child welfare services for children living on reserves is discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
Eight years later, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal rendered its landmark decision in January 2016. The Tribunal found that the federal government’s underfunding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves was discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act. It ordered the government to “cease its discriminatory practices” and reform its funding system to provide for the needs of Indigenous children. The Tribunal also ordered that the federal government “take measures to immediately implement the full meaning and scope of Jordan’s Principle,” which states that services and programs for children may not be delayed or obstructed by jurisdictional disputes between different government departments or other levels of government.  
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE 
Amnesty International intervened in this case at the request of Cindy Blackstock, executive director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. We argued that the Canadian Human Rights Act must be interpreted consistently with Canada’s international obligations. International law strictly prohibits discrimination against an individual or group because they are Indigenous. Canada also has obligations under international law to protect children. These obligations require the government to consider the best interests of First Nations children in all of its actions, including by preserving their family environment and protecting their cultural identity through the provision of appropriate child welfare services. Finally, Amnesty International’s submissions specified that where an individual’s international human rights are violated due to discrimination, they are entitled to timely and effective remedies, including the financial and other resources necessary to structure programs, services and products that meet human rights standards. 
STATUS OF THE CASE 
In 2019, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that Canada willfully and recklessly discriminated against First Nations children and ordered Canada to monetarily compensate First Nations children, youth, and families with the maximum allowable amount under the Canadian Human Rights Act. In October 2019, the federal government applied for judicial review of this decision, stating that the Tribunal did not have the jurisdiction to award this compensation because of a lack of identifiable children who experienced harm. On November 25, 2020, the CHRT released 2020 CHRT 36 ruling on the groups of children eligible to receive services through Jordan’s Principle. The CHRT ruled that cases meeting any one of four criteria are eligible for consideration under Jordan’s Principle. Canada contested and appealed this ruling and asked for another legal review on December 22, 2020.

“The collapse of this case marks yet another sorry milestone in the Sri Lankan authorities’ continued failure to ensure justice for crimes committed during the armed conflict. The Attorney General’s Office has not indicated any interest in re-opening the investigation into the murder. 
“Those aligned with the state must not continue to enjoy impunity for historic abuses. Without accountability, Sri Lanka will never be able to turn the page on this dark chapter. The authorities must immediately launch a new thorough, effective and impartial criminal investigation and bring those responsible for Joseph Pararajasingham’s murder to justice.   
“However, given the repeated failures of past domestic accountability mechanisms, we are not holding our breath. The international community must step up to end the cycle of impunity and advance accountability for human rights violations in Sri Lanka.”  
Background  
Joseph Pararajasingam MP was shot dead while attending mass at St Mary’s Church, Batticaloa on Christmas Eve 2005. One of the five persons suspected of criminal responsibility for the murder was MP Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan (alias Pillayan), the leader of Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP), a government-aligned political party. The Criminal Investigations Department arrested Chandrakanthan in connection with the murder in 2015.   
In February 2020, the Sri Lankan government withdrew its support for the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution committing the country to promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights. Amnesty International is calling on UNHRC to launch a new process or mechanism to pursue the objectives of resolution 30/1.

“Amid concerns over threatening rhetoric from high-ranking government officials, use of violence and an escalating crackdown on political opposition, human rights defenders, activists, journalists and civil society actors, it is alarming that the Ugandan authorities have suspended social media networks including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp and restricted people’s right to freedom of expression and access to information.  
“The move is clearly intended to silence the few accredited election observers, opposition politicians, human rights defenders, activists, journalists and bloggers who are monitoring the elections. Such shutdowns are a violation of the right to freedom of expression and access to information. Ugandan authorities must immediately lift all blanket restrictions, and end their wave of political repression ahead of the general election.”  
Despite banning social media, the Ugandan authorities are circumventing their own restrictions to communicate on these channels. Similarly, telecommunication providers are announcing their compliance with the social media shutdown on the same channels that they have shut.   
Social media shutdowns have happened in previous Ugandan elections. In 2011, authorities instructed internet service providers to temporarily block access to Facebook and Twitter for 24 hours and in 2016, authorities ordered telecommunication companies to block social media access on mobile phones.   
Background  
Uganda’s President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, in office for more than 34 years, is seeking a sixth term. On 12 January he accused Facebook and unnamed others of interfering with the electoral process.  
On the same day, UCC Executive Director Irene Sewankambo ordered telecommunications companies to “immediately suspend any access and use” of social media and online messaging platforms. Service providers such as Airtel and MTN Uganda have already written to their subscribers announcing the suspension.  
On 9 January, Facebook shut down dozens of pro-government accounts claiming they were “fake and duplicate accounts” linked to the country’s Ministry of Information to make content appear more popular ahead of the elections.  
Silencing peaceful dissent and shutting down the internet and social media show that the authorities are failing to uphold their international human rights obligations including those relating to the right to freedom of expression provided under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Article 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Uganda is a state party to both.  
In 2016, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights adopted a resolution in which it expressed its concerns over “the emerging practice of State Parties of interrupting or limiting access to telecommunications services”.

But this human rights crisis has not gone away. In fact, according to a survey conducted last Spring by the Native Women’s Association of Canada, violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people has increased during the pandemic. 
The federal government has still not issued a formal response to the National Inquiry’s Final Report. The much-anticipated National Action Plan to implement the National Inquiry’s 231 Calls for Justice, which was set to be released in June 2020, was delayed because of the pandemic. The government has stated that the plan is under development, but the timeline remains unknown. 
As the federal government crafts the National Action Plan it is looking to provinces and territories to see how each jurisdiction plans to implement the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice. In December, the Yukon became the first jurisdiction to release its strategy to end the violence. 
Much of Amnesty International’s advocacy with the No More Stolen Sisters campaign has focused on calling for the federal government to take action. Our calls for federal action remain unchanged, but this year we are pivoting to focus on action at the local, provincial, and territorial levels to encourage these levels of government to review the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice and work with rights holders to develop action plans for their jurisdiction. 
On March 8th, we will release a No More Stolen Sisters campaign guide to support your activism at the local, provincial, and territorial levels. The guide will include a brief overview of the issues and actions taken to date, and provide guidance for Amnesty supporters building and strengthen connections with rights holders to collectively explore how best to support local, provincial, and territorial initiatives to end the violence. 
Please make space in your activist calendar to review the campaign guide in March. If you are part of a community group that now meets virtually, please build in time to discuss the campaign guide together. Please take time to implement the guide throughout 2021. 
The guide will be uploaded here on March 8th, International Women’s Day.

The inspiring Lenca leader was internationally recognized for her determined efforts to stop construction of a dam on the Gualcarque River that Indigenous communities opposed for violating their rights. Berta was awarded the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize, known as the ‘Green Nobel’, for her leadership of this struggle. To learn more, watch a 5-minute video about why Berta was awarded the prize and listen to Berta’s inspiring words at the acceptance ceremony. 
The anniversary is an important moment to make visible international support for the courageous defenders who risk their lives to continue the vital human rights work for which Berta was killed. 
 
The anniversary also calls on us to raise our voices yet again to insist that everyone responsible for the assassination of Berta Caceres is identified and brought to justice.  
Sustained pressure from inside and outside Honduras has been successful in overcoming entrenched impunity and ensuring that seven men involved in carrying out the contract killing of Berta were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences (read more in this blog). 
Yet those who ordered, plotted and paid for the crime have so far escaped accountability, despite ample evidence of their involvement. Until full accountability is achieved, there is little hope of stopping ongoing deadly violence against defenders of land, Indigenous rights and the environment. Honduras remains one of the most dangerous countries in the hemisphere for these defenders and the Indigenous peoples they represent.

In a statement issued today, leading human rights organizations, Amnesty International, Jesuit Refugee Service Europe, Médecins du Monde Belgique and Refugee Rights Europe have called for immediate humanitarian support to address the current emergency as well as durable institutional solutions to meet the needs of people transiting through the country. 
“Accommodation is available to house most of the people currently sleeping rough in bitterly cold temperatures in Bosnia and Herzegovina. What is lacking is the political will to make that happen. The authorities at all levels must immediately provide suitable shelter and assistance to those in need,” said Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office. 
No long-term solutions despite €88 million of EU assistance  
The EU has provided over €88 million in assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina to strengthen its migration management capacity over the past three years. Despite this, the country has failed to identify suitable facilities for the accommodation of migrants and asylum-seekers, assume full responsibility for the management of existing facilities or to provide minimal guaranteed support to those stranded in the country. 
“The EU now has to work with the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina on finding systemic, long term solutions to meet the needs of people on its territory and ensure that this situation does not reoccur yet again next winter,” said Eve Geddie. 
“The EU’s responsibility is clear – the current humanitarian crisis is also a consequence of EU’s policy of fortifying its borders that has left thousands of people stranded on its periphery or in the neighbouring countries.” 
Lipa unsafe, as temperature plummets 
Many of those at risk were housed in a temporary makeshift camp in Lipa, northwest Bosnia, which was shut down on 23 December. A fire broke out during closure, converting the area into an uninhabitable wasteland. Over the weekend, the authorities installed dozens of heated tents on the ground, but close to 400 people remain in makeshift shelters despite heavy snow and the temperatures that are forecasted to plummet in the coming days. 
“Without access to running water, adequate sanitation or heating, and significant risks to people’s health and safety, Lipa remains unsuitable as a permanent accommodation site. 
Outside of Lipa, many people, including families with children, continue to seek refuge in parks, abandoned houses, defunct factories, and forests close to the border with Croatia. They are in desperate need of shelter and humanitarian assistance as they face dire winter conditions.  
“Ultimately, EU’s support for humanitarian crises will ring hollow unless it changes the policies that cause them. The EU must create more genuine opportunities for safe and legal ways for those fleeing conflict, persecution or poverty to reach Europe,” said Eve Geddie.

Over the past year, because of the pandemic, we have seen the number of women experiencing gender-based violence go up, the hours women dedicate to unpaid care work skyrocket, threats faced by women human rights defenders increase, marginalized groups including sex workers become further marginalized, access to sexual and reproductive health services decrease, and the number of women in the paid labour force plummet. 
But we have also seen activists come together to demand that governments address the violence, ensure access to sexual and reproductive health services, protect activists, advocate for the rights of sex workers, and demand access to affordable and high-quality childcare. 
International Women’s Day, which every year falls on March 8th, is always a time to take stock of feminist accomplishments over the past year and re-commit ourselves to the work ahead. This year we have much to take stock of, and much to re-commit ourselves to. The coming year will continue to be shaped by the pandemic response, and it will also be shaped by pandemic recovery. The pandemic has forced us to re-think society, and now is the time to re-think, re-envision, and re-build a more just and equitable world. 
In many parts of the world, the pandemic has been a more dangerous time for activists, including women human rights defenders in jail who face a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. Join us in March to watch an inspirational documentary that we’re sure will leave you more re-committed than ever to our collective activism, and take action in support of jailed women human rights defenders. 
Stay tuned for other opportunities to connect with each other and take action collectively in March to mark International Women’s Day.

“This is about more than just the 40 people still held at Guantánamo – it is also about the crimes under international law committed over the past 19 years and the continuing lack of accountability for them. It is about the future, too, as we move towards the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks and strive for enduring justice,” said Daphne Eviatar, Director of the Security with Human Rights Program at Amnesty International USA. 
The report documents a catalogue of human rights violations perpetrated against those detained at the camp, where victims of torture are held with inadequate medical care indefinitely and in the absence of fair trials. Transfers out of the facility have stalled, and even those cleared for release have remained incarcerated for years on end. Detentions at Guantánamo began out of the decision to frame the U.S.’s response to the 9/11 attacks as a “global war on terror,” bypassing human rights protections in the pursuit of intelligence gathering. Crimes under international law such as torture and enforced disappearance were committed against detainees deliberately held out of reach of judicial scrutiny at secret facilities operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in other countries or in Guantánamo. The report calls for renewed urgency on this issue, accompanied by a genuine commitment to truth, accountability and remedy, as well as a recognition that indefinite detention at   Guantánamo must not be allowed to persist any longer 
“These are detentions that are inescapably bound up with multiple layers of unlawful government conduct over the years – secret transfers, incommunicado interrogations, forced feeding of hunger strikers, torture, enforced disappearance, and a complete lack of due process”  said Daphne Eviatar.  
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in 2009, Vice President, now President-elect, Joe Biden told his audience: “We will uphold the rights of those who we bring to justice. And we will close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay.” He emphasized that the “treaties and international organizations we build must be credible and they must be effective.” A dozen years later, as he prepares to become President, he has an opportunity to live up to those words. He should seize it.

International Day of Action for Rivers on March 14 is a celebrated around the world as a day for solidarity action with communities defending access to the water of clean, flowing rivers. World Water Day, which is celebrated each year on March 22, will focus this year on the value of water for all of us, especially amid the climate crisis.  
On and around these key dates, we are organizing Days of Action in solidarity with unjustly imprisoned indigenous river defender Bernardo Caal Xol in Guatemala and other threatened water defenders. 
Bernardo Caal Xol is a Maya Q’eqchi’ Indigenous community leader, trade unionist and teacher who was persecuted and unjustly jailed in order to silence his peaceful, legitimate efforts on behalf of communities confronting the destructive impacts of a big dam project on the Cahabón River. Bernardo Caal Xol is a prisoner of conscience. He is now at grave risk of contracting COVID-19, amid overcrowded prison conditions. Meanwhile, Bernardo’s people and other communities continue to be attacked for seeking to defend their right to clean water and decision making about projects that will cause irreparable harm.

These are the words that Jani Silva, a courageous woman environment defender in the Amazon region of Colombia, shared at Amnesty Canada’s Sparking Connections online conference in November (watch a video of what Jani said at the conference on our YouTube channel here). Not long after we talked with her, Jani had to flee her home and go into hiding because of dangerous new threats that put her life in danger and reduced state protection.  
During December’s Write for Rights campaign, more than 9,000 Amnesty Canada supporters raised their voices to demand strengthened, not reduced, protection for Jani and other threatened defenders of her organization, ADISPA. 
 
From hiding, Jani sent a message of heartfelt appreciation for all the messages of concern sent to Colombian authorities from Canada. She told us how important it is for people in Canada to speak out, help to make visible the worsening crisis for environment defenders in Colombia and call for action to stop a terrifying increase in attacks and assassinations.  
The South American country is now one of the most dangerous in the world to defend land, Indigenous territory and the environment. As the bloodshed continues, women defenders face the additional threat of sexual violence against them or their daughters. This horrendous situation is documented in Amnesty’s 2020 report Why Do They Want To Kill Us? Lack of Safe Space to Defend Human Rights in Colombia. 
On Earth Day, April 22, Amnesty Canada will launch a new campaign for the protection of land and environment defenders in Colombia.  
Bookmark this page and revisit it in April for emblematic stories of environment defenders at risk and details of the actions we will be asking Amnesty Canada supporters to take. Our Colombia campaign will run until December 2021 and include e-action, creative social media action, letter writing and opportunities to make visible our solidarity. We will organize online events in order to hear directly from defenders. We will also focus on Canadian connections to what is happening in Colombia. 
Meanwhile, be sure to sign this online action for Jani Silva and ADISPA. 
Also be sure to sign this action for Colombian river defender Isabel Zuleta and the members of Rios Vivos (Living Rivers) movement, persecuted for denouncing a disastrous big dam project financed with millions of dollars of public money by Export Development Canada.

This campaign has a global reach. Uyghurs living overseas – including in Canada – are being harassed and intimidated by Chinese authorities: intrusive surveillance, intimidating phone calls, and even death threats.

Instead, in April 2019, it unveiled a powerless advisory post called the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE). The CORE is little different from what has already existed for years and is ill-equipped to address human rights abuses linked to Canadian companies operating overseas. 
At the time, the Canadian government said that the promised powers to independently investigate would need to wait a little longer – until the results of an external legal review were made public, in just a few weeks’ time. Fast forward more than 18 months later and the report remains buried and the office of the CORE remains powerless. 
Then in late November 2020, the office of the Minister of Small Business, Export Development and International Trade cemented the CORE’s fate, informing our coalition (the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability) that Canada will not give the CORE the promised powers to compel documents and testimony after all. This is outrageous!  
Join us in urging the Government of Canada to empower the CORE and enact human rights due diligence legislation without further delay.

In response, Amnesty International USA Interim Executive Director Bob Goodfellow issued the below statement: 
“The President’s embrace of white supremacist and violent groups has further fanned the flames of the chaos and violence we witnessed today, putting human rights and the rule of law at grave risk in the United States. All U.S. officials must respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, including to be free from violence, intimidation and racism. 
“Amnesty International works for a world where all those in power respect the law, meet their human rights obligations, and are held to account when failing to do so. Across the world, we have witnessed the dire consequences of government officials who spread false information and incite racist or political violence to stay in power. The world is watching, and so are our more than 10 million supporters and members.” 
“This is a moment of reckoning for the United States. President Trump has repeatedly encouraged violence and disorder by his supporters affecting journalists, activists, faith communities and others. These are not the actions of a head of state who has an obligation to ensure the safety of all people under his jurisdiction. All public officials must condemn words and actions that fuel hatred and intimidation.”  
Background and context 
Amnesty International USA is monitoring the situation and is deeply troubled by what is occurring in the country. The organization is calling on the President to deescalate, not add to, the climate of fear, uncertainty, and turmoil. The human rights organization is also calling on the President and his administration to ensure that they are disseminating reliable and trustworthy information, countering false and misleading information, and doing everything in their power to prevent and condemn attacks and intimidation by hate groups.

I am also the daughter of immigrants who had escaped civil unrest in a war-torn country. It is through this lens that I have cultivated a deep passion for social equity, advocacy and human rights activism. During my years of undergraduate study, I earned my B.A. in Criminology and Human Rights and although I wanted to be a voice for those who have routinely been silenced, I felt that I did not have a tangible means of doing so. I had the knowledge but not the tools for creating real, meaningful change. 
I later learned about Amnesty International’s work during my time as a fundraiser. Here, I was able to get a glimpse into some of the urgent campaigns affecting many marginalized and disenfranchised communities. When I heard about the launch of the National Organizers program in the fall of 2018, I knew that I wanted to get involved. This was the beginning of actualizing my role as a global citizen through activism and advocacy. Since then, I have participated in numerous initiatives including those related to women’s rights, anti-racism, prisoners of conscience, Indigenous rights and climate change. 
 
I am most proud of the letter writing actions that I have organized and participated in. The annual Write for Rights events in particular, have always been inspiring and empowering for me as an organizer. It is the reason why I have centered most of my activism around letter writing. In the past, I mobilized groups of volunteers to sign petitions and call on governments to take a stand against the abuse of Indigenous women including those defending the Amazon rainforest and those who have undergone forced sterilization here in Canada. More recently, I helped organize an international anti-Black racism letter writing online event which was in response to the heinous murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Regis Korchinski-Paquet. I appreciate that along with sending letters, we are encouraged to write cards in solidarity with those impacted by human rights abuses. These cards are then mailed directly to them as a reminder that they have not been forgotten and that we are actively fighting for their rights and freedoms. 
The National Organizers program is a unique one which has shown me that I can make a difference both locally and abroad, regardless of my age or any other factors. It has also taught me the power of collective activism through our voices and actions.

“President Donald Trump must grant clemency to those facing execution during the last days of his administration and President-Elect Joe Biden should end the use of the federal death penalty immediately upon taking office. 
“After a seventeen-year hiatus in federal executions, the Trump administration resumed federal executions this last year and has pursued far more executions on federal death row since reliable statistics began to be gathered in 1927. The cases of those selected for execution have been marked by arbitrariness, ineffective legal representation, racial bias, and, in violation of international law and standards, have involved people with severe mental and intellectual disabilities. 
“By resuming the cruelest and most irreversible of punishments, the federal government is dramatically and disgracefully out of step with the general momentum. Around the world countries are increasingly moving away from the death penalty. In the United States twenty-two states have abolished the death penalty, while in all fifty states people are fighting tirelessly to end the inhumane practice. 
“2020 brought enormous losses as a result of the pandemic. All three people facing execution have felt the impact of the pandemic, as two of Lisa Montgomery’s lawyers contracted COVID-19, and in December, Corey Johnson and Dustin Higgs reportedly tested positive themselves. Instead of ensuring the safety of all, these actions only add to the death toll and further chip away at this country’s morale.” 
Background and context  
The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception – regardless of who is accused, the nature or circumstances of the crime, or method of execution. Amnesty International believes that the death penalty should be abolished, once and for all. 
The United States’ human rights record was reviewed by the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2020. During oral remarks, 34 countries, almost one third, called for the United States to issue a moratorium on the death penalty and executions. 
Amnesty International previously called for the federal government to end the federal death penalty and to rescind the July 25, 2019 addendum to the Federal Execution Protocol and the recently enacted Department of Justice rule on “Manner of executions”. The organization also called on the federal government to withdraw any execution dates already set, cease to seek any death sentences, withdraw authorization for all pending death penalty cases, commute all federal death sentences, and for the United States Bureau of Prisons to dismantle the death chamber at FCI Terre Haute prison. Additionally, Amnesty International calls on Congress to abolish the death penalty in federal law. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, more people on death row across the United States have died of COVID-19 than were executed this year.

“Today’s decision to refuse Julian Assange’s bail application renders his ongoing detention ‘arbitrary’, and compounds the fact that he has endured punishing conditions in high security detention at Belmarsh prison for more than a year,” said Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International’s Europe Director. 
“Rather than finally going home with his loved ones and sleeping in his own bed for the first time in almost ten years, Julian Assange will be driven back to his solitary cell in a high security prison.” 
Julian Assange has been detained for more than year pending a decision on his extradition to the US. On Monday, a judge ruled that extradition to the US would be unlawful. After so long in detention the failure to grant him bail has rendered his detention arbitrary. 
On Monday, the judge noted the dire state of Assange’s mental health, and the risk to his health has been compounded by the ongoing COVID pandemic in the UK. 
“It is clear that Julian Assange should not have been jailed pending extradition in the first place. The charges against him were politically-motivated, and the UK government should never have so willingly assisted the US in its unrelenting pursuit of Assange,” said Nils Muižnieks. 
“The US government is behaving as if they have jurisdiction all over the world to pursue any person who receives and publishes information about government wrongdoing. Today’s decision seems intended to send a message that British justice will not stand in their way.”

See our response to Monday’s extradition verdict https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/01/uk-assange-extradition-decision-welcome-but-exposes-politically-motivated-process/ 
BACKGROUND 
The US extradition request is based on charges directly related to the publication of leaked classified documents as part of Assange’s work with Wikileaks. Publishing such information is a cornerstone of media freedom and the public’s right to information about government wrongdoing. 
Publishing information in the public interest is protected under international human rights law and should not be criminalized. 
If extradited to the US, Julian Assange could face trial on 18 charges, 17 of them under the Espionage Act; and one under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He would also face a real risk of serious human rights violations due to detention conditions that could amount to torture or other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement. Julian Assange is the first publisher to face charges under the Espionage Act.

“This shocking crackdown on Hong Kong’s political opposition – sweeping up candidates, activists and pollsters alike – is the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponized to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment. 
“This ruthless legislation gives the Beijing and Hong Kong authorities free rein to crush any dissenting views and puts all government critics at risk of imprisonment. Today’s arrests also illustrate how the broad scope of the law allows it to be applied in circumstances that do not qualify as genuine threats to national security. 
“Charging dozens of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists with ‘subversion’, just because they held their own informal primary contest, is a blatant attack on their rights to peaceful expression and association. People have a legitimate right to take part in public affairs. Political opposition should not be silenced just because the authorities don’t like it. 
“The Hong Kong government must stop this dangerous practice of treating critics as criminals and threats to national security. Unless there is evidence that those arrested today have committed an internationally recognized criminal offence, they should be immediately released.” 
Background 
Around 50 Hong Kong pro-democracy figures were arrested on Wednesday morning for alleged violations of Hong Kong’s national security law. 
According to media reports and social media posts, they were charged with “subversion” over their organization and participation in a self-proclaimed primary for last year’s Legislative Council election, which was later postponed over COVID-19 fears. 
Among the arrested were several former lawmakers and district councillors, organizer of the primaries Benny Tai and American lawyer John Clancey, who was treasurer for one of the organizers. Also arrested was Robert Chung, executive director of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI), which provided the technology to carry out the poll. 
The home of jailed activist Joshua Wong was also raided by police, according to his Twitter account, while newspapers Apple Daily and the Stand were visited by police seeking contact information of primary candidates. 
The democratic camp conducted a poll last July to narrow the final list of pro-democracy candidates to run in the official legislative polls. They aimed to secure a majority in the Legislative Council by winning more than 35 seats. 
At the time, the Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the polls were illegal and warned that they could be in breach of the national security law, which had been enacted weeks earlier.

0,Israel/OPT: Denying COVID-19 vaccines to Palestinians exposes Israel’s institutionalized discrimination,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/israel-opt-denying-covid-19-vaccines-to-palestinians-exposes-israels-institutionalized-discrimination/,"The Israeli government must stop ignoring its international obligations as an occupying power and immediately act to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are equally and fairly provided to Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, said Amnesty International today. On 23...","The Israeli government must stop ignoring its international obligations as an occupying power and immediately act to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are equally and fairly provided to Palestinians living under its occupation in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, said Amnesty International today. 
On 23 December, the Israeli Health Ministry began the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Having already given initial jabs to more than a 10th of its population, Israel has been hailed as the country that has to date achieved the widest vaccination coverage in proportion to its population size. However, the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out plan so far covers only citizens of Israel, including Israeli settlers living inside the West Bank, and Palestinian residents of Jerusalem. It excludes the nearly 5 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, under Israeli military occupation. 
“Israel’s COVID-19 vaccine programme highlights the institutionalized discrimination that defines the Israeli government’s policy towards Palestinians. While Israel celebrates a record-setting vaccination drive, millions of Palestinians living under Israeli control in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will receive no vaccine or have to wait much longer – there could hardly be a better illustration of how Israeli lives are valued above Palestinian ones,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“Israeli authorities must ensure that vaccines are equally provided to the Palestinians living under their control, in order to meet their obligations under international law. They must also ensure smooth entry of vaccines and other medical equipment to the OPT, including making any necessary logistical arrangements to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines.” 
The Israeli Ministry of Health has not yet publicly formulated an allocation policy that includes reserving specific amounts of doses for Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), nor has it established a timeline for the disbursement of these vaccines to Palestinian health authorities. 
Over half a century of occupation and enforcement of a system of institutionalized discrimination in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, Israel has deprived Palestinians of their basic rights and committed mass human rights violations. Israel must end its discriminatory policies and remove any barriers that may hinder Palestinians from accessing or enjoying health care. 
Israel’s obligations under international humanitarian law include the duty of ensuring and maintaining “the medical and hospital establishments and services, public health and hygiene in the occupied territory, with particular reference to the adoption and application of the prophylactic and preventive measures necessary to combat the spread of contagious diseases and epidemics”, as per Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
As of 3 January 2021, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 159,034 Palestinians in the OPT, including East Jerusalem, have so far tested positive for coronavirus since the first confirmed case was reported in March 2020. There have been nearly 1,600 deaths related to COVID-19 among Palestinians in the OPT since the beginning of the pandemic. 
As the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and de facto Hamas administration in the Gaza Strip cannot independently fund vaccines and their distribution among the Palestinian population, they depend on global co-operation mechanisms such as COVAX, which still has not begun distributing vaccines. Israel must provide full financial support to ensure that the vaccine is promptly distributed to the Palestinian population without discrimination. Israel must also lift the blockade on the Gaza Strip to enable the proper functioning of its health system in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaza’s health care system – subjected to half a century of occupation and more than a decade of blockade – is already unable to meet the needs of its population. The COVID-19 pandemic and lack of fair access to vaccines have only magnified the discrimination and inequality faced by the Palestinian population. 
“The Israeli government must uphold its obligations as the occupying power, under international humanitarian law and human rights law, to provide the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health to the population of the OPT without discrimination,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“The views of marginalized groups must be at the forefront of any decision-making to ensure that national vaccine policies aren’t exclusionary or discriminatory. All states must confront existing inequalities to ensure everyone has access to vaccines.”  
On 22 December, 10 human rights and health organizations issued a statement calling on Israel to ensure that its vaccination campaign includes Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. 
In early December, Israel reached an agreement with Pfizer pharmaceutical company to supply 8 million doses of its newly approved COVID-19 vaccine – enough to cover almost half of Israel’s population of nearly 9 million since each person requires two doses. Israel also reached a separate agreement with Moderna to buy 6 million doses of its vaccine – enough for another 3 million Israelis. 
As the race to distribute COVID-19 vaccines gathers pace, Amnesty International calls on states and companies to ensure that no one is denied access to health care, including vaccines, because of where they live, who they are or what they earn. 
Background 
There are approximately 600,000 Israeli settlers residing in 256 settlements and outposts scattered across the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. 
On 3 January 2021, the Israeli Health Ministry said that 435,866 people in Israel had so far tested positive for the coronavirus since the first confirmed case was reported in February 2020. Almost 3,400 people have died in Israel, it said. 
Reports indicate that the first batch of 313,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses arrived in Israel in early December 2020, and the country was expected to receive 3.8 million additional doses by the end of December 2020. 
The Palestinian authorities have nominal and limited jurisdiction over parts of the occupied West Bank in accordance with interim peace agreements reached with Israel in the 1990s. Israel captured the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip following the 1967 war. 
The Palestinian authorities hope to obtain vaccines for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip through a WHO-led partnership with humanitarian organizations known as COVAX, which aims to provide vaccines to up to 20% of the population of all participating countries, many of which have been hit especially hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.

0,Israel/OPT: Drop politically motivated charges against Palestinian activist Issa Amro,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/israel-opt-drop-politically-motivated-charges-against-palestinian-activist-issa-amro/,"A military judge at Israel’s Ofer Military Court in the occupied West Bank is expected to give tomorrow his verdict against Issa Amro, a prominent Palestinian activist who is facing politically motivated charges for his peaceful activism against Israel’s military occupation and illegal...","A military judge at Israel’s Ofer Military Court in the occupied West Bank is expected to give tomorrow his verdict against Issa Amro, a prominent Palestinian activist who is facing politically motivated charges for his peaceful activism against Israel’s military occupation and illegal settlements; some of the charges date back to 2010. Amnesty International fears that Issa Amro will be given a long prison sentence. 
Ahead of Issa Amro’s hearing, which is set to take place on 6 January 2021, Saleh Higazi, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, said: 
“The Israeli authorities must end their campaign of persecution against Palestinian activist Issa Amro, who is a prominent voice against Israel’s regime of discrimination and systematic human rights violations against Palestinians in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), particularly in Hebron. 
“Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Israeli authorities to drop all the charges they have imposed on Issa Amro. It considers them all to be politically motivated and linked to his peaceful work in exposing Israel’s human rights violations. 
“More broadly, the organization is urging the Israeli authorities to end their systematic attacks against Palestinian activists who speak up and peacefully act against Israel’s long-standing military occupation. Such attacks are an assault on the right to freedom of expression. The international community must act now to stop this campaign of repression and work to ensure that human rights defenders and activists in Israel and the OPT are protected from arbitrary interference in their work.” 
Background 
Issa Amro is a founder of the Youth Against Settlements (YAS) group in Hebron. He and his group are committed to non-violent activism against the illegal Israeli settlements in Hebron and the discriminatory restrictions placed on Palestinians by the Israeli authorities in the city. Issa Amro documents human rights violations in the city in the context of Israeli’s military occupation, organizes peaceful protests and distributes information about the settlements, violence by settlers and human rights violations by Israeli forces to journalists, diplomats and other visitors. He is continuously targeted by Israeli authorities and settlers for his human rights work. 
Issa Amro first appeared in an Israeli military court in February 2016, when he was presented with 18 charges, ranging from “insulting a soldier” to “participating in a march without a permit”. Some of the charges date back to 2010. Issa Amro denies all the charges. Trials before Israeli military courts fail to meet international standards of fair trial. 
Over the past decade, Amnesty International has documented a pattern of attacks on Palestinian human rights defenders and activists in Israel and the OPT. An escalation of acts of intimidation by the Israeli government and of attacks and threats by settlers and other non-state actors has created an increasingly dangerous environment for activists in Israel and in the OPT. 
Hebron is one of two Palestinian cities in the OPT that have illegal Israeli settlements inside them. The Israeli authorities have long imposed a set of severe and deeply discriminatory restrictions on movement on Palestinian residents of Hebron that have amounted to collective punishment. Israeli forces in Hebron frequently fail to prevent attacks on Palestinians by settlers, and almost never hold those responsible to account. 
In September 2017, Issa Amro was arrested by Palestinian security forces for posting comments on Facebook critical of the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank. He was later charged with disturbing “public order” under the Palestinian Electronic Crimes Law, as well as “causing strife” and “insulting the higher authorities” under the 1960 Jordanian Penal Code, which is still enforced in the West Bank. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank to drop all charges against Issa Amro.

Please note that this op-ed was originally published on gal-dem in mid-Dercember. Since then Canada has started a vaccination program. 
The fight against COVID-19 has taken a huge leap forward this month. The historic rollout of the first vaccine is underway in the UK and the USA, while Canada and others are set to soon follow suit. For many the news represents light at the end of the tunnel as we may have the opportunity to put an end to this pandemic. 
But this is a global crisis that requires a global solution. The success of any vaccine will depend on it being fairly distributed and made available first to those most at risk – regardless of where they live, who they are, or what they can afford. 
We all have the right to be protected against COVID-19. But as wealthy countries hoard doses, the lifesaving potential of vaccines risks being undermined by inequality and corporate interests.  
In a desperate bid to ensure their own escape routes from this pandemic, Western countries have made advance purchases of billions of doses of future vaccines for their populations – buying up enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations nearly three times over by the end of 2021. Known as “vaccine nationalism”, this involves large bilateral purchasing agreements between companies and a select number of countries. 
New research by the People’s Vaccine Alliance, including Amnesty International, Frontline AIDS, Global Justice Now and Oxfam, shines light on who would have access to a vaccine if these contracts were to be rolled out today. 
Both Canada and the UK have bought enough to vaccinate each of their citizens five times over. The USA has secured 800 million doses of at least six vaccines, with an option to purchase around 1 billion more. And the European Union, Japan, Canada and Australia have also followed suit, securing millions of additional potential doses. 
The hoarding of vaccines is leaving limited potential supplies for other countries to protect their populations against COVID-19. In fact, 67 countries, including Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ukraine – nations that have reported nearly 1.5 million cases between them – will only be able to vaccinate one out of 10 people unless we course correct immediately. 
Governments and the pharmaceutical industry have human rights obligations and responsibilities to take measures to increase access to these life-saving advances for the maximum number of people around the globe. The health and livelihoods of millions of people rely on a safe and effective vaccine being available and allocated in a fair and timely way, upholding the right to health, allowing people to earn a living, and ensuring people can see those they love without fear or restrictions.  
Without fair access globally, pre-existing inequalities will only deepen – with those who have been marginalised and discriminated against historically continuing to be disproportionately impacted.  
Take people living in overcrowded and unsanitary refugee camps – they are likely to be at higher risk of exposure and often have no access to the healthcare they need, including vaccines. Indigenous Amazonian communities in Ecuador are at risk too – they face a higher risk of COVID-19 thanks to the scarcity of drinking water, food, medical supplies, health services and vital tests. 
Several UN agencies have also warned that nearly half of the world’s workforce is at risk of losing its livelihood, whilst the World Bank has noted that 88 to 115 million people may be pushed into extreme poverty in 2021, possibly rising to as many as 150 million people. 
Governments have a responsibility to ensure those most at risk everywhere around the globe have access to vaccines when they become available. This means wealthier states should refrain from making large bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies. Instead, they should join and support global initiatives which aim to ensure fair vaccine access for all countries, such as the World Health Organisation’s COVAX mechanism.  
Leading pharmaceutical companies must also fulfil their human rights responsibilities and ensure the widest possible access to their innovations, putting people before patents. 
It is vital the views of marginalised groups are amplified to ensure that national vaccine policies are not exclusionary or discriminatory.

“We welcome the fact that Julian Assange will not be sent to the USA and that the court acknowledged that due to his health concerns, he would be at risk of ill-treatment in the US prison system. But the charges against him should never have been brought in the first place. The charges were politically-motivated, and the UK government should never have so willingly assisted the US in its unrelenting pursuit of Assange. 
“The fact that the ruling is correct and saves Assange from extradition, does not absolve the UK from having engaged in this politically-motivated process at the behest of the USA and putting media freedom and freedom of expression on trial. It has set a terrible precedent for which the US is responsible and the UK government is complicit.” 
BACKGROUND 
The US extradition request is based on charges directly related to the publication of leaked classified documents as part of Assange’s work with Wikileaks. Publishing such information is a cornerstone of media freedom and the public’s right to information about government wrongdoing. Publishing information in the public interest is protected under international human rights law and should not be criminalized. 
If extradited to the US, Julian Assange could have faced trial on 18 charges, 17 of them under the Espionage Act; and one under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He would also face a real risk of serious human rights violations due to detention conditions that could amount to torture or other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement. Julian Assange is the first publisher to face charges under the Espionage Act.

“Loujain al-Hathloul is a brave human rights defender whose peaceful activism together with other brave Saudi activists has driven momentous social change in Saudi Arabia. This sentencing, while partially suspended, still shows the cruelty of the Saudi authorities towards one of the bravest women who dared to be vocal about her dreams of a better Saudi Arabia.  
“With this deeply flawed trial and the continued relentless crackdown on activists and human rights defenders, Saudi Arabia has proven that its rhetoric on human rights reform is utterly hollow.  
“Loujain al-Hathloul has already spent more than 900 days in detention, during which she endured torture, sexual harassment and other forms of ill-treatment, was held in solitary confinement and denied access to her family. We are extremely concerned for her wellbeing and safety, and reiterate our calls for her immediate and unconditional release. In the meantime, Loujain must be allowed access to her family and a doctor of her choosing.”  
“We reiterate our calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all Saudi human rights defenders and women activists who are still in detention, including Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani, and ensure that charges are dropped against all 13 activists on trial for promoting women’s rights.    
Background  
In 2018, Saudi Arabia arbitrarily arrested 13 women’s rights activists for exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly, including Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani.  
On 28 December, Loujain al-Hathloul was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, after her case was transferred to Saudi Arabia’s Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) in November. She was charged with “spying with foreign parties” and “conspiring against the kingdom” for promoting women’s rights and calling for the end of the male guardianship system in Saudi Arabia. Amnesty International has documented how trials conducted before the SCC are intrinsically unfair, in gross violation of the international right to fair trial.  
The Court has suspended 2 years and 10 months of Loujain al-Hathloul’s term and backdated its start to May 2018, meaning she only has three months left to serve.

Thirty-one year old Loujain al-Hathloul is one of the most celebrated women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia for good reason. She was one of the leaders of the campaign for Saudi women to have the right to drive vehicles. She advocated against the male guardianship system. She wanted to set up frontline services to support survivors of gender-based violence. She networked with other activists and organizations, attended international conferences, and testified on Saudi Arabia’s women’s rights record at the United Nations. 
Instead of being celebrated for her tireless and impactful activism, Loujain has been jailed since 2018, subjected to torture and other forms of ill treatment, held incommunicado for long periods of time without access to independent legal counsel and family visits, charged with terrorism-related offenses, and she could face up to twenty years in prison. 
Loujain is not a criminal. She is not a terrorist. Her “crimes” are doing things that Amnesty supporters do every day, like sharing information and strategizing with fellow activists. 
Amnesty International calls for Loujain and other Saudi women human rights defenders to be immediately and unconditionally released and for all charges against them to be dropped. Advocating for women’s rights is not a crime! 
Loujain has been in jail since May 2018. She has not been convicted of any crime. 
Her case was brought before the Specialized Criminal Court (anti-terrorism court) in March 2019, where it was then moved to the Criminal Court, which held a hearing on her case, also in March 2019. After that, everything stopped. Her next trial hearing was in February 2020. Her family visited her in March 2020. After a phone call with her family in April 2020, Loujain was held incommunicado until the end of August 2020. After one visit with her family she was again held incommunicado until the end of October 2020. 
In November 2020, Saudi Arabia hosted the G20 Leaders’ Summit. In the lead-up to the Summit, activists around the world advocated for Loujain’s release. Right after the Summit ended, and with less than 24 hours notice, Loujain’s trial resumed on November 25. During the hearing, her case was moved back to the Specialized Criminal Court. Trial hearings in the Specialized Criminal Court were held throughout December. 
At a hearing in the Specialized Criminal Court on Monday, December 28, Loujain was sentenced to five years and eight months in prison, including a suspended sentence of two years and 10 months, plus time served. This means that Loujain could be released in approximately three months. However, she will have to serve three years of probation and could be re-arrested during that time if she engages in illegal activities (i.e. activism), and she will be banned from travel for five years. Read Amnesty International’s statement on Loujain’s conviction.

Police violence has been a defining feature of 2020 – from the brutal killing of George Floyd in the US, to violent crackdowns on protests in Belarus, Hong Kong and Nigeria.   The COVID-19 pandemic...","Now more than ever, it’s important to know our rights when it comes to the police. Police violence has been a defining feature of 2020 – from the brutal killing of George Floyd in the US, to violent crackdowns on protests in Belarus, Hong Kong and Nigeria.   
The COVID-19 pandemic has also fuelled police abuses around the world. As Amnesty International documents in a new report, law enforcement has often played far too prominent a role in what is fundamentally a public health issue.   
In many countries police have abused their powers – carrying out mass arrests, beating or shooting people for violating public health restrictions, or using force against peaceful protesters. Many governments have used the pandemic as a pretext for repression, resulting in arrests and detentions of journalists, activists and health workers for sharing information, or for criticizing COVID-19 response measures.  
A pandemic does not relieve police forces of their obligation to respect human rights, nor of their primary duty to serve and protect the population. Although some restrictions on certain human rights may be justifiable during a pandemic, these must have a proper legal basis, be necessary and proportionate, and they must have a legitimate aim, such as the protection of public health.  
Amnesty’s research shows that far too many law enforcement agencies have crossed the line – for example by using lethal force when there is no imminent threat of death or serious injury, or by imposing blanket bans on public assemblies.    
So what’s the right way to police a pandemic? Here’s a quick guide, based on international human rights laws and standards.  
Exercise restraint in enforcing COVID-19-related regulations.  
Prioritise de-escalation, mediation and negotiation in all interventions.  
Always ensure their response is legitimate, necessary and proportionate, and that it is not contributing to spreading the virus.   
Ensure that law enforcement interventions do not interfere with human rights more than necessary, and do not cause greater harm than the harm they want to prevent.  
Ensure journalists, bloggers, human rights defenders and political activists can pursue their activities without interference.  
Avoid the use of force – in particular force which is likely to cause injury.  
Facilitate people’s exercise of their right to freedom of peaceful assembly  
When policing public assemblies, only use wide area chemical irritants like tear gas when there is widespread violence that cannot be addressed by targeting violent individuals alone – and only as a last resort.  
As far as possible, use arrest and detention as a last resort – this will reduce the risk of contagion.  
When arrest and detention is unavoidable, take all measures available to prevent contagion in these settings.  
Discriminate  
Enforce COVID-19-related regulations on people who are unable to follow them (e.g. homeless people unable to confine themselves).  
Use humiliating measures to enforce COVID-19-related regulations.  
Use police powers to repress the right to freedom of expression.  
Carry out forced evictions.  
Carry out illegal expulsions of refugees and migrant workers  
Use force against people who are acting against COVID-19-related regulations solely to meet their basic needs (e.g. in search for food, medicine, medical assistance).  
Use force likely to cause injury solely to enforce COVID-19-regulations – it is counterproductive and disproportionate.  
Use firearms to enforce COVID-19-related regulations.  
Use spit hoods as a means to protect themselves against COVID-19: it does not work and can cause serious harm  
Impose blanket bans on public assemblies.  
Forcefully disperse an assembly that is peaceful, including for the purpose of enforcing COVID-19 regulations  
Keep people in overcrowded detention facilities, or other circumstances likely to spread the virus.  
The most important thing to remember is this: it is the utmost obligation of state authorities, including police, to respect and protect the right to life. For more information, see Amnesty International’s detailed guidelines on use of force by law enforcement.

In a new briefing, COVID-19 Crackdowns: Police Abuse and the Global Pandemic, the organization documented cases in 60 countries where law enforcement agencies committed human rights abuses in the name of tackling the virus. This includes cases where people were killed or severely injured for allegedly breaching restrictions, or for protesting against detention conditions.  
In Iran for example, security forces reportedly used live ammunition and tear gas to suppress protests over COVID-19 safety fears in prisons, killing and injuring several people. In the first five days alone of a curfew in Kenya, at least seven people were killed and 16 hospitalized as a result of police operations.  
While some limitations on human rights can be justified during a pandemic to protect public health or other pressing social need, many governments have gone far beyond reasonable and justified restrictions.  
“Security forces all over the world are widely violating international law during the pandemic, using excessive and unnecessary force to implement lockdowns and curfews. The horrific abuses committed on the pretext of fighting COVID-19 include Angolan police shooting a teenage boy in the face for allegedly breaking curfew, and police in El Salvador shooting a man in the legs after he went out to buy food,” said Patrick Wilcken, Deputy Director of Amnesty International’s Global Issues Programme.  
“While the role of law enforcement at this moment is vital to protect people’s health and lives, the over reliance on coercive measures to enforce public health restrictions is making things worse. The profound impact of the pandemic on people’s lives compounds the need for policing to be carried out with full respect for human rights.”  
Far from containing the virus, decisions to arrest, detain, use force, and forcibly disperse assemblies have risked increasing contagion – both for the law enforcement officials involved as well as those who are affected by police actions.  
Beatings and killings  
Amnesty International’s wide-ranging briefing examines laws, policies and acts committed by police forces or other agencies carrying out law enforcement functions. It provides numerous examples of state overreach and abuse of power that have been falsely justified in the name of protecting public health.   
Pandemic-related police operations have led to deaths and injuries in many countries, including in the context of police enforcing curfews and lockdowns. Elsewhere there have been mass arrests, unlawful deportations, forced evictions, and aggressive crackdowns on peaceful protests, as governments use the pandemic as an excuse to attack human rights and crackdown on dissent.  
In South Africa, police fired rubber bullets at people ‘loitering’ on the streets on the first day of lockdown. In Chechnya, video footage showed police kicking and assaulting a man for not wearing a mask. Meanwhile, an investigation by Amnesty International and Angolan rights organization OMUNGA found that Angolan police tasked with enforcing COVID-19 restrictions killed at least seven young men between May and July.   
Arbitrary arrests and detentions  
The briefing also highlights mass and arbitrary arrests by law enforcement. Amnesty International has documented how police have arrested and detained people for violating quarantine measures; for violating restrictions on travel or holding meetings; for participating in peaceful protests; and for speaking out to criticize their government’s handling of the pandemic among other reasons that do not justify sending people to jail.  
In the Dominican Republic for example, police detained approximately 85,000 people between 20 March and 30 June, allegedly for non-compliance with the curfew.  
Between March and May, 510 people in Turkey were reported to have been detained for questioning on account of “sharing provocative coronavirus posts” on social media, in clear violation to their right to freedom of expression.  
Discrimination  
In several countries, police have demonstrated racial bias and discrimination in their enforcement of COVID-19 regulations. Refugees, asylum-seekers, migrant workers, LGBTI and gender non-conforming people, sex workers, homeless people and people at risk of homelessness are among the marginalized groups who have been particularly affected.  
For example, in Slovakia law enforcement and military personnel cordoned off Roma settlements under quarantine, adding to the stigma and prejudice these communities already faced. The aggressive application of COVID-19 restrictions has also led to people being forcibly evicted and left without a place where to protect themselves from COVID-19, often impacting groups who are already marginalized.   
In France, volunteers from Human Rights Observers documented 175 cases of forced evictions of migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees by law enforcement officials in Calais between March and May 2020.  
Restrictions on peaceful assembly  
Many states have also used the pandemic as a pretext to introduce laws and policies that violate international law and roll back human rights guarantees, including unduly restricting the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression.   
For example, at least 16 people were killed by security officers in Wolaita Zone in Ethiopia in August following protests against the arrests of local leaders and activists, allegedly for holding a meeting in contravention of COVID-19 restrictions.  
Under international human rights law, certain restrictions can be lawfully placed on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly in order to protect public health or other legitimate interests, but they must be provided by law and be necessary and proportionate to a specific aim. However, in many instances documented by Amnesty International, restrictions go much further – for example imposing blanket bans on protests, prohibiting or restricting protests where other public gatherings of similar sizes remained unaffected; or using force against peaceful protesters.  
Human rights should be at the centre of policing  
Authorities must treat the COVID-19 pandemic first and foremost as a public health crisis that needs to be addressed through appropriate public health measures.   
Where law enforcement fulfils a legitimate and necessary role, Amnesty International is calling for governments across the globe to ensure that law enforcement agencies respect their ultimate mission to serve and protect the population.   
The COVID-19 pandemic does not relieve law enforcement agencies of their obligation to carefully balance the interests at stake and to use their powers in a manner that complies with their human rights obligations.   
In cases where violations of human rights related to policing and the use of force have taken place, states must conduct prompt, thorough, effective and independent investigations, and ensure that all those responsible are held accountable in fair trials.  
“It is essential that authorities around the world prioritize public health best practices over coercive approaches that have been found to be counterproductive. Law enforcement agencies must give clear orders and instructions to their personnel to put human rights at the centre of all considerations,” said Anja Bienert, Head of Amnesty International Netherlands Police and Human Rights Programme.  
“Law enforcement officials must be held accountable for excessive or unlawful exercise of their powers. Without accountability, the door will be opened to further abuses of power.”

The bill will now pass to the Senate, which has an opportunity to make history by passing the law and bringing an end to clandestine abortions in the country. 
“This is an achievement of the women’s movement and a demand from different social groups who have never given up on the cause. The Senate cannot afford to turn its back on women once again and must press forward to pass the law, without further delay. Legal abortion is an imperative for social justice, for reproductive justice and for human rights,” said Mariela Belski, executive director of Amnesty International Argentina. 
“The debate of the past few years has been very positive and has succeeded in making visible the failure of the criminalization of women as a state policy. The Senate must now put an end to clandestine abortions. The legalization of abortion saves lives and addresses a key public health issue”. 
The bill, which received 131 votes in favour, 117 against and 6 abstentions, decriminalizes and legalizes abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. Once this period has passed, abortion would continue to be legal in cases of risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman or in cases of rape. The bill is in keeping with the fulfillment of the commitments that the Argentine state has undertaken with respect to public health and human rights. 
As the bill now passes to the Senate, Amnesty International reiterates the obligation of both Chambers of Congress to honor the international human rights commitments that the country has assumed. 
In the last 25 years, more than 50 countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, China, South Africa and Uruguay have amended their legislation on abortion, recognizing that access to safe abortion is fundamental for the protection of women and girls’ rights, life, health and autonomy.

Across the globe, people are organizing in extraordinary numbers, with a sense of common purpose that unites them across race, gender, age and social condition.  
By Ketty Nivyabandi & Alex Neve* 
2020 has been a tumultuous year for human rights.  
Like a mirror held to our faces, COVID-19 has unveiled our deepest inequities: Older people, women, Indigenous peoples, Black and racialized communities, refugees and migrants, low-income and homeless people, and those living with disabilities have borne the brunt of the pandemic.  
The failure to respect the land and resource rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada once again led to confrontation and violence, notably in Wet’suwet’en Territory at the beginning of the year and the Treaty-protected Mi’kmaq lobster fishery more recently.  
Demands for action to address systemic racism against Indigenous, Black and racialized peoples in Canada grew more urgent, particularly with respect to police violence.  
South of the border, the profound divisions and ascent of hate under the Donald Trump administration reached frightening levels in the lead-up to and following the presidential election.  
Around the world, leaders undermine human rights every day with alarming boldness. They repressed peaceful protest in Belarus, Nigeria, Thailand and Hong Kong. They waged wars that ravaged civilians in Yemen, Syria, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Ethiopia. They target and silence human rights defenders in Colombia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Burundi, Honduras, Turkey and India. They watch refugees drown in the Mediterranean and institutionalize cruelty at the U.S./Mexico border where more than 600 children have yet to be reunited with the parents from whom they were forcibly separated. And massive human rights violations persist in Venezuela, the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and against Uyghurs in China and the Rohingya in Myanmar.  
All the while, the global climate crisis – an overarching human rights crisis of unprecedented scale – begs for decisive political action.  
These are grave challenges, the solutions to which all lie in universal human rights.  
Yet we hear very little about human rights from our leaders. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s throne speech in September, offering a roadmap “to build a stronger and more resilient Canada for everyone” only referenced human rights once, in connection with Canadian citizens arbitrarily detained in China. The same could be said of most governments globally.  
Leaders ignore their human rights responsibilities at their peril. Across the globe, people are organizing in extraordinary numbers for their rights to be upheld, with a renewed sense of common purpose that unites them across race, gender, age and social condition. In Canada, Indigenous and Black communities are joining in solidarity and struggle, bonded by the understanding that their freedoms are intimately tied.  
Earlier this year, the killing of George Floyd hit a global nerve, an unbearable reminder that the knee of white supremacy remains firmly on the world’s neck. In return, people poured into the streets – with women and young people so often leading the way – demanding accountability for centuries of racial violence. Their courage is often met with brutal force. Yet it does not give way; and it propels us towards real change.  
Clearly, it is time for leaders to follow the people’s lead. Human rights will see us through these turbulent times, if leaders have the wisdom and foresight to uphold them.  
The just-tabled legislation to make the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples law in Canada is a good start, and must be followed by implementation in collaboration with all Indigenous Peoples.  
So much more remains. The rights of women and LGBTIQ2S people must be upheld. Front-line human rights defenders must be supported, not vilified, for the essential role they play. Systemic racism cannot just be decried, it must be concretely uprooted.  
Nations and industries that bear the greatest responsibility for the climate crisis must halt its devastating impact on communities already unjustly exposed to human rights violations.  
And the inequalities laid bare by COVID-19 call for long-overdue action to uphold economic, social and cultural rights.  
Until governments and corporations are held accountable for their human rights responsibilities, justice and equality will remain elusive, and our futures unsustainable.  
When they adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, governments agreed that, “recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.”  
While that affirmation remains an illusion, more than 70 years later it has never been more true, more urgent, and – we believe – more possible.   
This op-ed was originally published in the Ottawa Citizen on December 10, 2020 here. Ketty Nivyabandi is the Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, succeeding Alex Neve, who was Secretary General from 2000-2020.

In many cases these appeals decisions can take up to a year. The Büyükada first appeal decision took less than four months. This is unusually fast.  
The decision does not contain the detailed reasoning expected from appeals courts and reads as a rubber stamp of the trial verdict. With this appeal court ruling, a crucial first opportunity to correct the wrong done in the trial verdict was sadly lost.  
Now, all four will take their appeals to the Court of Cassation, the highest appeal court in Turkey. We will continue to urge for their convictions to be overturned.  
The ordeal that began in the summer of 2017 is continuing for Taner, İdil, Özlem and Günal. The news of their arrest in June and July 2017 sent shockwaves across the world. Taner was unjustly imprisoned for over 14 months, İdil, Özlem and Günal spent more than three months in Silivri High-Security prison. 
The repercussions of this case reach far beyond the four human rights defenders who have been convicted. Their conviction in this baseless trial represents a shocking example of the authorities’ attempt to criminalize the defence of human rights with implications for everyone in Turkey. This injustice has become a stark symbol of the massive crackdown on human rights and on those who defend them. 
The journey that our colleagues in Turkey have been on has been a long and arduous one. From day one, we have been inspired by the steadfastness and resilience that these human rights defenders have demonstrated. We will not give up now.   
We asked them for their initial thoughts about the appeals court ruling.  
 
“Since the beginning of this prosecution, we didn’t and couldn’t think we were subject to a fair trial, as there were many elements showing this was not the case. But this decision of the regional appeals court has added insult to injury. The unfair prosecution of human rights defenders has entered the final bend on the road at great speed.” 
  – Taner 
  
“The pathetic state of the Turkish judiciary is well reflected in all our court decisions. From the indictment to the appeal decision, we were handed the exact same text, even the typos! None of our statements, the witnesses nor the evidence were taken into account. From a right they have created a crime. During the 3.5 years of prosecution the only text that cared for the rule of law was the dissenting opinion of one of the three trial judges. This is not only true for Büyükada case, it is the current spirit of Turkish justice system. Trying to silence human rights defenders through judicial harassment never works anywhere in the world. Because we are right, not them! We have massive resilience that is powered by our struggle to defend justice and the rights of everyone and everything that we share this planet with.” 
  – Özlem 
  
“This decision is saddening but not surprising, given the fact that, for a long time, the regional appeals courts are operating as a rubberstamping authority on Heavy Penal Court rulings and leaving the examination of politically motivated prosecutions such as ours to the Court of Cassation. The decision was also very speedy, compared to other examples in Turkey. I want to believe that this speed is not aiming at a speedy decision of the Court of Cassation, while applications to the Constitutional Court and to the European Court of Human Rights are pending, motivated by the wish to imprison people and keep them there.” 
  – İdil  
 
“I want all human rights defenders around the world to know that I am not giving up. These convictions are meaningless to me. Because I have not committed a crime, I don’t have anything to pay for; I am not someone that can be tamed. I am a criminal law expert and a human rights defender. I will continue the work I have been doing for the last 23 years. I also know that one day, I will defend the rights of those who have convicted me today. Onwards for the struggle for human rights.”

The San Francisco-based online accommodation company has around 200 properties for rent in the illegal Israeli settlements that are at the heart of systematic human rights violations faced by Palestinians. 
Two years ago, Airbnb said it would remove accommodation in the settlements from its listings, before reversing its decision. 
Responding to reports that Airbnb is set to become a publicly-listed company after filing IPO documents in the US, Saleh Higazi, Deputy Regional Director for Middle East and North Africa, said: 
“These settlements are a war crime under international law. Airbnb needs to do right by future investors and stop benefiting from illegal settlements built on stolen Palestinian land in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  
Shamefully, Airbnb has been promoting and benefiting from a situation that is a root cause of the systematic human rights violations faced by millions of Palestinians on a daily basis.” 
Lack of transparency in IPO documents 
Earlier this year, Airbnb was one of more than 100 companies around the world listed in a UN database of firms whose business operations linked them to Israeli settlements in the OPT. These settlements are illegal under international law. 
However, Airbnb’s Registration Statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ahead of the IPO makes no mention of business operations in the Israeli settlements or the fact that the company appears on the UN database. This information is missing from the “Risk Factor” section of the documents, which informs shareholders of a company’s legal, reputational and other risks. 
Airbnb stock is expected to be purchased by investment and pension funds across the world, which could mean that a large number of people will indirectly hold investments in Airbnb without understanding the full ramifications.  
The major global banks that are underwriting Airbnb’s IPO, including Goldman Sachs, Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley, also have a responsibility to ensure that material disclosure to shareholders is accurate. 
Airbnb’s shameful change of heart 
Though Airbnb claims to donate the profit it generates through these listings, allowing them to remain in place means that a wider tourist industry is being supported and allowed to flourish at the expense of Palestinian rights and livelihoods. 
In January 2019, Amnesty published a major report called “Destination Occupation” showing how Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Expedia and Booking.com were fuelling systematic human rights violations against Palestinians by listing hundreds of rooms and activities in Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land, including East Jerusalem. 
The previous year, Airbnb had announced it would remove listings for 200 rental properties in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, excluding East Jerusalem, “at the core of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians”. The company said one of the principles it applied when making the decision had been to “evaluate whether the existence of listings is contributing to existing human suffering”. 
However, in April 2019, Airbnb shamefully reversed this decision following a number of lawsuits and said the company would allow the listings to remain but would “take no profits from this activity in this region”. 
Settlement expansions feared 
There is now concern that Israeli settlements on Palestinian land are expanding, with thousands of new housing units announced in 2020. The surge in settlement-building is widely believed to reflect the broad political support the Israeli authorities have received under the US presidency of Donald Trump. 
In November, Mike Pompeo visited a winery in the Israeli settlement of Psagot, the first time a serving US Secretary of State has ever visited an Israeli settlement. This follows his announcement in November 2019 that the US no longer considers Israeli settlements to be illegal under international law. 
The expansion proposals come after more than a half century of Israeli military occupation in the OPT, during which more than 50,000 Palestinian homes and structures have been demolished. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been forcibly removed. 
In their place, more than 600,000 Israelis have been allowed to move into around 250 mostly purpose-built settlements, many serviced by settler-only roads and guarded by military checkpoints. 
Approximately 1,000 square kilometres of Palestinian land has been expropriated by Israeli settlers in the past 50 years. 
This has had a devastating impact on Palestinians’ rights to an adequate standard of living, to work, to housing, to health, and to education and has progressively crippled the Palestinian economy. 
“No company should be party to human rights abuse and until Airbnb ends its business relationship with the Israeli settlements it will be deeply compromised,” said Saleh Higazi.

0,Campaigners warn that 9 out of 10 people in poor countries are set to miss out on COVID-19 vaccine,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/campaigners-warn-that-9-out-of-10-people-in-poor-countries-are-set-to-miss-out-on-covid-19-vaccine/,Rich countries have hoarded enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations nearly 3 times over Nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against COVID-19 next year unless urgent action is taken by governments and the pharmaceutical industry to make sure enough...,"Nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against COVID-19 next year unless urgent action is taken by governments and the pharmaceutical industry to make sure enough doses are produced, a group of campaigning organizations warned today. 
By contrast, wealthier nations have bought up enough doses to vaccinate their entire populations nearly three times over by the end of 2021 if those currently in clinical trials are all approved for use. Canada tops the chart with enough vaccines to vaccinate each Canadian five times. Updated data shows that rich nations representing just 14 per cent of the world’s population have bought up 53 per cent of all the most promising vaccines so far. 
The organizations, including Amnesty International, Frontline AIDS, Global Justice Now and Oxfam, who are part of an alliance calling for a People’s Vaccine, used data collected by science information and analytics company Airfinity to analyse the deals done between countries and the eight leading vaccine candidates. They found that 67 low and lower middle-income countries risk being left behind as rich countries move towards their escape route from this pandemic. Five of the 67 – Kenya, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ukraine – have reported nearly 1.5 million cases between them. 
Anna Marriott, Oxfam’s Health Policy Manager, said:  “No one should be blocked from getting a life-saving vaccine because of the country they live in or the amount of money in their pocket. But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19 for years to come.”  
Heidi Chow, from Global Justice Now, said: “All pharmaceutical corporations and research institutions working on a vaccine must share the science, technological know-how, and intellectual property behind their vaccine so enough safe and effective doses can be produced. Governments must also ensure the pharmaceutical industry puts people’s lives before profits.” 
The Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine has already received approval in the UK and vaccinations are beginning this week. It is likely to receive approval from other countries including the US within days. Two further potential vaccines, from Moderna and Oxford in partnership with AstraZeneca  are expected to submit or are awaiting regulatory approval. The Russian vaccine, Sputnik, has announced positive trial results and four other candidates are in phase 3 clinical trials. 
So far, all of Moderna’s doses and 96 percent of Pfizer/BioNTech’s have been acquired by rich countries. In welcome contrast Oxford/AstraZeneca has pledged to provide 64 percent of their doses to people in developing nations. Yet despite their actions to scale up supply they can still only reach 18 per cent of the world’s population next year at most. Oxford/AstraZeneca deals have also mostly been made with some of the big developing countries like China and India, while the majority of developing countries have not done deals and have to share the COVAX pool of vaccines between them. 
This demonstrates that one company alone cannot hope to supply the whole world, and that only open sharing of technology between vaccine producers can make this possible. 
The People’s Vaccine Alliance is calling on all pharmaceutical corporations working on COVID-19 vaccines to openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organization COVID-19 Technology Access Pool, so that billions more doses can be manufactured and safe and effective vaccines can be available to all who need them.  
The Alliance is also calling on governments to do everything in their power to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are made a global public good—free of charge to the public, fairly distributed and based on need. A first step would be to support South Africa and India’s proposal to the World Trade Organisation Council this week to waive intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments until everyone is protected. 
Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said: “The hoarding of vaccines actively undermines global efforts to ensure that everyone, everywhere can be protected from COVID-19. Rich countries have clear human rights obligations not only to refrain from actions that could harm access to vaccines elsewhere, but also to cooperate and provide assistance to countries that need it. 
“By buying up the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply, rich countries are in breach of their human rights obligations. Instead, by working with others to share knowledge and scale up supply, they could help bring an end to the global COVID-19 crisis.” 
The vaccines developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech have received more than $5 billion dollars of public funding, which the alliance said placed a responsibility on them to act in the global public interest. 
Dr Mohga Kamal Yanni, from The People’s Vaccine Alliance, said: “Rich countries have enough doses to vaccinate everyone nearly three times over, whilst poor countries don’t even have enough to even reach health workers and people at risk. 
“The current system, where pharmaceutical corporations use government funding for research, retain exclusive rights and keep their technology secret to boost profits, could cost many lives.” 
Lois Chingandu, Director of Frontline AIDS, said: “This pandemic is a global problem that requires a global solution. The global economy will continue to suffer so long as much of the world does not have access to a vaccine. 
“We need to put pharmaceutical industry profit aside during this unprecedented pandemic, both to save humanity and the economy.” 
Momentum is mounting for a people’s vaccine, which has already been backed by COVID survivors, health experts, activists, past and present world leaders, faith leaders and economists including: Cyril Ramaphosa, Imran Khan, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Gordon Brown, Helen Clark, Mary Robinson, Joseph Stiglitz, John Nkengasong and Thomas Piketty. 
Last month in the US, more than 100 high-level leaders from public health, faith-based, racial justice, and labor organizations, joined former members of Congress, economists and artists to sign a public letter calling on President-elect Biden seize on this extraordinary moment and power of the US President to support a People’s Vaccine.

“Khaled Drareni’s case is one that speaks to infamous silencing efforts that governments are undergoing in order to make the reality in their country seem more positive than it is. Khaled was not doing anything but telling the truth, the truth that the Algerian government decided for themselves. I think this case comes at an interesting time in history as we are battling with COVID-19 and its recovery as well as larger conversations around police brutality and their funding. Khaled needs to be released in order for us to stay informed, but also to ensure that truth before lies and fabrication come before all else. In a world riddled with fake news, it is time that activists join together to free Khaled for him to continue his important and vital work of telling the truth.” – Cass

In these 16 days, we reflect on how far we’ve come, but how far we still have to go to see the elimination of violence against women, part of which includes calling for fair and impartial investigations and a commitment to justice to counter deeply-embedded gender-based violence in societies around the world. This year I hope you join us in demanding justice for the deaths of Popi and Bongeka, and committing to standing up for the rights of women everywhere.” – Roshni

I’ve witnessed some of the most vibrant and powerful demonstrations of humanity at these celebrations, from proposals to families supporting their loved ones.

Every human deserves to be treated with dignity, free from abuse and exploitation. The El Hiblu 3 case is vital for two reasons; it touches upon the UN’s convention against torture and other cruel treatment, as well as the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which protects refugees and asylum seekers from being returned to countries where they risk persecution. The El Hiblu 3 are courageous youth who are being wrongly accused by the Maltese government with little evidence for a crime they did not commit. Instead, they should be honoured for de-escalating a conflict and advocating for other refugees’ rights not to be sent back to Libya. Please join me in demanding the dropping of all charges against these human rights defenders!” – Fatima

Jani Silva began courageously defending the environment — integral to her community — at the young age of 16 and has unfalteringly continued to do so in the face of great danger. To continually advocate for something, with consistent and imminent danger shows urgency of the issue and the dedication of those fighting for it. Fighting for the basic human right of clean water is an issue that is entirely alienated for most of us. But the Earth is dying, and not only in Columbia; I challenge you all to draw from the bravery of Jani Silva and her fellow ADISPA memories in trying to save their homes. If we want to continue to inhabit this planet, we must be able to freely fight for its protection, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of all. This year, I hope everyone will join me in demanding protection for all ADISPA members and their right to defend the land.  – Anjali

As a someone who empathises with Nassima, I have been following her story since the initial arrest and strongly believe that enough is enough.

Protests have long held the power to shape the way our governments work. To inspire positive social change and advance human rights in countless ways. They remind each individual and group that there is power in solidarity. It is this human right to share views, hold governments accountable, and dissent against injustice, that is taken away from millions around the world, like Gustavo. No person should have to endure physical harm, lose their eyesight, for simply demanding dignity and equality. I urge you all to be inspired by Gustavo’s words, to wake up and join me in defending him. To join me in reminding all those around the world to never be afraid to speak out and stand up for what they believe in. – Shriya

The race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is gathering pace, and it seems like there may finally be light at the end of the tunnel. But as wealthy countries continue to hoard doses, the lifesaving potential of vaccines risks being undermined by inequality and corporate interests.   
Now is the time to demand that COVID-19 vaccines are available to everyone – regardless of where they live, who they are, or what they can afford.  
COVID-19 is a truly global crisis, and we will only solve it through global cooperation and respect for human rights.  
If we get this right, we can end COVID-19 and build a more just and sustainable future. Here’s what needs to happen:  
Human rights must be considered when deciding who to prioritize  
The question of who should get vaccines first is complex – we all have the right to be protected against COVID-19. But initial supplies will be limited, and we need to prioritize those who are most at risk. Health workers, older people, and people with pre-existing health conditions are among the groups being considered for priority access.   
But governments need to consider human rights factors which put some individuals and communities in a more vulnerable situation. As well as exacerbating pre-existing inequalities, the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on people who have been historically marginalized and discriminated against.  
For example, Indigenous Amazonian communities in Ecuador often face a higher risk due to scarcity of drinking water, food sources, medical supplies, health services and COVID-19 tests. In April an oil spill polluted the food and water sources of many communities, increasing their risk of infection.  
People living in overcrowded refugee camps in unsanitary conditions are also likely to be at higher risk from infection. Furthermore, in many  
migrants and refugees without documents often do not have access to health care, including vaccines.    
There must be careful consideration of risk and exposure factors like working and living conditions, and access to sanitation, when making decisions about allocation. Narrow definitions of risk could leave the people most in need of the vaccine unable to access it.  
Similarly, early allocation to health workers must consider everybody working in the health sector – not just doctors and nurses but drivers, administrative staff, care home workers, and many more.  
Under international human rights law, countries have an obligation to work together to respond to the pandemic, and wealthier states have a special responsibility to assist states with fewer resources. But some governments have already adopted a “me first” approach that could undermine the efficacy of a future vaccine.  
Research by Oxfam found that wealthy nations, representing just 13 per cent of the global population, have already bought up more than half of future vaccines. This means more than half of the promised doses of the five leading vaccine candidates are already taken. As of November 2020, more than 80% of the planned 2021 supply of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines have already been sold to rich countries.   
As well as denying millions of people their human rights, “vaccine nationalism” is alarmingly short sighted. The World Health Organization estimates that for us to reach herd immunity, we need to vaccinate roughly 70% of the global population. Hoarding vaccines for a privileged few will not end this pandemic.   
States need to cooperate to make sure everyone has access to vaccines when they become available. This means wealthier states should refrain from making  large bilateral deals with pharmaceutical companies. They should also join and support global initiatives which aim to ensure fair vaccine access for all countries, such as the WHO’s COVAX scheme.   
The COVAX Facility is a way for countries to pool their resources, to invest in and buy as many vaccines as possible, and then distribute them fairly and equitably. So far, 178 countries are engaging with COVAX – notable exceptions include the USA and Russia.   
Questions remain about how COVAX will achieve its goal of fair and equitable distribution. The scheme has faced criticism for allowing wealthier countries to request doses equivalent to 50% of their population, while lower-income countries so far can only request 20%. Wealthier countries can also pay a higher price up front to select which vaccines they prefer.   
This has created a two-tier system which could compromise COVID’s aim of  making vaccines accessible to everyone.   
States who join COVAX must push for meaningful participation from civil society and developing countries in decision-making, and follow the principles of transparency and accountability.   
When new medicines are developed, the company that makes them is usually given intellectual property rights. That means they are the only company allowed to produce the drug for a period of time, and they can decide how much it should cost.  Intellectual property laws can also restrict the sharing of data related to research and development – so if one pharmaceutical company found a successful COVID-19 vaccine, they would have the right to keep that information to themselves.  
We already know how harmful it can be when companies put patents before people. For years, people living with HIV were priced out of treatments by pharmaceutical companies keeping their products scarce and charging unreasonably high prices. While these companies profited from selling their medicines in several rich countries, millions of people also were unable to access lifesaving treatment.   
International human rights standards are clear – public health takes precedence over the right of companies to protect their intellectual property.   
To encourage companies to share their know-how, WHO has set up the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), where companies can share data and patents on their innovations. If companies join C-TAP, it will vastly increase the amount of publicly available research on COVID-19 vaccines, scale up production, and reduce the cost of vaccines.  
Unfortunately, to date, not one company has joined C-TAP. Oxford/AstraZeneca is the only company that has committed to selling the vaccine for no profit for the duration of the pandemic. Other companies need to follow suit, by issuing open and non-exclusive licenses, to ensure that the COVID-19 vaccines reach as many people as possible.   
As part of their human rights obligations, governments must take measures to eliminate any cost barrier that people may face in accessing the right to health.   
Like all businesses, pharmaceutical companies also have human rights responsibilities. In 2008 the UN expert on the right to health published guidelines for how pharmaceutical companies should fulfil these responsibilities, including by considering ways to make their products affordable to as many people as possible.  
Cost can prevent access to health care, especially for marginalized people and at least half the world’s population today cannot afford essential healthcare. This means vaccines are likely to not be accessible to half the world unless they are free at the point of care.   
Governments must make every effort to provide these vaccines and the investment is well worth it. Vaccines are one of the most cost-effective public health interventions and COVID-19 vaccines may break the chain of transmission between people early in the cycle, avoiding further health and socio-economic impacts.   
In fact, the WHO recently estimated that an investment of $38 billion to fully fund one of these collective initiatives to support global access to COVID-19 health products would be regained through economic activity “in less than 36 hours once global mobility and trade alone are restored.”  
Vaccines must comply with the scientific community’s most recent standards concerning safety and effectiveness – safety is more important than speed. Just as importantly, immunization plans must be carried out in a way that is consistent with the protection of human rights, paying special attention to informed consent.   
This means that governments should communicate clearly about the benefits of vaccination, counter misinformation, and be transparent about all stages of vaccine development.  Scientific benefits of vaccines must be explained and disseminated in a way that is understandable to everybody – in languages they understand and formats they can access.   
This is an essential component of the right to health and key to ensure maximum vaccine uptake, as people can only make informed decisions about their health when they are given accurate information and timely information.

The 18 students and an academic at the Middle East Technical University (METU) are facing prison sentences of up to three years simply for organizing and participating in a Pride march on campus that the University management had unlawfully banned. 
“In the summer of 2019, students and others peacefully participating in a celebration of love and solidarity were met with police pepper spray, plastic bullets and tear gas. Nineteen of them have also been dragged through the courts on baseless criminal charges and face absurd jail sentences,” said Nils Muižnieks, Amnesty International’s Europe Director. 
“The ban of the Pride march lacked legal grounds and these brave students who defied it had their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly violated. They must be acquitted.” 
The 19 individuals are charged with “participating in an unlawful assembly” and “failing to disperse despite being warned”. This is despite the fact that in February 2019, the Ankara Administrative Appeals Court had lifted the blanket ban prohibiting all LGBTI+ activities in Ankara introduced under the state of emergency, which University management relied on as the legal basis to stop the annual campus based Pride March from going ahead. 
Despite appeals on them to ensure the March went ahead, the university authorities called the police to disperse the students on the day. As they peacefully sat on the lawn, students were met with pepper spray, plastic bullets and tear gas. Several were injured, many arbitrarily detained.   
A year later in June 2020, another administrative court in Ankara overturned the university’s unlawful ban, confirming that it had no legal basis. 
“Against the backdrop of increasing homophobia in Turkey, METU students and staff have marched through their campus each year to celebrate Pride and demand equality and dignity for LGBTI+ people as they have a right to do so,” said Nils Muižnieks. 
“The only just outcome in the unfair prosecution of 19 human rights defenders for their participation in a peaceful Pride march is their wholesale acquittal.”

0,Egypt: Historic opportunity for international community to halt crackdown on human rights movement,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/egypt-historic-opportunity-for-international-community-to-halt-crackdown-on-human-rights-movement/,"Today’s court decision to freeze the assets of three senior directors from the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) demonstrates the urgent need for the international community to sustain pressure to halt the existential threat to the Egyptian human rights movement, said Amnesty...","Today’s court decision to freeze the assets of three senior directors from the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) demonstrates the urgent need for the international community to sustain pressure to halt the existential threat to the Egyptian human rights movement, said Amnesty International today. The development comes ahead of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s visit to Paris tomorrow to meet French President Emmanuel Macron.  
Today, an Egyptian court ruled to uphold the Public Prosecutor’s order to freeze the assets of the three EIPR directors Mohamed Basheer, Karim Ennarah and Gasser Abdel Razek – who were released from detention on 3 December in the wake of significant national and international pressure – pending investigations. This latest blow to EIPR leaves no doubt that the human rights movement in Egypt remains at critical risk amid ongoing arbitrary arrests, criminal investigations, asset freezes and travel bans against staff at civil society organizations. 
“Though they are now free, these human rights workers should not have spent a single day behind bars, and their release will bring great relief to their families and to Egypt’s embattled human rights community. However, this is a bittersweet victory which highlights the ongoing unjust detention of many other human rights defenders in Egypt,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. 
“Freezing the personal assets of three EIPR directors on the heels of the unprecedented assault on the organization demonstrates the authorities’ intent to eradicate the Egyptian human rights movement. Amid ongoing arbitrary arrests, criminal investigations, asset freezes and travel bans against tens of human rights defenders, members of the international community must ensure sustained coordinated and public pressure on the Egyptian authorities to show their genuine commitment to the survival of the human rights movement in Egypt.” 
Amidst the detention of other human rights defenders including EIPR’s gender researcher Patrick George Zaki, the Egyptian authorities continue to arbitrarily detain thousands, including prisoners of conscience, execute dozens after unfair trials, and commit widespread torture and enforced disappearances with absolute impunity. 
During the sole substantive hearing into the EIPR directors’ asset freeze case held on 1 December, the judge in a terrorism circuit of a criminal court in Cairo did not allow lawyers to present their defence, examine case files including the basis of the Public Prosecutor’s decision to order the asset freeze, or speak to their clients in private, in serious violation to their right to a fair trial.  
Egypt’s President to visit France as human rights movement in crisis 
Amnesty International is calling on President Macron to act on his declared commitment to promote human rights in Egypt, and press President al-Sisi for the release of arbitrarily detained human rights defenders and the protection of the human rights movement. 
In Egypt, at least 31 leaders of civil society organizations are subject to travel bans, while 10, in addition to the three recently released senior EIPR directors, are subject to asset freezes, including EIPR’s founder Hossam Bahgat; Mozn Hassan from Nazra for Feminist Studies; Mohamed Zaree from the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies; Azza Soliman, director of the Center for Egyptian Women’s Legal Assistance; Gamal Eid, director of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information; and Aida Seif el-Dawla from Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture. All these human rights defenders are facing a criminal investigation known as “Case 173” or the “foreign funding case” into their legitimate work and could be sentenced to long prison terms. 
In 2020, judges in terrorism circuits of criminal courts have added human rights lawyers Mohamed el-Baqer and Zyad el-Eleimy; the Egypt coordinator of the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions (BDS) movement Ramy Shaath; and human rights activist Alaa Abdelfattah to “terrorists lists”, banning them from travel and freezing their assets for five years. All four remain arbitrarily detained over unfounded terrorism charges. 
“As part of a broader response to pressure the Egyptian authorities to halt their assault of the human rights movement, the international community must, through the Human Rights Council, establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism on the situation of human rights in Egypt,” said Philip Luther. 
Background 
Between 15 and 19 November, the Egyptian authorities arrested EIPR staff members following a meeting with western diplomats. For years the international community has largely been looking the other way as the Egyptian authorities abused counter-terrorism measures to justify their arrest of tens of human rights defenders over unfounded terrorism related charges. Among the human rights defenders arrested on spurious terrorism-related charges are the director of Adalah Center for Rights and Freedoms Mohamed al-Baqer; journalist and human rights defender Esraa Abdelfatah; human rights lawyer Mahienour el-Masry; researcher Ibrahim Ezz el-Din and lawyer Haytham Mohamdeen from the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms; lawyer and founder of the families of the disappeared coalition, Ibrahim Metawly; and lawyer Hoda Abdelmoniem. 
Earlier this year, a judge in a terrorism circuit sentenced veteran human rights defender Bahey el-Din Hassan to 15 years in prison in his absence for fabricated charges related to “insulting the judiciary” and “disseminating false news” over his tweets about human rights. 
Today, EIPR researcher Patrick George Zaki and his lawyer appeared in front of a court reviewing his pre-trial detention pending investigations into unfounded terrorism-related charges since February 2020. The court’s decision has yet to be communicated.

Last year, we took 6.6 million actions together.  
Why do we do it? To ensure that those in power keep their promises and are held to account for human rights violations. Secondly, acts of solidarity and compassion from all over the world can change lives. Here’s what Magai Matiop Ngong, a teenager who was freed from death row in South Sudan this past summer, had to say about the support he received last year: “To Amnesty activists, tell them that I am so happy and grateful for what they have done to me and my family… I’m so blissful and blessed to have them as a support for my life and freedom.”  
Our words have power. Let’s do it again! Sign up to Write for Rights. 
Here are the ten incredible cases we’re supporting this year—human rights defenders and individuals in Algeria, Burundi, Chile, Colombia, Malta, Myanmar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey.   
Khaled Drareni, Algeria 
 
Journalist Khaled Drareni acted on his dream of freedom and equality in Algeria when he started covering street protests in February 2019. “Why should anyone refrain from telling the truth?” Khaled often declared. In the subsequent 12 months, authorities detained and released him many times. 
After his arrest in March 2020, no cell door opened for him. In August, Khaled began a two-year prison sentence, simply for doing his job.   
Germain Rukuki, Burundi 
 
In July 2017, music lover and devoted father Germain Rukuki, his wife, Emelyne Mupfasoni, and their two young sons woke to banging on his door. Security forces whisked Germain away to Ngozi prison in northern Burundi. There ended his work with ACAT-Burundi (Action by Christians for Abolition of Torture). Fake charges that include “rebellion” and “threatening state security” ensued, and Germain was sentenced to 32 years in prison for his peaceful work. 
Germain must be released immediately and reunited with his family, including his 3-year-old son whom he has never met.  
Gustavo Gatica, Chile 
 
In November 2019, amid widespread concern over rising costs of living and inequality, millions of people across Chile protested in the streets. They were met with excessive force by the authorities, and police officers loaded their guns with metal and rubber ammunition, injuring hundreds. At one protest, Gustavo Gatica, a 21-year-old psychology student and an avid fan of music and photography, was shot in both eyes. He was blinded permanently. 
“I gave my eyes so people would wake up,” he says. We must demand justice for Gustavo. 
Jani Silva, Colombia 
 
Despite repeated threats to her life, Jani Silva wakes every day to continue protecting the environment and the rights of the people living in the Amazonian Pearl, a campesino reserve in Colombia. That drive has placed her in conflict with an oil company in the territory. The company is already responsible for two oil spills that have poisoned the water sources. 
Being an earth defender is dangerous work in Colombia, and increasingly so for women and their communities in isolated areas. “Because I defend my territory, people have put a gun to my head to kill me,” she says. “But we cannot let ourselves be won over by fear.”  
El Hiblu 3, Malta 
 
Three teens fleeing violence in their home countries in Africa met each other in Libya en route to safety in Europe. When their rubber dinghy ran into trouble during the Mediterranean crossing, the crew of the El Hiblu oil tanker rescued them and 111 other passengers. Faced with return to Libya, a protest broke out in Maltese waters. The teens used their language skills to help calm the situation but now face trial on ludicrous charges of taking the tanker by force. 
Charges against the “El Hiblu 3” must be dropped.  
Paing Phyo Min, Myanmar 
 
Members of Myanmar’s Peacock Generation fuse verse with comedy and music in a traditional version of slam poetry. In April and May 2019, their satirical sketches became too much for the military. Six members were arrested and sentenced. Paing Phyo Min received the longest term – six years. 
He declared, “We have been directly communicating with the public, expressing what is wrong in our society… We may be imprisoned, but we will not be deterred from speaking our minds.”   
Idris Khattak, Pakistan 
 
Talia Khattak describes her father, Idris Khattak, as selfless, loving and generous. The 55-year-old was often found in his backyard, tending to his garden and talking to his chickens. But he is also a dedicated human rights researcher, investigating enforced disappearances in Pakistan for organizations like Amnesty International. In a cruel twist of fate, he too was disappeared in November 2019. 
Where is he? How is he? Talia says, “We deserve answers and he deserves the protection of the law.”  
Nassima al-Sada, Saudi Arabia 
 
Nassima al-Sada bravely campaigned for women to have the right to drive in Saudi Arabia and to carry out their daily lives without the permission of a male “guardian.” “Why isn’t there an age at which a woman becomes an adult, responsible for her decisions?” she asks. In 2018, the Saudi authorities arrested Nassima for her peaceful human rights work. She was held in solitary confinement for a year and was often not allowed to see her children or her lawyer for months at a time. 
Nassima has given her freedom so that others can enjoy theirs. Now she needs our help.   
Popi Qwabe and Bongeka Phungula, South Africa 
 
24-year-old Popi Qwabe and 28-year-old Bongeka Phungula met as talented drama students and dreamt of making it big as actors. On May 12, 2017, the young women hailed a minibus taxi, heading for a night out in Soweto, South Africa. They were not heard from again. Following a frantic search, the terrible truth was discovered. Popi and Bongeka had been shot dead and dumped by the side of a road. They may also have been raped. 
It has been three years since Popi and Bongeka’s deaths, and despite national outcry, nobody has been brought to justice. With enough support, we can get justice – for Popi, for Bongeka, and for their families.  
Melike Balkan and Özgür Gür, Turkey 
 
Biology students Melike Balkan and Özgür Gür are prominent members of the LGBTI+ Solidarity Group at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara. Against the backdrop of increasing homophobia in Turkey, the group has marched through their campus each year to celebrate Pride and demand equality and dignity for LGBTI+ people. When the university administration said the May 2019 Pride march could not proceed, they staged a sit-in. The university called the police, who used excessive force, including tear gas, against the peaceful protestors. 
Melike, Özgür and 21 others were detained and are now on trial. If found guilty, they face up to three years in prison. We must demand their acquittal.

0,Climate accountability bill must be revised to protect human rights: Amnesty’s reaction to Bill C-12,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/climate-justice/climate-accountability-bill-must-be-revised-to-protect-human-rights-amnestys-reaction-to-bill-c-12/,"Canada’s announcement of a climate accountability bill (Bill C-12: Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act) is a step in the right direction but is insufficient to ensure human rights protection in the face of climate change. To meet its international human rights obligations, Canada must...","Canada’s announcement of a climate accountability bill (Bill C-12: Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act) is a step in the right direction but is insufficient to ensure human rights protection in the face of climate change. 
To meet its international human rights obligations, Canada must ensure that the shift towards a zero-carbon economy and a more resilient society: addresses systemic inequalities, combats discrimination, and promotes gender, class, racial, disability and intergenerational justice; ensures a just transition for workers and communities impacted by the shift from a fossil fuel economy; and respects, protects and fulfils human rights. These principles should be clearly set out in the bill’s preamble. 
The bill’s target of net-zero emissions by 2050 is inadequate to meet Canada’s human rights commitments. Under international human rights law, all states must take all feasible steps to the full extent of their abilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the shortest possible time-frame both nationally and through international cooperation, in order to keep the average global temperature rise as low as possible and no higher than 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. A failure to take such action will make states legally responsible for serious harm to human rights. 
It is true that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommends reducing global greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 to limit the average global temperature rise to no higher than 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels; however, not all countries can be expected to reduce emissions at the same rate. It would be unreasonable for example to demand that developing countries make this transition at the same pace as wealthier countries. Based on obligations under international environmental and human rights law, wealthy, industrialized countries like Canada, that have a greater responsibility for causing the climate crisis as well as greater resources and technological capacity, should move to zero carbon emissions by 2030 or as soon as possible thereafter. It is also crucial that the targets be achieved by reducing emissions, while avoiding carbon removal mechanisms and other offsetting measures that may violate people’s human rights. 
According to the new bill, the Government of Canada is committed to achieving and exceeding its 2030 target. That’s good to hear as Canada is one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters and its current 2030 target falls far short of what is needed. Amnesty International urges the Canadian government to demonstrate higher ambition, not just in the long, but also the short and medium term, as the country’s current targets are highly incompatible with the imperative of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Amnesty also recommends that Canada adopt a 2025 target to ensure that sufficient progress is being made before it’s too late to adjust course. 
Under the Paris Agreement, states are obliged to submit their updated 2030 targets by December 31, 2020, which Canada has not yet done, although the end of the year is quickly approaching. Amnesty urges the Government of Canada to announce an ambitious new Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) before the end of this year in line with its international commitments. The enhanced NDC must be consistent with human rights obligations and set a target compatible with the 1.5°C imperative. 
Amnesty was encouraged to see that Bill C-12 acknowledges the need for a rights-based approach in relation to the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The bill should ensure that climate measures fully respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and all communities and groups impacted by such measures. In particular, just transition plans should be led by Indigenous Peoples who have an obligation to care for their territories. Just transition plans must also contribute to respecting, protecting and fulfilling Indigenous Peoples’ inherent, treaty, constitutional and international rights to land, territory and resources and include the obligation to seek the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of Indigenous Peoples before moving forward with any transition project that may impact their rights. 
In terms of public participation, when following a rights-based approach it is essential that people are given the opportunity to meaningfully participate in decisions that affect them. Bill C-12 stipulates that the Minister will provide provincial governments, Indigenous Peoples, the advisory body, and interested persons, including any expert the Minister considers appropriate to consult, with the opportunity to make submissions. It isn’t clear who is meant by interested persons, but this should include civil society organizations and the general public, and most importantly, the people and communities most affected by climate change and by measures to address climate change. Moreover, the opportunity to make submissions does not in itself ensure meaningful participation. People and communities most impacted by climate change and measures to address climate change must have the opportunity to participate in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of climate plans. Furthermore, meaningful participation needs to be underpinned by adequate information and education. And any barriers to participation must be identified and effectively addressed, including for members of equity-seeking groups, and especially considering Canada’s obligations to consult and meaningfully engage with Indigenous Peoples, women, racialized communities, and people with disabilities. 
Bill C-12 also mentions the establishment of an advisory body, whose mandate is to provide the Minister with advice with respect to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. It will be important to appoint someone to the panel with human rights expertise to ensure that a rights-based approach is adhered to. 
Bill C-12 would benefit from a robust enforcement mechanism to ensure that the bill’s objectives and targets are met. To date Canada has not met any of the emissions targets that it has set for itself during the past thirty years. The world is running out of time to combat the climate crisis and we cannot afford to miss any more targets. It is imperative that Canada takes extremely seriously its responsibility to climate-vulnerable communities in Canada and around the world and future generations, to decarbonize swiftly, and in a manner consistent with human rights. 
Lastly, Bill C-12 needs to be complemented by further actions to tackle the human rights implications of the climate crisis domestically and abroad. This requires the Government of Canada to put in place: 
In addition, Amnesty International urges the Canadian government to substantially increase funding and support for developing countries to be able to reduce emissions and protect people facing the impacts of the climate crisis, including through stronger adaptation measures. In climate negotiations, Canada should support the establishment of adequate mechanisms to mobilize new and additional finances to provide means, support and remedy, including compensation, to people and communities, including Indigenous peoples, whose rights have been negatively affected as the result of loss and damage caused by the climate crisis in climate-vulnerable developing countries.

We are awaiting further details and will update this page and actions on December 7. 
On November 3, 2020, members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR)—one of a handful of independent human rights organizations continuing to operate in Egypt—hosted a meeting at their office with 13 Western diplomats, including representatives from Canada. Such meetings aren’t uncommon as human rights defenders around the world seek support and protection for their vital work.   
One month later, however, the EIPR is struggling to continue operations in the face of arrests, office eviction, and an asset freeze.   
Between November 15 and 19, Egyptian security forces arrested three senior staff of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR): Mohamed Basheer, Karim Ennarah and Gasser Abdel-Razek. The arrests were apparently in direct retaliation for the EIPR meeting with foreign diplomats. Amnesty International considers them to be prisoners of conscience, detained solely in relation to their organization’s peaceful human rights work.   
All three have been added to Case No. 855/2020 which includes several other human rights defenders, many of whom have been detained without trial for over a year.  Prosecutors detained both Gasser Abdelrazek and Karim Ennarah pending investigation on charges of and “joining a terrorist group”, in addition to “spreading false news” and “misusing social media.” Mohamed Basheer was questioned about “committing a crime of funding terrorism” in addition to all other three charges.  
Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos. 
Gasser Abdelrazek is being held in solitary confinement, denied any time outside his cell, and does not have a mattress to sleep on. His family has only briefly been able to visit him. The families of Karim Ennarah and Mohamed Bashir have not yet been granted permission to visit. 
These latest detentions mark another escalation in the Egyptian authorities’ campaign to eradicate the human rights movement in Egypt, ranging from asset freezes and travel bans to enforced disappearances and torture, and prolonged arbitrary detention in abysmal conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Egyptian authorities regularly use unfounded “terrorism” related charges to imprison human rights defenders and to subject them to punitive measures without trial.  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights says these latest arrests are part of  “a broader pattern of intimidating organizations defending human rights and of the use of counter-terrorism and national security legislation to silence dissent,” leading to “a profound chilling effect on an already weakened Egyptian civil society.”  
Canada sought the expertise of EIPR staff. Three EIPR staff have now been jailed as a direct result of meeting with diplomats from Canada and other countries. Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne has said that “promoting and protecting these essential liberties and rights is, and will remain, a priority for the Government of Canada.” Canada must implement its Voices at Risk guidelines on supporting human rights defenders and take urgent action to free the EIPR staff. 
The international community must show to Egypt that they utterly reject the equation of defending human rights with terrorism and continue to demand the immediate and unconditional release of all detained human rights defenders in Egypt.  
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) was founded in 2002.  The organization uses research, documentation, legal aid, strategic litigation and advocacy in its work on civil liberties, economic and social rights and criminal justice. Its work includes reporting on the rights of religious minorities in Egypt, documenting sectarian violence, representing members of the LGBT+ community facing prosecution and advocating on mental health law. EIPR is one of the few human rights organizations working on environmental justice in Egypt.

“The authorities should immediately halt relocation of more refugees to Bhashan Char, return those on the island to their families and community in mainland Bangladesh, and follow due process including the full and meaningful participation of refugees in any plan for their relocation. 
“The relocation of so many Rohingya refugees to a remote island, which is still off limits to everyone including rights groups and journalists without prior permission, poses grave concerns about independent human rights monitoring. 
“It is crucial that the Bangladeshi authorities must let the UN, rights groups and humanitarian agencies carry out independent assessments of Bhashan Char’s habitability first before taking any steps to relocate people there. No relocation plan, either to Bhashan Char or to another location, can be undertaken without the full and informed consent of the individuals involved. 
“Some refugees already on the island have shared their anxiety with Amnesty International at being cut off from their families and community. 
“Bangladesh and other members of the international community have a critical role not only in protecting the rights of the Rohingya people but also in ensuring their full and meaningful participation in decisions that affect them.” 
Background: 
The Bhashan Char – which in English translates to “floating island” – is a silt island developed by the Bangladesh Navy, where the Bangladeshi authorities plan to relocate 100,000 Rohingya refugees. 
Amnesty International obtained a partial list of the Rohingya families that the government of Bangladesh identified for relocation to Bhashan Char. In interviews with Amnesty International five family members, who represent 23 refugees on the list for relocation, said that they signed up to relocate to Bhashan Char out of compulsion rather than choice. 
In September 2020, Amnesty International released the briefing “Let Us Speak for our Rights”, which outlines how exclusion from decision-making is impacting the human rights of Rohingya refugees. The briefing includes a section on the conditions for Rohingya in Bhashan Char.

“Amnesty International welcomes the tabling of Bill C-15, federal legislation to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into Canadian law and policy. Bill C-15 will provide a much-needed and long-overdue framework for the federal government to work cooperatively with Indigenous peoples to implement the standards of the UN Declaration in Canada. Implementation will guide the settler-state of Canada towards respect for the values and legal understandings that Indigenous Elders and knowledge keepers first sought to have articulated by a United Nations working group nearly 40 years ago. Because the core purpose of the new Bill provides a framework for implementation, Amnesty International strongly urges the Canadian government to pass this legislation quickly. Moving towards the crucial work of setting priorities and reforming laws and policies in collaboration with Indigenous Peoples will ensure substantial political and social change that respects Indigenous rights. 
“Further, we are disappointed to hear yesterday’s statement by Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller that the federal government will not live up to its promise to lift all long-term drinking water advisories in First Nation communities by March. While the Liberal government has made a lot of headway in lifting these long-term advisories, it will not be enough until every First Nation has access to clean drinking water, which is a basic human right. The federal government has known since 2006 that the problem is primarily due to a lack of federal funding. Now, 14 years later, many First Nation communities are learning that they must continue living without clean drinking water. This is unacceptable.”

President al-Sisi is scheduled to arrive in Paris on 7 December 2020, for a two-day visit, just three weeks after his government’s security agencies cracked down on the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), one of the last remaining independent human rights organizations in the country, arresting three of its directors. The arrests were apparently in direct retaliation for the EIPR meeting with foreign diplomats, including the French mission in Cairo, in early November. Egypt has also arbitrarily detained Ramy Shaath, a prominent Egyptian-Palestinian human rights defender married to a French national, for over a year without trial. 
French diplomacy has, at the highest levels, long indulged President al-Sisi’s brutal repression of any form of dissent. It is now or never for President Macron to stand up for his self-declared commitment to promote human rights in Egypt. 
If Egypt does not release arbitrarily detained activists and defenders ahead of the visit, and those who unjustly imprison them are rewarded with arms deals and praise, the implication for what is left of Egypt’s human rights community would be devastating and President Macron’s commitment to human rights in Egypt would be undermined, the groups said. 
Between 15 and 19 November, Egyptian security forces arrested the EIPR executive director Gasser Abdel-Razek, and Karim Ennarah and Mohamed Basheer, the group’s criminal justice and administrative directors respectively. Prosecutors have ordered their pretrial detention pending investigations on abusive terrorism-related charges stemming only from their human rights work. 
These latest detentions mark another escalation in the Egyptian authorities’ campaign to eradicate the human rights movement in Egypt, ranging from asset freezes and travel bans to enforced disappearances and torture, and prolonged arbitrary detention in abysmal conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has sounded the alarm, situating the newest arrests within “a broader pattern of intimidating organizations defending human rights and of the use of counter-terrorism and national security legislation to silence dissent,” leading to “a profound chilling effect on an already weakened Egyptian civil society.”[1]  The retaliatory nature of these arrests has been publicly recognized and denounced across Europe and the United States of America.[2] 
Receiving President al-Sisi on an official visit while not adequately raising concerns as so many activists and human rights defenders are detained over their human rights work, many on abusive “terrorism” charges and  some even added to “terrorist lists”,  would sabotage France’s own efforts to promote human rights within its partnership with Egypt and undermine France’s credibility in many countries in the region, the groups said. 
France’s Foreign Ministry condemned the EIPR arrests in a 17 November statement, saying it maintained “a frank, exacting dialogue with Egypt on human rights issues.” But if France’s responses stop at verbal condemnation and do not rise to the seriousness of the situation in Egypt, such condemnations are meaningless. Human rights organizations have documented years of the consequences of the lack of concrete action on the increased scale and grave nature of human rights violations in Egypt and the authorities’ boldness in shredding the rule of law. 
Moreover, for President Macron to receive President al-Sisi in France repeatedly without Egypt releasing activists and human rights defenders, and in fact arresting more of them, would contradict significant voices within Macron’s own political movement. Of the 66 French parliament members from across the political spectrum who signed a recent cross-European public letter calling on President al-Sisi to release prisoners of conscience, the majority were from President Macron’s party, La République en Marche; a noteworthy number sit on Defense and Foreign Affairs Committees.[3] 
A recent French parliamentary report on French arms sales[4]  also stresses the reputational damage and increasing political cost that France will most likely incur for continued arms and surveillance technology sales to Egypt, recognizing the country’s dismal rights record and credible reports of its use of French arms for violent repression of protests and in crimes committed in the context of counter-terrorism operations in Sinai including extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests. 
France has sold many weapons to Egypt, overtaking the US to become Egypt’s main arms supplier between 2013 and 2017. In 2017 alone, it delivered more than EUR 1.4 billion worth of military and security equipment. France has provided warships, fighter jets, and armored vehicles, while French companies – with the government’s approval – have provided surveillance and crowd control tools, with little transparency and without adequate monitoring of the end use of these weapons supplied to the military and police involved in serious violations. 
With this visit, France has an opportunity and duty  to take a strong public position in line with the values President Macron asserted during his January 2019 visit to Cairo, and to signal  to his Egyptian counterpart that the same level of international cooperation cannot be maintained against the backdrop of the Egyptian authorities’ flouting of international law, including the unprecedented assault on one of the most prominent human rights organizations in Egypt and the values it represents. 
President Macron has long justified his support to President al-Sisi’s government by saying it is a partner in the regional fight against terrorism. But Egypt has made it crystal clear that it misuses counter-terrorism legislations to stamp out legitimate human rights work and uproot any peaceful opposition.

The statistics, published by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), showed that 11,088 km² of rainforest was lost between August 2019 and July 2020, an increase of 9.5 per cent when compared to the same period the previous year.  
The statistics show Brazil’s Amazon has suffered its worst destruction in 12 years, since 12,911 km² was deforested in 2008. 
“By declaring the Amazon region open for business, Jair Bolsonaro has prioritised profits of large companies over the wellbeing of vulnerable people. Protected areas continue to burn so that commercial cattle ranching can expand,” said Richard Pearshouse, Head of Crisis and Environment at Amnesty International.   
“Behind these statistics is a very real crisis for some of the most vulnerable people in Brazil’s Amazon. Traditional residents and Indigenous people who live sustainably in protected areas are losing the precious forests that provide them with food, sources of livelihood and medicines – as well as their very identities.”  
The statistics reveal that 381 km² of rainforest in Indigenous territories was lost. It is the third largest forest loss in Indigenous territories since 2008. 
Environmentally protected areas lost 1,096 km² of forest (similar to the previous period, which registered the largest forest loss in environmentally protected areas since 2008, with 1,110 km² lost). 
“The Amazon rainforest is made of rich biodiversity, and is also home to many Indigenous and traditional peoples. The Brazilian authorities have the constitutional obligation to take care of this biome, and the communities who live there. Protecting the Amazon rainforest is paramount to protecting these people. These deforestation statistics reflect not only a huge setback on environmental policies, but also on human rights policies in Brazil’s North region,” said Jurema Werneck, Executive Director from Amnesty International Brazil. 
Illegal cattle farms fuelling Amazon destruction  
Amnesty International research has previously shown that cattle farming is the main driver of illegal land seizures on Reserves and Indigenous territories in Brazil’s Amazon, fuelling deforestation and trampling on the rights of Indigenous people and traditional residents. 
The Amazon region has seen the largest growth in Brazil’s lucrative cattle industry. Since 1988, the number of cattle there has almost quadrupled to 86 million in 2018, accounting for 40% of the national total. Some of this expansion is destroying large swathes of protected rainforest in Indigenous territories and Reserves. 
In total, 63% of the area deforested from 1988 to 2014 has become pasture for cattle – a land area five times the size of Portugal. Amnesty International documented this process in a briefing published in November 2019. 
Cattle illegally grazed found in supply chain of JBS  
In an investigation published in July 2020, Amnesty International found that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas in Brazil’s Amazon had been found in the supply chain of leading meat-packer JBS. Amnesty International did not find any evidence indicating that JBS is directly involved with human rights abuses. 
In September, following pressure from Amnesty International, JBS announced it would introduce a new system to monitor its cattle suppliers, including its indirect suppliers, by 2025. JBS has been aware of the risks that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas may be entering its supply chain since at least 2009, and previously pledged to monitor its indirect suppliers by 2011. 
“This timeline is simply not good enough. In 2009, JBS pledged to monitor its indirect suppliers by 2011 – yet here we are in 2020 with another vague promise that it might happen by 2025. Amnesty International again calls on JBS to implement these changes by the end of this year,” said Richard Pearshouse. 
Amnesty International has also launched an online petition, Say no to cattle illegally grazed in the Amazon, which can be signed here. 
Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve 
Today (2 December), a public hearing was held to discuss a bill in Rondônia State Congress that aims at reducing the area of Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve by 1,520 km². 
Most of the residents of the Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve were evicted by cattle farmers and grileiros during land seizures over the last two decades. The Reserve is one of the most deforested environmentally protected areas in the Amazon. Between August 2019 and July 2020, the Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve lost 104 km², an increase of 10.1% compared to the previous period. 
According to official data obtained by Amnesty International through a Freedom of Information request, the number of cattle inside the Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve increased from 83,642 in November 2018 to 105,478 in April 2020. 
“If approved, the bill will mean the regularization of land seizures for illegal commercial cattle ranching inside the Reserve. It will only encourage further land seizures in protected areas in the Amazon,” said Richard Pearshouse.

“Once again, the government has used the politically motivated charge of ‘inciting others to protest’ to prosecute people who have merely spoken out and protested peacefully. 
“By targeting well-known activists from Hong Kong’s largely leaderless protest movement, authorities are sending a warning to anyone who dares openly criticize the government that they could be next. 
“Even in protests where isolated acts of violence took place and public property was damaged, these should not be attributed to others or the organizers, or to the assembly in general. 
“Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam now join the many others who have been sentenced to jail in connection with the 2019 Hong Kong protests – the vast majority of whom have been prosecuted despite their activities being entirely peaceful. 
“These three activists have been jailed in violation of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Their convictions should be overturned without delay and they must be released immediately and unconditionally.” 
Background 
Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam – all former members of the disbanded political party Demosisto – were today sentenced over their involvement in protests outside the main Hong Kong Police Force base in the city’s Wan Chai area on 21 June 2019. 
Wong was sentenced to 13.5 months in jail, Chow to 10 months and Lam to seven months. 
Wong had pleaded guilty to inciting and organizing an unauthorized assembly under Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance, while Chow and Lam admitted to the incitement charge. “Incitement” in this case refers to the defendants’ use of a megaphone to shout slogans during the protest. 
Thousands of protesters gathered on 21 June last year in response to the use of rubber bullets, bean bag rounds and tear gas by police to disperse crowds during an earlier mass protest on 12 June. Some protesters in the 21 June demonstration threw eggs and covered the police building with graffiti, and an off-duty police officer was assaulted. 
More than 10,000 people have been arrested overall in connection with the 2019 Hong Kong protests, and more than 2,000 have faced prosecution on charges such as “rioting”, “illegal assembly” and “possession of weapons”. 
In June, 13 people including Apple Daily newspaper owner Jimmy Lai were charged with “inciting” others to join Hong Kong’s banned June Fourth Tiananmen anniversary vigil. 
The charge has also been used to arrest people for mobilizing others to join unauthorized protests using the messaging app Telegram. 
Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance has long been identified as not being in line with international standards. 
Under the law, those wishing to organize a protest are required to obtain a “Notice of No Objection” from the police before an assembly may proceed. If an assembly or procession is not approved, the event is considered “unauthorized” and individuals organizing and participating in such activity can be subject to fines and imprisonment. In effect, the provisions of the Public Order Ordinance establish a system in which permission from police is required to stage a protest. This runs counter to international law in that state authorities cannot require prior approval, but only notification to help facilitate orderly assemblies.

0,Egypt: Chilling rise in executions reveals depth of human rights crisis,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/egypt-chilling-rise-in-executions-reveals-depth-of-human-rights-crisis/,"In October and November alone, the Egyptian authorities executed at least 57 men and women, nearly double the recorded 32 people they executed throughout 2019, Amnesty International said today.

This horrific assault of the right to life included at least 15 people sentenced to death in cases relating to political violence following grossly unfair trials marred by forced “confessions” and other serious human rights violations including torture and enforced disappearances. 
This shocking death toll is likely to be an underestimate, as Egyptian authorities do not publish statistics on executions or the number of prisoners on death row; nor do they inform families or lawyers in advance of executions. Pro-government media reported 91 executions citing anonymous official sources since October. 
“The Egyptian authorities have embarked on a horrifying execution spree in recent months, putting scores of people to death, in some cases following grossly unfair mass trials,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. 
“These executions are particularly appalling given the well documented and systematic breaches of fair trial rights in Egypt, with courts often relying on torture-tainted ‘confessions.’ Not only are the Egyptian authorities trampling on the right to life in shocking disregard for their obligations under international law, but they are also punishing the brave human rights defenders at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights documenting and speaking out these violations.” 
Egyptian authorities have also clamped down on human rights organizations working on the death penalty. Authorities arrested staff members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) between 15 and 19 November and interrogated them about the organization’s criminal justice work, including its November publication on the alarming rise in executions. 
The execution spree followed an incident at Tora Maximum Security Prison One known as al-Aqrab (Scorpion) on 23 September, when four prisoners on death row and four members of security forces were killed. Official sources blamed the violence on an alleged escape attempt by prisoners. However, there has not been an independent and transparent investigation into the incident. 
Amnesty International has spoken to lawyers and relatives of prisoners who have been executed or are currently on death row and reviewed relevant legal documents, as well as reports from Egyptian NGO, media articles and Facebook posts by relatives of murder victims as well as those detained and executed. 
Rise in executions  
The Egyptian authorities executed 15 men in October convicted of murder in cases related to political violence. In October and November, they executed an additional 38 men and four women, convicted of murder in regular criminal cases, as well as two men convicted of rape. 
On 3 October, the authorities executed two men who had been convicted in a mass trial in the case known as “Alexandria Library events,” for involvement in political violence taking place in the aftermath of the authorities’ deadly dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in in August 2013.   
On 4 October, 10 men were executed after being convicted and sentenced to death, in the case known as “Agnad Masr,” involving violent attacks on officials and public property. The defendants told Supreme State Security Prosecutors that they had been subjected to enforced disappearance and torture, however there was no investigation into these complaints. One of the men executed, Gamal Zaki, had appeared in a video “confession” broadcast on several media outlets before the trial was concluded, severely undermining his right to fair trial, including his right not to incriminate himself and his right to the presumption of innocence. 
Three other men who were executed on 4 October had been convicted in another case of political violence in the aftermath of the authorities’ dispersal of the Rabaa sit-in. The case, known as “Storming the Kerdasa police station”, involved the death of 13 policemen. In December 2014, a Terrorism Circuit of the Giza Criminal Court convicted 184 people, sentencing 183 (34 in their absence) to death and a child to 10 years in prison and acquitted two people, while two others died by the time of the verdict. In a retrial, a Terrorism Circuit in the Cairo Criminal Court sentenced 20 people to death, 17 of whom remain on death row. Nine Egyptian human rights organizations denounced the verdict, highlighting gross violations of fair trial rights including defendants being denied access to their lawyers during their detention, being interrogated without the presence of lawyers, and being forced to “confess”.  
Amnesty International has previously documented concerns over the breaches of fair trial standards in such mass trials especially and the failure to demonstrate individual criminal responsibility. Torture is rampant in Egypt, and frequently used to extract “confessions”, while courts regularly fail to order investigations into allegations of torture and admit torture-tainted “confessions” as evidence. 
In addition to the 57 cases Amnesty International verified, pro-government media reported that an additional 31 men and three women were executed in October and November. Amnesty International was unable to verify these reports independently, in part given the reluctance of family members to communicate with human rights organizations for fear of reprisal. 
At risk of execution 
Given the Egyptian authorities lack of transparency, the number of prisoners currently at risk of execution is unknown. Among those on death row after having exhausted all possibilities of appeal is Wael Tawadros, known as Father Isaiah, a monk who was convicted of killing Bishop Anba Epiphanius in April 2019. Wael Tawadros was sentenced to death following a grossly unfair trial, where the court relied on his torture-tainted ‘confessions’ to secure a conviction. He was also denied the right to an adequate defense. 
According to his family, Wael Tawadros was arrested and held in an undisclosed location between 2 and 28 August 2018, where the Ministry of Interior refused to acknowledge his detention and reveal his location to his family and denied him access to his lawyer, effectively subjecting him to enforced disappearance.  
According to a video statement given by Wael Tawadros in court, examined by Amnesty International, police officers stripped him naked, then took him to the monastery and told him to wear his monk robe. He was then beaten, given electric shocks, and ordered to act out the alleged murder on camera. Wael Tawadros said that when a judge ordered that he be taken to hospital for a medical test, the officer ordered a medical worker to write that he was fine. 
Cruel and inhuman conditions  
In apparent retaliation for the security incident on 23 September at al-Aqrab Prison, authorities reduced the amount of food given to prisoners, including on death row and cut off the electricity supply to their cells, according to information received from sources knowledgeable of the conditions of detention in al-Aqrab. Prison guards beat 10 prisoners with water hoses, batons and sticks and confiscated prisoners’ belongings including bedding. Many were moved to solitary confinement cells or to another notorious prison, Tora Maximum Security Two, after the incident. 
Wael Tawadros’s family told Amnesty International that the Abaadiya prison administration has been subjecting him to discriminatory and punitive treatment as well, by preventing him from corresponding with his family and denying him regular access to a priest, in violation of international standards and Egyptian law. Others held at the same prison were granted such rights.  
“We call on the Egyptian authorities to commute all death sentences, and to quash convictions and order fair retrials without recourse to the death penalty for Wael Tawadros and anyone else convicted after unfair trials. We also urge the international community, including UN human rights bodies, to publicly call on the Egyptian authorities to immediately halt executions, and for members of the UN Human Rights Council to establish a monitoring and reporting mechanism on the human rights situation in Egypt,” said Philip Luther.

0,Viet Nam: Tech giants complicit in industrial-scale repression,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/viet-nam-tech-giants-complicit-in-industrial-scale-repression/,Facebook engaging in country-wide censorship of content Viet Nam imprisoning a record number of prisoners of conscience – with 40% behind bars for their social media use State-sponsored harassment rampant on Facebook and YouTube Tech giants Facebook and YouTube are allowing themselves to become...,"Tech giants Facebook and YouTube are allowing themselves to become tools of the Vietnamese authorities’ censorship and harassment of its population, in an alarming sign of how these companies could increasingly operate in repressive countries, a new report by Amnesty International reveals today. 
The 78-page report, “Let us Breathe!”: Censorship and criminalization of online expression in Viet Nam”, documents the systematic repression of peaceful online expression in Viet Nam, including the widespread “geo-blocking” of content deemed critical of the authorities, all while groups affiliated to the government deploy sophisticated campaigns on these platforms to harass everyday users into silence and fear. 
The report is based on dozens of interviews with human rights defenders and activists, including former prisoners of conscience, lawyers, journalists and writers, in addition to information provided by Facebook and Google. It also reveals that Viet Nam is currently holding 170 prisoners of conscience, of whom 69 are behind bars solely for their social media activity. This represents a significant increase in the number of prisoners of conscience estimated by Amnesty International in 2018. 
“In the last decade, the right to freedom of expression flourished on Facebook and YouTube in Viet Nam. More recently, however, authorities began focusing on peaceful online expression as an existential threat to the regime,” said Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns. 
“Today these platforms have become hunting grounds for censors, military cyber-troops and state-sponsored trolls. The platforms themselves are not merely letting it happen – they’re increasingly complicit.” 
In 2018, Facebook’s income from Viet Nam neared US$1 billion – almost one third of all revenue from Southeast Asia. Google, which owns YouTube, earned US$475 million in Viet Nam during the same period, mainly from YouTube advertising. The size of these profits underlines the importance for Facebook and Google of maintaining market access in Viet Nam. 
“Facebook is by far the most popular and profitable platform in Viet Nam. Businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever they operate in the world, and Viet Nam is no exception. The company could be doing much more to push back against Viet Nam’s heinous repression,” said Ming Yu Hah. “For millions of Vietnamese netizens, Facebook was the great hope for helping to build a free and open society – and it still has the power to be.” 
“Instead of seeking to weaponize these platforms, the Vietnamese authorities should stop punishing people simply for exercising their right to freedom of expression. Everybody in Viet Nam, regardless of their political opinions, has the right to participate in public life – both on- and offline.” 
Facebook and YouTube increasingly complying with Vietnamese pressure 
In April 2020, Facebook announced it had agreed to “significantly increase” its compliance with requests from the Vietnamese government to censor “anti-state” posts. It justified this policy shift by claiming the Vietnamese authorities were deliberately slowing traffic to the platform as a warning to the company. 
Last month, in Facebook’s latest Transparency Report – its first since it revealed its policy of increased compliance with the Vietnamese authorities’ censorship demands – the company revealed a 983% increase in content restrictions based on local law as compared with the previous reporting period, from 77 to 834. 
Meanwhile, YouTube has consistently won praise from Vietnamese censors for its relatively high rate of compliance with censorship demands. 
State-owned media reported Information Minister Nguyen Manh Hung as saying in October that compliance with the removal of “bad information, propaganda against the Party and the State” was higher than ever, with Facebook and Google complying with 95% and 90% of censorship requests, respectively. 
Vanishing content as platforms cave to repressive laws 
Based on dozens of testimonies and evidence, Amnesty International’s report shows how Facebook and YouTube’s increasing censorship of content in Viet Nam operates in practice. 
In some cases, users see their content censored under vaguely worded local laws, including offences such as “abusing democratic freedoms” under the country’s Criminal Code. Amnesty International views these laws as inconsistent with Viet Nam’s obligations under international human rights law. Facebook then “geo-blocks” content, meaning it becomes invisible to anyone accessing the platform in Viet Nam. 
Nguyen Van Trang, a pro-democracy activist now seeking asylum in Thailand, told Amnesty International that in May 2020, Facebook notified him that one of his posts had been restricted due to “local legal restrictions”. Since then, Facebook has blocked every piece of content he has tried to post containing the names of senior members of the Communist Party.  
“I have lost faith in Facebook, so I don’t post much anymore,” Nguyen Van Trang told Amnesty International. “Imagine if you spent years and years growing your Facebook account, posting and writing about your passions for democracy, but then in one easy act, Facebook just erases all the work you have done over the years.” 
Nguyen Van Trang has experienced similar restrictions on YouTube, which, unlike Facebook, gave him the option to appeal such restrictions. Some appeals have succeeded and others not, without YouTube providing any explanation. 
Content removed without any notification 
Truong Chau Huu Danh is a well-known freelance journalist with 150,000 followers and a verified Facebook account. He told Amnesty International that between 26 March and 8 May 2020, he posted hundreds of pieces of content about a ban on rice exports and the high-profile death penalty case of Ho Duy Hai. In June, he realized these posts had all vanished without any notification from Facebook whatsoever. 
Amnesty International heard similar accounts from other Facebook users, particularly when they tried to post about a high-profile land dispute in the village of Dong Tam, which opposed local villagers to military-run telecommunications company Viettel. The dispute culminated in a confrontation between villagers and security forces in January 2020 that saw the village leader and three police officers killed. 
After Facebook announced its new policy in April 2020, land rights activists Trinh Ba Phuong and Trinh Ba Tu reported that all the content they had shared about the Dong Tam incident had been removed from their timelines without their knowledge and without notification. 
On 24 June 2020, the pair were arrested and charged with “making, storing, distributing or disseminating information, documents and items against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” under Article 117 of the Criminal Code after they reported extensively on the Dong Tam incident. They are currently in detention. Their Facebook accounts have disappeared since their arrests under unknown circumstances. Amnesty International considers both Trinh Ba Phuong and Trinh Ba Tu to be prisoners of conscience. 
People jailed, harassed and attacked for their social media use 
The Vietnamese authorities’ campaign of repression often results in the harassment, intimidation, prosecution and imprisonment of people for their social media use. 
There are currently 170 prisoners of conscience imprisoned in Viet Nam, the highest number ever recorded in the country by Amnesty International. Nearly two in five (40%) have been imprisoned because of their peaceful social media activity. 
Twenty-one of the 27 prisoners of conscience jailed in 2020, or 78%, were prosecuted because of their peaceful online activity under Articles 117 or 331 of the Criminal Code – the same repressive provisions that often form the basis of ‘local legal restrictions’ implemented by Facebook and YouTube. 
These individuals’ supposed “crimes” include peacefully criticizing the authorities’ COVID-19 response on Facebook and sharing independent information about human rights online. 
“For every prisoner of conscience behind bars, there are countless people in Viet Nam who see this pattern of repression and intimidation and are understandably terrified about speaking their minds,” said Ming Yu Hah. 
Amnesty International has documented dozens of incidents in recent years in which human rights defenders have received messages meant to harass and intimidate, including death threats. The systematic and organized nature of these harassment campaigns consistently bear the hallmarks of state-sponsored cyber-troops such as Du Luan Vien or “public opinion shapers” – people recruited and managed by the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV)’s Department of Propaganda to engage in psychological warfare online. 
The activities of Du Luan Vien are complemented by those of “Force 47”, a cyberspace military battalion made up of some 10,000 state security forces whose function is to “fight against wrong views and distorted information on the internet”. 
While “Force 47” and groups such as Du Luan Vien operate opaquely, they are known to engage in mass reporting campaigns targeting human rights –related content, often leading to their removal and account suspensions by Facebook and YouTube. 
Additionally, Amnesty International’s investigation documented multiple cases of bloggers and social media users being physically attacked because of their posts by the police or plainclothes assailants, who operate with the apparent acquiescence of state authorities and with virtually no accountability for such crimes. 
Putting an end to complicity 
The Vietnamese authorities must stop stifling freedom of expression online. Amnesty International is calling for all prisoners of conscience in Viet Nam to be released immediately and unconditionally and for the amendment of repressive laws that muzzle freedom of expression. 
Companies – including Facebook and Google – have a responsibility to respect all human rights wherever they operate. They should respect the right to freedom of expression in their content moderation decisions globally, regardless of local laws that muzzle freedom of expression. Tech giants should also overhaul their content moderation policies to ensure their decisions align with international human rights standards. 
In October 2020, Facebook launched a global Oversight Board – presented as the company’s independent “Supreme Court” and its solution to the human rights challenges presented by content moderation. Amnesty International’s report reveals, however, that the Board’s bylaws will prevent it from reviewing the company’s censorship actions pursuant to local law in countries like Vet Nam. 
“It’s increasingly obvious that the Oversight Board is incapable of solving Facebook’s human rights problems. Facebook should expand the scope of the Oversight Board to include content moderation decisions pursuant to local law; if not, the Board – and Facebook – will have again failed Facebook users,” said Ming Yu Hah. 
“Far from the public relations fanfare, countless people who dare to speak their minds in Viet Nam are being silenced. The precedent set by this complicity is a grave blow to freedom of expression around the world.”

The 12 youths have been denied lawyers appointed by their families since being detained on 23 August, and they are at imminent risk of torture. Two of the group were under 18 years old when arrested. 
“The plight of these 12 young people is extremely concerning. Over the past 100 days, they have been subjected to some of the most common tactics from the Chinese police’s playbook. 
“They have been deprived of their basic human right to fair trial, including the chance to select their own lawyers, and they are at risk of torture and ill-treatment. Their families have repeatedly been denied access to them, and at least six lawyers have been threatened by the Chinese authorities to make them drop this case. 
“China must allow the ‘Hong Kong 12’, two of whom were children at the time of their arrest, to have regular access to their families and to family-appointed lawyers. They must also ensure that these young people are not subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.” 
Background 
CHENG Tsz-ho (鄭子豪), CHEUNG Chun-fu (張俊富), LIU Tsz-man (廖子文), QUINN Moon (喬映瑜), TANG Kai-yin (鄧棨然), LI Tsz-yin (李子賢), LI Yu-hin (李宇軒), WONG Wai-yin (黃偉然) and four other individuals were intercepted by coast guard officers from mainland China after leaving Hong Kong on a speedboat on 23 August 2020. 
On 30 September 2020, Yantian District People’s Procuratorate announced that it had approved the arrest of the 12 Hongkongers. This means that the 12 individuals could remain in custodial detention for three months or more while the case is investigated further by the police. 
QUINN and TANG were arrested for allegedly “organizing other persons to secretly cross the border” and the 10 others for “secretly crossing the border”. 
The Hong Kong government has made clear it has no intention of interfering with “the law enforcement of other jurisdictions”. 
Amnesty International has documented numerous cases in which detained individuals in mainland China, many of them human rights defenders, have been routinely deprived of their right to see lawyers that they or their families have chosen to represent them. 
In some instances, the authorities have appointed lawyers for detainees without their, of their families’, consent. In other cases, the authorities have threatened lawyers to make them drop cases. 
They have also claimed that detainees dismissed family-hired lawyers without producing any proof, as well as stopping families from hiring lawyers. All of this effectively amounts to depriving the detainees of their right to legal representation. Individuals deprived of legal representation of their own choice are often denied access to information about their legal rights, making them more vulnerable to unfair legal procedures.

On 26 November 2020, the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) released a list of “missing persons” to its offices. The list includes those who are unaccounted for either in connection with the conflict in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, due to civil or political unrest,  have been subject to enforced disappearance, or personnel of the armed forces, or police who have been identified as Missing In Action. The OMP has a mandate to collate data related to “missing persons” obtained by various past processes and to receive any new complaints.   
“The long overdue release of this list is an important first step for the families that have waited years to learn of the fate of relatives they have not seen or heard from since the conflict. The Sri Lankan authorities must now initiate investigations into the circumstances of their disappearance, identify anyone suspected of criminal responsibility for their fate, and, where there is sufficient admissible evidence, prosecute them in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts and without recourse to death penalty,” said David Griffiths, Director of the Office of Amnesty International’s Secretary General.  
Relief payments  
The release of the list comes as families of the disappeared have been petitioning the new Sri Lankan government – elected last year – to extend relief payments to them. Under the OMP’s recommendations, families had begun to receive LKR 6,000 (approximately 27 EUR) per month as a living allowance to ease the straitened circumstances they have endured with the disappearance of their relatives, including many individuals who were the sole income earners within those families. But the payments, which are just one of the several forms of reparation, were only reaching a limited number of affected families before being stopped altogether by the current government. Earlier this month, Amnesty International called on the government to commit funds in the 2021 budget to support the transitional justice process for victims of conflict.  
“The Sri Lankan government should commit funds to resume and extend relief payments to all families that have been affected by the disappearance of a relative, as they have been calling for. A disappearance of the main income earner can often mean financial ruin for a family. They have also spent considerable sums of money that they cannot afford to in their years-long search for answers. For all that they have suffered, a modest monthly stipend is the least that they are owed,” said David Griffiths.  
Threats, harassment and intimidation  
In their search for justice, truth and reparation, families of the disappeared and lawyers acting on their behalf continue to face threats and harassment from the authorities and from non-state actors.  
Human rights lawyer Kumaravadivel Guruparan was forced from his position as a senior lecturer and head of the University of Jaffna’s Law Department after pressure was brought to bear on the University authorities by the Sri Lankan military. The Adalaylam Centre for Policy Research, a human rights organization founded by Gurupuran, has been subject to multiple visits from officials inquiring about its staff and funding. Guruparan has been representing the families of 24 Tamil youths who have not been seen or heard from since they were taken into military custody in 1996.  
Achala Senevirathna, a lawyer, who is appearing in court on behalf of the relatives of 11  youths who were allegedly forcibly disappeared by a group of officers of the Sri Lankan Navy in 2008-2009, has been subject to a torrent of threatening abuse online and offline. Among the abuse Senevirathna has been subject to, she has received threatening phone calls and text messages from the accused naval officers and people believed to be close to them, using obscene language. Her Facebook profile has been targeted by people distorting her photos, and making threats of rape and murder. She says these threats have had impacts on her personal life and her career. Despite her complaining about these threats, the authorities have taken no action so far.  
The need for protection  
The Sri Lankan authorities must guarantee that the families of the disappeared, activists campaigning with them, and lawyers acting on their behalf are protected. The victims have a right to justice, truth, and reparation, including guarantees of non-recurrence. Any attempt to interfere with the pursuit of these rights must be investigated.  
“Where justice is denied and impunity is guaranteed, recurrence is almost inevitable. It is only through justice, truth, and reparation that the wounds suffered by these families can begin to heal. They have every right to pursue accountability using all means available to them, freely and without fear,” said David Griffiths.

On Black Friday, one of Amazon’s busiest periods, Amnesty International released a new briefing, Amazon, Let Workers Unionize, documenting the company’s treatment of workers in France, Poland, the UK and USA.  
Researchers found that Amazon has undermined attempts by workers to unionize and collectively negotiate, including through surveillance in the US and threats of legal action in the UK, and that it has failed to engage on key health and safety issues in Poland and France.  
“All through the pandemic, Amazon workers have been risking their health and lives to ensure essential goods are delivered to our doorsteps, helping Amazon achieve record profits. In this context it is alarming that Amazon has treated attempts to unionize with such hostility – as one of the most powerful companies in the world, it should know better,” said Barbora Černušáková, Amnesty International’s Researcher and Advisor on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  
“As Amazon approaches its busiest time of year with Black Friday and Christmas, we are urging the company to respect the human rights of its workers and comply with international labour standards, which state clearly that workers have a right to unionize. Amazon must refrain from breaching its workers’ rights to privacy, and stop treating union activity as a threat.”  
Productivity targets resumed 
Amazon suspended its stringent productivity targets for workers in March 2020, in the face of concerns that they were incompatible with health and safety measures required to prevent COVID-19 infections. However, ahead of the end of year holiday season, in October, Amazon told workers in the US, UK and elsewhere that it was reintroducing them.  
Workers in the UK reported receiving a text message stating that, “starting 21 October we will resume measuring and delivering productivity performance feedback to ensure we are ready to deliver for customers in the coming weeks.”  
Unions threatened and disciplined  
International human rights law and standards are clear that workers have rights to join and form trade unions, enjoy safe working conditions and have their right to privacy respected.   
Although Amazon says it respects employees’ rights to join or form a labour union, it has consistently undermined the ability of trade unions to operate. Not only did it identify the existence of unions as a “risk” factor in its 2018 and 2019 annual reports, Amazon also advised managers in a 2018 training video to look for “warning signs” of union activity.  
In March and April, there was uproar in the US when Amazon fired workers who spoke out about health and safety conditions during the pandemic.  
In the UK, GMB Union staff have been repeatedly threatened with injunctions for “trespassing” when trying to access Amazon facilities to recruit new members. Legal notices sent to union staff in 2018 and 2019 also illustrate that Amazon monitors the social media profiles of the union members, as their screenshots are attached as evidence of “planned” demonstrations.  
In Poland, the Workers’ Initiative reported disciplinary action against its members, including a woman who was reprimanded for recruiting union workers during working hours.   
Surveillance  
Another source of concern is the surveillance of Amazon’s workforce. In September, Vice News reported that Amazon had put out job advertisements for intelligence analysts to track risks including “labor organizing threats against the company”. Amazon has since removed the job adverts and stated that their posting was an error.   
In the same month, Vice News published details of internal Amazon documents showing that the company had been secretly monitoring and analyzing Amazon Flex drivers’ private Facebook groups, including for the purpose of tracking plans for strike actions or protests.  
On 21 September 2020, Amnesty International wrote to Amazon asking it to clarify its position on allegations of inappropriate surveillance and data collection from its workforce. In its response of 12 October 2020, Amazon did not answer specific questions about such practices. It did say, however, that Amazon places “enormous value on having daily conversations with each associate. Direct engagement with our employees is a strong part of our work culture.”  
According to leaked internal documents, made public in October 2020, Amazon appears to be using technology to monitor its workforce in the USA, including secretly tracking social media accounts for signs of plans to organize protests or strikes.   
In October, Recode reported that a leaked internal memo included plans by Amazon to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to monitor union “threats” through a new technology system called “geoSPatial Operating Console”.  
“This kind of sinister “Big Brother” behaviour is totally unacceptable, and interferes with workers’ freedom of expression and right to organize,”  said Barbora Černušáková.   
Failure to engage with unions on health and safety during the pandemic  
As COVID-19 continues to infect hundreds of thousands of people every day, the health and safety of Amazon workers remains a key concern.  
In Poland, the Workers’ Initiative told Amnesty International that in March 2020, Amazon refused to discuss health and safety concerns with them. In France, the trade union Solidaires successfully launched a legal challenge that forced a temporary halt in operations and the introduction of more stringent health and safety measures.    
Unions have also raised concerns about hazard pay. While some increased hazard pay for Amazon employees was introduced in Europe and North America, it was withdrawn in most countries at the end of May 2020 despite the pandemic continuing.   
“This festive period comes at the end of a long and difficult year for Amazon workers, who have had to fight for their rights at work in the midst of a pandemic,” said Barbora Černušáková.   
“Amazon is facing increasing scrutiny for its treatment of its workers, and we are urging the company to step up and fully comply with its responsibilty to respect workers’ rights.”

“With Saudi Arabia’s human rights record back in the spotlight as its hosts the G20 this year, the Saudi authorities could have decided to end the two-year nightmare for brave human rights defender Loujain al-Hathloud. Instead, in a disturbing move, they transferred her case to the SCC; an institution used to silence dissent and notorious for issuing lengthy prison sentences following seriously flawed trials. This is yet another sign that Saudi Arabia’s claims of reform on human rights are a farce. 
“Loujain al-Hathloul must be immediately and unconditionally released, and all charges against her dropped. We also call on the Saudi authorities to ensure she is allowed to be treated by a doctor of her choice and granted proper access to her lawyer and family.” 
Background  
In 2018, Saudi Arabia arrested 13 women’s rights activists for exercising their right to freedom of expression, association and assembly. Five remain in detention and appeared before a court today: Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani. It is unclear what the outcome of the sessions for the four other women human rights defenders. 
Loujain al-Hathloul undertook a two-week hunger strike from 26 October. According to family members who were present in the courtroom, she was shivering and speaking in a low voice during today’s session as she read out her four-page defense. Diplomats from a number of states were denied entry at the courthouse under the pretext of COVID-19 regulations. Amnesty International has documented how trials before the SCC are intrinsically unfair.

“The police repression of the 21 November protests was extremely serious. It is clear to Amnesty International that the Guatemalan authorities have violated international standards on the use of force, and have attacked the population’s right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“We demand that the Public Prosecutor’s Office conduct a prompt, thorough and independent investigation into the excessive use of force by police during the demonstrations and that the government ensure that the population is able to exercise its right to raise its voice without fear of reprisal.” 
This weekend, thousands of people took to the streets of the capital and other cities around the country to protest at the Congress of the Republic’s approval of the 2021 national budget, which was tabled by President Alejandro Giammattei’s government with a lack of transparency that prevented any in-depth discussion. Among other concerns, the budget includes a substantial reduction in public spending on social programmes that would address the population’s needs, such as chronic malnutrition, as well as reductions in the budget of the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsman. 
In response to isolated incidences of violence during what were mostly peaceful protests, the National Civil Police made unnecessary and indiscriminate use of tear gas and water cannons against people who were peacefully gathered or walking in the street. At least 43 arrests were recorded. From the images, Amnesty International has observed acts of violence committed by the police, including beatings of those arrested and journalists. Roosevelt Hospital also reported treating two people with eye injuries caused by tear gas canisters. 
Devices that have an indiscriminate effect and serious potential for harm, such as tear gas or water cannon, should not be used against peaceful, or mostly peaceful, public gatherings. International standards on the use of force stipulate that they should only be used when strictly necessary and provided clear warning is given, in situations of widespread violence in order to disperse a crowd when all other means have failed to contain the violence. 
Amnesty International repeats that acts of violence on the part of a few do not alter the peaceful nature of a protest and that police action must adhere to criteria of legality, necessity and proportionality. 
“President Alejandro Giammattei’s government must ensure that people are able to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The use of the security forces to repress the population must therefore be halted, as well as the use of language that stigmatizes and seeks to criminalize people who are genuinely protesting in demand of the authorities’ accountability,” concluded Erika Guevara-Rosas.

Drawn directly from a real-life case, “Violence Against Women: Consent” – an educational toolkit – is based on a landmark ruling of the European Court of Human Rights about a woman survivor of rape that was denied protection and access to justice. 
“Learners navigate their way through several shocking obstacles rape survivors encounter in their fight for justice, such as victim blaming, prejudices and flawed investigations that focus on the perceived lack of resistance of the victim rather than the absence of consent”, said Stasya Denisova, Human Rights Education Coordinator in Europe and Central Asia 
“Learning can be fun, even when learning about human rights violations. This user-friendly tool that will help to increase knowledge about sexual violence and rape as a serious violation of human rights and engage more people, including young people in the campaign against rape.” 
The module takes about 15 minutes to complete. Learners can consult with a legal expert via chat-bot to learn more about the importance of sexual consent and rape as a human rights violation. 
Shockingly, only nine countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) recognise that sex without consent is rape. Focus on resistance and violence rather than on consent has an impact not only on the reporting of rape but also on wider awareness of sexual violence, both of which are key aspects in preventing rape and tackling impunity. 
“This module helps learners to get away from common perceptions of rape where a woman will cry out for help, fight back and scream. The reality is that rape does not always look like this. Survivors of sexual assault often freeze, they may lose the ability to resist or to understand what is happening to them”, said women’s rights defender and the creator of the powerful illustrations for the module, Tatiana Zelenskaya. 
“Education on human rights and consent is crucial to ensure that women are better protected from rape and girls will not have to grow up questioning whether rape is their fault or doubt that the perpetrators will be prosecuted.”

Background 
The module “Violence Against Women: Consent” is based on the case of E.B. v Romania at the European Court of Human Rights. The court ruled that Romania failed to effectively investigate and prosecute a rape complaint and violated the right to be free from torture and other ill-treatment and the right to private life. 
It is currently available in both English and Russian. 
The module is the third in a series which also includes modules on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.

0,Afghanistan: Women’s rights must not be compromised in peace process,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/afghanistan-womens-rights-must-not-be-compromised-in-peace-process/,"Any compromise on women’s rights in a peace deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban would betray two decades of hard-won progress for Afghan women, said Amnesty International, ahead of a new campaign highlighting the incredible work of women human rights defenders in Afghanistan.  ...","Any compromise on women’s rights in a peace deal between the Afghan government and the Taliban would betray two decades of hard-won progress for Afghan women, said Amnesty International, ahead of a new campaign highlighting the incredible work of women human rights defenders in Afghanistan.   
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign starting on 25 November – the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women – and running until 10 December, Human Rights Day. The campaign celebrates Women Human Rights Defenders in every region of the world who fight gender-based discrimination and stand up for women’s rights. It calls on governments to prevent, investigate, and prosecute violence against women and girls.  
At a moment when the rights of Afghan women are at grave risk of being traded off in a peace deal with the Taliban, Amnesty International is working with women human rights defenders in Afghanistan to showcase their powerful stories.  
“Having spent two decades fighting hard to win their most basic rights, Afghan women now face the real possibility of seeing these gains bargained away. The advances made on women’s rights must not be rolled back in this peace process – the human rights of all Afghans, especially women and girls, must be at the heart of any eventual agreement,” said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s Afghanistan Campaigner.  
“As the stories we’ve gathered powerfully demonstrate, Afghan women have been at the forefront of efforts for peace and stability in Afghanistan. They have played a vital role in ensuring that issues such as human rights, justice, accountability, victims’ rights, and crimes against humanity are on the agenda in the ongoing peace efforts.”  
Under the Taliban, women and girls were denied a whole range of human rights, including the rights to education, health, free movement, and political and social participation.  
Since the Taliban regime ended in 2003, important strides have been made on women’s rights. There are now 3.3 million girls in education, and women are politically, economically and socially engaged. Despite ongoing conflict, Afghan women have become lawyers, doctors, judges, teachers, engineers, athletes, activists, politicians, journalists, bureaucrats, business owners, police officers, and members of the military.  
However, major obstacles and challenges remain. Violence against women is rife, the participation of women at all levels of government remains limited and, according to UNICEF, 2.2 million Afghan girls still do not attend school.  
In this year’s 16 Days of Activism campaign, Amnesty International will give a platform to women politicians and activists from Kabul and other provinces, who have been some of the pioneers in securing rights for Afghan women. These women share a common vision of a peaceful Afghanistan where women enjoy their rights as citizens, including their rights to study, to work, and to be independent.   
“A just, sustainable peace must uphold the human rights of all of Afghan society. Women are among those who have suffered most and their full participation in the peace process is absolutely essential,” said Samira Hamidi.    
“The progress women have been making is starting to redress the near-total exclusion they have faced in the past, and shows how central they are for the future of the country, but much work remains to be done. Any peace deal must not only protect the gains already made but commit to further advancing the rights of Afghan women.”   
Background  
On each of the 16 days, the campaign will feature social media video clips of women human rights defenders in Afghanistan discussing what peace means to them, what the meaningful participation of women in the peace process should look like, and their ideas of equality, justice and human rights – now and in a future Afghanistan.   
In 2019, Amnesty International featured 16 Women Human Rights Defenders in its 16 days of activism campaign.   
Amnesty International is calling on the international community to remain fully committed to protecting the human rights of women and girls in Afghanistan at this week’s Geneva Quadrennial Pledging Conference on Afghanistan (23-24 Nov)

Yesterday, Gasser Abdel- Razek appeared before a prosecutor for questioning, and a meeting of ambassadors to the Human Rights Council took place in Geneva to discuss the international response. 
On the same day, judicial authorities added human rights defender and founder of Adalah Center for Rights and Freedoms Mohamed al-Baqer to the “terrorists list” for five years, along with prominent blogger and activist Alaa Abdelfatah and other opposition politicians, without charging them with a criminal offence, nor giving them an opportunity to challenge the evidence. 
“Instead of responding to global calls to end the unprecedented attacks on the EIPR, the Egyptian authorities continue to add to the litany of committed human rights violations by deliberately ill-treating Gasser Abdel-Razek in solitary confinement without access to basic necessities as punishment for his human rights leadership. EIPR has been documenting and fighting against such violations for 18 years, and its staff are now paying a heavy price,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. 
“The arrest of EIPR staff, following a meeting with diplomats, Gasser Abdel-Razek’s punitive treatment in detention and the designation of human rights defenders as ‘terrorists’, are the latest illustrations of how deep and catastrophic the crisis of human rights in Egypt has become. States and UN actors cannot continue to tolerate a status quo in which civil society is being cut off and suffocated without consequence; they must, through word and deed, demand meaningful improvements to the human rights situation in Egypt. As part of this broader response, it is time for the UN Human Rights Council to take immediate steps towards establishing a monitoring mechanism on Egypt.” 
Amnesty International fears that Gasser Abdel-Razek is being deliberately held in poor conditions to punish him for his human rights work. Since his transfer to Liman Tora Prison on 20 November, Gasser Abdel-Razek, a veteran human rights defender and father-of-two, has been held in solitary confinement in a cold cell, denied warm clothing or a mattress. All his personal belongings and money have been confiscated. Prison authorities have denied him any time outside his cell, including for exercise. They also prevented him from purchasing basic necessities from the prison canteen. Yesterday, Gasser Abdel-Razek appeared in front of the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) for additional questioning. Prison authorities shaved his head completely, an unusual step for pre-trial detainees, raising further concerns over discriminatory and punitive treatment. 
Gasser Abdel-Razek, Criminal Justice Unit director Karim Ennarah and Administrative Director Mohamed Basheer, are all detained pending investigations into bogus “terrorism”-related charges, solely as a result of the EIPR’s human rights work. They were arbitrarily arrested between 15 and 19 November in retaliation for a meeting with western diplomats earlier this month.  A fourth staff member, Patrick George Zaki has been in prison since his arrest in February 2020 upon his return from Italy where he was studying. 
The Egyptian authorities regularly use unfounded “terrorism” related charges to imprison human rights defenders and to subject them to punitive measures without trial. Human rights defenders Mohamed al-Baqer, Esraa Abdelfatah, Mahienour al-Masry and Solafa Magdy are detained pending investigations in the same case over similar “terrorism” related charges. 
Amnesty International has documented the Egyptian authorities’ routine and systematic use of counter-terror legislation to prosecute thousands of peaceful critics and suspend guarantees to fair trial.  Multiple UN experts have expressed concern about how Egypt’s terrorism laws facilitate rights abuses, and how imprisoned human rights defenders in Egypt are at grave risk of COVID-19.  Egypt has a history of reprisals against civil society for engaging with UN officials.  To our knowledge, however, this is the first case of reprisals against civil society for engaging with a group of diplomatic representatives, thereby representing an escalation in the authorities’ crackdown. 
On 20 November, the Spokesperson of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed deep concern “that the targeting of human rights defenders and other activists, as well as further restrictions on freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly imposed in the country, are having a profound chilling effect on an already weakened Egyptian civil society.” On the same day, the Secretary General, through his Spokesperson, endorsed this statement.  On 23 November, Amnesty International along with other organizations, participated in a meeting hosted by a number of Human Rights Ambassadors focused on how to respond to the arrests against EIPR staff, and the larger context of repression against civil society. 
“Egyptian authorities regularly use unfounded ‘terrorism’ charges to detain and defame human rights defenders in the eyes of the Egyptian public and international community. In reality, the Egyptian authorities view legitimate human rights work like defending LGBTI rights, opposing the death penalty, defending religious minorities and promoting the right to health as terrorism” said Philip Luther. 
“The international community must show to Egypt that they utterly reject the equation of defending human rights with terrorism and continue to demand the immediate and unconditional release of all detained human rights defenders in Egypt.”

“We express our solidarity with communities calling for long overdue action to address systemic racism and transformative approaches to public safety. 
“Peaceful protests are a fundamental part of a vibrant society. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is a vital means of political engagement, with a long history of being a valid and effective means of bringing issues and grievances to light. Facilitating and protecting the right to freedom of assembly contributes to the protection of other human rights. 
“The right to hold assemblies and demonstrations on public roads has been upheld consistently by regional and international human rights bodies, which have established that urban space is not only an area for circulation but also a space for participation. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association has stipulated that ‘the free flow of traffic should not automatically take precedence over freedom of peaceful assembly.’ 
“Why did police disperse the occupation and arrest 13 activists – 12 of whom were later charged with mischief – when community members from the three groups were already due to meet with city representatives later that day to address their concerns?

Amnesty International is calling on all parties to the conflict to prioritize the protection of civilians, and to grant access to human rights monitors and humanitarian organizations. 
“The conflict in the Tigray region has already claimed hundreds of civilian lives, left many more injured, and forced thousands into refugee camps in neighbouring Sudan. As Ethiopian federal troops begin preparations to encircle Mekelle, Amnesty International reminds all parties that deliberately attacking civilians and civilian objects is prohibited under international humanitarian law, and constitutes war crimes. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks are also prohibited,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“As well as abiding by this prohibition, commanders in both the Ethiopian national army and the TPLF must take active steps to protect civilians during any fighting, including by taking all feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure and avoiding locating military facilities and soldiers near concentrations of civilians. 
Amnesty International is particularly concerned about potential civilian casualties after military spokesman Colonel Dejene Tsegaye appeared on state-run TV and said: 
“We want to send a message to the public in Mekelle to save themselves from any artillery attacks and free yourselves from the junta … After that, there will be no mercy.”

Monday 9 November was a sad day for Mexican journalism. 
That morning, the reporter Israel Vázquez Rangel was investigating a crime scene in Salamanca, a small industrial city in the central state of Guanajuato, when armed men arrived and shot him at least five times. He died in hospital hours later. 
Then, that evening, police in the tourist city of Cancún opened fire to disperse a demonstration against the high level of femicides that plague the nation. Two journalists suffered gunshot wounds and the police beat two others during the repression of the protest.

Mexican journalism has been through too many sad days. In the 11 days before Israel was killed, another two journalists were murdered. On the night of 29 October, Arturo Alba Medina, a TV news presenter in Ciudad Juárez, died after being shot at least 10 times while he was driving home. Five days later, the reporter Jesús Alfonso Piñuelas was shot while riding a motorbike in the northern state of Sonora and died instantly.   
Besides those three dead journalists, another 135 of their colleagues have been murdered in Mexico since the year 2000, according to the NGO Article 19.

PEN International reports: “Veteran journalist Miroslava Breach was repeatedly shot in the head outside her home in Chihuahua on March 23, 2017. Breach, aged 54, was a well-known journalist whose 20-year career focused on reporting on political and social issues, often covering corruption. Her most recent work exposed connections between local politicians and drug cartels.” Photo credit: Sergio Ortiz Borbolla/Amnesty International  
Impunity and lack of protection 
Mexican authorities have achieved some convictions this year in the emblematic cases of Javier Valdez and Miroslava Breach, who were murdered in 2017. But the vast majority of killings go unpunished. This vicious cycle of impunity and violence has turned Mexico into one of the world’s most lethal countries for journalists. 
Of course this problem has existed since long before the current government’s mandate, but that does not absolve it of its obligation to protect journalists and guarantee their rights to life and freedom of expression. Yet, instead of taking urgent and decisive measures to ensure that they can carry out their work in an environment free of violence, the government is putting them in situations of even greater risk.  
In order to allocate more resources to combatting the COVID-19 pandemic, on 21 October Mexico’s Congress approved the elimination of 109 independent trust funds that distributed public resources to support a wide range of causes, from scientific research to natural disaster responses. The Fund for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists is among the trusts that were shut down.  
This fund was financing the protective measures granted to more than 400 journalists and almost 900 human right defenders who are under threat, providing them with access to bodyguards, satellite phones, panic buttons, armored cars and safe houses. Although we at Amnesty International have documented that these measures are imperfect and sometimes insufficient, the government must take great care not to weaken them even more. On the contrary, it should strengthen them through consultation with the defenders and journalists in need of protection.  
The Mechanism for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and Journalists now faces an uncertain future. It will depend directly upon the Secretariat of the Interior to finance the protective measures but, as Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexico representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, has warned, the funding for these measures “may become vulnerable to political whims and the trading of favors”. 
Besides the risk associated with the disappearance of the trusts, several high-ranking Mexican officials have also verbally attacked the press. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has consistently attacked certain media outlets during his daily morning press conferences, stigmatizing journalists and exposing them to threats and harassment. We have also seen the governors of states such as Jalisco, Puebla and Baja California doing the same.  
 
Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador  
According to a study by Article 19, public officials were responsible for 199 of the 406 acts of aggression against journalists and media outlets registered during the first half of this year, while politics and corruption proved the most dangerous topics to cover. These aggressions vary from harassment and cyber attacks to displacement and killings. From January to June there was a 45% rise in aggressions compared to the same period of 2019, equivalent to an attack against the press every 11 hours. If this continues, there will be more aggressions against the press in 2020 than any year in the last decade. 
This disturbing panorama encourages self-censorship and has grave implications for press freedom, the right to information and accountability in Mexico.   
The government must stop treating the press like an enemy. If it genuinely cares about human rights, it will recognize the importance and legitimacy of the work of journalists and take swift, concrete and effectives measures that allow them to carry it out without fear of reprisal.

“Germain Rukuki has been behind bars for more than three years on trumped-up charges. During this period, he has not seen his family or held his youngest son who was born after his arrest. Rukuki is paying the price for his dedication to human rights in a country where the government and ruling party remain intolerant of any form of dissent,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“We are calling on the world to stand in solidarity with Germain Rukuki, a prisoner of conscience detained solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression, and write a letter urging the Burundian authorities calling to release him and for an end to their crackdown on human rights defenders.” 
Rukuki was arrested in July 2017 and is serving a 32-year prison sentence after he was convicted of “rebellion”, “threatening State security”, “participation in an insurrectional movement” and “attack on the authority of the State.” 
In June 2020 the Supreme Court vacated the Appeal Court’s rejection of his appeal the previous year citing procedural irregularities and directed the Appeal Court to hear the appeal again. A new hearing date has not yet been announced. 
Many human rights defenders, opposition leaders and journalists have fled Burundi since the 2015 violent crackdown on protests against the late president Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to run for a third term, and those who remained have been subjected to threats and reprisals, including physical attacks and enforced disappearances. 
Rukuki joined the human rights movement when he was still a student, volunteering and later working as staff member for ACAT-Burundi, an anti-torture organization. ACAT-Burundi was suspended in 2015 and permanently shut down in 2016, along with four other human rights groups that also opposed President Nkurunziza’s bid for a third term. He had moved to another organization at the time of his arrest, but his previous employment at ACAT-Burundi formed the basis of the charges against him. 
Every December, in what has become the world’s biggest human rights event, people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts and postcards as part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign, in support of people whose human rights are under attack. Rukuki’s case is one of the 10 selected for Write for Rights 2020. Other cases featured are from Algeria, Chile, Colombia, Malta, Myanmar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey.

We are also deeply troubled by the longstanding and worsening efforts, carried out by individuals and organizations that are led, backed or encouraged by the Chinese government, to harass and intimidate human rights defenders from our communities here in Canada. We reiterate our calls for the Canadian government to prioritize concern for human rights in our relationship with China.  
We welcome the recent statement by Prime Minister Trudeau calling attention to the intensification of intimidation and harassment, here in Canada, by agents and proxies of the Chinese government, in an effort to silence and intimidate voices raised against wholesale intimidation, cultural genocide, linguistic suppression and curtailing the freedom of conscience and religion.  
Human rights defenders and pro-democracy campaigners in Canada who are from the Uighur, Tibetan, Hong Kong and Chinese communities, and practitioners of Falun Gong have borne the brunt of these unlawful tactics in a very direct manner. This is intolerable and in breach of international human rights norms as well as Canadian laws.   
 So, while applauding the Prime Minister’s remarks on this issue, we collectively urge him to review the 2017 and 2020 reports from our Coalition, prepared by Amnesty International, with concrete recommendations to counter this mounting pattern of interference and intimidation. The first step would be to appoint a central focal point where individuals and groups can report the harassment and threats they experience. That must be accompanied by a robust suite of measures to counter this systemic and wholly unacceptable intimidation. The China Coalition therefore recommends that the Government of Canada adopt the following further measures:  
Failure to take concrete measures will only embolden the Chinese government and its proxies, leading to intensified harassment and intimidation against us here in Canada. We know from long experience, that hesitation is read as weakness by the Government of China and will be exploited. We urge the Canadian government to act now and take up our recommendations.   
This statement is endorsed by the following members of the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China:   
Alliance Canada-Hong Kong, Amnesty International Canada (English & Francophone Branches), Canada-Hong Kong Link, Canada Tibet Committee, Falun Dafa Association of Canada, Federation for a Democratic China, Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights, Toronto Association for Democracy in China, Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project, and Vancouver Society in Support of Democratic Movement.

“COVID-19 may be a new killer – but hate has been killing us for decades.” 
This is what Joey Mataele, a trans activist from Tonga, told Amnesty when we asked about the pandemic’s impact on trans people in the Pacific Islands. 
Joey, who helped found Tonga’s only organization for trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people, is right. Between 2008 and 2020 there has been a yearly increase in murders of trans and gender-diverse people, according to the most recent findings of the Trans Murder Monitoring Project. In the year to 30 September 2020, 350 trans and gender-diverse people were killed globally. 
The TMM project’s statistics for this period also highlight the intersecting forms of discrimination many trans people face; people of colour made up 79% of trans people murdered in the USA; and 62% of murdered trans people whose occupation was known were sex workers. 
These figures are horrific enough, but they do not capture the full magnitude of the abuse perpetrated against many trans people on a daily basis. 
Violence and abuse against trans people has increased during the pandemic. In some cases this is a direct result of lockdown measures which force trans people to isolate with hostile family members. Others have been forced to put themselves in dangerous situations to earn a living; this is particularly the case with trans sex workers, who have risked exposure to the virus, or met clients in unsafe locations in order to continue working amid lockdowns. 
The pandemic has also exposed how years of discrimination have pushed many trans people to the margins, leaving them vulnerable to the economic ravages of COVID-19. 
Ahead of Trans Day of Remembrance, Amnesty spoke to trans people around the world about their experiences of the pandemic. Their accounts make it clear that established economic, employment, and health care systems across the world often marginalize trans people in unique ways. 
Trans people in many parts of the world are cut off from formal education or employment. This restricts trans people to a narrow range of job opportunities; much of the work that is available is informal or based in industries which were hard hit by the pandemic. 
For example, in India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, trans women, culturally known as khwaja siras or hijras, are cut off from many education and employment opportunities, and often earn a living by performing ceremonial functions at weddings and child births, engaging in sex-work, or begging on the streets 
When lockdown measures were imposed across these countries, this kind of work came to a grinding halt. Trans activists in Punjab and Sindh regions of Pakistan told Amnesty they knew transwomen who could no longer afford to pay rent after lockdown was implemented, and who would have been on the verge of homelessness without the support of other trans women and activists. 
Brenda, a Filipino trans activist who works across countries in South East Asia said the main forms of livelihood for trans women in the region are sex-work, participating in beauty pageants, and performing in various entertainment venues. Social distancing and lockdown measures affected all of these industries and cut trans women off from their income overnight. 
Similarly, in the Pacific Islands, including Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, most transwomen – culturally referred to as Leiti, Faʻafafine, Vakasalewalewa, Fakafefine, and Palopa on the different islands – are employed in the hospitality industry. Joey said trans women lost their jobs in droves when visitors stopped coming to the islands because of the pandemic. 
It’s clear that the barriers trans people have historically faced to employment have left many in precarious situations. The pandemic has been economically devastating for millions of people, but those who are shut out of the job market due to discrimination and hate have been especially badly hit. It shouldn’t have taken a pandemic to draw attention to this, but now governments must act to ensure trans people have equal access to employment and social security. 
There are other ways in which the pandemic has had a unique impact on trans people. 
In some countries, lockdown measures have included the mandatory display of IDs when people leave their homes for essential purposes. Trans and non-binary people living in countries where they are not able to legally change their gender, told us that this resulted in a barrage of harassment and hostility. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, some countries in South America, including Peru, Colombia, and Panama, designated specific days for men and women to leave their homes for essentials. This left trans people open to abuse, extortion, and harassment. One particularly shocking video circulated online showed police officers in Lima forcing three trans women to squat on the ground and say: “I want to be a man”. 
In some countries trans people are also denied the documentation they need to access social security benefits. 
Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju, a medical student and trans-activist, told Amnesty India: 
“Transgender people don’t have access to Aadhar cards, ration cards, PAN card or a lot of identity documents that might allow you to access basic facilities.” 
Accessing health care has also been a major problem for many trans people during the pandemic. 
Trans people across different regions told Amnesty that the stigma and discrimination they have historically faced in accessing health care has been exacerbated by the pandemic. 
A major problem is a lack of trans-specific healthcare, which leaves people reliant on online forums or the experiences of other trans people to make big decisions about medication and treatment. This peer support system is valuable, but it carries risks. Rumi Dalle, a transwoman in Lebanon told us that people often feel they have no option but to take over-the-counter medicines and black-market hormone injections without medical oversight. I heard similar stories about lack of medical support and oversight from trans people in the Philippines, Tanzania, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Kosovo.  
In countries in Europe and in the United States, where some trans-specific healthcare is available, gender affirming treatment and surgeries were postponed when health-care services were reprioritised to respond to the pandemic, resulting in a raft of physical and mental health challenges.  Restrictions on travel have also impacted people who have to travel to other countries to get gender affirming treatment or healthcare. This is often the case where legal gender recognition is not possible in their own countries, and the medical support for it is unavailable. 
When we asked trans people whether they had received any government support during the pandemic, many responded with incredulity.  One Filipino transwoman referred to the murder of Jennifer Laude, whose killer was pardoned after he had served only half his sentence: 
“President Duterte pardoned the murderer of a transwomen. That’s the worst slap we can get as transwomen[…]If killing trans people has been made this easy, what can we expect from the government [at the time of the pandemic]? No support at all.” 
In the absence of specific government relief or stimulus packages, many trans people have had to rely on assistance from others in the trans or wider LGBTI communities. There are some heartening examples of trans activists and communities coming together in localised efforts to support those most in need. In Latin America, the organization RedLacTans created a solidarity network linking 18 countries in the region, and provided limited funds to cover basic needs like food for those most in need. In Pakistan, trans activists came together to provide basic awareness around hygiene and sanitisation, distributed sanitisers, immunity boosters and masks. 
But activists shouldn’t have to step into the gaps where states have failed. Governments need to look hard at the damage the pandemic has caused to trans people and take immediate action to protect their rights.  
This means challenging and breaking down the institutionalised, systemic barriers trans people face in accessing and retaining formal employment and the benefits that come with it; providing appropriate and timely healthcare, food security and shelter; and protecting trans people from violence and harassment. 
Respecting and promoting the human rights of trans people is the national and international obligation of every government. As the pandemic rips across the world, governments must recognize their responsibilities to keep those who are already on the margins of society from falling over its edges.

The crackdown took place after the group held a human rights briefing with 13 Western diplomats. Gasser Abdel-Razek, EIPR’s Executive Director and a veteran human rights defender, is the third senior staff member to be detained in just five days. 
Amnesty International calls on countries whose representatives attended the meeting on 3 November, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Germany, to break their silence and publicly demand Egypt release these human rights defenders and end its brutal repression of the human rights community. 
“This is an unprecedented crackdown on the human rights community and could well go beyond EIPR to engulf the few other remaining brave groups. The tepid response by the international community risks emboldening the Egyptian authorities and sends a terrifying message to civil society that human rights work will not be tolerated,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director. 
“These arrests, the smear campaign against the organization and the government’s baseless claim that EIPR operates illegally, show that this is a well-planned and concerted attack. Accusing NGO staff of ‘joining a terrorist group’ is an assault on the organization and the human rights values it represents.” 
The reprisals campaign began after the briefing with diplomats at EIPR’s office. Ambassadors from Germany, France, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland as well as Chargés d’Affaires of Canada, Norway, and Sweden, the deputy ambassador of the United Kingdom and representatives from the European Commission in Cairo attended. Diplomats and the EIPR shared photos of the meeting on social media. 
Fabricated charges 
On the evening of 19 November, plainclothes security forces arrested Gasser Abdelrazek from his home in Maadi, Cairo. He appeared before Supreme State Security Prosecutors (SSSP) at 1:30 am and was questioned over fabricated “terrorism”-related charges. Prosecutors then ordered his pre-trial detention for 15 days. 
Earlier that day prosecutors had ordered the detention of EIPR’s Criminal Justice Unit Director Karim Ennarah for 15 days pending investigations over similar charges. Security forces arrested him on 18 November at a beach resort in Dahab, South Sinai, where he had been on vacation. They took him to an undisclosed location and detained him incommunicado for 24 hours before bringing him before the SSSP, where he was questioned about his work including on conditions of detention and the death penalty. 
The first detention took place on 15 November, when security forces arrested Administrative Director Mohamed Bashseer from his home. After being held for about 12 hours at a facility controlled by the National Security Agency, where he was questioned while blindfolded about the diplomats’ visit and other EIPR work, he was taken to the SSSP, which ordered his detention pending investigations. 
All three have been added to Case No. 855/2020 which includes several other human rights defenders, many of whom have been detained without trial for over a year.  Prosecutors detained both Gasser Abdelrazek and Karim Ennarah pending investigation on charges of and “joining a terrorist group”, in addition to “spreading false news” and “misusing social media”. Mohamed Basheer was questioned about “committing a crime of funding terrorism” in addition to all other three charges. 
Ongoing harassment 
This campaign is the latest in a string of crackdowns on NGOs since the 2011 raid and prosecution of staff from five international organizations, known as Case 173, or Egypt’s “foreign funding case”. In 2013, 43 foreign and Egyptian staff were convicted on charges of operating unlawfully and receiving foreign funding without authorities and sentences to prison terms. 
After years of lobbying by the US and German governments, in a retrial, a Cairo Criminal Court  acquitted all defendants in 2018, but criminal investigations continue against local civil society groups. As part of the case, EIPR’s founder Hossam Bahgat has been under a travel ban since 2016 and his assets have been frozen. At least 30 other human rights defenders are banned from travel and nine have their assets frozen. 
EIPR has remained one of a handful of independent human rights organizations that have bravely continued to operate in Egypt. Patrick George Zaki, an EIPR gender rights researcher, remains arbitrarily detained following his arrest in February 2020 upon his return from studying in Italy. 
“This is a test for the international community,” said Philip Luther “There is a need for urgent, coordinated and public action, backed by strong measures, to call on Egyptian authorities to end the crackdown and release all those detained. Failure to act threatens the very survival of the human rights community in Egypt.” 
Background 
The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) was founded in 2002. The organization uses research, documentation, legal aid, strategic litigation and advocacy in its work on civil liberties, economic and social rights and criminal justice. Its work includes reporting on the rights of religious minorities in Egypt, documenting sectarian violence, representing members of the LGBT+ community facing prosecution and advocating on mental health law. EIPR is one of the few human rights organizations working on environmental justice in Egypt.

As you may have already learnt, our very own Amnesty family in India is under assault, and has recently had to temporarily close its operations. We stand in firm solidarity with them and  other Amnesty activists around the world increasingly at risk in recent years. These attacks only fuel our resolve to pursue freedom and justice for all, and to hold leaders accountable to the universal principles of human rights.  
My goal is to engage Canadians decision makers at all levels to ensure we “walk the talk” and truly uphold the culture of respect for human rights for which we are globally known. We will continue to speak truth to power and to do all we can to ensure that these rights are also upheld right here at home. The current pandemic has revealed Canada’s profound inequalities, and there is much work for us to do for Indigenous, racialized and marginalized peoples in particular to not only have their basic rights upheld, but to lead free and fulfilling lives.  
Building a more inclusive movement —one that is actively anti-racist, intersectional, decolonial, and which centers the voices, concerns and solutions of rights holders— is a top priority for me. I am particularly committed to continue building a movement which reflects Canada’s rich diversity and the values of respect, dignity and justice which are the benchmark of our movement.  
As refugee mom of two beautiful, smart girls, I hope my appointment encourages young refugee and immigrant youth to pursue their heart’s calling and know that there is a place for everyone in Canada. You belong here and you have so much to bring. We need you and your voice to build a better and more just world, starting right here in our movement. We welcome you with open arms.  
Beyond my personal human rights work, I am conscious that I am also the first woman, Black person, African, refugee, exiled human rights defender and poet to step into this role. Yes, so many firsts! I’m excited to bring all these identities and my rich experience in both advocacy and activism on board.  
Despite the great challenges we face, these are unique and hopeful times for anyone who yearns for a more just world. There is such enthusiasm, passion, legitimate rage and hunger for change. The possibilities are immense, and our people-power has never been so palpable. Young people in particular are reminding us that hope combined with action have always been the path to change.  
To quote my favorite author, Toni Morrison: “there is no time for despair”. This is precisely when we go to work.  
It’s an honour and a joy to stand in solidarity with you and with countless passionate and fearless activists globally, as we continue to push towards the changes we so fervently seek. This work would not be possible without your dedication, your energy and the generous support of all our donors.  
I am grateful to you all and hopeful about what we will achieve together.  
Onwards, with hope, love and solidarity!

“The videos that Amnesty International has digitally verified are strong evidence of the violence that the police are using against the population they should be protecting,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
According to the information received, more than 15 people have been injured, at least three of them seriously wounded by firearms, since 10 November 2020, mostly in the massive protests that took place yesterday in several cities across the country. 
Amnesty International has also received reports of arbitrary arrests by National Police officers in civilian clothes who refused to identify themselves, and of ill-treatment by the security forces. 
The National Police has reported that eleven police officers were injured by blunt objects, and said an unspecified number of people were detained for “disturbances, aggression and resistance to authority”. 
In the incidents that Amnesty International has been able to verify, police officers fired ammunition, launched tear gas, and beat or violently subdued people in an unnecessary and disproportionate manner, injuring them and violating international human rights standards. 
On the night of 12 November, several police officers fired directly at people during a demonstration in the vicinity of Lima’s Superior Court of Justice. In one video, agents formed a barrier and fired unidentified ammunition on four occasions, while one of them shouted “Kill him, kill him”. In another video of the same incident, the same group of officers fired several times at a group of people, and in another video an officer fired at close range in the direction of a group of people. 
“This political crisis is generating a human rights crisis due to the violent repression of the protests. The authorities must prioritize the protection of the population over any political interest,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru. 
The authorities must immediately stop the repression of demonstrations, guarantee the right to peaceful protest and investigate promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially all allegations of human rights violations during the current crisis, particularly those committed by the security forces. 
Amnesty International stresses that the role of journalists and human rights defenders is fundamental in this context and strongly condemns the reports of threats and acts of intimidation against members of the National Human Rights Coordinating Committee. At least four journalists have been injured during the repression of the protests. 
Finally, the organization calls on the judicial authorities not to apply the Police Protection Law (No. 3110), which, in violation of international human rights law, leaves open the possibility that the excessive use of force by the National Police will be met with impunity.

According to local media reports, the Bangladeshi government has completed preparations to relocate 300 to 400 Rohingya refugees to the silt island of Bhashan Char this month on a “voluntary basis”. Rohingya refugees, interviewed by Amnesty International this month, said that government officials in charge of refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar have coerced them into registering for relocation.  
Amnesty International has obtained a partial list of the Rohingya families identified for relocation to Bhashan Char, where more than 300 Rohingya refugees are already living in poor conditions.   
“Aside from the fact that Bhashan Char has not been deemed safe for human habitation by the UN, there are serious questions over this relocation procedure. Many of the Rohingya we have spoken to have not given full and informed consent to being moved to an island they know nothing about,” said Omar Waraich, Head of South Asia at Amnesty International.  
“Any decisions relating to the relocation of refugees must be transparent and involve the full participation of the Rohingya people. In the meantime, plans for any further relocations must be abandoned. The Bangladeshi authorities must let the UN carry out an assessment of Bhashan Char and immediately return the hundreds of Rohingya refugees currently on the island to their families in Cox’s Bazar.”  
A Rohingya woman on the list told Amnesty International that she has registered to go to the island because her husband is there. As a single parent with a young child and without any relatives in the camp, she has been facing many problems. “It’s very difficult to live this refugee life. I don’t have any other option. It seems that the government will never allow my husband to get out of the island,” she said.  
Two Rohingya families were put on the list for relocation after they reported partial damage of their shelters to the majhi – a Rohingya community leader, selected by the Bangladeshi authorities in most of the camps – and government officials in charge of the refugee camps. Instead of having their shelters repaired, they were told that they must relocate to Bhashan Char.  
“I requested many times to the NGOs and CIC (camp authority) for support to fix my shelter. We are still having difficulty staying in the shelter. They are not helping me to relocate within the camp or to other camps,” said the head of one Rohingya family. The head majhi in his camp told him that debts he had incurred to feed his family and pay for his wife’s medical treatment would be cleared if he relocated. “I decided to register for the relocation as I have no other option,” he said.  
One member of a family said that he registered to relocate to the island in 2019, after being deprived of relief support by the majhi in his camp. “I wanted to relocate to the island at that time to escape from a society where some powerful people were discriminating against the poor. The majhis were abusing their power on me. But the problem is resolved now,” said the 33-year-old head of a five-member family who believes that the government will not forcibly relocate anyone to the island. He is, however, on the list prepared this month by the government official in charge of the refugee camp.  
A head majhi told Amnesty International that government officials in charge of camps put pressure on them to provide lists of refugees to be relocated.  
“Based on the experiences of those that Amnesty International has spoken to, many of the Rohingya who have signed up to relocate to Bhashan Char are doing so out of compulsion rather than choice,” said Omar Waraich.   
“Bangladesh has demonstrated commendable generosity in hosting nearly a million Rohingya refugees. Rather than hasty relocations that leave both Bangladesh and the Rohingya in further limbo, this protracted situation requires the local, international and Rohingya community to work together to find a sustainable solution.”  
Amnesty International is also calling for unfettered access to Bhashan Char for rights and humanitarian organizations to carry out independent assessments.   
Background  
Amnesty International interviewed five family members who represent 23 refugees on the list for relocation.  
In September 2020, Amnesty International released the briefing ‘Let Us Speak for our Rights’, which outlines how exclusion from decision-making is impacting the human rights of Rohingya refugees. The briefing includes a section on the conditions for Rohingya in Bhashan Char.   
A United Nations technical and protection assessment, which has been pending since November 2019, seeks to determine “safety and sustainability” of the island, “safety and security” of the humanitarian staff, “protection” of human rights of refugees, “sustainable livelihood” opportunities and “logistics & accessibility” with regards to food and supplies.

“Devastating though it has been, the COVID-19 pandemic has also brought out the best in people. We have witnessed countless acts of compassion and solidarity as people come together in their communities to help those most in need. Sadly, many governments have pursued the opposite course, detaining and persecuting people who stand up for human rights,” said Julie Verhaar, Acting Secretary General of Amnesty International.  
“We are at a crossroads – we can all choose to build a future which puts kindness, solidarity, tolerance and human rights at its core. Governments must use this moment to show that they can put right injustices by releasing prisoners of conscience, ending the persecution of human rights defenders, and upholding every person’s right to freedom of expression.”   
Write for Rights: The world’s biggest human rights campaign  
Every December, people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts and postcards for those whose human rights are under attack, in what has become the world’s biggest human rights event. The ten cases selected for Write for Rights 2020 include human rights defenders and individuals in Algeria, Burundi, Chile, Colombia, Malta, Myanmar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey.   
Jani Silva has been threatened with death for speaking up to protect land, water and human rights in Colombia’s Amazonian Pearl reserve. The South American country has witnessed an alarming increase in assassinations of defenders, many of them women, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amnesty International is calling for protection for Jani Silva and her organization so they can continue their vital work.   
“When we are protecting our ecosystem, we are not just doing it for ourselves,” says Jani. “Because I defend my territory, people have put a gun to my head to kill me. But we cannot run away.”  
In Saudi Arabia, Nassima al-Sada has been in prison for more than two years for her peaceful women’s rights advocacy. She was one of several prominent activists campaigning for women to have the right to drive and to carry out their daily lives without the permission of a male “guardian.” While Saudi Arabia has recently relaxed these guardianship laws, Nassima and other activists who campaigned to end the guardianship system remain behind bars.  
“Why should an under-age boy be the guardian of a woman who is an adult?” Nassima wrote in 2016. “Why isn’t there an age at which a woman becomes an adult, responsible for her decisions and her life? Why should there be a man responsible for her life?”  
Nassima was arrested for her peaceful human rights work in July 2018. While in jail, she was ill-treated. She was placed in solitary confinement for a year and denied access to visitors, including her children. She is now allowed one weekly phone call with her family, but no visits, not even from her lawyer. Amnesty International is urging Saudi Arabia to free Nassima and other women’s rights activists.  
Among the other cases are:  
Gustavo Gatica, a psychology student in Santiago, Chile who was struck in both eyes and left permanently blinded after attending a protest over rising inequality on 8 November 2019. Police violently repressed this protest, repeatedly opening fire on demonstrators with shotguns loaded with rubberized buck shots. Amnesty International is calling for a full investigation into the events that led to Gustavo being injured and for the commanders in charge to be held responsible.    
In Malta, three teenage boys from Ivory Coast and Guinea are in prison awaiting trial on baseless terrorism charges after acting as interpreters for the captain and crew of a Maltese tanker which came to rescue them – and more than 100 other migrants – from their sinking rubber boat. Amnesty International is demanding justice for the “El Hiblu 3” and calling for the charges against the youths (now aged 21, 18 and 16) to be dropped.  
Germain Rukuki, a Burundian human rights defender and prisoner of conscience serving a 32-year prison sentence. He was convicted on account of his human rights work. Amnesty International is calling for his immediate and unconditional release.   
METU LGBTI solidarity group, whose members face a prison sentence for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Turkey.  LGBTI students at the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara have been organizing an annual Pride march on campus for years without restrictions. In 2019, the peaceful event was broken up by police. Students and an academic were detained and beaten, and the case is now in court. Amnesty International is calling for the acquittal of all those who have been charged, an investigation into the excessive use of force by police, and for students to have the freedom to hold peaceful marches on campus.  
Idris Khattak from Pakistan, a researcher on enforced disappearances for Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, was – in a cruel twist – forcibly disappeared himself on 13 November 2019, and may now be charged with espionage. Amnesty International is calling for his immediate release.   
Campaign successes  
As seen in previous years, writing letters really does bring about change for the individuals whose cases are highlighted in Write for Rights, and also offers enormous emotional support and encouragement to them and their families.   
Nigerian teenager Moses Akatugba was arrested and sentenced to death when he was 15 years old, after being accused of stealing three phones. In 2019, he was released, after 800,000 Amnesty International supporters showed their support.   
“I was on death row because the police claimed I stole three phones,” says Moses. “But now I’m free, because people like you wrote letters to support me. After eight years in jail, and 800,000 letters from Amnesty International supporters all over the world, I was released. Those letters kept my fire burning. I am alive today because of these letters. So your letters can save a life.”  
In July 2020, a South Sudanese man had his death sentence quashed, due in part to Write for Rights. According to his testimony in court, Magai Matiop Ngong fired his father’s gun at the ground to warn off his cousin, who was trying to stop him fighting with another boy in his neighbourhood. The bullet ricocheted and hit his cousin, who later died in hospital. Magai, who was just 15 at the time, faced trial for murder without a lawyer. He was convicted and sentenced to death.  
Our research shows that the death penalty is disproportionately used against poor and disadvantaged people. According to international law, and South Sudanese law, sentencing a child to death is illegal.  
More than 765,000 people took action and wrote to the South Sudanese government expressing solidarity with Magai. The South Sudan Court of Appeal eventually quashed the death sentence imposed on Magai because he was a child at the time of the crime, and sent his case back to the High Court to rule on an appropriate sentence.  
“The power of individual action to save lives and hold governments to account must never be underestimated. Year on year we see the powerful impact that simply writing a letter or email can deliver,” said Julie Verhaar.  
“Write for Rights is all about individuals helping other individuals, and this way of expressing our shared humanity has never been more important and relevant. Governments must respond to this widespread desire for change by delivering justice to those whose human rights are being attacked.”  
Background  
Write for Rights mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people around the world to change the lives of individuals at risk through taking action. Last year over six and half million actions were taken – an annual increase for the 18th consecutive year. The case of Yasaman Aryani in Iran received over one million actions alone.   
The Write for Rights campaign will run from 20 November to 31 December 2020. For more information see here.

A few months later, I joined the Urgent Action network. I don’t think that I will ever forget the feeling of signing up. At that time, I wasn’t the type of person who committed to causes before discussing them with someone in my immediate circle. But Amnesty’s work resonated with me, and from what I could see, it was not like the other causes and charities I’d been interested in. The warm welcome that I received from the Urgent Action Network Coordinator went way beyond the automated reply that I’d been expecting, and proved that my decision to join had been a good one.   
After my introduction to Amnesty, I was able to participate in more letter-writing campaigns, and in 2018, I organized a Write for Rights event at my university. One of the folks who attended this event later invited me to apply to join the Thompson Rivers University Student’s Union Equity Committee. My application was accepted, and when I started working with this committee, I was excited to learn that the group wrote Urgent Action letters at their meetings. Since I hadn’t been able to generate much enthusiasm within my high school activism club when I suggested that we engage in human rights work, I was pleasantly surprised to see a strong interest in my university community.   
In the summer of 2020, I had the chance to join the National Organizers Program. Already, this has been a positive experience; I feel fortunate to be included in an online environment that focuses on human rights issues and activism techniques, among other topics. It is so rewarding to work with a diverse group of intelligent, humble, and inspiring activists who gently challenge me to expand my beliefs.    
Ever since a trail of magazine articles and internet browsing led me to Amnesty International, I’ve felt that the organization’s values match my own to a tee. The more I learn, the more I believe in Amnesty’s ability to address complex issues and gratuitous, unconscionable suffering. I think that Amnesty’ power lies in its commitment to human rights law, self-determination, and impartiality, along with its consistent compassion. I am grateful to Amnesty for providing me with inspiration, a sense of purpose, and access to a wealth of knowledge and wisdom. I can’t wait to find new ways of contributing!

G20 leaders attending this weekend’s virtual summit hosted by Saudi Arabia must take the Saudi authorities to task for their shameless hypocrisy on women’s rights, Amnesty International said today. Women’s empowerment features prominently on Saudi Arabia’s G20 Agenda, despite the fact the activists who spearheaded campaigns for women’s rights are languishing in jail or facing trial.  
Amnesty International is urging G20 leaders to join the call for the immediate and unconditional release of Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima al-Sada, Samar Badawi, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani, who were arrested in 2018 for their human rights work. 
“For Saudi authorities the G20 Summit is critical: it is a moment for them to promote their reform agenda to the world, and show their country is open for business. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s real reformers are behind bars” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Instead of playing along with the Saudi government’s whitewashed narrative, G20 leaders should use this summit as an opportunity to stand up for the brave activists whose genuine commitment to women’s empowerment has cost them their freedom.” 
In recent years, Saudi authorities have sought to reshape their image through expensive PR campaigns presenting Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a reformer. In June 2018 the ban on women driving was officially lifted, a much-publicized move which was presented as evidence of progress. Yet in the preceding weeks, many of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent advocates for women’s right to drive had been arrested and detained. 
Saudi Arabia’s real reformers 
Loujain al-Hathloul, one of Saudi Arabia’s most recognizable advocates for the right to drive, was arrested in a May 2018 crackdown on campaigners for women’s rights. She had previously been arrested in 2014 and detained for 73 days. After her release, Loujain al-Hathloul continued to campaign against the driving ban and the male guardianship system, before being arrested in May 2018 along with other women. She has remained in detention ever since, while the other women are still facing trial. 
Loujain al-Hathloul has been on hunger strike since 26 October, in protest at the authorities’ refusal to grant her regular contact with her family. She is reported to be feeling weak and exhausted and concerns for her health are growing. 
Nassima al-Sada and Samar Badawi were arrested in August 2018. Samar Badawi is an activist who campaigned vocally against the driving ban and against the imprisonment of her ex-husband, human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair, and her brother, blogger Raif Badawi. Nassima al-Sada has campaigned for civil and political rights, women’s rights and the rights of the Shi’a minority in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia for many years. 
Nouf Abdulaziz is a blogger and journalist who wrote about a range of human rights issues before her arrest in June 2018. Shortly after her arrest, fellow activist Maya’a al-Zahrani posted a blog calling for her release and was arrested herself a few days later.    
All five women remain in detention; some have been tortured, ill-treated and held in solitary confinement. 
Meanwhile, since assuming the G20 Presidency, the Saudi authorities have publicized new initiatives on women’s employment opportunities and claims in its Presidency Agenda that it is “strongly committed” to empowering women and girls. 
On 10 November the Saudi ambassador to the UK said authorities were considering clemency for the activists ahead of the summit, though this was dismissed by Loujain al-Hathloul’s sister as ‘a PR stunt’. 
“These women should not require ‘clemency’ – they have done nothing but peacefully exercise their rights,”  said Lynn Maalouf. 
Human rights – the missing chapter in Vision 2030 
In 2017 Saudi Arabia launched Vision 2030, a plan to diversify the economy and create more opportunities for women and young people 
Ahead of this week’s summit, a group of Saudi Arabian activists launched what they called a “People’s Vision for Reform,” outlining 13 human rights issues which they are calling on authorities to act on. Abdullah Alaoudh, one the initiators, described it as “the chapter that we think has been missing in the Saudi Vision 2030.” 
The “People’s Vision” calls for the release of all prisoners of conscience, as well as respect for women’s rights and migrants’ rights, abolition of the death penalty, and an end to violations of international law in Yemen. 
“This weekend Saudi authorities will talk up the reforms championed by imprisoned activists to garner business opportunities and political acclaim,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
“We are urging G20 leaders to speak up against this shameless hypocrisy. The activists who continue to fight for human rights in Saudi Arabia are the true voices for reform, and they should be listened to, not locked up.”

“The COVID-19 pandemic is a human rights crisis on an unprecedented scale. The U.S. government’s response to the pandemic has laid bare systemic disparities that have long undermined our human rights, including those to life and health, to and at work, to social security, and to be free from discrimination. From the very beginning, this crisis has affected everyone, but some have been hit much harder than others. Communities of color, frontline and low-wage workers, people with disabilities, older people, people who are undocumented, and those of us facing economic hardship are yet again dying and suffering in far greater numbers.  
“It didn’t have to be this way. The current administration must reverse course and refrain from disseminating false information minimizing the risks posed by the pandemic and undermining the importance of testing. It is paramount that it stops sending mixed signals about the importance of wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, and instead urgently implements evidenced-based strategies, including providing timely, accurate and accessible information and services to prevent the spread of the virus. 
“President Trump’s rejection of the results of the 2020 election and refusal to cooperate with President-Elect Biden’s team will effectively cost even more lives and worsen this human rights crisis. It’s long past time for Donald Trump as President of the United States to acknowledge the mobile morgues and miles-long food lines that are the manifestations of the pandemic’s devastation. He must do everything in his power to ensure the incoming administration can access the resources needed to facilitate an effective, rights-based COVID-19 response, and he must work with Congress to urgently pass a relief package.  
“Respect for human rights must not be a casualty of the current political situation. We call on President Trump and his administration to fulfill their human rights obligations under international law and cooperate with President-Elect Biden to protect the rights to health and to life, with special attention on the impact on those of us who have long faced discrimination, marginalization, and exclusion.”

On the anniversary of the deadliest day of the protests, Amnesty International is launching a new microsite, A web of impunity: The killings Iran’s internet shutdown hid, documenting how the lethal crackdown that left at least 304 people dead was hidden from the world. 
“When news of the deadly crackdown began to emerge from Iran last November, the world was shocked by the brutal violence of the security forces. The authorities deliberately blocked internet access inside Iran, hiding the true extent of the horrendous human rights violations that they were carrying out across the country,” said Diana Eltahawy, Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“The government thought they could silence the population by taking the country offline, but the Iranian people were determined to tell the world the truth. Our new website is a tribute to the courage of everyone who captured on camera the scenes of violence that the authorities wanted to keep hidden.” 
The microsite – a joint investigation between Amnesty International and The Hertie School, in partnership with the Internet Outage Detection and Analysis (IODA) project – features more than 100 verified videos from 31 cities, and reveals the repeated use of firearms, water cannons and tear gas by Iran’s security forces against unarmed protesters and bystanders. 
To date, no one has been criminally investigated or held accountable for the killings. Amnesty International is again calling on member states of the United Nations Human Rights Council to mandate an inquiry into the unlawful killings to ensure those responsible for ordering, planning and carrying out the crimes are brought to justice in fair trials. 
Protest crackdown and internet blackout 
On 15 November 2019, protests erupted across Iran following a government announcement of a significant increase in the price of fuel. During the five days of protests that followed, security forces killed at least 304 men, women and children. The victims were mostly killed with shots to the head or torso, indicating security forces were operating a shoot-to-kill policy. The real number of deaths is believed to be much higher, but the ongoing cover-up by Iranian authorities means the true death toll may never be known. 
On 16 November, authorities started to shut down the country’s internet. Amnesty International’s research shows that day was also the deadliest of the protests, with at least 100 protesters and bystanders killed. 
As protests intensified, the Iranian authorities implemented a near-total internet blackout by ordering different internet service providers (ISPs) to shut down. IODA observed steady drops in signals, which started when cellular operators were ordered to disconnect around 2pm local time on 16 November. By 7pm, Iran had descended into digital darkness. 
Iran’s domestic internet remained online, allowing activities such as government services and banking to continue, which minimized financial losses in the country’s economy. It was only around five days later, at approximately 10am on 21 November, that internet access began to be restored. It did not completely return until 27 November. 
Internet shutdowns and human rights                                                         
A shutdown happens when a state or another actor intentionally disrupts the internet for a specific population, or within a specific region. Shutdowns take a variety of forms. Authorities may slow down the internet to make access difficult, or they may order ISPs to shut down services completely. 
The UN Human Rights Committee has declared that “states…must not block or hinder internet connectivity in relation to peaceful assemblies”. However, many states have increasingly used internet shutdowns as a tool to stifle or silence dissent in recent years, particularly when faced with protests or uprisings. 
Since the November 2019 protests, internet access in Iran has been disrupted on several occasions during further protests. Organizing peaceful protests, speaking openly against state policies, and documenting human rights violations all heavily rely on the ability to access the internet, and are protected under international human rights law. 
Today, Amnesty International is also joining the #KeepItOn coalition, a partnership of more than 220 organizations campaigning against internet shutdowns. 
“Access to the internet is essential to protect human rights, especially in times of protest. The Iranian authorities must commit to never again taking the country offline, and must respect the right to peaceful protest,” said Sam Dubberley, Head of Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab.  
Uncovering the hidden killings 
Amnesty International first documented the use of lethal force against protesters in the days after the crackdown began, and recorded the details of at least 304 people killed in an investigation published in May 2020. 
The organization verified the deaths by collating evidence from videos and photographs, death and burial certificates, accounts from eyewitnesses, victims’ relatives, and friends and acquaintances on the ground, as well as information collected by human rights activists and journalists. 
Further research by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps found that in the vast majority of cases across the country, there was no evidence that protesters posed an imminent threat to life or threat of serious injury. As such, the intentional lethal use of firearms by the authorities was completely unwarranted and unlawful. 
Key data that Amnesty International has gathered is published on the microsite, including pictures of victims and details related to their cause and place of death, and can be downloaded in both English and Farsi. 
Amnesty International is again calling on the Iranian authorities to ensure that independent and impartial criminal investigations are conducted into every death during the November 2019 protests, as the first step towards ending impunity.

Idris Khattak, who has worked extensively to tackle enforced disappearance, including with Amnesty International, has not been seen or heard from since being abducted while on his way home from Islamabad to Peshawar on 13 November 2019. On 16 June 2020, more than six months after his disappearance and following a public campaign by his family, the Pakistani Ministry of Defence confirmed that Idris Khattak was in their custody and had been charged with treason under the Official Secrets Act (OSA) – a charge punishable by death. They also stated he would be tried in a military court.  
“A year after he was taken from them, Idris Khattak’s family remain completely in the dark about where he is being kept, his state of health, and the legal process he is being put through, if any. The Pakistani authorities must end this intolerable situation by disclosing his whereabouts and allowing him regular access to his family and lawyer,” said Omar Waraich, Head of South Asia at Amnesty International.  
“As with all enforced disappearance cases, Idris Khattak’s legal status has been shrouded in unacceptable secrecy. No information has been provided about the nature of the charges against him, whether he has legal representation, or even if his trial has started. As a first step, the Pakistani authorities must bring him before a judge in a civilian court to rule on the lawfulness of his arrest and detention.”  
Amnesty International has serious concerns about the use of a military court for the trial, given these courts’ disregard for due process, human rights and transparency. Moreover, the OSA is a law that can only be used to charge state officials, not civilians.   
Idris Khattak suffers from diabetes and back problems. It is unclear if he has had access to the medical care that he needs while in detention.   
“Following promises of a clampdown by the government, enforced disappearances remain an all-too-common occurrence in Pakistan. Despite an open admission from the authorities that Idris Khattak was abducted, those responsible have enjoyed complete impunity so far,” said Omar Waraich.  
“The Pakistani government must immediately make good on their pledge to criminalize this cruel practice.”  
Background  
On 13 November 2019, Idris Khattak was travelling as a passenger in a rented car which was intercepted near the Swabi Interchange of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. According to the application submitted by Idris Khattak’s family for the registration of the police case, four men in plain clothes put a black sack on the faces of Mr Khattak and the driver and took them to an undisclosed location. News of the abduction only became known when the driver was released on the night of 15 November.   
Despite an election promise by the current government, there has been no progress in ending the practice of enforced disappearance nor in criminalizing it. The Minister of Human Rights, Dr Shireen Mazari, tweeted in September that Prime Minister Imran Khan found the practice “unacceptable.” There has been no other movement, despite strong rebukes from the Islamabad High Court.

The meeting, two consecutive half-days over the course of November 9 and 10, marks only the third time in the past 32 years that ministers from across the country have come together to discuss human rights protection in Canada. Previous meetings were held in 1988 and 2017. This sporadic political attention to an intergovernmental human rights agenda in Canada is disgraceful and has long been a source of serious concern among civil society groups, Indigenous organizations, United Nations human rights bodies and parliamentary committees. 
In advance of and during this week’s meeting, groups had pressed governments to commit to nation-wide law reform that will legally require governments to adopt a collaborative, accountable, consistent, transparent, well-coordinated approach to effectively implementing international human rights obligations in Canada. People across the country require and deserve nothing less. No such commitment was made. 
Only one new concrete commitment emerged from this week’s meeting, the establishment of a Forum of Ministers on Human Rights, which will meet every two years. There had been no advance engagement with civil society about the Forum, or even notification of the intention to take this step. Civil society groups cautiously welcome this development and hope that it will provide the intergovernmental political leadership and coordination that has been so sorely lacking for decades in Canada. It is essential that the Forum include meaningful engagement with Indigenous Peoples’ organizations and civil society groups. With no further information as to its mandate or working methods, what the Forum will truly offer remains uncertain at this stage. 
Groups were particularly shocked that two provincial governments essentially boycotted this week’s meeting. The governments of Quebec and Alberta refused to send their responsible ministers to participate in the meeting and instead designated government officials to observe the proceedings. 
The politicized and groundless positions taken by these two governments, and their cavalier willingness to stay away from such an important meeting, in both instances sell human rights short, a particularly troubling stance given the serious human rights challenges in the country and how infrequently these meetings have occurred. 
In 2017, meeting for the first time in 29 years, ministers made several commitments to strengthen their collaboration in protecting human rights across Canada. The lack of meaningful progress since has been staggering and remains so after this week’s meeting: 
A  widely-endorsed proposal in April 2020 from 302 civil society groups, Indigenous peoples’ organizations and a broad spectrum of subject matter experts to federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments to institute meaningful human rights oversight of their COVID-19 responses has not been taken up by any government in the country. 
At the current meeting, Ministers discussed the human rights implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and agreed that it is “important that human rights principles be considered in the development of plans for a strong and equitable recovery from the pandemic for all Canadians” but in no way acknowledged or even referenced social and economic rights. The proposal for human rights oversight of COVID-19 responses was not addressed. 
In 2017 Ministers committed to consider moving towards acceding to three important international human rights treaties. Canada did subsequently become a party to one of those instruments, the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. But there appears to be no prospect of Canada becoming party to the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, which establishes crucial mechanisms for the prevention of torture, or the UN Convention on Enforced Disappearances at any point in the near future. At this week’s meeting ministers went no further than to reiterate that they are considering the possibility of accession to these treaties.  
Moreover, Canada has also still not ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, or any of the Organization of American States’ human rights treaties. There has been no public reporting as to why Canada has not ratified these treaties.  
In 2017 Ministers also committed to institute structural reforms to improve their coordination and collaboration in complying with the country’s international human rights obligations:  
That governments remain so reluctant and seemingly unable to reliably work together in taking up the collective responsibility they share to ensure that Canada’s international human rights obligations are consistently and effectively implemented is unfathomable. 
Canada’s haphazard and ineffectual approach to intergovernmental coordination in implementing human rights obligations is of twofold concern. First, it is clearly a serious problem domestically, as it undermines efforts to address grave and longstanding human rights violations. Second, it means that Canada’s global human rights diplomacy is weakened, making it impossible for our diplomats to encourage other nations to take steps that we have failed to take ourselves. 
Looking ahead, there are important human rights opportunities that federal, provincial and territorial governments, working with Indigenous Peoples’ organizations and civil society groups, must seize. For instance, 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the World Conference Against Racism and its Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and the 60th anniversary of the UN’s Refugee Convention. Also in 2021, Canada’s human rights record is slated for review by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. 
Many of our groups have made numerous presentations and recommendations at various meetings with governments over many years, laying out suggestions for improving their approach to implementing human rights. It has become clear that the solution does not lie in tweaks to what is already in place, but rather bold leadership to advance a truly transformative human rights agenda.

Relatives of COVID-19 patients, medical professionals and humanitarian workers have told Amnesty International that public hospitals have been forced to turn patients away due to a lack of beds, oxygen tanks and ventilators. In desperation, some residents have been forced to rent oxygen tanks and ventilators at exorbitant fees. Thousands of lives, including those of health workers, continue to be at risk with no transparent and effective information, or testing. 
“Syria’s crumbling health system was already at breaking point before the pandemic. Now, the government’s lack of transparency about the scale of the COVID-19 outbreak, its inadequate distribution of personal protective equipment, and lack of testing is further endangering health workers and the general population,” said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International’s Syria researcher. 
“As a matter of urgency, the Syrian government must ensure that health workers looking after COVID-19 patients are protected with adequate PPE and that they receive training on how to use this equipment. If the government does not have capacity, it should seek further support from international health organizations working in areas under its control.” 
The Syrian authorities appear to be significantly under-reporting COVID-19 counts. On 22 March, the Syrian government declared the first COVID-19 case.  As of 10 November, the Ministry of Health reported 6,352 cases of COVID-19, including 325 deaths. On 29 August, Ramesh Rajasingham, Acting Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Deputy Emergency Relief Coordinator, told the UN Security Council “reports of health care facilities filling up, of rising numbers of death notices and burials, all seem to indicate that actual cases far exceed official figures”. Mr. Rajasingham added that the cases could not be traced to a known source, which also indicated weak testing and surveillance systems to control outbreaks of the disease. 
Between August and October, Amnesty International spoke to 16 doctors, humanitarian workers, and family members of COVID-19 patients in Damascus and Daraa in Syria and outside the country. All testimonies indicate that the situation is worse than it was eight months ago. 
The Ministry of Health is not publishing information about the impact of COVID-19 on health workers; the only available information is what the ministry reports to the UN. As of October, a total of 193 health workers had tested positive for COVID-19 but evidence suggests that the number could be much higher due to a lack of testing. Eleven health workers are reported to have died of COVID-19, but Syria’s union of doctors have reported that at least 61 health workers had died of the disease as of August 2020. 
A crumbling health system 
The outbreak of COVID-19 has added more pressure on Syria’s health care system, which has been decimated by almost a decade of conflict. According to the World Health Organization, only 50% of hospitals across Syria are fully functioning, 25% are partially functioning due to a shortage of staff, equipment, medicines or damage to hospital buildings, while the remaining 25% are not functioning at all. 
While WHO and other Damascus-based international humanitarian organizations claim that they have provided the Syrian government with PPE, humanitarian workers told Amnesty International that the authorities have been extremely slow in its distribution for unknown reasons. 
Relatives of people infected in Damascus told Amnesty International that despite providing much better medical care than public hospitals, private facilities have had to turn away COVID-19 patients because the authorities are only allowing public hospitals in Damascus to treat COVID-19 patients. 
One doctor told Amnesty that after his grandfather showed COVID-19 symptoms around mid-July, his family took him to two public hospitals in Damascus but there weren’t any available beds. He died two weeks later. The doctor said: 
“The hospital only ran tests and told my family he would need an oxygen tank. With some difficulty, we managed to rent an oxygen tank but three days later he died. My family was barely able to pay for the oxygen tank because prices have significantly increased as more and more people are in need of oxygen tanks and ventilators.” 
Lack of transparency and access to testing  
Testing is key in understanding the scale of the outbreak and informing government policy. Likewise, the publishing of data is crucial so the public is informed and understands the scale of infections and its impact on society and the health sector. And yet, testing sites remain significantly limited in Syria. According to the UN, there are five laboratories to process COVID-19 tests for the 15 million people living in all of the areas under the government’s control. There continues to be no testing sites in Daraa and north-east Syria where infection rates have significantly increased in past months. 
In Daraa, residents and a doctor told Amnesty International that testing has not been available since June, and when testing was available the results took up to a week as all tests were sent to the Central Public Health Laboratory in Damascus for processing. In the north-east, the UN reported that cases are believed to be higher than 4,164 due to significant gaps in detection and testing capacity. 
The Ministry of Health publishes a daily data report on the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries; however, the data excludes the number of tests carried out per day. Relatives of people infected, humanitarian workers and a doctor in Damascus, told Amnesty International that testing is only available to people travelling outside Syria. 
In August, the Ministry of Health stated that the government was unable to conduct public testing due to “an unjust economic blockade imposed on the country, which affected the health sector.” A month later, it said it would be allocating 300 tests a day for people travelling outside Syria at a fee of $100 [around 51,000 Syrian pounds] when the average monthly salary is around 60,000 SYP. 
Two humanitarian workers told Amnesty International that the government’s low testing capacity is due to a lack of a coherent government policy to address the pandemic, lack of awareness about the importance of testing, and bureaucratic hurdles due to the centralization of decision-making. 
Amnesty International calls on the Syrian government to ramp up its public health response by ensuring adequate access to quality health care for all, and ensuring that health workers have access to necessary protective equipment. Moreover, the expansion and disclosure of accurate and up-to-date information about the spread of the virus is key to effectively address COVID-19.

Amnesty International can today confirm the that scores, and likely hundreds, of people were stabbed or hacked to death in Mai-Kadra (May Cadera) town in the South West Zone of Ethiopia’s Tigray Region on the night of 9 November. 
The organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab has examined and digitally verified gruesome photographs and videos of bodies strewn across the town or being carried away on stretchers. It confirmed the images were recent and using satellite imagery, geolocated them to Mai-Kadra in western Tigray state (14.071008, 36.564681). 
“We have confirmed the massacre of a very large number of civilians, who appear to have been day labourers in no way involved in the ongoing military offensive. This is a horrific tragedy whose true extent only time will tell as communication in Tigray remains shut down,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The government must restore all communication to Tigray as an act of accountability and transparency for its military operations in the region, as well as ensure unfettered access to humanitarian organizations and human rights monitors. Amnesty International will regardless continue to use all means available to document and expose violations by all parties to the conflict.” 
The organization has also spoken to witnesses, who were providing food and other supplies to the Ethiopian Defense Forces (EDF), who visited the town immediately after the deadly attack, on the morning of 10 November, to find dead bodies strewn all over the town, as well as injured survivors. 
Most of the dead bodies were found in the tow​n centre, near the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, and along a road that exits to the neighbouring Humera town, according to the witnesses and verified images. 
People who saw the dead bodies told Amnesty International that they had gaping wounds that appear to have been inflicted by sharp weapons such as knives and machetes, reports which have been confirmed by an independent pathologist commissioned by Amnesty International. Witnesses said there were no signs of gunshot wounds. 
The witnesses said that together with the EDF soldiers, they found some wounded people among the dead and took them to nearby hospitals in Abreha-Jira and Gondar, before removing dead bodies from the streets. 
“Those wounded told me they were attacked with machetes, axes and knives. You can also tell from the wounds that those who died were attacked by sharp objects. It is horrible and I am really sad that I witnessed this in my life,” one distraught witness said. 
‘Soaked in blood” 
Amnesty International has not yet been able to confirm who was responsible for the killings, but has spoken to witnesses who said forces loyal to the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) were responsible for the mass killings, apparently after they suffered defeat from the federal EDF forces. 
Three people told Amnesty International that survivors of the massacre told them that they were attacked by members of Tigray Special Police Force and other TPLF members. 
“There was a military operation by the EDF and Amhara Special Force against the Tigray Special Police and militia at a place called Lugdi during the daytime on 9 November. After they defeated the Tigray forces, the EDF spent the night on the outskirts of Mai-Kadra town. When we entered, we saw a lot of dead bodies, soaked in blood, on the streets and rental dormitories frequented by seasonal workers. The view was really debasing, and I am still in shock struggling to cope with the experience,” a civilian who entered the town after it was retaken by EDF told Amnesty International. 
This was corroborated by another who said: “We went to the town immediately after the army and the Amhara Special Force took control of Mai-Kadra town on 10 November around 10 am. The army entered … after encircling the town overnight. There was no exchange of fire for the army to take over the town. But when we entered the town, what we saw was devastating. The roads were strewn with dead bodies especially in the centre of the town, and on the road the connects the town to Humera.” 
“The Ethiopian authorities must immediately, thoroughly, impartially and effectively investigate this blatant attack on civilians and bring those responsible to justice in fair trials,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“TPLF commanders and officials must make clear to their forces and their supporters that deliberate attacks on civilians are absolutely prohibited and constitute war crimes. All parties in the Tigray conflict must ensure full respect for international humanitarian law and human rights law in their operations.  The safety and protection of civilians must be paramount.” 
While the official death toll in Mai-Kadra is not yet known, the Amhara regional government’s media agency AMMA reported there were around 500 victims, adding that they were primarily non-Tigrayan residents of the town. A man who is helping to clear the bodies from the streets told Amnesty International that he had looked at the state-issued identification cards of some victims, and most were Amhara. 
Background 
On 4 November 2020, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered the Ethiopian Defence Forces (EDF) to militarily engage with the Tigray Regional Paramilitary Police and militia loyal to the Tigray People Liberation Front (TPLF) in what he stated was a response to multiple attacks by the Tigray security forces on the EDF North Command base in Mekelle and other military camps in Tigray Region. 
Since the start of the conflict, there have been armed confrontations between federal forces (Federal Army, Amhara Region’s Special Force Police and Amhara local militia) on one side and the Tigray regional forces (Tigray Special Force Police and militia) on the other side. 
The Ministry of Defence and the Prime Minister have announced that Ethiopian Air Force planes carried out multiple air strikes against TPLF military installations. The Prime Minister and the Army Chief of Staff pledged to continue air strikes on selected targets without endangering civilian life, advising residents to stay away from ammunition depots and other military targets.  
According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 11 November, some 7,000 refugees had fled western Tigray state into neighbouring Sudan.

Because that boot stretches into the Mediterranean Sea, it’s a point closest to Libya. So people fleeing violence in Libya try to cross the Mediterranean to safety in Italy.  
But many of the boats are not safe and don’t make it to shore. The passengers need to be rescued. 
In 2016 and 2017, Italy’s government felt there were too many refugees and migrants trying to enter Italy. They didn’t like how the rescue boats were bringing so many people to safety. 
One of the boats is the Iuventa (pronounced u-wenta). It had a crew of 10 people from Germany, Britain, Spain and Portugal. The “iuventa 10” crew felt it was more important to rescue refugees and migrants in danger of dying in the Mediterranean Sea than to listen to the wishes of the Italian government. Do you agree with them? 
The Iuventa managed to rescue 14,000 people. But all that stopped on August 2, 2017. That’s when the government seized the ship and accused the “iuventa 10” of helping refugees and migrants to enter Italy.  
For three years, the “iuventa 10” have been waiting for charges. For three years, they have been waiting to start rescuing people again. 
Amnesty International has examined the actions in 2016 and 2017 of the “iuventa 10”. Other experts from an organization called Forensic Architecture has done the same. Neither says the crew is guilty of a crime. Both organizations believe the Iuventa and its crew should return to their life-saving work. 
Let’s help them do that by sending an urgent message. Your letter could be a life saver!

Jessica Silva and her husband Jaime Torres were driving through Delicias, a town in the northern state of Chihuahua, late on 8 September when members of Mexico’s National Guard attacked them. 
That afternoon they had joined thousands of agricultural workers in a tense protest at La Boquilla, a nearby dam, to defend their right to water. The National Guard fired tear gas at the demonstrators, who were armed with bats, poles and rocks. Undeterred, the protesters managed to seize control of the dam, forcing the soldiers to retreat.  
As Silva and Torres made their way home that night, members of the National Guard opened fire on their vehicle. A witness told Amnesty International he saw two National Guard trucks pass by and heard five or six gunshots. Torres, a walnut and alfalfa farmer, was seriously wounded, while Silva, a 35-year-old homemaker and agricultural worker with three teenage children, died instantly. 
Founded last year, the National Guard was supposed to herald an end to the militarized approach to public security that left an estimated 200,000 people dead and tens of thousands missing under Mexico’s last two governments. Upon inspecting a barracks in February 2020, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador declared it a “very important new institution to guarantee peace, but without excesses, without authoritarianism, respecting human rights.” 
The early signs suggest this has not been the case. The new force was unable to stop Mexico registering record numbers of murders last year and it stands accused of hundreds of human rights violations, including killing Silva and wounding her husband. 
The National Guard initially said it had “repelled [an] attack” by “armed civilians in several vehicles” but Torres has denied he was carrying a weapon. Neither victim appeared to be armed in a photo that showed Torres behind the wheel, blood soaking his white t-shirt, with Silva’s body slumped beside him, her black facemask still covering her face. 
Luis Rodríguez Bucio, the head of the National Guard, later said it was “a disgraceful, unfortunate accident” and on 27 October the National Guard admitted there was “evidence that suggests the guilt of some members of our institution”. The same day, the federal attorney general’s office announced that it had arrested six members of the force and charged them with homicide and attempted homicide. 
“It’s not fair that people who are supposed to protect their safety have taken [Jessica’s] life and almost killed Jaime,” Silva’s aunt, Alma Rodríguez, told Amnesty International. “They took the life of a wonderful, hard-working person, someone who was not a criminal, who didn’t steal or kill, whose only defect was having gone to protest to stand up for her rights.”

There is ample evidence that the deployment of military forces has coincided with an increase in human rights violations and in levels of violence across Mexico. A 2016 government survey found that the armed forces are more likely to abuse detainees than Mexico’s federal, state or municipal police, with 88 percent of people detained by the Navy and 86 percent of those arrested by the Army complaining of torture or other ill-treatment. 
Instead of fulfilling his pledge to return the armed forces to their barracks, López Obrador has extended their role in enforcing public security until 2024 and entrusted them with pet projects such as building a new airport for Mexico City and parts of a controversial tourist train connecting Mayan ruins. The government has also deployed the armed forces to aid Mexico’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and announced plans to hand control of the nation’s ports and customs to the Army and the Navy. 
The National Guard was born into this context of militarization. Although an amendment to Mexico’s Constitution established that it must be “civilian in nature”, it is an overwhelmingly militarized force. Led by the former general Rodríguez Bucio, its members are armed with Mexican-made FX-05 Xiuhcoatl assault rifles and Sig Sauer 9mm pistols, and ride Chevrolet pickups backed by Black Hawk helicopters. 
In response to reports that the government had handed operational control of the National Guard to the military in October, Mexico’s Secretariat of National Defense told Amnesty International they “work in a coordinated manner in response to the specific situation in each state” and that the armed forces can only carry out “public security tasks in an extraordinary, regulated, controlled, subordinate and complementary manner” for a period of five years “while the National Guard develops its structure, capacities and territorial implementation”. 
Yet doubts remain over whether it is a truly “civilian” force. 
“Past experience shows it’s dangerous for the military to operate without civilian oversight,” says Sam Storr, a consultant with the Citizen Security Program at Mexico’s Ibero-American university, who warns that the National Guard has not fulfilled its legal obligations in terms of making information public, in particular regarding how many of its troops are still employed by the armed forces. 
As of July 2020, the National Guard was comprised of approximately 90,000 troops, of whom 51,101 had transferred from the Army, 10,149 from the Navy and 26,376 from the now-defunct Federal Police, according to an investigation by Animal Político. The Army and Navy had been responsible for all recruitment and continued to pay the wages of their former members who joined the National Guard. Only 20 percent of members and just 0.3 percent of new recruits had reportedly passed background checks and been trained and certified to carry out police work. 
“The wider context here is the lack of investment in good police forces and the lack of strong civilian institutions in Mexico, and this is only going to worsen the problem over time, so that takes the country in potentially a very dangerous trajectory,” Storr warns. 
While the armed forces are often portrayed as less corruptible than Mexico’s police – a narrative weakened by the arrest of the former National Defence Secretary, General Salvador Cienfuegos, in the United States in October – the National Guard has already been implicated in multiple scandals. Its members have been exhibited extorting an alleged drug trafficker in Sonora, dining with alleged members of criminal groups in Puebla, misusing firearms in an apparent state of inebriation in Jalisco, and inviting sex workers to a party at a barracks during the COVID-19 lockdown in Guanajuato. 
 
Mexico’s ombudsman’s office, the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH), logged at least 219 complaints about the National Guard between 26 May 2019, when the force was formally established, and August 2020. These included allegations of 51 arbitrary arrests, 28 cases of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, three cases of torture, two unlawful killings and two enforced disappearances. 
Yet experts say it’s difficult to ascertain the full number of human rights violations that the National Guard is committing due to a lack of transparency from the authorities, the absence of a specialist independent watchdog, the fact that victims are often afraid to denounce security forces for fear of reprisal, and the dangers that inhibit journalism in parts of the country. 
Lucia Chavez, a researcher at the non-governmental Mexican Commission for the Defense and Protection of Human Rights (CMDPDH), says the actual number is likely much higher, particularly in states that have experienced high levels of violence like Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Durango, where few complaints are typically made due to “distrust in the authorities and the ombudsman figure”. 
The National Guard also faces reduced accountability after the Mexican government passed a National Law on the Use of Force last year that did not restrict the use of lethal force or require that it only be used as a last resort in order to protect life, or even mention the need to protect third parties. 
Although by no means complete, the information available in the press is enough to set alarm bells ringing over the National Guard’s use of lethal force. As of late September 2020, media reports compiled by the CMDPDH since 2019 indicated that 11 members of the National Guard had died in 128 violent confrontations in which 178 alleged criminals or bystanders were killed, as well as 11 members of other state security forces. In the troubled states of Guanajuato, Michoacán and Tamaulipas alone, the National Guard reportedly suffered four deaths in 52 confrontations that left 84 alleged criminals or bystanders dead, along with one police officer and two Navy personnel. 
While this may appear like evidence of the efficiency or superiority of the National Guard, experts from the group Lethal Force Monitor have established that if there are 10 or more deaths for every member of the security forces killed in confrontations “this constitutes a clear indication of excessive use of force”. 
Although ostensibly created to improve public security, the National Guard’s most visible role to date has been in stopping Central American migrants and asylum seekers from traveling up through Mexico to the United States. 
The CNDH has denounced the deployment of the National Guard to enforce immigration law before Mexico’s Supreme Court, arguing that it is unconstitutional, will cause multiple human rights violations and effectively criminalizes migration and perpetuates xenophobic conduct. Meanwhile, the force has raided migrant shelters, harassed migrant rights defenders and used tear gas while arresting hundreds of migrants who crossed Mexico’s southern border in January. 
In one incident, on 23 March, about 20 members of the National Guard entered the Siglo XXI migrant detention center in Tapachula, a small, steamy city in the southern state of Chiapas. Dozens of Central American migrants and asylum seekers had started protesting and asking to be released for fear of contracting COVID-19 while locked up there. 
Flanked by Mexican immigration agents, the National Guard allegedly assaulted the migrants over several hours, stripping some of them naked and attacking them with their shields, fists, boots, hoses, fire extinguishers, pepper spray, Tasers, bats and knuckledusters, according to transcripts of interviews that the Fray Matías de Córdova Human Rights Center conducted with witnesses and shared with Amnesty International. 
“They dragged them by their hands, by their feet, naked, with their faces disfigured and beaten, broken even… they threw them to the floor and started beating them with their fists and electrocuting them,” said one Honduran man. “I’ll never forget the screams of those people, as I watched them vomiting blood.” 
Another man, who had fled his home in Guatemala after surviving an attempt on his life, said he almost suffocated from the pepper spray and felt scarred by the brutality he witnessed: “I’d never experienced anything of that magnitude, violence of that kind.” 
Eventually the National Guard dragged a group of migrants onto a bus and drove them away, without revealing their destination. Salvador Lacruz from the Fray Matías Center says he eventually learned that they were transferred to other migrant detention centers in the states of Chiapas, Tabasco and Veracruz. Lacruz says the witnesses’ testimony is “evidence of torture and ill-treatment”, while other local human rights groups suggested the abuses fit the definition of enforced disappearance under international human rights law, given that authorities refused to reveal their location or destination during the events. 
On another occasion, when the CMDPDH’s asylum coordinator Daniela Reyes visited the migrant detention center in Hermosillo, in the northern state of Sonora, last December she was struck not only by the severe overcrowding and oppressive heat, but also by the detainees’ reluctance to speak to her and her colleagues. Migrants at other detention centers had always been quick to approach them, Reyes told Amnesty International, but in Hermosillo she found they had been silenced by a culture of fear and intimidation. 
As the migrants began to open up, they told her the National Guard had beaten, threatened and pointed their firearms at them during an inspection of the facility, in retaliation for starting protests or hunger strikes to denounce their living conditions. The violence was gendered, with 13 women, mostly from Cameroon and Central America, telling Reyes that members of the force sexually assaulted them.  
“We gathered their testimony on the first day, but when we came in the next day, they wouldn’t even look at us. They didn’t want to talk,” Reyes says. “Finally, one person told us that members of the National Guard had come in that morning and physically attacked the people that agents of the National Migration Institute had identified as having talked to us.” 
The CMDPDH is also representing several migrants who say they suffered torture and threats of enforced disappearance at the hands of the National Guard in Mexico City’s Las Agujas migration detention center in October 2019 and February 2020. 
Mexico’s Secretariat for Security and Citizen Protection did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations against the National Guard, which, combined with its militarized nature and the lack of transparency and civilian oversight, contrast with the president’s proclamations about the nature and significance of the force. 
After 18 months in operation, there is little to suggest that the National Guard represents a change to Mexico’s security strategy or a new era of respect for human rights.

The away-game jersey features the iconic image of a family fleeing, with the words ‘Refugees Welcome’. It also features the famous ‘Love Football, Hate Racism’ slogan. 
Amnesty International Ireland launched its partnership with Bohemian FC in early 2020, which captured media headlines and went viral on social media. The jersey also went on to become a best-seller, with people ordering it from over 40 countries around the world, from China to the British Virgin Islands. 
Now Amnesty International branches around the world are joining in to support the jersey’s launch in EA Games’ updated FIFIA 2021. FIFA 2021 is played by more than 45 million people, giving the local club in Dublin Ireland a truly global audience. 
Colm O’Gorman, Executive Director of Amnesty International Ireland, called on gamers around the world to embrace the message. 
“Gamers and football fans are powerful communities, with a huge reach. The response to the jersey in Ireland was incredible. We’re hoping the gaming community take it global now. 
“In a time when global leaders are demonising refugees, stoking fear and hatred against people fleeing for their lives, it’s up to every community to take responsibility and fight back. 
“The tragic drownings in the Mediterranean sea, and recently in the UK channel, show that anti-refugee rhetoric leads to policies that cost people their lives. It turns communities against one another, and breaks down our common humanity. So while the ‘Refugees Welcome’ message is straightforward, it is powerful.” 
In gameplay, when you select Bohemian FC as your team, the update to FIFA 2021 includes the option to choose the football clubs away-jersey which features the logos. 
Daniel Lambert,  Chief Operating Officer for Bohemian FC, said: 
“Our ethos has always been that football brings people together, brings communities together, brings nations together. Football is a universal language that should always unite and never divide. 
“By playing with Bohemian FC in FIFA 2021 you represent these values; values of equality, inclusion and acceptance.” 
Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English Section), said: 
“We salute this incredible partnership between Amnesty International, Bohemian FC and EA Games, which will allow the message of unity, anti-racism and welcoming refugees to resonate among human rights advocates, gamers, and football fans alike.”

The organizations, including Amnesty International Canada’s English- and French-speaking sections, learned late last week that the Alberta and Quebec governments will send observers to the meeting, instead of their ministers responsible for human rights. The Quebec government has made it clear that it opposes plans to reference “systemic racism” in a joint media release that will be issued following the meeting, while the Alberta government refuses to recognize that Canada’s international human rights obligations are binding on the province. 
The Federal, Provincial and Territorial ministers responsible for human rights will be meeting, virtually, to discuss their collective responsibility to ensure that the human rights of all people are protected across the country. This is only the third meeting of its kind in the past 32 years, with the other meetings having taken place in 1988 and 2017. 
In advance of the meeting, the group of civil society organizations that took part in the 2017 meeting have written the attached letter to Ministers highlighting the crucial importance of advancing the commitments they made at that time to improve their record of implementing and complying with Canada’s international human rights obligations. Progress to date has been slow and disappointing. Some of those groups will also take part in a limited panel discussion and question and answer session with ministers on November 10. 
Representatives from civil society groups will be available to provide reaction to the outcome of the meeting when it concludes at the end of the afternoon on November 10.

“Over the weekend, the security forces under the command of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka escalated reprisals against peaceful dissent and took the human rights crisis in Belarus to a new level, with gruesome footage of riot police beating unarmed demonstrators and officers shoving elderly people into police vans. 
“These acts add weight to the already heavy dossier of government violations of human rights, including unlawful use of force, arbitrary mass arrests, torture and ill-treatment of people who speak out against Lukashenka’s government. Hundreds of those arrested face up to 15 days of administrative detention, which can be applied multiple times amounting to lengthy imprisonment intended to silence and intimidate. 
“Hundreds of thousands of Amnesty International supporters around the globe are demanding that the Belarusian authorities stop repression and start respecting human rights. We as a global movement will make sure that those who commit human rights violations against peaceful protesters or give the orders – will one day face justice.”

Background 
According to the human rights group Viasna, security forces detained at least 1,053 people over the weekend in Minsk and other major Belarusian cities as protesters turned out on the streets for the 14th consecutive Sunday. At least nine journalists were detained while reporting, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 
In Minsk, the police prevented the formation of a single column. The protesters were split in several separate groups that were actively chased by the police. The detentions continued in Minsk in the evening after the protests ended. According to eyewitnesses and video footage, police used indiscriminatory force and beat protesters and bystanders.

0,Tunisia: Freedom of expression at risk as prosecutions rise,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/tunisia-freedom-of-expression-at-risk-as-prosecutions-rise/,"The Tunisian authorities must immediately stop exploiting largely outdated, overly broad and repressive laws to prosecute individuals for exercising their right to freedom of expression online, said Amnesty International in a detailed briefing and campaign launched today. Amnesty International...","The Tunisian authorities must immediately stop exploiting largely outdated, overly broad and repressive laws to prosecute individuals for exercising their right to freedom of expression online, said Amnesty International in a detailed briefing and campaign launched today. 
Amnesty International found that at least 40 bloggers, administrators of widely followed Facebook pages, political activists and human rights defenders have face criminal prosecution between 2018 and 2020 simply for publishing online posts critical of local authorities, the police or other state officials.  
“It is extremely disturbing to see bloggers and activists being targeted with criminal prosecutions under laws that date back to the time of repression in Tunisia ten years after the revolution, for simply posting their views on Facebook. Instead of trying to muzzle criticism, the Tunisian authorities should uphold the right of each and every person to express themselves freely and safely without fear of reprisals,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“These prosecutions threaten the human rights progress made so far in Tunisia where the right to freedom of expression is a hard-won value of the revolution. We call upon the legislative authorities to prioritize reforming all largely outdated and overly broad laws that allow repression to prevent further backsliding and to fully comply with Tunisia’s obligations to uphold the right to freedom of expression.” 
While most of these cases did not lead to a prison sentence, the summons for interrogation, the indictments and the trials themselves on charges that carry prison sentences amount to harassment and intimidation of people who express critical opinions about a public official and will have a chilling effect.  
Whilst Tunisia is perceived as the only success story of the Arab uprisings and has been hailed for fostering a safe environment for all kinds of expression, the Ministry of Interior now openly threatens to prosecute people for legitimate criticism of police conduct and there has been a steady increase of prosecutions for Facebook posts that reveal cases of alleged corruption, criticize the authorities, or are deemed to “insult” officials online. 
Amnesty International calls on the Tunisian authorities to protect freedom of expression in Tunisia by dropping all charges against individuals being investigated or prosecuted for their peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression, ordering a halt to all criminal prosecutions of expression offences and instructing state officials to stop initiating or threatening such prosecutions. 
The organization also calls on Tunisian parliamentarians to prioritize reforming laws including the Telecommunications Code and Penal Code provisions that criminalize or otherwise limit legitimate expression and to treat defamation as a civil offense only. 
Growing intolerance of criticism 
Over the past two years, Tunisian authorities have displayed decreasing tolerance towards those who criticize public officials or institutions and have increasingly initiated prosecutions of bloggers and Facebook users for expressing views that are deemed “insulting” or “disrespectful”. 
The Ministry of Interior, security forces unions and local authorities have over the past two years increasingly threatened prosecutions, at times in response to criticism of police conduct or campaigns calling for accountability. 
On 18 October 2019, the Ministry of Interior issued a statement announcing that it would “take legal action against those who intentionally offend, question, or attribute false allegations to its departments.” The same statement went on to claim that “recent repeated statements by people of different affiliations and qualities in some websites and in the media are considered dangerous and can jeopardize the security institution.” 
In October 2020 alone, at least five activists were summoned for investigation for criticizing security forces online in the context of a campaign against a bill that enforces impunity.  
According to Amnesty International’s findings, the provisions most often used to prosecute online speech come under the Tunisian penal code, the Telecommunications Code and the Decree-law 115 on the Freedom of the Press. 
For example, on 7 October 2020, anti-impunity activist Myriam Bribri received a summons from the Judicial Police in Sfax after she posted a critical opinion of the police on Facebook. The next day she went in for questioning over a complaint from the secretary general of a Security Forces Union in Sfax, accusing her of ”insulting the police.” 
International human rights law does not recognize “insult” as a legitimate offense and deems it to be speech protected by freedom of expression. 
Myriam Bribri was arrested and held in custody before being transferred to court on the same day to face charges under Article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, which imposes a prison sentence of up to two years for the use of telecommunications networks to “intentionally harm others or disturb their peace.” Myriam Bribri said she had to wait for at least two hours in court before her lawyers were told that her trial will start that afternoon. The judge accepted a request by Myriam s lawyer to postpone the hearing and she was provisionally released. Myriam is is scheduled to appear again before the court on 14 December 2020. 
Similarly, on 6 October 2020, Imed Ben Khoud, a civil society activist from Kerouane, shared a cartoon by an anonymous cartoonist on Facebook depicting police officers as “dogs” and the Tunisian Interior Ministry building as a “doghouse”. On 12 October, he was arrested by the national guard and questioned in relation to the same charges under the Telecommunications Code. He was released without charges later the same day, but the investigation remains open. 
Local officials have also used Penal Code provisions to prosecute individuals criticizing them, such as the case of blogger Anis Mabrouki. On 13 April, Anis Mabrouki posted a video on his Facebook page showing a crowd of people standing in front of the building of the closed mayor’s office in Tebourba (a town 30 km from the capital Tunis), demanding financial aid which had been promised by the government amid the COVID-19 lockdown. He criticized local authorities’ disregard for people in need and accused the mayor of failing to properly manage aid distribution. The next day, he received a summons from the authorities after the mayor pressed charges against him. On 15 April, Anis Mabrouki was charged with “causing noises and disturbances to the public” and “accusing public officials of crimes related to their jobs without furnishing proof of guilt” under Penal Code Articles 316 and 128. Anis was arrested and spent two weeks in pre-trial detention until the Court of First Instance of Manouba city acquitted him on 30 April. 
Amnesty International’s campaign calls on the Tunisian authorities to stop prosecuting individuals for exercising their legitimate right to peaceful expression and to reform laws that represent a threat to freedom of expression in Tunisia.

Workers in the home delivery business were already facing precarious labor conditions before the COVID-19 pandemic. A lack of basic protections for ‘gig economy’ workers in warehouses and home delivery roles has taken on a new urgency as the very workers who ensure that food, medicines, and other essential goods are shipped out on time and delivered to your door are exposed to greater risks to their own health and safety.   
Amnesty’s new global campaign calls on the most powerful companies in the home delivery sector, starting with Amazon, to guarantee the rights of workers, including health, safety, and labor rights, such as the right to join a union.   
Why Amazon?   
Since the start of the pandemic, Amazon has become the most used consumer-facing platform in the world, delivering essential goods, in some case partnering with governments for the delivery of COVID-19 test kits for frontline workers, such as the UK, protective personal equipment (PPE) to health authorities, hospitals and other government agencies, such as in Canada, as well and non-essential goods to people’s homes.     
Amazon has done very well for itself since the start of the pandemic, seeing its profits soar over the last eight months. And yet, the company’s COVID-19 response has been plagued by scandals in relation to its treatment of workers. In most of the locations where it operates, Amazon faces allegations of union busting, treating its workers like machines and recklessness towards their health and safety.  
Workers’ right to unionize is a human right. Respecting this right is an obligation, not a choice. Amazon should know better! 
For the next 4 weeks, join Amnesty International in calling on Amazon to protect the health and safety of workers and to respect their labour rights.   
Public statement: It is time for Amazon to respect workers’ right to unionize

As we follow the crest of the second wave, and on the eve of the annual flu season, concerns are rising over the new pressures that will come to bear on the health care system. The vital healthcare workers across the health systems from long term care homes to hospitals and all in between have already faced unprecedented pressures and risks since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was clearly outlined in the International Council of Nurses (ICN) Report highlighting the alarming burden of disease and deaths from COVID-19 which discussed collected data globally in mid-August, 2020. It found that of the 52 national nursing associations in 50 countries, the infection rates for healthcare workers ranged from 1% to 30 % of all COVID-19 cases. The average rate was 10%. An alarming statistic from the study revealed “across 44 countries, there were 1097 deaths among nurses with the possibility of the actual deaths being much higher.” 
In Canada, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) released their report in September 2020. The data was collected as of July 23rd of this year and was done with assistance from the Canadian Nurses Association and the Canadian Medical Association. The report “COVID-19 cases and deaths among health care workers in Canada”, demonstrated: 
Both the ICN and the CIHI reports discuss that aside from the risk of infection, healthcare workers, direct-care support and other health team members including custodial staff are subject to verbal harassment, violence and discrimination due to their association with COVID-19.  They also suffer from psychological harm, mental health distress and burn out which in turn could negatively impact patients in their environments. Howard Catton ICN CEO said, “Governments around the world have been slow or failed to protect nurses or others from the effects of the pandemic…” (ICN Press information). Mike Villeneuve, the Canadian Nurses Association’s (CAN) CEO echoes this concern with respect to Canadian nurses and other health care workers. 
The ICN and the CNA both call on all governments to sign the WHO Health Worker Safety Charter which was launched on World Patient Safety Day, September 17, 2020. The Charter contains many of the ICN reports recommendation including safe staffing levels, having all the equipment need to do the job safely (including PPE), open communication in the workplace and reducing work-related stress. 
To add to the unsafe environments being created during this pandemic, many healthcare providers and healthcare workers do not feel comfortable speaking up about them; neither do their patients. With the increased pressures and challenges come the increased risk of safety incidents. When healthcare providers are physically, mentally and psychologically distressed incidents such as medication errors and other miscommunications rise. 
Without ensuring the health and safety across health services by creating a culture of safety in health with accessible and accepted methods of reporting unsafe practices and preventing them, the rights of all workers and their patients will continue to be compromised.  Workers’ and patients’ lives will continue to be put at risk.  
Healthcare workers have and will continue to play a critical role in this pandemic. The reports and recommendations are there to protect those vital workers who were so much lauded months ago. While people made wonderful outpourings of respect, recognition and appreciation for their sacrifices, these same workers need to be protected, upheld, and supported by their workplaces as well as by the provincial/territorial and national governments. The reports and data are out there, best practices have been established, what is needed now is for concrete demonstrations of supporting, protecting and defending the rights of all levels of healthcare workers.

An 18- year old holding refugee status in France beheaded the teacher allegedly because he had shown his students some cartoons depicting the prophet Mohammed. 
On 29 October, three people were killed in a church in Nice. The main suspect is a 21-year old Tunisian national. The authorities have arrested another person who is suspected of being an accomplice. Amnesty International condemns the murders in the strongest possible terms. All our thoughts are with the families of the victims. 
French authorities have legal obligations to carry out a prompt, thorough, independent, impartial, transparent and effective investigation into the murders. Anyone suspected of being responsible should be brought to justice and judged following a fair trial. Regrettably, following the murders, the French Minister of Interior Gérald Darmanin, made announcements that raise concerns regarding the authorities’ willingness to comply with the country’s international human rights obligations. 
In the context of a hearing before the National Assembly on 2 November, the Minister provided further details regarding the government’s counter-terror measures. 
Amnesty International is concerned that the measures violate the principles of non-discrimination, non-refoulement, and the right to freedom of association.

“The Belarusian authorities clearly fear freedom of peaceful assembly in the country, and are now criminalizing it wholesale, by attempting to prosecute 231 detained protesters in one single case. The protesters called their rally on Sunday a March against Terror, and now they are being intimidated by the authorities even further.  
“By officially calling hundreds of participants of a peaceful demonstration criminals, the Belarusian authorities show their deep disdain for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This criminal case is utterly absurd and sets a dangerous precedent. It must be immediately dropped.  
“We call on world governments to respond to the vicious cycle of oppression and deepening injustice in Belarus by putting pressure on the country’s authorities to ensure that human rights are respected and that all Belarusians can freely exercise their rights and freedoms – without these kinds of ugly reprisals.”  
Background  
On Monday, the Investigative Committee of Belarus opened a criminal case accusing 231 people detained during Sunday’s peaceful protest rally in Minsk of “organizing or preparing  activities that gravely breach public order” (part 1 of Article 342 of the Criminal Code of Belarus, a crime punishable by up to three years of imprisonment).    
According to the investigation, the suspects took part in an “unauthorized action”, which caused damage to “city infrastructure and a police vehicle” and “obstructed the public transportation and the work of organizations.”   
Following overwhelmingly peaceful protests on Sunday, at which there were isolated scuffles between police and protestors the authorities have responded by orchestrating a campaign of mass arrests, disproportionately arresting about 300 people.

It was on October 24, 2018 that community leader and forest defender Julián Carrillo was shot dead. The assassination came just a week after Julian spoke out against the environmental impacts of a mining concession awarded by authorities to a Canadian mining company without the free, prior and informed consent of the Indigenous people whose lands would be impacted. 
The killing of Julián Carrillo is no isolated case. A shocking number of defenders of land, Indigenous territory and the environment have been killed in Mexico. Many others have received death threats and must decide whether to abandon their efforts to protect rights and the environment, or live in constant fear of being gunned down. 
This crisis is largely invisible, despite the election of President López Obrador, who promised to bring human rights change to Mexico. Violence and injustice continue, especially when communities speak out against resource extraction projects they say will damage their land and the environment.

The attack on Gawa Qanqa village in Guliso District of West Wellega Zone took place just a day after Ethiopian Defense Forces troops withdrew from the area unexpectedly and without explanation. Witnesses said dozens of men, women and children were killed, property looted and what the militants could not carry away, they set on fire. 
“This senseless attack is the latest in a series of killings in the country in which members of ethnic minorities have been deliberately targeted. The fact that this horrendous incident occurred shortly after government troops abruptly withdrew from the area in unexplained circumstances raises questions that must be answered,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The Ethiopian authorities must investigate what happened and prosecute those responsible for the attack through fair trials.” 
Amnesty International spoke to some of the survivors of the heinous attack who escaped death by hiding in a nearby forest. They said that the attackers had identified themselves as OLA and said that they “controlled” the area as soon as government troops left on 31 October. 
The survivors said they had counted 54 bodies in a school compound where the militants gathered people who did not manage to flee, mainly women, children and the elderly, and killed them. One man told Amnesty International that three of his relatives were killed – his father, his sister and his wife’s grandfather. Another said he lost his brother, sister-in-law and three children including nephews and cousins. Their bodies were found in the school grounds with bullet wounds. 
“The Ethiopian government must step up its efforts to end armed attacks on minority groups and protect their lives and stop the destruction of homes, not only in Oromia, but across the country,” said Deprose Muchena.

The Summit brought together some of the wealthiest and most powerful countries in the world, including Canada, to address global issues. We let Canada and other G20 member states know that if they didn’t make women’s rights and freedoms their business at the G20, they’d legitimize Saudi Arabia’s atrocious human rights record. We called on G20 member states to #UnmuteSaudiVoices & #FreeSaudiFeminists 
On November 24, Saudi Arabia announced a trial hearing for the five jailed women human rights defenders. The hearing was held on November 25 and instead of releasing Loujain, the court moved her case to the Specialized Criminal Court (anti-terrorism court). In the wake of this news, we need to keep up our activism even though the G20 Leaders’ Summit has now passed! 
Hosting the G20 Summit is part of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to improve its image. But the glamour of hosting a major global summit masks what is really going on in Saudi Arabia—a brutal government campaign of repression, intolerance, and human rights violations. 
Under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman (MBS), human rights defenders, women’s rights activists, writers, artists, religious clerics, protestors and bloggers have been persecuted, silenced, detained, tortured and handed lengthy prison sentences for demanding reforms and advocating for peaceful change. Several were sentenced to death and executed based on so-called “confessions” extracted under torture. 
The state-ordered murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, is but one chilling example of how far the Saudi authorities are willing to go to muzzle critical voices. 
Until the G20 Summit, being held from November 21-22, we will be campaigning in support of human rights and human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, and in particular women human rights defenders like Nassima al-Sada. Will be advocating for Canada, as a G20 member, to use the G20 Summit to promote human rights in the kingdom. 
GREAT NEWS! On November 18, we handed over 12,160 petition signatures to Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, calling on him to put human rights front and centre at this week’s G20 Leaders’ Summit! These signatures were part of over 195,000 signatures collected from around the world calling on G20 member states to address Saudi Arabia’s human rights record at the Summit. Also on November 18, the National Post published an op ed written by Walid al-Hathloul, Loujain’s brother, calling for her release.

0,Lebanon: Blow to Migrant Domestic Worker Rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/lebanon-blow-to-migrant-domestic-worker-rights/,"Reinstate Contract; Amend Labor Law (Beirut, October 30, 2020) – Lebanon’s State Shura Council, the country’s top administrative court, delivered a sharp blow to migrant domestic worker rights by suspending the implementation of a new standard unified contract, Amnesty International and Human...","(Beirut, October 30, 2020) – Lebanon’s State Shura Council, the country’s top administrative court, delivered a sharp blow to migrant domestic worker rights by suspending the implementation of a new standard unified contract, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today. The standard unified contract, which the Labor Ministry adopted on September 8, 2020, included new protections for migrant domestic workers, including vital safeguards against forced labor, and would have been an important first step toward abolishing the abusive kafala (sponsorship) system. 
The Syndicate of the Owners of Recruitment Agencies submitted a complaint to the Shura Council on September 21 requesting the council to block and annul the labor minister’s two decisions to adopt the new standard unified contract for migrant domestic workers and to cap the permissible deductions an employer can make from a domestic worker’s salary – equivalent to the national minimum wage – at 30 percent. The Shura Council on October 14 ruled in favor of the recruitment agencies on the grounds that these decisions comprised “severe damage” to the agencies’ interests. The Council made no reference to the rights of migrant domestic workers, which Lebanon is obliged to protect under international law. 
“The shameful pattern of abuses against migrant domestic workers under the kafala system has to end,” said Diala Haidar, Lebanon campaigner at Amnesty International. “Lebanese authorities, including the judiciary, have a duty to protect the rights of these workers instead of protecting a system that facilitates exploitation, forced labor and human trafficking.” 
An estimated 250,000 migrant domestic workers, work in Lebanon. The majority are women from African and South and South East Asian countries, including Ethiopia, the Philippines, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. They are excluded from Lebanon’s labor law protections, and their status in the country is regulated by the kafala system – a restrictive immigration regime of laws, regulations, and customary practices that ties migrant workers’ legal residency to their employer. 
Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and many other organizations have documented for years how the kafala system gives employers substantial control over workers’ lives. This has led to an array of abuses, including non-payment of wages, forced confinement, excessive working hours with no rest days or breaks, and verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. Those who left their employers without “permission” risked losing their legal residency in the country and facing detention and deportation. The previous contract only made exceptions for workers in extreme cases of abuse, with the burden of proof falling on the worker, effectively leaving workers trapped, including in forced labor situations. 
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), almost 90 percent of the migrant domestic workers employed in Lebanon are recruited through an agency. These recruitment agencies bring workers into Lebanon through partner agencies in the country of origin or through their own representatives abroad. Their business model depends on charging employers high recruitment fees that range between $1,000 and $3,000. The ILO found that employers are often not certain what the fee covered. They also found that there is a large disparity in recruitment fees depending on the income of the employer and the nationality of the worker. 
Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented abuse at the hands of recruitment agencies. Some agencies asked employers to pay the first few months’ salary to them, rather than to the worker, violating the worker’s rights. Some of the workers also reported being subjected to physical and verbal abuse, forced labor, and human trafficking by the recruitment agencies. 
The recruitment agencies argued that migrant domestic workers are specifically excluded from the Labor Law, and therefore their relationship with their employer is only governed by the Law of Obligations and Contracts as long as it does not conflict with “public order, public morality, and the general provisions.” They further said that the standard unified contract violates the principle of freedom to contract, as both parties should have the ability to decide on the terms of the contract, including whether they should be bound by the minimum wage. The Shura Council ruling failed to take into account both the rights of workers and the power imbalance between the parties. 
Lebanon is one of only two countries in the Middle East that hosts large numbers of migrant domestic workers but does not have any law governing their relationship with their employer and granting them sufficient protections and rights. Lebanon is obliged under international human rights law to ensure that domestic workers and migrant workers have protections equal to those for other workers under the law. 
The contract is the only legal document that a migrant domestic worker has in Lebanon. The country has had a standard unified contract for migrant domestic workers since 2009, but the 2009 version lacked vital safeguards against forced labor, does not meet international human rights and labor standards, and was adopted before the 2011 ILO Domestic Workers Convention. 
The new standard unified contract aimed to correct the power imbalance and grant the workers key labor guarantees already afforded to other workers, such as a 48-hour work week, a weekly rest day, overtime pay, sick pay, annual leave, and the national minimum wage, with some permissible deductions for housing and food. Most important, the new contract would have allowed workers to terminate their contract without the consent of their employer, dismantling a key abusive aspect of the kafala system. 
“Migrant domestic workers are one of the most marginalized groups in Lebanon, said Aya Majzoub, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “With the country’s economic collapse, compounded by the fallout of Covid-19, their already precarious situation went from bad to worse. But instead of providing more protections and dismantling the system that allows for these workers’ entrapment and exploitation, the Shura Council has appeared to prioritize the narrow commercial interests of the recruitment agencies.” 
It is not clear what defense the Labor Ministry presented or whether it plans to appeal, and a Labor Ministry official declined to comment. 
Human Rights Watch has found that Lebanon’s judiciary is failing to protect domestic workers or hold employers accountable when they violate the workers’ basic rights. 
Lebanon’s parliament should urgently amend the labor law to include migrant domestic workers. The Lebanese authorities should urgently take other steps to dismantle the kafala system, including by ensuring that migrant workers are not dependent on their employers for their legal status in the country. 
“Migrant domestic workers have long suffered under Lebanon’s abusive kafala system,” Haidar said. “Lebanon should abide by its international obligations, include migrant domestic workers in the labor law, and end the archaic kafala system.”

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the country’s premier anti-terror agency, raided the residences and offices of prominent human rights activists Khurram Parvez, the co-ordinator of J&K Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), three of his associates and Parveena Ahanger, Chairperson of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP). Both organizations have reported extensively on human rights abuses in Kashmir, including the indefinite administrative detention and extrajudicial execution of human rights defenders, torture of people in detention and the widespread impunity of the security forces in the region. Further raids were carried out on the offices of the NGOs Athrout and GK Trust and on the residence of Agence France-Presse’s Kashmir correspondent Parvez Bukhari.   
According to a statement released by the NIA, the raids were conducted based on ‘credible information’ that the organizations have been using funding from India and abroad ‘for secessionist and terrorist activities in J&K’, in contravention of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), India’s primary anti-terror and foreign funding laws.   
“These raids are an alarming reminder that India’s government is determined to suppress all dissenting voices in Jammu and Kashmir. The authorities are evidently targeting these civil society and media groups because of their continued work reporting and advocating for the rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir despite a harsh communications blackout that was imposed by the Indian government in the region since 5 August 2019,” said Julie Verhaar, Acting Secretary General of Amnesty International.   
“In a worrying pattern, the UAPA and the foreign funding law are being repeatedly and deliberately weaponized to intimidate, harass and restrict the ability of civil society groups from operating, in clear violation of their rights to freedom of expression and association.”  
The raids come after Amnesty International India was forced to halt its work and let go of its employees in the country from 1 October 2020 after its bank accounts were frozen by the government, shortly after it released a Situation Update on human rights in Jammu & Kashmir.  
In September 2020, APDP submitted almost 40 testimonies of victims who were subjected to arbitrary detention and torture by security forces in Kashmir, to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. On 5 August 2020, JKCCS published its bi-annual human rights review documenting the extrajudicial executions of at least 32 individuals and the impact of internet shutdowns in the region.   
Both UAPA and FCRA have been criticized by UN human rights experts for their overarching nature, which is used to criminalise religious minorities, political dissidents and human rights defenders. In October 2020, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet appealed to the government of India to review the FCRA and its compliance with international human rights norms, and regretted that it was being “used to deter or punish NGOs for human rights reporting”.  
Since 2014, several organizations have been targeted under the foreign funding law, including Greenpeace India, Lawyers Collective, Centre for Promotion of Social Concerns, Sabrang Trust, Navsarjan Trust, Act Now for Harmony and Democracy, NGO Hazards Centre, and Indian Social Action Forum. In September 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the FCRA was further amended, without any public consultation, to choke civil society in India.  
Background  
On 19 October, the office of the Kashmir Times, a news daily, was sealed by the Jammu & Kashmir Estates Department. Since 5 August 2019, Anuradha Bhasin, the editor of Kashmir Times has spearheaded the litigation in the Supreme Court of India against the shutdown of internet and telephone services in Jammu & Kashmir.  
Amnesty International’s statement on the halting of its operations in India can be found here.  
The 20 October statement from the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, on the situation for NGOs and human rights defenders in India can be found here.  
In its Situation Update, Amnesty International India documented physical attacks on and intimidation of at least 18 journalists since 5 August 2019. It also demanded the withdrawal of a draconian media policy which was introduced by the government to create “a sustained narrative on the functioning of the government in media” by checking on “anti-national activities”.  
By directly attacking and failing to protect civil society organizations organisations, India stands in a clear violation of its human rights obligations, particularly Articles 19 and 22 of the International Covenant of the Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which it’s a state party.

Yesterday (28 October 2020), at approximately 1.30pm local time, one or several Smerch rockets were fired into Barda, striking a residential neighbourhood close to a hospital. The Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s Office has stated that at least 21 people were killed, with an estimated 70 more injured. 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Response experts verified pictures (taken by Vice News reporters in the city) of fragments of 9N235 cluster munitions from Russian-made 9M55 Smerch rockets, that appear to have been fired into the city by Armenian forces. 
“The firing of cluster munitions into civilian areas is cruel and reckless, and causes untold death, injury and misery,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
“As this conflict continues to escalate, Armenian, Armenian-backed and Azerbaijani forces have all been guilty of using banned weapons that have endangered the lives of civilians caught in the middle. 
“Cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons, and their use in any circumstances is banned under international humanitarian law. We are again calling on both sides to immediately stop using cluster munitions, and to prioritize the protection of civilians.” 
On 5 October, Amnesty International identified M095 DPICM cluster munitions that appear to have been fired by Azerbaijani forces into the city of Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
Last week, Amnesty International also called for both Armenia and Azerbaijan to immediately stop the use of heavy explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated civilian areas. 
Background  
On 27 September, heavy fighting erupted between Azerbaijan and Armenia and Armenian-supported forces in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. In the last month, both sides involved in the conflict have exchanged artillery and rocket fire. 
Amnesty International has called on all sides to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law, and to protect civilians from the effects of hostilities. 
Cluster munitions 
Cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons that inflict suffering for civilian populations years after their use, and are internationally banned by a treaty backed by more than 100 states. Amnesty International is calling on both Armenia and Azerbaijan to become parties to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. 
Cluster munitions scatter hundreds of bomblets, or submunitions, over a wide area. It is estimated that between 5 and 20 per cent of cluster bomblets fail to explode. They are then left behind, posing a threat to civilians similar to that of anti-personnel landmines.  
The use of these weapons violates the prohibition of indiscriminate attack because of the wide area covered by the numerous bomblets released, and the danger posed to all who come into contact with the unexploded munitions.

The timeline – available here – collates photographs and video footage to confirm that Nigerian Army vehicles left Bonny Camp, a military base approximately a seven-minute drive from the toll gate, at 6.29pm local time on 20 October.  
Footage then tracks the vehicles to the toll gate. At approximately 6.45pm, the Nigerian military opened fire on the #EndSars protesters who were peacefully calling for an end to police brutality. 
“What happened at Lekki Toll Gate has all the traits of the Nigerian authorities’ pattern of a cover-up whenever their defence and security forces commit unlawful killings,” said Osai Ojigho, Country Director of Amnesty International. 
“One week on, the Nigerian authorities still have many questions to answer: who ordered the use of lethal force on peaceful protesters? Why were CCTV cameras on the scene dismantled in advance? And who ordered electricity being turned off minutes before the military opened fire on protesters? 
“The initial denials of the involvement of soldiers in the shooting was followed by the shameful denial of the loss of lives as a result of the military’s attack against the protests. 
“Many people are still missing since the day of the incident, and credible evidence shows that the military prevented ambulances from reaching the severely injured in the aftermath.” 
Amnesty International is again calling on Nigerian authorities to bring to justice those behind the shooting and to protect those who are exercising their right to freedom of assembly. The organization is still investigating the shooting, and the reported removal of bodies of those killed by the military in an attempt to remove evidence. 
Tracking the military’s movements  
Amnesty International’s Crisis Response experts investigated and verified social media videos and photographs that confirm the Nigerian security forces were present at the Lekki Toll Gate when the shootings occurred. 
At 6.29pm local time in Lagos, two military vehicles were filmed leaving Bonny Camp on videos shared on social media. Later footage shows four vehicles with flashing lights in a convoy, and they appear to be vehicles used by the Nigerian military and police. 
The same vehicles head east along Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue – which changes its name to the Lekki-Epe Expressway – in the direction of the Lekki Toll Gate. On this route, the vehicles pass several international embassies and consulates, including the Japanese Embassy and the Australian High Commission. 
Further photographs and footage capture the vehicles arriving at the toll gate, before the peaceful protest is disrupted by men in military uniform and gunfire is heard. As night time descended, protesters continued to film and share videos of the shootings. Later in the evening, videos of the victims were also shared on social media.  
Background  
Amnesty International has been monitoring developments across Nigeria since the #EndSars protest began on 8 October 2020. 
Nigerians have been taking to the streets, peacefully demanding an end to police brutality, extrajudicial executions and extortion by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian police tasked with fighting violent crimes.  
At least 56 people have died across the country since protests began. In multiple cases, the security forces have used excessive force in an attempt to control or stop the protests.

My name is Jani Silva and I’m a campesina, or small-scale farmer, from Colombia. I’m 57 years old and I work in the Perla Amazónica Farming Reserve Area in the southern region of Putumayo. Ever since I was little, I’ve always followed my convictions and always defended what I believe in. This is why I’m fighting to preserve the Amazon and its biodiversity. 
Today I face death threats, for defending our territory, the environment and our way of life. The armed groups in the region want to control our crops, our land and our communities. 
We’ve also faced oil drilling that affects our territory, destroys sensitive biological corridors for the protection of Amazonian species, and has drastically changed the lifestyle of our campesino communities. 
Despite all the obstacles and difficulties that we confront, we’re convinced that our struggle is just and necessary. Humanity must understand that we are all life, that we are water and that to defend the Amazon is to defend the life of present and future generations. 
We, the campesinos, are the Amazon. Our territory is everything we have and everything we are. It’s where we live our lives, where we raise our children and where we see our grandchildren grow. We’re fighting to stay here. We’re defending life, defending an ecosystem, defending a whole history, a whole campesino culture. 
We carry an immense responsibility on our shoulders because everyone breathes the oxygen that our forests and wetlands produce. When there are threats to our territory, it is not just our community that is endangered, but the entire world, the water, the trees and the species that are at risk of extinction. We must not just think about our country, we must think about others too and all those who need us. All ecosystems are important, for together they form a whole that protects life on our planet. 
We all share a common home, resources and the environment. This is why I believe we should all be territorial defenders. We need to raise awareness that what we have is very important for the life of everyone. We cannot let it be destroyed or polluted. That’s why there should not be just one group of defenders, there should be a world of defenders, because we must defend everyone’s lives together. 
The biggest obstacles are greed and apathy. We cannot go on thinking about obliterating everything or filling our territory with oil palm or rice plantations. Our soil is diverse and must not be covered with monocultures. We want the same variety of crops and natural diversity that we’ve always had. We are campesinos and we must preserve that way of life and restore the forest, respecting nature’s cycles and preserving clean water supplies. 
Not a day goes by when we don’t think about how to improve conditions in our community. We stay up late at night, thinking of how to things in the best possible way for everyone, the best way to fight against the economic interests that attack us, including the business interests that have the backing of a government that has forgotten us and handed our territory over to them so they can exploit it. The damage done to nature cannot be fixed with money, or with jobs; it can only be rectified by respecting nature. I know that change is possible, we just have to fight for it. 
In Colombia they say that those who have money always win, that those who have power always win, but we’ll never give up here. We may be few, but we’ve had major achievements, such as delaying the oil industry from operating here for three years. But our community no longer has clean drinking water. We must wait for rain to collect water because our rivers and streams, which used to supply us with fish and water all year round, are now contaminated by waste from the oil industry. We used to bathe in them, but now if we touch the water it leaves our skin with blisters. We no longer have a potable water supply and there are families who go thirsty. 
Now I’m facing death threats once again. We’ve learned of new plans to assassinate me and thus silence my voice. They want to crush my spirit and deprive me of my peace of mind. But the toughest thing has not been the threats but having to give up what I love. I’m a campesina, I love my land, I love my chickens and my home. I love to go barefoot. I love the countryside and the river. My favourite moment of the day was getting up to have a cup of coffee and watch the sunrise with my family, but now, with the threats against me, I cannot do these things. I have had to move away. Today I can no longer live on my farm and I try not to leave the house where I am staying. 
Living in fear, with constant anxiety, is not living. Living with oppression is not living. We need people to raise their voices and search for those who will defend the defenders. 
In the meantime, I’ll continue to defend my territory, my family, the future of my seven beautiful grandchildren and life itself.

The petition was launched ahead of Belarus’s 9 August presidential election amid mounting violations against protesters. As the crackdown against peaceful protesters has intensified, it has been signed by hundreds of thousands of people from 184 countries.  
“When we started this campaign back in July, we could not have foreseen just how widespread and brutal the assault on peaceful protesters would be. The Belarusian authorities have descended to new lows in their pursuit of critics and political opponents, arresting thousands of people and carrying out a campaign of intimidation, torture and other ill-treatment that is ongoing. Only a couple of weeks ago, the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs condoned the use of lethal weapons against protesters,” said Aisha Jung, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner on Belarus.  
“The nearly two hundred thousand signatures that we have collected send a clear message to the Belarusian authorities: stop the violence; the world is watching, and people care. We will continue to demand accountability for the killings of peaceful protesters by the Belarusian security forces, the indiscriminate detention of peaceful protesters, the torture of detainees, and the arrests of opposition leaders.  
“This systematic campaign of intimidation and terror being waged against peaceful protesters in Belarus must cease immediately. All human rights violations committed by the Belarusian authorities against protesters must be investigated, and all those suspected of such violations should be brought to justice in accordance with international standards for fair trials. Furthermore, it is imperative that all officers are clearly identifiable and the lawless practice of using gangs of men in plain clothes in unmarked vehicles to detain people must also stop immediately.”    
Background  
The petition was launched on 27 July during the final stages of the electoral campaign. By that time, already hundreds had been detained by law enforcement officers. Leading opposition figures and aspiring presidential candidates Viktar Babaryka and Syarhei Tsihanouski were arrested on bogus criminal charges. Further politically motivated arrests of opposition figures followed.   
In the days following the elections, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians took to the streets to contest their results. They were met with brutal and indiscriminate force. At least six protestors died, thousands were detained, and hundreds subjected to torture. 
The Belarusian people continue to protest around the country, hundreds of them are detained weekly. Throughout this time, social and independent media channels have captured shocking footage of the continuing violence against them which corroborates many protesters’ claims.

Of course there was a student who asked “Why do we have to learn this? Who writes letters these days?” In response, our teacher showed us Amnesty International’s website. She introduced us to their work, specifically their letter writing campaigns, and to the idea that our words held so much power. I was instantly captivated – ordinary people like me were creating change and bringing justice. I immediately knew that I had to get involved. 
I went home and spent hours scouring the internet, learning more about Amnesty and what they did. I discovered success stories of activists who had been freed, and reforms that had been made. I also came across countless opportunities where I could get involved – from signing petitions and writing letters, all the way to joining a group or taking on a national leadership position. Jeez, that seemed intimidating. 
That was four years ago. Since then, I have written and sent countless letters, participated in a Write for Rights event, joined my high school’s Social Justice Club, planned a city wide High School Human Rights Conference, spoken at a panel with a handful of amazing activists, and recently became a National Organizer. 
Every single person I have met through Amnesty has inspired me in some way – from my fellow youth organizers, to my high school teachers who support our club (shoutout to Ms.Hodgson!). What inspires me even more is seeing the progress we are making – just recently, the Federal Court repealed the Canada/Us Safe Third Country Agreement, which Amnesty has been actively working to suspend for more than fifteen years! 
Although we have come a long way, there is still much we have to do. The issue of human rights is such a broad one, that sometimes it seems completely overwhelming. Will we ever really make a difference? Does the work we’re doing have a long term effect? Or will it splinter with time? Every activist has asked themselves these questions, and countless more.  
The way I see it, you can get intimidated by the world’s problems, or choose to stand up against them. Anyone can create change, if they care enough to do so.

The case,...","Amnesty International is welcoming news that a group of Eritrean plaintiffs have reached an out-of-court settlement in a lawsuit against Canadian mining company, Nevsun Resources. 
The case, filed in British Columbia in November 2014 by former mine workers Gize Yebeyo Araya, Kesete Tekle Fshazion and Mihretab Yemane Tekle, alleged that Nevsun was responsible for benefitting from gross human rights abuses such as slavery and forced labour, torture, and crimes against humanity during the construction of its copper and gold mine in Eritrea. 
The terms of the settlement – which concludes years of legal wrangling across three continents – are confidential. 
“This settlement speaks to the incredible courage of the mine workers who came forward with their horrific experiences of torture, slavery, and forced labour while working at the mine,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “With this groundbreaking lawsuit, these individuals helped pave the way for corporate accountability overseas. Canadian companies must take responsibility for alleged human rights abuses associated with their operations, not just on Canadian soil, but anywhere in the world.” 
Nevsun fought against the case being heard in Canada all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Amnesty International was granted ‘friend of the court’ status in the appeal hearing and together with the International Commission of Jurists presented arguments about the right to an effective remedy under international law for victims of corporate human rights abuses. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court dismissed Nevsun’s appeal and allowed the case against the company to proceed in BC. The Court affirmed that customary international law applies both to states and corporations, making it clear that companies may go to trial in Canada over serious allegations of this nature.  
This decision was significant because, in cases of alleged human rights abuses by Canadian mining companies overseas, foreign plaintiffs face immense legal barriers when they attempt to bring lawsuits before Canadian courts. For many years, Canadian courts declined jurisdiction to hear corporate abuse cases, ruling instead that these cases should be heard in the country where the alleged harms occurred. In States without an independent judiciary or constitution, such as Eritrea, the idea that a case against a powerful foreign company for human rights harms could proceed fairly and without interference is highly unlikely. This case underscores the urgent need for legislation requiring Canadian companies to conduct human right due diligence throughout global operations 
Nevsun was acquired by Zijin Mining Group Company in late 2018.  
For more information about the case, please see Amnesty International’s legal brief on Nevsun Resources Ltd v. Gize Yebeyo Araya et al.  
Addendum: 
Amnesty International wishes to confirm that it has not seen the confidential settlement reached in this matter. Amnesty International has had no discussions regarding the terms of the settlement with the plaintiffs or the plaintiffs’ legal counsel, and the terms were in no way disclosed to us. Amnesty International therefore has no knowledge about the terms of settlement, including whether or not it involves financial compensation of any amount. Any direct or indirect implication to the contrary would be inaccurate.

Since the police killing of George Floyd in May 2020, there have been thousands of peaceful anti-racism and political protests and counter-protests across the USA. Yet in nearly 200 incidents where violence occurred between participants in conflicting protests, Amnesty International found that US police forces frequently failed to take preventive measures to avoid the disruption of peaceful assemblies and failed to protect protesters from violent attacks when they did occur. 
“Amidst unprecedented rises in political volatility and violence, US government and law enforcement authorities at all levels must meticulously protect people’s human rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. “In the context of hotly contested elections and a nationwide civil rights movement, no one should fear for their lives when they try to cast a vote or have their voices heard at peaceful assemblies.” 
From May to September 2020, Amnesty International has documented and verified violent confrontations between protests and counter-protests in approximately 75% of all US states, and in about half of all US states it confirmed cases of police forces failing to keep assemblies peaceful and to protect participants from violent confrontations with counter-protesters. In particular, law enforcement agencies often neglected to: 
“As President Trump calls on his supporters to ‘go to’ and ‘watch’ the polling stations, and white supremacist armed groups to ‘stand by’ during the elections, law enforcement officials should be on high alert to prevent political violence in this explosive moment,” said Brian Griffey, regional researcher and advisor for North America at Amnesty International. “Government authorities and the police forces they direct must adopt new policies, strategies, and tactics to facilitate and protect peaceful protests, and prevent their disruption by armed groups or other violent actors.” 
Among the incidents documented by Amnesty International, over a dozen protests and counter-protests erupted in violence with police either mostly or entirely absent from the scene. A frequent catalyst for violent confrontations between protesters and counter-protesters was the presence of vigilante armed groups. The Trump administration’s rhetoric, policies, and practices have appeared to encourage the prevalence of armed groups unlawfully assaulting protesters and counter-protesters around the country. 
In one example, an anti-racism protest organizer, Tony Crawford, told Amnesty International that “people could have gotten killed” during a violent confrontation his community had with armed counter-protesters at demonstration calling for the removal of a Confederate civil war statue in Weatherford, Texas in July. 
In a series of text messages to the Weatherford police chief, reviewed by Amnesty International, Crawford wrote: “The patriots [armed group members] are surrounding us to force confrontation. We are surrounded by guns and people talking about shooting us loudly… Where are the police, Chief? This is ridiculous. We are being abused. Where are y’all… Y’all abandoned us Chief. You abandoned us. You let us get dragged and attacked while you did nothing.” 
US government and law enforcement authorities at all levels must reform their police forces’ policies and practices to better facilitate freedom of peaceful assembly and protect protesters from widespread threats of preventable violence. In the marked absence of federal protection, local-level governments should safeguard protests from violence by issuing temporary executive orders to restrict the presence of weapons in public properties, parks, polling stations, and peaceful assemblies; and by instructing their law enforcement agencies to prevent armed individuals and armed groups from disrupting peaceful protests and civic activities during the elections period. 
Police forces at city, county, state and federal levels should all immediately reform their conduct and implement specialized trainings on the human rights-compliant facilitation and protection of freedom of peaceful assembly, in line with their obligations under the US Constitution and good practices in policing of assemblies. 
Background and context 
On 4 August, Amnesty International published the report The World is Watching: Mass Violations by US police of Black Lives Matter protesters’ rights. 
On 6 October, the organization called upon US governors to issue executive orders prohibiting non-state actors from possessing firearms at or near polling places during the 2020 general elections. Six states already prohibit guns at polling places: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. 
On 20 October, Amnesty International also issued a joint letter with Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, calling on US municipal governments to adopt temporary special measures to prevent armed individuals or groups from intimidating or threatening protesters or voters during and following the elections.

Loujain al Hathloul, Nassima al-Sada, Samar Badawi, Maya’a al-Zahrani, and Nouf Abdulaziz spearheaded women’s rights campaigns, including calling for the right to drive and an end to the repressive male guardianship system. But while Saudi Arabia talks up recent reforms such as the relaxation of social restrictions and the loosening of the guardianship system to court approval from the rich and powerful around the B20, women’s rights activists remain in detention. 
“Since assuming the G20 Presidency Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in rebranding its image, throwing out slogans about women’s equality and insisting it is ready for change. But Saudi Arabia’s real changemakers are behind bars,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“B20 leaders must not be fooled by this shameless hypocrisy, and we call on them to show they care about human rights as much as business opportunities. Any business operating in or with Saudi Arabia has a responsibility to ensure they are not contributing to human rights violations through their activities.”  
The B20 is the official forum for business leaders to present policy recommendations to the G20, ahead of the main summit in November. This year high profile participants include representatives from HSBC, Mastercard, PwC, McKinsey, CISCO, ENI, Siemens, Accenture and BBVA. 
Cynical PR campaign 
Saudi Arabia has publicized the fact that this year, 33 percent of B20 delegates are women – the highest ever contingency. The B20 website states that “Women in Business” will be Saudi Arabia’s “signature topic” as President. 
These events are the culmination of an aggressive PR drive under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has promised equal opportunities as part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 strategy. 
Following the announcement of the Vision 2030 plan, women were granted the right to drive in June 2018. This was a step towards equal employment opportunities, giving women in Saudi Arabia a modicum of freedom and independence. But just weeks before this change was announced authorities launched a crackdown on human rights defenders, arresting many of those who had advocated for the right to drive. 
Currently, 13 women’s rights defenders remain on trial facing prosecution for their human rights activism. Several face charges of contacting foreign media or international organizations, including Amnesty International. Some were also accused of “promoting women’s rights” and “calling for the end of the male guardianship system”. Of the 13 women, five remain in detention: Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani. 
Saudi Arabian authorities continue to systematically silence dissent and crush freedom of expression, using the Specialized Criminal Court to target economists, teachers, clerics, writers, activists and others who have called for change. Human rights defenders face arbitrary arrest, unfair trials and torture. 
Amnesty International is urging business leaders at the B20 not to turn a blind eye to these violations. All businesses have a responsibility to ensure they are not contributing to human rights harm. They are expected to carry out human rights due diligence in order to identify, prevent and mitigate the human rights risks of their activities, and activities within their supply chain and business relationships. 
Amnesty International has written to businesses participating in the B20 Summit raising serious concerns about the human rights risks of business operations in and with Saudi Arabia, and reminding them of their human rights responsibilities. 
“We urge B20 delegates also to think carefully about how their brands could be legitimizing human rights violations and endorsing Saudi Arabia’s charm offensive,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
“If B20 Saudi Arabia was as progressive as it claims, the activists who did so much to secure more rights for women would have a seat at the table.”

Prior to the beginning of the oral and public debate, a hearing was scheduled on 22 October to examine the proceedings against David Castillo, the former manager of the company Desarrollos Energéticos (DESA), who was in charge of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project. 
According to the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), the organization that Berta Cáceres was general coordinator of, the broadcast of the hearing could not be accessed remotely due to the absence of a technician, thus limiting publicity and the transparency of the judicial process. 
“Amnesty International has repeatedly asked the Honduran authorities to guarantee the rights to justice, truth and reparation of Berta Cáceres’ family and COPINH members. In light of the restrictions on courtroom access related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the authorities must also take all appropriate measures to ensure that the trial is public and transparent through remote access,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“In a country like Honduras – where those who defend human rights related to territory and the environment are at constant risk of death, and where impunity is almost absolute – ensuring publicity around the trial, including the presence of journalists and observers, is fundamental for society as a whole to know the truth about what happened to Berta Cáceres. The trial must be transparent.” 
The murder of Berta Cáceres four and a half years ago has moved Honduran and international society and remains one of the most emblematic crimes against human rights defenders. Amnesty International will be monitoring the respect of due process during the trial, as well as the progress of the investigation to identify everyone involved in the planning of the murder.

“Secretary Pompeo’s baseless accusations are yet another attempt to silence and intimidate international human rights organizations. The administration is spreading misinformation and working to undermine those who are working to protect human rights. Amnesty International USA is deeply committed to fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate worldwide, and will continue to protect people wherever justice, freedom, truth, and dignity are denied. We vigorously contest any allegation of antisemitism. 
“Our human rights work, as well as the broader human rights movement today, exist because of the actions taken by the international community in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Nations came together and said, ‘never again.’ Never again would atrocities such as those committed in the Holocaust occur because governments would now recognize that all human beings have rights.  
“The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the founding document of our work and our guiding light, came together precisely because of the  atrocities committed against  the Jewish people. These accusations are an affront to anyone who believes in the human rights movement. 
“We advocate for the release of Jewish prisoners of conscience, condemn acts of terrorism against Jewish communities, and call on governments to condemn neo-Nazi and other hate groups across the U.S. and throughout the world. We are deeply concerned that conflating antisemitism with legitimate criticism of Israeli government policy is detrimental not only to ending serious crimes under international law, but also to efforts to address and end antisemitism – and it may encourage other countries to make such baseless claims.  
“Amnesty International USA criticizes governments and policies based on international human rights law and standards. As such, we condemn settlements because they are illegal and cause great harm to Palestinians. Our research has continuously shown a close connection between Israeli settlements and the violation of human rights of Palestinians in every aspect of their lives. The Amnesty International movement is independent of any ideology, government, creed or religion. Our investigations and reports into human rights violations committed by Israel are not disproportionate to other countries in the Middle East, such as Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Iran and Bahrain. 
“We know that the governments of many countries, including the United States’, would rather not have their human rights violations exposed. It is concerning to see Secretary Pompeo join the list of people and governments that use accusations of antisemitism to try to sweep human rights abuses under the rug. 
“Any process aimed at a just and sustainable peace in Israel and the State of Palestine must include an end to systematic human rights abuses, dismantling of illegal Israeli settlements, and justice and reparation for victims of crimes under international law. This is what international norms demand, whether Secretary Pompeo likes it or not.” 
Background and context 
Amnesty International USA does not receive any government funding, from the U.S. government or any other government. 
Amnesty International Israel continues work in the country, despite hindrances and attacks on its ability to conduct robust campaigns.

0,Nigeria: Killing of #EndSARS protesters by the military must be investigated,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/nigeria-killing-of-endsars-protesters-by-the-military-must-be-investigated/,At least 12 people killed at Alausa and Lekki Toll Gate Lagos  Hundreds severely injured  CCTV dismantled to cover murder  An on-the-ground investigation by Amnesty International has confirmed that the Nigerian army and police killed at least 12 peaceful protesters yesterday at two locations in...,"An on-the-ground investigation by Amnesty International has confirmed that the Nigerian army and police killed at least 12 peaceful protesters yesterday at two locations in Lagos. The killings took place in Lekki and Alausa, where thousands were protesting police brutality as part of the #EndSars movement.  
Evidence gathered from eyewitnesses, video footage and hospital reports confirm that between 6:45pm and 9:00pm on Tuesday 20 October, the Nigerian military opened fire on thousands of people who were peacefully calling for good governance and an end to police brutality.  
Witnesses at the Lekki protest grounds told Amnesty international that solders arrived at about 6:45pm local time on Tuesday evening, and opened fire on #EndSars protesters without warning. Eyewitnesses at Alausa protest ground said they were attacked by a team of soldiers and policemen from the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) Unit at about 8:00 pm, leaving at least two people dead and one critically injured.   
“Opening fire on peaceful protesters is a blatant violation of people’s rights to life, dignity, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.  Soldiers clearly had one intention – to kill without consequences,” said Osai Ojigho, Country Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.  
Amnesty International received reports that shortly before the shootings, CCTV cameras at the Lekki toll gate, where #EndSARS protesters had been camped for two weeks, were removed by government officials and the electricity was cut – a clear attempt to hide evidence. As in previous cases documented by Amnesty International, some of those killed and injured at both grounds were allegedly taken away by the military.  
 “These shootings clearly amount to extrajudicial executions. There must be an immediate investigation and suspected perpetrators must be held accountable through fair trials. Authorities must ensure access to justice and effective remedies for the victims and their families,” said Osai Ojigho.  
Background  
Amnesty International has been monitoring developments across Nigeria since the #EndSars protest began on 8 October 2020.  At least 56 people have died across the country since the protest began, with about 38 killed on Tuesday alone. Victims include protesters and thugs who were allegedly hired by the authorities to confront the protesters. In many cases the security forces had used excessive force in an attempt to control or stop the protests.

Daniel Montsion not guilty of manslaughter and assault charges connected to his death. 
Abdi was a 37-year-old Somali-Canadian man who died on July 24, 2016 following a violent arrest and altercation with Ottawa police, captured on a witness video. Abdi’s family indicated that he suffered from mental health issues. He had no criminal history. 
“Today’s verdict does not serve justice to Abdirahman – nor to the Black, Indigenous and racialized people who have died at the hands of police before him” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “Instead, today’s verdict is yet another painful reminder of the systemic racism that is pervasive in our police institutions and carceral systems. This must end.” 
Canada’s mental health care institutions continues to consistently fail Black people. Amnesty International is echoing the Justice for Abdirahman Abdi Coalition’s calls for greater transparency and accountability in our law enforcements, as well as increased mental health supports. 
“Our hearts go out to Abdirahman Abdi’s family and friends who are dealing with this devastating news today,” said Nivyabandi. 
Abdirahman’s death is part of a long history of police violence against Black and Indigenous people in Canada. Police must be held accountable for systemic racism and how it influences policing decisions and practices. Black communities in Ottawa are also questioning the death of Anthony Aust, a 23-year-old Black man who died earlier this month while police were present. On Oct. 7, Aust fell from a window of his family’s 12th floor apartment building during a raid in which SWAT police executed a no-knock warrant, battering down the door and using flashbang grenades. Regis Korchinski-Paquet also fell to her death from a high-rise building in Toronto after police entered her apartment on May 27. Further, 26-year-old D’Andre Campbell was shot in his home by Peel police officers in April this year. 
Amnesty International is continuing to call on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to follow-up on his 2019 campaign promise to strengthen and boost funding for Building a Foundation for Change: Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy. Amnesty International also calls on Trudeau and Public Safety Minister Bill Blair to apply an immediate ban on carding, street checks and racial profiling by law enforcement. These cases, including today’s verdict­­, demonstrate Canada’s urgent need for decisive, government-wide reforms to end systemic racism. Federal and provincial governments must act now to reform the institutions which uphold this systemic racism. Clear roadmaps for reform exist, it is past time to implement them.

My life changed completely on Nov. 8 last year. 
That day, Carabinero officers—members of the Chilean National Police—shot me in both eyes, leaving me completely blind. 
Why did they shoot me? For exercising my right to protest. 
Before that day, I was an ordinary student from Santiago, studying psychology, playing basketball, riding my bike and playing the bass. 
That day, I was participating in a mass social demonstration, part of a wave of protests that began on Oct. 18 2019 to change a system that is based on inequality. The protests started due to an increase in the price of public transport, but that was just the trigger after decades of injustice. We took to the streets to change that, to demand more equal access to health and education, and better pensions. 
But in Chile, demanding your rights always involves a certain level of risk. There’s no guarantee that you will return home safely. When you go out to protest, you go prepared with a helmet and a facemask to protect against tear gas. But there’s no way to protect yourself from the guns fired by the Carabineros. 
According to the National Human Rights Institute, at least four people died at the hands of security forces during the first six weeks of the social outcry, and more than 12,500 were injured. Amnesty International has documented how in many cases, officers deliberately fired pellets and tear gas canisters at people’s heads. They report at least 460 cases of severe eye trauma injuries by the end of the mass protests in March. 
The authorities’ intention was clear—to hurt us as punishment for daring to protest. 
 
It has been hard for me to get used to losing my sight. During the first few days it was difficult for me to hold a fork to eat. I’ve had to learn all these processes all over again, but with time I’m developing the abilities that I need to continue with my life. Now I can do things like cooking—maybe badly, but I can do it—and I’m even learning to play the drums and the piano. 
The most difficult thing has been going outside and using a walking stick. It’s stressful because of the noise and the surroundings. But in March I went out to protest again in the same plaza where I was shot. That was very important to me and it was moving to feel people’s affection. A lot of people thanked me; it felt strange but nice. Many people have offered me help and we’ve built a giant network of people. This support and solidarity gives me the strength to go on. 
I’ve always believed in the importance of the search for justice, truth and reparations for the victims of human rights violations during the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile from 1973-1990. These support networks need to be developed to fight for justice once again. 
The authorities have been updating me on the progress of the investigation into my injuries. There were a lot of delays, but in August, after nine months, they arrested Claudio Crespo, a Carabinero lieutenant colonel, as the alleged perpetrator. I’m glad progress has been made and am now waiting for the justice system to do its job and also charge those who allowed the Carabineros to come out and shoot us day after day. 
It seems that the government is more concerned about public opinion and pressure from abroad than from its own people. The support of international bodies is crucial because it shines a spotlight on what is happening in Chile. 
I’ve spent the last few months in lockdown with my family because of the pandemic. We’ve gone out as little as possible to avoid putting ourselves at risk, but unfortunately the repression in Chile has not stopped. The armed forces are in the streets, allegedly to help stop the spread of coronavirus, but they’re armed with their rifles and shotguns. It still doesn’t make sense: what is the point of having soldiers with firearms in the street during a health crisis? 
The armed forces show up at the protests, but they’re not trained to maintain public order; on the contrary, they’re trained for war. In fact, several months ago, they shot a man and damaged his eye too. These things are still happening during the pandemic. The government continues to commit human rights violations. 
What gives me hope for the future of the country is the upcoming referendum to draft a new constitution. It will not change things overnight, but I think it will be a big step forward. If successful, the new constitution must be based on respect for and guarantee of human rights. We also need a total restructuring of the Carabineros. We can’t allow them to keep hurting us. 
This tragedy that we’ve experienced should never have happened. All that’s left is for us to keep demanding justice and reparation in all cases of human rights violations. We need to stay alert and follow the legal proceedings so that the perpetrators and the politicians who are responsible face justice. 
The repression that we’ve experienced in Chile over the last year must never be repeated.

The July Federal Court decision is otherwise due to take effect in January 2021. 
The Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and The Canadian Council of Churches, alongside the individual litigants, are arguing that the stay application must be rejected. 
“Every day that the rules remain in effect, more people risk being returned to imprisonment in the US and possible return to persecution,” said Dorota Blumczynska, CCR President. “After seeing overwhelming evidence, including the testimonies of the appalling experiences of people in the US immigration detention system, the Federal Court concluded that the conditions in US detention ‘shock the conscience’. We must stop sending people to face these intolerable abuses.” 
“For the second time, the Federal Court has found that the Canadian law implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement is unconstitutional,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada. “While the court gave Parliament six months to remedy the law, the government has squandered that opportunity in favour of an appeal. We are hopeful that the Federal Court of Appeal will affirm the deadline, so that no refugee protection claimant will be handed over by Canada to face the horrors of US immigration detention past January 2021.” 
“The principles of justice in Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms must be upheld. The court has directed that the best way to achieve that is for the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement to be set aside so that refugee claimants can apply at regular border crossings and be given a hearing. We are our sister’s and our brother’s keeper,” said Pastor Peter Noteboom, General Secretary for The Canadian Council of Churches. 
The organizations are arguing that:

By Ana Nicole Collins and Stacia Loft 
In February, as demonstrators across the country halted trains and stopped traffic in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en land defenders in northwestern B.C., Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asserted that Canada is “a country of the rule of law, and we need to make sure those laws are respected.” We have seen too many examples of settler/Indigenous conflict, and now, just eight months later, we are witnessing another flagrant violation of Indigenous rights, as Mi’kmaq fishers have come under violent attack for exercising their longstanding treaty rights to fish lobster. So how does the rule of law apply? 
The problem is, that “rule of law” is a slippery phrase in this country. Canada has a habit of selectively choosing when to obey its own laws and human rights standards when Indigenous rights are at stake.  The rule of law is a principle of governance in which everyone, including the state, abides by a set of laws, which includes treaties, the Canadian Constitution, and internationally recognized human rights norms. 
One foundation of our legal system comes from the inherent order in nature: social life and customs learned from the lands, waters, and non-human beings (plants, animals, and celestial bodies, for example) on how to live well. These inherent laws and traditions form the basis for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a human rights instrument that the Canadian government claims to endorse. 
Another foundation are the Peace and Friendship Treaties, signed before 1779, that set out how settler and Indigenous peoples can live together in the shared territory and build respectful long-term relationships that benefit all. However, the aggression of settler fishers in Mi’kmak’i this week and the inaction of the RCMP indicates a broken relationship. 
Amnesty International echoes Sipekne’katik Chief Michael Sack’s calls for Canada to address the threats, attacks, and discrimination against Sipekne’katik and Mi’kmaq throughout their territory. Canada and the provinces must ensure the safety and security of the Mi’kmaq people. 
Video shows us that RCMP officers stood by while settlers broke the law by mob intimidation, throwing rocks, setting vehicles on fire, destroying two lobster storage facilities, and physically restraining Indigenous individuals. It is inexcusable that settler governments should allow the violence and hatred spreading against Mi’kmaq to continue.  In doing so, the RCMP, Canada and its provinces are contravening the Canadian Constitution and treaties, including international human rights standards and, yes, the rule of law. Why is the rule of law not being applied equally in this situation? 
Meanwhile, provincial leaders, like their federal counterparts, as inheritors of the Peace and Friendship Treaties, must foster strong relationships with Indigenous peoples. Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil must show integrity and conscience and call for the attacks and violence to stop. he must use his position to bring the signatories of the treaties together. He cannot shirk his responsibilities as Premier to be a role model and demonstrate what a good treaty relationship should be. 
This isn’t a fight about lobster. Everyone is concerned about the right to livelihood, the right to take care of one’s family, the right to be connected to the land that they grew upon and care for; values that are shared by everyone living on Turtle Island and that are ingrained in many covenants, agreements and treaties.  We have witnessed and experienced other examples when Canada and the Provinces have ignored their legal obligations and allowed violence and conflict to grow between Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities. Today, it is critical that the Prime Minister and Premiers uphold the rule of law through leadership and respect for Indigenous rights.

We are writing this open letter to raise Amnesty International’s serious concerns relating to the ongoing detention of women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, and to urge all W20 participants to take action in support of these brave women ahead of and during the Summit. 
For the past few years, the government of Saudi Arabia has been trying to improve its image, investing millions of dollars in a public relations campaign to encourage foreign states and businesses to invest in the country, as part of its flagship 2030 economic vision. During this period, the Saudi Arabian government initiated several reforms regarding women’s rights, such as allowing women the right to obtain a passport that should make it possible for them to travel without the permission of a male guardian. 
However, women and girls continue to face systematic discrimination in law and in practice in other areas such as marriage, divorce, inheritance and the ability to pass on citizenship to their children. Women and girls remain inadequately protected from sexual and other forms of violence and continue to be detained and charged by the authorities for disobeying their male guardians. Thus, despite the commitment of Saudi Arabia as a G20 state to implement the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls) and to uphold specific G20 commitments to end all forms of discrimination against women and girls and gender- based violence, it continues to violate basic women’s human rights and muzzle voices that demand equality. 
Indeed, behind the highly publicized initiatives and reforms, a brutal government campaign is being carried out of repression, intolerance and human rights violations, including against prominent women activists. While Saudi Arabian authorities point to women’s rights reforms such as lifting the driving ban on women in June 2018, several women activists who led the demand for the change have been arbitrarily detained since May 2018 and are now facing trial. These women had campaigned, some for decades, for the right to drive, the end of the repressive guardianship system, as well as political and civil rights for everyone in Saudi Arabia. For the first three months of their detention, several of them endured torture, sexual abuse and other forms of ill-treatment when they were held in solitary confinement with no access to their families or lawyers. Some of the women’s rights defenders were temporarily and provisionally released but continue to face trial and remain at risk of being sentenced to prison terms. However, Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima al-Sada, Samar Badawi, Nouf Abdulaziz, and Maya’a al-Zahrani remain locked up in prison, simply for demanding equality in the Kingdom. 
These brave women activists must be immediately and unconditionally released so they can continue their peaceful human rights work towards a better future for their country and people. 
This year, with the G20 under Saudi Arabia’s presidency, presents you with a unique opportunity to use your presence at the W20 to publicly and privately call on Saudi Arabian authorities to free jailed women activists and to undertake meaningful women’s and human rights reforms without which any claims of “progress” or “positive change” remain devoid of substance and value to people in Saudi Arabia, particularly to women. 
Your participation in the W20 must not be used in Saudi Arabia’s whitewashing of its international reputation while they continue to jail peaceful women activists. 
Therefore, Amnesty International urges you to use your leverage at the W20 meetings, privately and publicly, to:    
Amnesty International strongly believes that W20 participants have an opportunity and responsibility to stand with Saudi Arabian women human rights defenders in detention and encourage the implementation of meaningful human rights reforms. This is a rare chance for women’s rights organizations and activists to effect positive change in Saudi Arabia. It should be well utilized to inspire a brighter future for its people.

G20 Commitments on Gender Equality and Ending Gender-Based Violence  
In 2012, the G20 said, “We also express our firm commitment to advance gender equality in all areas”. (Leaders’ Declaration). 
In 2014, the G20 said, “We agree to the goal of reducing the gap in participation rates between men and women in our countries by 25 per cent by 2025.” (Leaders Declaration) and committed to “Address legal, regulatory, cultural and behavioural barriers to employment opportunities for women”. (Policy priorities for boosting female participation, quality of employment and gender equity 2014). 
In 2015, the G20 committed to implementing Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 5 (Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.)  (Leaders Declaration). In 2016, it announced an Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including a commitment to “Implement the 2030 Agenda domestically according to national priorities, needs and capacities, and internationally in fostering peaceful, just and inclusive societies which are free from fear and violence”.  
In 2017, the G20 said, “we are resolved to tackle common challenges to the global community, including … inequality including gender inequality, as a basis for sustainable development and stability”. (Leaders’ Declaration)  
It also committed to “take further action to improve the quality of female employment and eliminate employment discrimination and reduce gender compensation gaps and provide women with protection from all forms of violence” and to “protecting the human rights of all persons regardless of their status”. (Leaders’ Declaration).    
The effect of cyber-violence on women and girls was also noted in 2017, with the G20 encouraging “active prevention and response to cyber violence to ensure that online spaces are free from gender-based violence and safe spaces to allow women to be active digital citizens”. (G20 Initiative “#eSkills4Girls”: Transforming the Future of Women and Girls in the Digital Economy)  
In 2018, the G20 said it would “continue to promote initiatives aimed at ending all forms of discrimination against women and girls and gender- based violence” (Leaders’ Declaration).    
In 2019, G20 leaders reaffirmed they would “commit to take further action to improve the quality of women’s employment, reduce gender pay gaps, and end all forms of discrimination against women and combat stereotypes and to recognize women as agents of peace, and in the prevention and resolution of conflict” (Leaders’ Declaration).

The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined the vital importance of the home as a space in which we can evolve and feel safe. It has also, however, highlighted the situation of millions of people for whom their home is, paradoxically, the most insecure place for them. 
This includes people living in some of Colombia’s most natural resource-rich areas. For them, defending their homes has become a lethal activity. 
According to the most recent information from Global Witness, Colombia is the world’s most dangerous country for human rights defenders. For those defending rights to land, territory and the environment, the situation is even worse. 
Their demand is simple: to live in peace in their home. But, for them, that home is not a physical space with a bedroom, a living room and a kitchen; it is their territory, with its rivers, forests, plants and animals. 
This territory is also their hospital, where they find healing for their physical and psychological wounds. It is their sacred temple, used for rituals and to connect with deities. It is their supermarket, because the land gives them their food. And it is where friendships are forged, because everyone sees themselves as part of the same environment. 
Afro-descendant, indigenous and rural farming communities exercise collective ownership of the land and territory and it is they that are defending the resources that keep our planet – and us – breathing.

“The Amazon is important to me because it’s my home but it’s also home to many others. Those who don’t live in the Amazon are still linked to it, even if they don’t know it, because it helps them breath, it is one of the lungs of the planet,” defender Jani Silva told me as we sailed down the Putumayo River. 
And yet the natural wealth that offers them a way of life on the land is, paradoxically, the very thing that is putting them in most danger because armed groups and businesses want to exploit it and unscrupulous authorities are failing in their duty to protect them. 
Over the last year I’ve had a chance to meet many people who, like Jani, have been putting their lives on the line to defend their home and the environment for decades. Their stories have been captured in Amnesty International’s new report “Why do they want to kill us?” 
Many of them have paid a high price for their courageous work. Jani, for example, had to leave her community in 2018 because of constant threats and attacks from armed groups that invaded her territory following the departure of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) after the signing of the Peace Agreement in 2016. 
But these threats have made her even stronger and more determined. 
“No one’s going to stop me,” she says. “As long as there are abuses in the territory, I’ll keep denouncing them. One day, I’ll be able to go home.” 
Jani’s story of pain and courage is repeated across the country. 
Danelly Estupiñán, who defends the rights of Afro-descendant communities in the western city of Buenaventura, has also had to leave her home because of the threats she has suffered.

She says the attacks are in retaliation for her opposition to several infrastructure projects in this large port city. Fighting for recognition of the ancestral rights of Afro-descendant communities puts her in danger. The authorities have provided her with bodyguards but Danelly says that is not enough. What is needed, she says, is for the state to address the structural causes of violence against the communities. 
“These protective measures don’t mitigate the risk because the attacks aren’t really aimed at me, they’re aimed at the work I do. Anyone doing the same work would suffer the same attacks,” Danelly explains. 
In other areas of Colombia, including those where coca is grown and where the armed conflict is ongoing, the situation is even worse. 
María Ciro, a human rights defender I met in Catatumbo, in the east of the country, explains that the region’s communities live not only with the threat of armed groups and the army, but also with a lack of humanitarian aid from the government, which prevents them from finding viable substitutes for their illicit crops. 
 
“People have taken refuge in their homes, which means they can’t work in the fields or obtain food to eat,” María told me. 
People like María, who are working to defend these people, are stigmatized by the perception that rural farmers are linked to drug trafficking. 
Indigenous community leaders also spoke to me about the attacks against them. 
Mauro Chipiaje, an indigenous community leader from the Meta region, told me that once they were able to return to their territory in 2015, after decades of displacement, they realized that the environment had been destroyed and that other people were taking over. Today, they are struggling to get their homes and their lives back. 
Colombia is a country of paradoxes. On the one hand, it has some of the highest standards and the most protocols and institutions protecting human rights defenders, but at the same time more people are killed there than anywhere else for trying to protect the land and environment. 
One problem is that the authorities are not listening to the communities about the protective measures they need. Another is our apathy and failure to understand that all those who defend the land, territory and environment are protecting not only their own homes, but the very nature that keeps all of us on this planet alive.

This October, Eritrean plaintiffs reached an out of court settlement in their major corporate accountability lawsuit against Canadian mining company Nevsun Resources. The confidential agreement was reached after years of legal wrangling that spanned three continents. 
The case, filed in British Columbia in November 2014 by former mine workers Gize Yebeyo Araya, Kesete Tekle Fshazion and Mihretab Yemane Tekle, alleged that Nevsun was responsible for benefitting from gross human rights abuses such as slavery and forced labour, torture, and crimes against humanity during the construction of its copper, zinc and gold mine in Eritrea.

“After nearly six long years of litigation, we are celebrating the news that this case has finally been settled”, says Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “We are in awe of these brave individuals who shared their horrific experiences of forced labour, slavery, and torture, despite facing numerous legal barriers along the way. We hope this conclusion will send a strong message to all Canadian mining companies that they will be held accountable for human rights abuses associated with their operations anywhere in the world.” 
Nevsun fought against the case being heard in Canada all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada. Amnesty International was granted intervenor status in the appeal hearing and, together with the International Commission of Jurists, presented arguments about the right to an effective remedy under international law for victims of corporate human rights abuses. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court dismissed Nevsun’s appeal and allowed the case against the company to proceed in BC. The Court affirmed that customary international law is part of Canadian law, and as a Canadian company, Nevsun can be held accountable in Canada for serious allegations of this nature. 
  
Why is this significant?  
Foreign plaintiffs harmed by Canadian companies face immense barriers to justice when they attempt to bring lawsuits before Canadian courts. For many years, Canadian courts declined jurisdiction to hear corporate abuse cases, instead ruling that these cases should be heard in the country where the alleged harms occurred. In states without an independent judiciary, such as Eritrea, the idea that a case against a powerful foreign company for human rights harms could proceed fairly and without interference is highly unlikely. Therefore, the decision of Canada’s highest court to allow a case to be heard against a company for gross human rights abuses overseas is both significant and welcomed by Amnesty International. 
The settlement is protected by a confidentiality agreement and the full facts of the case will not be heard in court, leaving us with many questions about the role Canada played in supporting Nevsun’s bid to establish the Bisha mine in Eritrea as well as the decisions taken by the company to proceed with a joint venture with the Eritrean government. But the fact that the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the case could proceed, coupled with the confidential settlement, send a clear message to Canadian companies that there will be consequences for contributing to, or benefitting from, human rights abuses at operations abroad. 
Nevsun was acquired by Zijin Mining Group Company in late 2018. 
Please join Amnesty Canada in congratulating the former workers on their settlement and their stellar legal counsel in advancing this important case for corporate accountability in Canada. We wish the workers and their families good health and healing as they recover from their horrific experiences and thank them for their courage and tenacity in pursuing a corporate accountability lawsuit of this magnitude.

0,Americas: The COVID-19 pandemic must not be a pretext for human rights violations,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/americas-the-covid-19-pandemic-must-not-be-a-pretext-for-human-rights-violations/,"States in the Americas must prioritize a human rights-based approach to combating the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed widespread inequality and discrimination in the region, Amnesty International said in an open letter to the heads of state attending the General Assembly of the Organization of...","States in the Americas must prioritize a human rights-based approach to combating the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed widespread inequality and discrimination in the region, Amnesty International said in an open letter to the heads of state attending the General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS). 
“The strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic has, in many countries of the Americas, been characterized by repressive measures and the unnecessary use of force. Added to the structural challenges and massive social and economic divides present prior to the pandemic, these measures only combine to perpetuate inequality and discrimination across the continent,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
In countries such as El Salvador, Paraguay and Venezuela, among others, the strict measures taken to combat COVID-19 have included confining tens of thousands of people in state-run quarantine facilities under police or military control. The imposition of compulsory state-controlled quarantine, without knowledge of its duration, in environments that lack the most minimum measures of infection prevention and control, and without guarantees of independent procedures in accordance with international human rights law, could constitute arbitrary detention. Moreover, if quarantine centres promote discriminatory situations and the authorities do not provide adequate water, food and medical care, these conditions could constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and a violation of the right to health. 
In addition, in countries such as Chile and Nicaragua, where human rights violations and even crimes under international law, such as torture, have been committed in recent years, it is essential, by virtue of their shared duty to guarantee human rights, that OAS member states urge the competent national authorities to investigate such situations seriously and thoroughly. 
In the particular case of Nicaragua, it is imperative that measures are taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the country, that people detained simply for exercising their rights are released, and that actions are implemented to protect those working in the Nicaraguan health system from the intimidation they are suffering for disagreeing with government policies. 
Cooperation among the states of the Americas must furthermore ensure that medical treatments to combat COVID-19, plus any eventual vaccine, are made available and accessible without discrimination, establishing special measures to support specific groups at most risk from the virus or whose marginalized position means they could be disadvantaged when accessing vaccines or treatments. 
“The States of the Americas should seek to avoid exclusively national approaches to the allocation of treatment and any eventual vaccine against COVID-19. The efforts of international cooperation should be focused on avoiding the imposition of bilateral agreements over and above the regional needs of the continent’s population as a whole; it is these needs that must form the guiding criteria in this allocation, always in accordance with human rights norms and standards,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Amnesty International also believes that a strengthened Inter-American human rights system is essential at this historic moment. In this regard, the organization urges OAS member states and its Secretary General to respect the autonomy and independence of the bodies of the Inter-American human rights system. In addition, the organization is calling for independent channels of investigation to be established that will allow for adequate follow-up of any complaints that may have arisen within the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), thus ensuring compliance with all guarantees for the parties and transparency of public management, and possibly, if appropriate, establishing responsibilities and reparation measures. 
An Amnesty International delegation will be present at the 50th General Assembly of the Organization of American States, and spokespeople will be available for interview.

Across these states, flawed laws are being used to criminalize “false news” to summon, arrest, investigate and prosecute individuals who post content on social media about the pandemic or the government’s response to it. 
Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, said: 
“The GCC states have failed to justify how these measures are necessary and proportionate for the protection of public health. Individuals are being subjected to harassment and intimidation simply for discussing the pandemic online, in a clear breach of their right to freedom of expression. 
“Once again, GCC states opt for using what means they have at their disposal to silence any public debate, in this instance about the pandemic and are clearly more concerned about averting public scrutiny than about protecting public health. Access to information is in fact essential for keeping the public up to date on how to protect themselves from the virus. 
“We therefore call on the GCC states to not only put an end to such unwarranted practices and ensure people can express themselves without fear of reprisals, but also to urgently step up their efforts to ensure they are disseminating reliable, accessible, evidence-based and trustworthy information, which is crucial to counter false and misleading information.” 
Amnesty International has reviewed official statements by these countries, issued via government social media accounts and comments given by government sources for reporting in the controlled domestic press, for the period from March to present. 
Background 
The right to freedom of expression is protected under international human rights law, primarily under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Bahrain and Kuwait have both acceded to the Covenant. Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are among the roughly 7% of UN member states that are not parties to the Covenant. 
All of the GCC states have overbroad laws on “public security”, which are frequently used to punish protected expressions. In recent years, the Gulf countries have added new repressive statutes under the title of counterterrorism or cyber-security laws, but many provisions in their long-standing penal codes are also incompatible with the right to freedom of expression and continue to be used to suppress online critics. 
Blanket prohibitions on the dissemination of information, based on vague and ambiguous concepts such as “false news” or “spreading misinformation,” are incompatible with international human rights law and standards. International law does not permit general prohibitions of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of events.

0,Nigeria: Authorities must initiate genuine reform of the police,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/nigeria-authorities-must-initiate-genuine-reform-of-the-police/,"At least 10 people killed during protests  Hundreds of protesters injured and arrested  Sponsored thugs unleashing violence on peaceful protesters  Nigerian security forces must immediately end the intimidation, harassment and attacks on peaceful protesters, Amnesty International Nigeria said...","Nigerian security forces must immediately end the intimidation, harassment and attacks on peaceful protesters, Amnesty International Nigeria said today, after at least 10 people were killed and hundreds injured during ongoing nationwide protests demanding an end to police brutality and corruption.  
Since 8 October Nigerians have been occupying the streets of major towns and cities across 21 states of the country, demanding an end to police brutality, extrajudicial executions and extortion by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit of the Nigerian police tasked with fighting violent crimes.  
“These protesters have been met with violence and excessive use of force. Nigerians who took to the streets have had enough of the lawless activities of SARS, and what they deserve is tangible reforms that will protect the human rights of the people. Nigerians are skeptical of authorities’ pledge to end police atrocities because the past claims of reforming SARS have turned out to be empty words,” said Osai Ojigho Director, Amnesty International Nigeria.  
“That police are still using excessive force on peaceful protesters, leading to injuries and deaths in Lagos, Ughelli, Abuja and Ogbomosho, throws through the window claims of any commitment to ending violations of human rights by Nigeria police.   
“Firing live ammunition, water cannon, throwing tear gas into crowds, beating and arresting protesters is contrary to the Nigerian Constitution of 1999 [as amended] and international standards. Journalists were also targeted, beaten and their filming equipment was either confiscated or destroyed,” said Osai Ojigho.  
The rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are guaranteed by the Nigerian Constitution and it is completely unacceptable for the police – whose duty is to protect lives and property and uphold the rule of law – to use excessive force against protesters. The Nigerian authorities must immediately direct all security forces to protect peaceful protesters and refrain from attacking them.  
Empty promises of police reform  
In response to the nationwide protests, the Inspector General of Police on 11 October 2020, dissolved the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and called for the immediate redeployment of all SARS officers to other units.  
Despite the pronouncement and increasingly brutal repression of the demonstrations, thousands of Nigerians continue to protest. They are demanding the release of all arrested protesters, justice for victims of police brutality and adequate compensation for the victims and their families, as well as prosecution of those suspected to be responsible.  
Over the past five years, the Federal Government has promised to reform SARS several times. Despite these pledges of reform and accountability for violations, Amnesty International’s report shows that SARS officers continue to commit human rights violations with impunity.  
Anyone suspected to be responsible must be brought to justice in fair trials. Law enforcement officials must comply at all times with international human rights standards on policing, in particular the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, and in particular must respect, protect and ensure the rights to life, liberty, personal security and physical integrity and to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.  
“We call on the Nigerian authorities to listen to the demands of their people  and promptly, thoroughly, impartially, effectively and transparently investigate all cases of human rights violations by the police, including the unlawful killings of the #EndSARS protesters,” said Osai Ojigho.  
BACKGROUND  
For years Amnesty International has reported cases of unlawful killings, police brutality and campaigned against the use of torture by law enforcement agencies in Nigeria. In November 2014, we released a report “‘Welcome to hellfire’: Torture and other ill-treatment in Nigeria” that revealed that torture and other ill-treatment is widespread and routine in military and police custody across Nigeria. In 2016 we published another report that shows that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was  responsible for widespread torture and other ill-treatment of detainees in their custody. Our June 2020 report shows that SARS continue to commit human rights violations with total impunity despite promises of reform and accountability by the Federal Government.

0,Chile: National Police commanders must be criminally investigated for human rights violations,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/chile-national-police-commanders-must-be-criminally-investigated-for-human-rights-violations/,"The National Public Prosecutor’s Office must ensure that a number of individuals in command of Chile’s National Police, the Carabineros de Chile, including the Director General, Deputy Director General and Director of Public Order and Security, as well as certain operational commanders...","The National Public Prosecutor’s Office must ensure that a number of individuals in command of Chile’s National Police, the Carabineros de Chile, including the Director General, Deputy Director General and Director of Public Order and Security, as well as certain operational commanders within the Metropolitan Zone, are investigated for their possible responsibility for human rights violations committed during last year’s social demonstrations, Amnesty International today said in a new report issued on the first anniversary of the mass protests. 
In All Eyes on Chile: Police violence and command responsibility during the social protests, the organization analyzes the actions of national police officers between 18 October and 30 November 2019 and concludes that serious human rights violations, including that of the demonstrators’ right to physical integrity, were committed on a widespread basis because those in strategic command did not take all the necessary measures to prevent them. 
Although this cut-off date was used for methodological reasons, cases of excessive use of police force continued to be recorded until mid-March 2020 – when demonstrations temporarily ceased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Recently, and following a number of demonstrations in Santiago, new episodes of police violence have been recorded, such as the case of a 16-year-old youth who fell from a bridge after being pushed by a police officer, who is now being charged with attempted murder. 
“Those in strategic command of the national police allowed acts of torture and ill-treatment to be committed against demonstrators because they considered them to be a necessary evil in order to disperse the crowds at all costs. Through tacit orders or deliberate omissions, they encouraged cases as serious as that of Gustavo Gatica or Fabiola Campillai, among many others,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The chain of omissions that Amnesty International identified, along the institutional channels by which those in strategic command of the police force could have put an end to the human rights violations, shows that, far from being isolated acts committed by officials acting on their own initiative, acts of violence are likely to have been committed because of a policy whose ultimate aim was to discourage social protest.” 
The excessive use of force, abusive behaviour and impunity for human rights violations committed by the national police are not exclusive to the events that took place since October 2019 but are part of a constant and historical pattern that highlights the need for a thorough structural reform of the Chilean National Police, including effective and independent mechanisms for control and accountability. 
Strategic or managerial command 
Amnesty International carried out in-depth investigations into violations of the right to life and physical integrity of 12 people, through investigative files, court records, interviews with victims, human rights defenders and authorities, including prosecutors in charge of the investigations. In addition, the organization analyzed more than 200 video clips and made 14 formal requests for information from different ministries, including the Ministry of the Interior. 
The report shows that there is reason to believe that the Director General, the Deputy Director General and the Director of Public Order and Security of the national police, at the very least, would have known of the human rights violations through public and official information. Internal reports, for example, noted repeated and serious injuries caused every day by munitions fired from shotguns and the use of tear gas launchers, including eye injuries, totalling 347 cases as of 30 November. As of March 2020, according to the National Human Rights Institute, this figure stood at 460. 
It took those in strategic command, analyzed in the report, a month to restrict the use of this ammunition and they never banned it, despite an internal report showing how dangerous it was and that there had been more than 250 eye injuries. Although a “National Master Plan” was established to advise the Director General, the strategy and planning of operations management remained virtually unchanged despite this disaster. Protocols remained vague and unamended, and general orders were issued that were almost identical to the previous, with no specific instructions on minimizing the harm done. 
During the period under review by Amnesty International, virtually no disciplinary sanctions were handed down despite more than 4,000 complaints made to the Public Prosecutor’s Office about the Chilean National Police. Of the 170 sanctions announced by the police institution in July 2020, only 16 involved removal from office. In two of the cases that received such administrative sanctions, those of Fabiola Campillai and Gustavo Gatica, the conduct being punished was not related to the use of force. In others, despite the fact that National Police officers had accepted responsibility for serious injuries, they were not sanctioned. This allowed officials involved in human rights violations to remain in their posts, operating on a daily basis, and only encouraged a repetition of violations given the prevailing impunity within the institution. 
“National Police officers suppressed the protests by firing highly damaging, widely dispersed ammunition, contrary to international standards on the use of force. Far from banning these rubber and metal bullets as anti-riot munitions, as should have been the case, they were fired in an uncontrolled manner, sometimes with the intention of harming the protesters, or in the knowledge that this was likely to happen,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“In the month of October alone, national police officers fired over 104,000 rounds of such bullets. Disregard for the demonstrators’ physical safety caused more people to be seriously injured every day, regardless of the fact that such behaviour could, on many occasions, have constituted a criminal offence. A strategy of impunity was fostered by the lack of traceability of the ammunition used given that there were no traces left on the weapons from which they were fired.” 
Operative or tactical command 
Some of those in strategic command in the Metropolitan Region, such as the Chief of the Metropolitan Zone (STGO1) or the Chief of the Public Order, Control and Intervention Zone (STGO4), also failed to exercise due control over their subordinates, as was their duty, and directed and coordinated operations such as that of 8 November in the Plaza Italia, where Special Forces operatives fired their weapons indiscriminately and into highly lethal areas of the body. 
In that intervention alone, which was ordered by the Prefect of the Special Forces (G-1) and his sub-prefects (G-2 and G-3) and in which Gustavo Gatica was blinded, more than 2,000 rounds containing 12 pellets each were fired. Operations such as this were not the exception but the rule. Amnesty International identified that this modus operandi was repeated during the month and a half under analysis, and that these operations in the Metropolitan Region were carried out by the same officers, who fired unjustified and uncontrolled shots day after day, and sometimes through offensive strategies against demonstrators. Among the officers repeatedly identified were G-2 and G-3 – the latter was recently charged as a possible perpetrator of the injuries to Gustavo Gatica. 
“The fact that those in strategic command in the Metropolitan Region directed and coordinated operations and were directly involved in human rights violations would have encouraged the rest of their subordinates to operate in the same way against the protesters,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Executive responsibility 
Amnesty International believes that the policy implemented by those in command of the national police would not have occurred if President Sebastián Piñera’s administration had exercised adequate control. The executive branch’s attempts to do so were insufficient and the discourse in support of the work of the National Police favoured a continuity of this strategy. 
“All political, administrative and even criminal responsibility, up to the highest level, must be established with regard to all those who, in their position as guarantors, knew or should have known of the magnitude of human rights violations and did not prevent them, even though they had the capacity and the duty to do so,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
To ensure that events such as those considered in the report are not repeated, not only is it necessary to bring all those responsible to justice, at the highest level possible, but also to reform the institution of the National Police Force. 
“If this crisis has shown us anything, it’s that the Chilean National Police as an institution is obsolete and needs to adapt to the needs of the population, submitting itself fully to civilian power and exercising its functions with absolute respect for human rights, transparency and accountability,” Erika Guevara-Rosas added. 
The demands of the population that triggered the social demonstrations in Chile in the first place must also be heard. In this sense, Amnesty International considers that the process for adopting a new Constitution is a historic opportunity in which the economic and social rights demanded by the population must be guaranteed for everyone in Chile, without discrimination. 
Although not the subject of this report, Amnesty International also documented cases of human rights violations committed by members of the armed forces, who President Sebastián Piñera deployed to some regions of Chile between 18 and 28 October during a constitutional state of emergency, despite the fact that their role is not one of controlling public order during demonstrations. Army officers were accused of numerous acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and of using lethal ammunition against demonstrators on several occasions, and of killing three people in the context of protests. Criminal responsibility for these deaths and injuries must be immediately, impartially and thoroughly clarified. 
“The National Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Judiciary have a mammoth task ahead of them but one that is crucial to the country’s well-being: to end the tradition of impunity for human rights violations committed by the national police force. Justice, truth and reparation for victims is the best remedy for a wounded country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

The project has been prompted by a shared concern that children and adults are often unaware of children’s human rights, meaning that children are left vulnerable and without redress when these rights are not upheld. The book was written in consultation with child rights lawyer Geraldine Van Bueren QC, one of the drafters of the landmark convention that gave children their own unique set of rights for the first time. 
Know Your Rights (And Claim Them) is being published in September 2021 by Andersen Press in the UK and other publishers internationally. It comes at a time when unprecedented numbers of children are protesting around the world, in the streets and online, against the climate emergency, racism and gender inequality, among other issues. The book’s vision is for all teenagers to know and be able to claim their rights, no matter who they are or where they live. 
Angelina Jolie said: 
“Today we have youth engaged and ready to fight. But many struggle with misinformation from adults, a lack of awareness of their rights, and a lack of knowledge of how to use the specifics of their rights, applying them to the country and circumstances in which they live. We need to give them the tools to strengthen their fight and empower them. Amnesty, Geraldine and I hope to get these books into the hands of young people, and for them to be a guide that they can carry with them and use. Not just to inform them, but to activate them and serve as a source of reference where needed.” 
The book is aimed at children 13 years and up, and sets out the main groups of rights and how they apply in the real world in relation to a range of issues including freedom of expression, gender and racial equality, health, a clean climate and a sustainable environment.  Each group of rights is accompanied by real-life accounts of child activists who have fought to make a difference in every corner of the world, as well as quotes in their own voices. 
It also includes a guide for children on how to claim their rights – through campaigning and protesting, educating themselves and others, navigating the law and challenging injustice at home, in school or in the community and at national and international levels. 
“We at Amnesty are delighted to work with Angelina Jolie, Geraldine Van Bueren and young people from around the world to create this powerful book. It has been desperately needed since the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child gave children their own unique set of rights,” said Nicky Parker, Publisher and Literary Partnerships Lead at Amnesty International. 
“Many children face daily violations, like extreme hunger, homelessness and trafficking. But whoever they are and wherever they live, they have the right to know their rights. This book empowers young people with the facts and the tools they need to stand up for themselves and each other.”

“For us kids in Australia we had the stolen generations and Aboriginal kids are still being taken away from their parents by the government. This history of fighting (resistance) lives in us. In our blood it runs. We need to learn about our rights, at home and at school, and share everywhere what happened and is happening to kids like us.

“This regressive step is a fig leaf that deflects attention from the lack of real action to address the appalling brutality faced by so many Bangladeshi women. Executions perpetuate violence, they don’t prevent it. Instead of seeking vengeance, the authorities must focus on ensuring justice for the victims of sexual violence including through delivering the long-term changes that would stop this epidemic of violence and prevent it from recurring. That means, for example, ensuring that Bangladeshi women and girls are protected and that they feel safe coming forward and reporting crimes. Perpetrators must be prosecuted and held accountable and the impunity for these horrific crimes must come to an end – but through fair proceedings and without resort to the death penalty.”  
Background 
Following large-scale protests calling for an end to impunity for rape against women and girls, the Bangladeshi cabinet approved the draft Women and Children Repression Prevention (Amendment) Bill, amending Section 9(1) of the existing Prevention of Women and Children Repression Act 2000, to increase the highest punishment for rape from life imprisonment to the death penalty.

At least two thousand Rohingya refugees have been forced to flee their shelters to other camps since violence broke out between two rival factions seeking to control the illicit trade of contraband drugs inside the camps. On 7 October, around a dozen shelters in Kutupalong refugee camp were burned to the ground.  
“The situation inside the camps is highly precarious and, unless the authorities take the necessary action to quell the violence and protect refugees, there’s a serious risk of further bloodshed,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner.   
“Those suffering most are the Rohingya refugees caught in the middle. The Bangladeshi authorities must heighten security inside the camps as long as necessary to ensure their safety and launch an immediate and impartial investigation into the violence to bring those responsible to justice.”  
Rohingya refugees told Amnesty International that the clash broke out between a group that has been operating a drug cartel within the refugee camp and another armed group called the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) as they vie for control of the camps. The violence reportedly started after negotiations over a partnership between the two groups broke down. Local media reports say that both groups have been using locally made guns and iron bars.  
The Bangladeshi authorities dispatched additional security personnel to the camps on 6 October, but violent clashes have continued. Last month, AKM Mozammel Huq, a Bangladeshi government minister, said that watchtowers and close circuit television cameras would be installed to increase surveillance inside the camps.  
According to Rohingya refugees who spoke to Amnesty International, the violence was sparked in part by a battle for control over the trade of methamphetamine tablets, a recreational drug manufactured in Myanmar and smuggled into Bangladesh. In light of the Bangladeshi government’s violent ongoing crackdown on the illegal drug trade, which includes allegations of extrajudicial executions, there are fears among refugees that the intensifying clashes are putting everyone in the camps at even greater risk.  
According to Bangladesh’s human rights organization Odhikar, the Bangladeshi authorities killed more than 100 Rohingya refugees in alleged extrajudicial executions between August 2017 and July 2020 purportedly in crackdowns on the illegal drug trade in Cox’s Bazaar.  
“The authorities should not take any measures that violate the human rights of the refugees. The violence is being committed by people belonging to criminal gangs, who should be held to account in fair trials for violent crimes,” said Saad Hammadi.  
Rohingya refugees are also afraid that Bangladesh’s government could use the ongoing violence as a pretext to relocate them to Bhashan Char, a remote silt island in the Bay of Bengal that has yet to complete the United Nations’ assessment for safe habitation. The refugees told rights groups including Amnesty International that they do not wish to relocate to the island out of fear of unsafe conditions and isolation.  
“Relocating the refugees to Bhashan Char will neither end their current insecurity nor bring about a durable solution to the refugee crisis. Instead, authorities must engage with the Rohingya refugees, take note of their concerns and ensure participation in the decisions that affect them,” said Saad Hammadi.  
Background 
More than 740,000 Rohingyas fled their homes in Myanmar after the country’s military committed atrocity crimes against the minority group in retaliation against a series of attacks committed by ARSA fighters on 30 Myanmar security posts on 25 August 2017. Rohingya refugees told Amnesty International that they are worried about their safety due to the presence of ARSA, as well as other criminal gangs in the camps that continue to operate and expand their network through the illicit trade of arms and contraband drugs.  
Amnesty International released the report Let Us Speak For Our Rights in September, calling on Bangladesh’s government and the local and international community to work together to develop a publicly accessible, transparent and rights-respecting policy document to ensure the representation of Rohingya refugees in decisions that affect them.

It’s like opening a dam – if I let my feelings out, I don’t know if I’ll be able to hold them in again.” This is...","By Tamaryn Nelson, Amnesty International’s Researcher on the Right to Health 
“I called my therapist once in the middle of the chaos, but I felt I couldn’t speak. It’s like opening a dam – if I let my feelings out, I don’t know if I’ll be able to hold them in again.” 
This is what  Annalisa*, a care home worker in Italy, told Amnesty International about the toll the pandemic has taken on her mental health. Like many health workers around the world,  Annalisa has put her own wellbeing on hold throughout the pandemic. 
But even during the peak of the crisis, when  Annalisa was preoccupied by immediate challenges like PPE shortages, she felt  the severity of the psychological impact. Annalisa said she developed a stammer and had nightmares, but staff shortages made it difficult to take time off. 
The right to the highest attainable standard of mental health is enshrined in international law, but globally relatively few people have access to quality mental health services. The World Health Organization says that in low- and middle-income countries, more than 75% of people with mental, neurological and substance use disorders receive no treatment at all. 
COVID-19 has exacerbated the problem – a recent WHO survey found that the pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide. Meanwhile, demand is increasing. Although everyone has felt the psychological impact of the pandemic, many health workers have been exposed to trauma on a daily basis and need extra support. 
During dozens of interviews with health workers, Amnesty has heard time and again how PPE shortages and grueling hours pose mental as well as physical health risks. Health workers who are expected to go to work without adequate protection feel undervalued, demoralized and angry. But given the low pay and precarious contracts that are endemic in parts of the sector, many have little choice but to carry on. 
Sarah*, who works in a  care home in the UK, said she had joined a union after finding out that agency workers brought in to cover shifts were being paid more than the other staff. She was angry about what she calls “poverty wages”, and the fact that care home workers were coming in to work unwell because they only get statutory sick pay . Sarah spoke about the psychological impact the isolation had on the residents of the care home: 
So when Sarah’s manager called her on her day off and asked her to come in, she agreed. 
“I felt exhausted, but I was thinking about residents. Who is going to attend them? Probably agency workers. But when you are permanent you know your residents’ needs.” 
Laly*, a home care worker in France, said the French government underestimates the strain the pandemic has put on people in her profession. Health workers who visit patients in their homes were excluded from France’s bonus scheme until August; although the bonus has now been extended, Laly is angry about the low pay and poor conditions. 
She points out that many in her sector are effectively paid below minimum wage, and that the vast majority are women. Laly said she sometimes works from 6 am to 9pm with just an hour’s break, helping vulnerable people shower, use the toilet, eat, and dress. Despite this, Laly said her company did not initially provide workers with masks; Laly was eventually given masks by nurses who lived nearby. Laly worries that if there is a second spike, many home care workers will resign: 
“Many people are burned out, they have depression … If we really get into a second wave, it’s going to pose a real problem for the authorities, because there are a lot of home care workers who are going to go on medical leave. Despite their dedication, they will not go back to working like that.” 
Many health workers Amnesty spoke to said they felt demoralised by the inequalities they saw in decisions about PPE. Ronald*, a hospital pharmacist in Indonesia, said he was left without adequate protection and support when pharmaceutical workers were reclassified as “non-medical personnel” – even though pharmacists also have direct contact with COVID-19 patients. 
Tshepo*, a radiographer from South Africa, contracted COVID-19 after going to work without adequate PPE; radiographers were not considered a “high risk” group despite coming into contact with COVID-19 patients daily, and were not provided with N-95 masks until April. Tshepo also expressed concern about the lack of rehabilitation for staff who had contracted the virus, and stressed that the trauma of being diagnosed with a potentially deadly illness has lasting consequences: 
“My body has not healed completely. It has affected my breathing, sinuses and I am fatigued. We should go through physiotherapy to assist with healing, and counselling for the trauma.” 
Seven months into the pandemic, it’s high time that governments start giving proper consideration to the wellbeing of health workers. 
There are many practical steps that managers of health care facilities can take. They should rotate workers from higher-stress to lower-stress functions; partner inexperienced workers with more experienced colleagues; and initiate, encourage and monitor work breaks. There needs to be flexibility for workers who are directly impacted by the virus, and all staff should be given information about how to access mental health services. 
The dedication of health workers is humbling, but calling them “heroes” ignores the fact that these are human beings; and no human being makes it unscathed through months of proximity to death and illness, gruelingly long hours and minimal pay. 
On World Mental Health Day, there needs to be a global effort to protect health workers and address the full range of challenges the pandemic has posed for their lives and wellbeing. We all owe a great debt to people like Annalisa, Sarah, Laly, Ronald and Tshepo, and it’s time for governments to take concrete action to show how much they are valued. If health workers are not safe, neither are we.

This evidence is based on firsthand testimony, photographs and video obtained from inside Rakhine State, and analysis of satellite imagery as well as media reports and civil society sources. Witnesses’ names have been changed.  
“There are no signs of the conflict between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military abating – and civilians continue to bear the brunt,” said Ming Yu Hah, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns.  
“The Myanmar military’s utter disregard for civilian suffering grows more shocking and brazen by the day. The UN Security Council must urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court.”  
Amnesty International is also concerned at recent reports of an increased presence of Myanmar military troops along the Myanmar-Bangladesh border. Images of antipersonnel landmines recently found in a civilian area were analyzed by Amnesty’s weapons expert and identified as the MM2 type landmine often used by the Myanmar military. This device is larger than most anti-personnel landmines, and typically inflicts severe damage. 
 
Both the Arakan Army and Myanmar military use antipersonnel devices, and as such definitively establishing provenance is not always possible. Current restrictions on access preclude on-the-ground documentation efforts by Amnesty International. 
 
Several incidents involving civilians injured or killed by landmines have been credibly reported in Rakhine and Chin States in recent months by local civil society and media outlets. 
 
One of the most recent instances was on September 18, when a 44-year-old Chin woman stood on a landmine while collecting bamboo shoots near the Myanmar military’s Light Infantry Battalion 289 base in Paletwa. She died of her injuries a short time after.  
Amnesty International also notes with alarm recent local media reports of the Myanmar military using Rohingya children for forced portering in Buthidaung Township, in an area where clashes with the Arakan Army are ongoing.  
‘I didn’t think it could be our village’  
On the morning of 8 September 2020, Maung Soe* was at work near his village of Nyaung Kan in Myebon Township when he heard heavy weaponry, which he describes as sounding like thunder.  
“I didn’t think it could be our village. I thought it was somewhere else. I tried to call my wife and she wasn’t answering. I heard it two times — jain, jain — within one minute.  
“I went to the village and I heard some people got injured. When I got home, my wife and my daughter were laid down on the floor. [My wife] was not saying anything. I tried to check my [seven-year-old] daughter and she was still alive. I picked up my daughter and tried to get out.  
“I didn’t see [any soldiers]. The weapon came from very far. And when I tried to run by hugging my daughter’s body, there was more shooting. I tried to lay over my daughter’s body, near the stream. Within two minutes, my daughter passed away.  
“Even after my daughter passed away, I could still hear the weapons coming… I had to run away, leaving my daughter’s body. I came back later when they stopped shooting.”   
Maung Soe says there were no Arakan Army fighters in Nyaung Kan. Villagers believe the heavy weaponry was fired from a Myanmar military base near the border with Ann Township.  
The shelling at Nyaung Kan village in Myebon Township claimed the lives of five people, including Maung Soe’s wife and daughter. All were from the Rakhine ethnic group, and two were seven-year-old children. Ten others were wounded in the attack.  
By one local civil society group’s estimate, the number of civilians killed in this conflict since December 2018 in Rakhine and Chin States stands at 289, with 641 injured. 
 
The true figure cannot be independently verified, as a mobile internet shutdown and broader government crackdowns on media reporting have impeded documentation efforts in conflict-affected areas. However, in July 2020, Amnesty International was able to document indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling by the Myanmar military, killing or injuring civilians, including children.  
On 14 September, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet told the Human Rights Council that in some recent cases in Rakhine State, civilians “appear to have been targeted or attacked indiscriminately, which may constitute further war crimes or even crimes against humanity.”  
Maung Soe is now displaced, and says he wants to see the Myanmar military withdraw from Rakhine State to prevent further harm: “As I suffer, and as I have lost my family, I don’t want any other Rakhine people to have a similar experience in the future.”  
‘One from the road and one from the mountain’: Burned village attacked from two directions  
Satellite analysis and new witness testimony gathered by Amnesty International suggest that Myanmar soldiers burned a village in central Rakhine State’s Kyauktaw Township in early September. 
 
One witness, villager U Kyaw Tin*, who lives in the area, told Amnesty International that he was walking with his cow when the Myanmar military launched an assault on Hpa Yar Paung began on 3 September.  
 
“[They] started shooting, they entered the village. I didn’t know exactly where the shooting came from … We were trying to run to the other side. We didn’t really see what exactly was going on, because we all were running.”  
He said that it appeared the village was closed in on by the Myanmar military from two directions: “Two [sets of] troops, one from each side – one from the road and one from the mountain. There was also shooting from [a remote location], but there was also something from the roadside, coming in by car.”  
A spokesperson for the Myanmar military, Major General Zaw Min Tun, told journalists a police vehicle was attacked by the Arakan Army with a remotely detonated improvised explosive device (IED) near the village.  
According to information supplied to Amnesty International, the Myanmar military were seen arresting two Rakhine men from the village that evening. Their bodies were reportedly found near the river with gunshot wounds the next morning.  
Their bodies have since been transported by the military for postmortem in Kyauktaw. The Myanmar military told the media “two enemy bodies and a gun” were seized from the site.   
“[The Myanmar military] started the arson attack around 9pm,” U Kyaw Tin told Amnesty International. “After they finished the arson attack they went to another site near the hill and they started to also attack there.”  
Satellite image analysis conducted by Amnesty International has found that over 120 structures in the ethnic Rakhine-populated villages of Taung Pauk and Hpa Yar Paung villages in Kyauktaw Township appeared burned to the ground, in imagery captured on 10 September 2020.  
Amnesty International also examined satellite sensor data from 3 September which showed thermal anomalies. Additionally, Amnesty International analysed a video of the charred village of Hpar Yar Paung, recorded on 4 September from a passing vehicle, which revealed a ground-level snapshot of the extensive destruction. All three information sources appear consistent with reports of the blaze on the night of 3 September 2020.  
U Kyaw Tim said around 80 houses were completely destroyed, and over 90 damaged. Hpar Yar Paung’s 500 residents are now displaced inside Kyauktaw Township, dependent on aid from Rakhine civil society groups in Kyauktaw town.  
New figures from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) indicate that 89,564 people were displaced to 180 sites in Rakhine State between January 2019 and 7 September 2020.  
These figures are based on numbers provided by the Rakhine State government and UNOCHA’s humanitarian partners. Local civil society groups indicate the true displacement figure is likely higher, as villagers have fled to areas now only nominally under government control. 
 
This adds to the existing mass displacement crisis in Rakhine, where over 130,000 Rohingya have been interned in camps since 2012.  
‘We didn’t know anything’: Internet shutdown amid the pandemic  
The mobile internet shutdown that had been in place across parts of Rakhine State and neighboring Chin State for the last year was partially lifted in August; however, the authorities have throttled network speeds to 2G in some of the areas most affected by armed conflict.  
The Myanmar government had stated the mobile internet blackout was necessary to prevent “incitement” and remote detonations of anti-personnel explosive devices by the Arakan Army. 
However, the blackout has impeded the delivery of critical humanitarian aid and access to crucial information about the conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic, with the virus increasingly spreading across Myanmar since mid-August, including and particularly in Rakhine State.  
In Maung Soe’s case, the lack of connectivity meant his village has been kept in the dark about the scale and location of fighting.  
“We don’t have any connection and we don’t know anything about what’s going on, about the conflict and the attacks in other places,” said Maung Soe.  
In addition to the internet blackout, humanitarian access remains severely curtailed by government edict across much of Rakhine State and a township in Chin State.   
Healthcare access in Rakhine State remains abysmal, and particularly so for the Rohingya population, who have long been subject to severe movement restrictions and, often, extortion by police and military. 
 
The Myanmar government should ensure full, unfettered access to humanitarian actors and allow all people in the state to access healthcare.  
Amnesty International is concerned that the sweeping powers granted under COVID-19 orders are ripe for abuse – particularly in conflict-affected areas.  
Impunity and secrecy mar military sexual violence scandal 
 
On 11 September 2020, the Myanmar military admitted that three of its soldiers had raped an ethnic Rakhine woman during operations in Rathedaung Township on 30 June despite their outright denials when the allegations were first raised in July.  
Last week, in a statement on the incident, the military publicly named the survivor but not the perpetrators.  
“Even when the Myanmar military are compelled to admit wrongdoing, their handling of this appalling sexual violence case shows a complete neglect for accountability,” said Ming Yu Hah.  
“These shocking events speak volumes about the Tatmadaw, and how deep the assumption of impunity runs within its ranks.”  
“The international community must raise the alarm about the situation in Rakhine State now, or face questions later about why they failed to act – again.”

Thanks to support from you and others around the world, including during Amnesty’s Write for Rights 2016 campaign, Narges has finally been released, reunited with her family, and can now access the medical treatment she needs.  
Now is the time to re-double our efforts on behalf of other women human rights defenders who remain in prison in Iran. Please take action in support of Nasrin Sotoudeh, Yasaman Aryani, and Atena Daemi.  
Thank you so much for your support and for speaking out in solidarity with unjustly imprisoned human rights defenders like Narges. 
  
More about Narges:   
Narges Mohammadi is an Iranian women human rights defender who campaigns for women’s rights and against the death penalty. Narges has suffered years of harassment by authorities, punctuated by intermittent periods in detention, which have inflicted a devastating toll on Narges’ health and family.  
Most recently, in May 2015, she was arrested and taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison. The next year, the Iranian government sentenced Narges to 16 years in prison after an unfair trial. 
Narges has consistently received degrading and inhumane treatment from prison officials. Suffering from a blood clot in her lungs and a neurological disorder, she requires specialized medical care that cannot be provided in prison. Earlier this year, she started showing COVID-19 symptoms, adding further urgency to the call for her release.  
Authorities have consistently used access to her children as a tool to punish her, denying her telephone contact. She undertook a hunger strike to protest the authority’s refusal to let her speak with her children, which triggered global outrage and thousands of people, including more than 100,000 Iranians, posted messages in solidarity through a Twitter campaign. After 20 days and extensive global campaigning, Narges was able to speak with her children.  
This cruel punishment for her “crimes” reflects the Iranian authorities’ recently intensified repression of women’s rights activists in the country.

Kafkaesque is an overused cliché but in the case of Osman Kavala, it is chillingly apt.” 
“The European Court of Human Rights ruled last December that Osman Kavala’s prolonged pre-trial detention was unlawful and served an ‘ulterior purpose’. Yet, Turkey refuses to implement the binding judgment and to release him. 
“Once again, we call on Turkey to end the shameful injustice that Osman Kavala has been subjected to, by freeing him from prison and dropping these manifestly vindictive proceedings against him.”

BACKGROUND 
The news of the new 64-page indictment came a week after a meeting of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers renewed its call on Turkey to comply with the European Court’s judgment for the release of Osman Kavala. On 29 September, Turkey’s Constitutional Court announced its decision to postpone the ruling regarding the legality of Osman Kavala’s ongoing pre-trial detention, stating that it would wait for the new indictment. A new date for the Constitutional Court’s considerations of the individual application is not known. 
The new indictment presents Osman Kavala’s civil society initiatives consisting of cultural projects, details of his travel inside Turkey and abroad as ‘evidence’ of the two charges; his previous prosecution in the Gezi trial is referenced without mentioning that he was acquitted of all charges in February 2020. This decision is currently pending on appeal. 
In September and in October, the Committee of Ministers called for the immediate release of Osman Kavala and for the elimination of the  negative consequences of the violation found by the ECtHR and “underlined, therefore, the need to ensure that the appeal which is pending against the applicant’s acquittal of the previous charge brought against him in relation to the Gezi Park events of 2013 and the current investigation into his alleged involvement in the attempted coup of July 2016 are concluded without further delay on the basis of the Court’s findings”.

The organization said the international community had broken the promise, enshrined in international law, to ensure the highest attainable standard of mental health for everyone. 
“A tiny fraction of the international health aid budget is devoted to mental health, and refugees and migrants are often cut off from even the scarce services available. It’s clear that the mental health of people seeking safety has never been a priority for the international community – this needs to change,” said Charlotte Phillips, Head of the Refugee and Migrant Rights Team at Amnesty International. 
“Asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, many of whom already face barriers to housing, employment and healthcare, have been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 crisis. The longstanding failure of most governments to provide adequate mental health services for refugees and migrants means they are facing the uncertainty and isolation of the pandemic without support.” 
Amnesty International is calling on all governments to remove barriers that prevent refugees and migrants from accessing mental health services and support. Wealthier countries must also increase support to lower income countries, to ensure that the most marginalized people in society are receiving the support they are entitled to. 
Abusive policies exacerbating suffering 
The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health systems at a time when social isolation, socio-economic decline and unemployment mean mental health services are needed more than ever. This affects citizens and long-term residents as well as people on the move. 
However, the mental health needs of refugees, many of whom have survived terrible ordeals, can be significantly different than those of the rest of the population. 
Instead of supporting the wellbeing of refugees and migrants, many of whom also face racism, hostility, poverty and unemployment in host countries, many governments have pursued abusive policies and practices which have had a well-documented harmful impact on mental health. 
For example, Australia’s deliberatively punitive policy of detaining asylum seekers in Nauru led to a high incidence of suicide attempts and self-harm. In the US, Amnesty International found that family separation policies have inflicted such severe mental suffering that they amount to torture.  
Lack of data illustrates neglect 
There is very little recent data on the availability of mental health services for refugees and migrants. This is a problem in itself, breaching states’ obligations to monitor their compliance with the duty to provide accessible mental health services for everybody, and illustrates how severely the mental health needs of refugees and migrants have been neglected. 
The information that is available makes it clear that services are wholly inadequate. The vast majority (85%) of the world’s refugees live in low-or middle-income countries. The annual median per capita funding for all mental health services in these countries is deeply inadequate, ranging from USD 0.02 in low-income countries to USD 1.05 in lower-middle income countries. 
Moreover, high-income countries are failing to support less wealthy nations in their efforts to provide mental health services to their populations. Between 2007 and 2013, only 1% of the world’s budget for international health aid was devoted to mental health. On top of this, many countries use immigration status to determine whether people can access health services, further obstructing access for refugees and migrants. 
Amnesty International is calling on all governments to ensure that their health policies fully integrate refugees and migrants, whilst also ending migration policies and practices that violate human rights and cause mental distress, such as separating families and detaining children. Where lower income countries lack the resources and capacity to respect, protect and fulfil the right to health of people in their jurisdictions, wealthier states must respond and provide the necessary support. 
“The emotional impact of the pandemic will be felt for years to come. We call on all governments to ensure adequate mental health services are available to anyone who needs them, including refugees and migrants,” said Charlotte Phillips. 
“Any system of mental health care and treatment which excludes whole groups of society such as refugees and migrants is not fit for purpose.”

0,Colombia: New report shows how failed policies are putting human rights defenders at risk,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/colombia-new-report-shows-how-failed-policies-are-putting-human-rights-defenders-at-risk/,"The frequent threats, attacks and killings of people defending land, territory and the environment in Colombia have highlighted the government’s failure to address the serious crisis facing the country’s human rights defenders, Amnesty International said in a new report published today. Why do...","The frequent threats, attacks and killings of people defending land, territory and the environment in Colombia have highlighted the government’s failure to address the serious crisis facing the country’s human rights defenders, Amnesty International said in a new report published today. 
Why do they want to kill us? The lack of a safe space to defend human rights in Colombia examines the reasons behind the violence against community leaders living in geographically strategic and natural resource-rich areas. The report also analyses the ineffectiveness of the protection measures implemented by the government since the Peace Agreement signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016. 
“For years, Colombia has been one of the world’s most dangerous countries for people who are defending human rights, territory, and natural resources. Since the Peace Agreement was signed in 2016, however, things have got even worse, particularly for those living in geographically strategic and natural resource-rich areas,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
“Defenders will continue to die until the government effectively addresses structural issues such as the deep inequality and marginalization suffered by communities, ownership and control of the land, substitution of illicit crops, and justice.” 
The report examines the cases of four communities at particular risk: the Process of Black Communities (PCN) in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca; the Catatumbo Social Integration Committee (CISCA) in Norte de Santander; the Kubeo-Sikuani Indigenous Ancestral Settlement (ASEINPOME) in Meta; and the Association for the Sustainable Integrated Development of the Perla Amazónica (ADISPA) in Putumayo. 
Representatives from each of the communities told Amnesty International of the threats and attacks they have suffered while defending land and the environment. Members of CISCA, for example, explained that because they live in one of Colombia’s largest coca-producing areas, they are stigmatized, harassed, attacked and accused of supporting the armed groups that operate in the area. 
Indigenous peoples’ communities throughout the country also suffer frequent attacks due to their defence of land and natural resources. In the department of Meta, for example, the failure to recognize the land rights of the Kubeo-Sikuani indigenous community has left them unprotected and under threat on their lands. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has put human rights defenders at even greater risk, masking the violent contexts they are facing and the lack of protection they are receiving from the authorities. During the pandemic, the authorities have reduced the protection schemes in place for some defenders, and authorized activities that put communities at increased risk, such as natural resource extraction, police operations and forced eradication of illicit crops. 
Colombia has established a range of measures, at least on paper, to protect human rights defenders. At least 14 of these measures directly or indirectly address the issue of collective protection. However, the institutions and their programmes are plagued by ineffectiveness. 
The National Protection Unit only grants measures such as guards, mobile phones and armoured cars on a highly individual basis, and generally within urban areas. The Early Warning System, designed to provide collective protection, is of little effect because there are no consequences for state bodies that fail to comply with its measures. The set of actions adopted by the Colombian authorities to prevent risk, counteract threats and minimize the vulnerabilities of groups and communities (known as the Collective Protection Route) are also not being effectively implemented. 
“Although, in theory, Colombia has one of the most comprehensive protection systems in the region, it is ineffective because the authorities refuse to take preventive action to address the structural causes of collective violence against defenders,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“The range of protective measures is so extensive and so complex that many defenders say they simply do not know how to use them or that they are not what is needed in their communities. If they truly want to protect environmental defenders, the Colombian authorities need to listen to the communities at risk, help them improve the strategies already in place and ensure justice for those who attack them.” 
Amnesty International has launched a campaign calling on the public to take action to ensure that human rights defenders in Colombia are able to carry out their work safely and with protection.

The letter, which can be found here, conveys Amnesty International’s grave concerns about racist policing practices used disproportionately against Black people in the USA, and demands the police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd be held accountable. 
“It is shameful that over four months have gone by since the horrifying killing of George Floyd without any meaningful commitments from the US government to prevent this kind of crime from occurring again,” said Julie Verhaar, Acting Secretary General of Amnesty International. “It appears that the US government is more committed to the status quo of law enforcement in the country, which is rife with racist policing practices and lack of accountability, rather than listening to the global outcry for racial justice and an end to police violence. It is abhorrent and unacceptable that the Trump administration has failed to address the police’s use of lethal force to deprive Black people of their right to life, time and time again.” 
Additional information: 
Amnesty International is calling for meaningful reforms to end police violence and demanding that the US government respect, protect, and fulfill the human rights of Black people. 
Amnesty International USA responded to the June 16 Trump executive order on policing, referring to it as a “Band-aid for a bullet wound”. 
Additionally, Amnesty International has documented the excessive use of force by police across the USA in response to the protests of George Floyd’s killing. An investigation carried out by the organization analyzed widespread and egregious human rights violations carried out by police forces across the USA in response to largely peaceful assemblies protesting systemic racism and police violence, including the killing of Black people. Amnesty International in the USA has created a guide for law enforcement officials policing demonstrations.

With the child having been repatriated, there are 46 documented cases of Canadian citizens who remain in arbitrary detention in Northeast Syria, 25 of whom are children. 
Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, added the following: “Canadian citizens in Northeast Syria have been suffering daily human rights abuses for over 18 months, be it in displaced persons camps or in Syrian jails. Canada’s repatriation of Amira demonstrates that while providing consular assistance in Syria is undoubtedly challenging, it can be done.

0,We have come far and have far to go still ,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/we-have-come-far-and-have-far-to-go-still/,"35 years ago, on a wintry evening in early 1985, I attended my first Amnesty International meeting.    I had just begun studying law at Dalhousie University in Halifax, with an entirely unformed notion of becoming a lawyer pursuing social change. I had seen an intriguing notice on a...","35 years ago, on a wintry evening in early 1985, I attended my first Amnesty International meeting.    
I had just begun studying law at Dalhousie University in Halifax, with an entirely unformed notion of becoming a lawyer pursuing social change. I had seen an intriguing notice on a bulletin board giving details about the monthly meeting of the Halifax Amnesty group. I went, and never looked back.    
I remember three things about that evening. First, the inspiring and welcoming Amnesty members I met were of all ages, backgrounds and interests, and from many different corners of the world; but were all united in a common sense of purpose and possibility. It was the evening I first heard of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and our shared responsibility to uphold it.    
Second, as a young activist I was energized by Amnesty’s “be the change” message. Yes, it is a world full of deeply entrenched cruelty and injustice, which can readily seem insurmountable. But here is one step to take, one letter to write – right now – to begin to make a difference. It was empowering in 1985 and certainly has powerful and necessary resonance in 2020. I wrote my first Amnesty letter that night, on behalf of a law student named Beatriz who had been forcibly disappeared in El Salvador.     
And finally, the student who aspired to be a different sort of lawyer was hooked as well. For human rights violations are rooted in many things and human rights protection requires deep change and transformation; but law – bad law, good law, the absence of law, the misuse of law, the repressiveness of law, the inadequacy of law, the rule of law, and the potential of law – is clearly at the heart of both the injustice that prevails and the justice that must triumph.  
I never would have imagined the remarkable journey that began that night. And it never occurred to me it would lead to the humbling honour of serving as Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada for more than twenty years.  
As I move on and hand the candle to the brilliant and inspiring Ketty Nivyabandi, I am filled with gratitude, memories and reflection.  
First, for the gift of learning and the responsibility to change.    
Every moment of every day has made it clear. There is so much to learn and unlearn about human rights. Why they matter. What they offer. Who they lift up and who they leave behind. The roots of injustice. My own part in those realities. I have learned from hundreds of people who have so generously shared their experience and wisdom with me. My teachers have been everywhere.  
The overarching lesson? That as a white, male lawyer living in the Global North, a settler in Canada, I enjoy immense privilege that challenges me to come to the human rights struggle with humility and honesty, and to acknowledge that working to change the world must include constantly working to change myself and my place in the world. And I still have far to travel.    
That holds true for our movement. Demands and long overdue need to address systemic racism, white supremacy and colonialism across society have become increasingly urgent and pressing. That means not only looking to the outside world; but looking within Amnesty and within ourselves as well.   
This is learning and change that can never stop.       
 
Second, for courage and conviction at the frontlines of struggle.   
There has been no greater gift over these two decades than to find common cause with and be led by incredible human rights defenders, survivors and families at the frontlines of repression and struggle around the world and across our country; in particular, the strength and vision of women and young people.   
For anyone who doubts that change is possible, for anyone who feels deflated by apathy or defeated by the powerful interests blocking progress, that is where hope, fueled by necessity, outrage and determination, has its home. More than anything else, it is their voices – often reassuring, sometimes enraged, frequently challenging, always clarion – that will stay with me.   
Third, for the power of the collective.   
I have often been asked: why don’t you give up, why shouldn’t we all give up? And there have certainly been moments when that has been tempting. But whenever my spirits have flagged, I have immediately sensed the energy from colleagues down the hall, out in the street or half-way around the world. Whenever a friend has felt dispirited, others have come to the fore. I am forever awed by the power of people coming together, close to home and across the globe, and what an unstoppable force for change can be unleashed.  
That is what is so uplifting and remarkable about Amnesty International. That I have dear friends, close colleagues and fellow travelers on this path to universal human rights – from Moose Jaw to Nairobi, St. John’s to Mexico City, Montreal to Beirut, Victoria to Lima, Edmonton to Brussels, Yellowknife to Hong Kong, Windsor to Chicago, Ottawa to London, Kanehsatà:ke to Dakar – has forged for me a world of connection and common cause beyond anything I imagined at that first meeting in 1985.   
 
And what is particularly rich is that everyone brings their own skills, perspective, and experience to the human rights struggle. Fastidious researchers, dynamic mobilizers, quiet workhorses, incredible pro bono lawyers, imaginative campaigners, eloquent communicators, loyal letter-writers, generous donors, and so much more. What you bring and who we are together; I will never leave behind.  
Fourth, for all that has been achieved.  
It would take a book to review these past two decades and celebrate the many remarkable moments of triumph, or at least of significant progress. It is too easy to dwell on all that is grim and despairing. We must not forget that there has been much to celebrate; always made possible by people who insisted it be so.   
I think of the very many prisoners of conscience freed, refugees protected, and executions stayed. Rarely were those victories forged in a few days. Rather they were long struggles, fueled by perseverance, and marked by considerable sacrifice by the individuals, families, and communities whose rights were on the line.   
Indigenous women, their families and communities across Canada have led a struggle that began with little recognition of the crisis of violence and discrimination that has long been their daily reality. We joined them in solidarity with our 2004 Stolen Sisters report and at countless vigils over many years. That truth can no longer be denied, following release of the historic report last year from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Now, for action.  
 
The ground-breaking UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was at long last adopted in 2007. To our eternal shame, Canada stood in opposition at the time, but has now embraced the Declaration and intends to enact legislation to implement it at home.  
We stood alongside the formidable Cindy Blackstock as she mobilized youth across the country in pursuit of equality for First Nations children. And though equality remains elusive, at every turn – before courts and tribunals, at the United Nations, on Parliament Hill, and in the hearts and minds of people across the country – human rights have prevailed.   
We were told that states would never tackle impunity or agree to limits on the global arms trade, but the International Criminal Court has been established and the Arms Trade Treaty agreed. That does not mean those responsible for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity consistently face justice, far from it. Nor does that mean weapons no longer cavalierly find their way into the hands of human rights violators, just look at Canada’s deal with Saudi Arabia. But what was once deemed impossible has been proven to be absolutely possible.   
I stand in awe of the immense progress in the march to end discrimination that has been led by LGBTIQ2S campaigners. In these 20 years, we have seen marriage equality across Canada and in more and more countries around the world, important steps forward in securing stronger standards at the UN, and at long last, gender identity and gender expression protections are now enshrined in federal law. Not a struggle that is over, particularly globally, but we have come so very far.  
 
Canadian mining companies span the globe, often on the edge of war zones or in the midst of widespread human rights abuse. They initially looked away when we talked to them of their human rights responsibilities and insisted that was a matter for governments alone. But many have come to at least recognize this is and must be part of doing business. We now face the tough challenge of translating their easy rhetoric into concrete reality.  
It seemed impossible to imagine there could be justice in the face of the torture and other human rights violations that became the mainstay of the ‘war on terror’ and a source of unrelenting discrimination and violence against Muslim communities around the world. But Maher Arar, Abdullah Almalki, Ahmad Elmaati, Muayyed Nureddin and Omar Khadr were released and came home to Canada from Syria, Egypt and Guantánamo Bay. And they were compensated and received an apology for Canada’s role in the grave violations they suffered. Now, long denied justice must also prevail for Hassan Diab and Abousfian Abdelrazik.  
 
There has been a steady march towards abolition of the death penalty, across the United States and around the world. The momentum is clear. More US states repeal capital punishment, more countries abandon executions.  Just last week Kazakhstan took one step closer toward abolition.  
Women’s sexual and reproductive rights are more widely recognized and protected in more countries. Ireland’s abortion ban was overturned and movements to follow suit in a number of Latin American countries continue to gather force.  
And women so powerfully lead local, national and global movements for human rights. Four remarkable women, including Canada’s Louise Arbour, have served as UN High Commissioners for Human Rights, standing up to human rights abusers everywhere. Malala Yousafzai, Greta Thunberg, Autumn Peltier and countless others certainly show the bedrock strength of young women.   
Women human rights defenders were locked up but not at all silenced, in Iran, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. And women and girls lead the way in the streets and in the digital world, catalyzing incredible human rights movements everywhere, including Indigenous women and girls in Canada who sparked Sisters in Spirit, #IdleNoMore, Shannen’s Dream and the Red Dress Campaign, the women at the heart of #BlackLivesMatter, women who came forward to declare #MeToo, the women who were the backbone of Egypt’s courageous Tahrir Square protests, women who stood up to the brutality of the Bashir regime in Sudan, Argentinian women who have launched an unstoppable campaign for abortion rights, and the women of Belarus who today are courageously unmasking secret service thugs in the streets of Minsk.  
Fifth, for all that was lost and all that remains.  
As far as we have come, there is still so very far to go.  
Twenty years haunted by scorched earth in Darfur, anguished devastation in Syria, staggering atrocities against the Rohingya, the crushed hopes of independence for South Sudan, a politicized war that unleashed untold suffering in Iraq, an ever-deepening human rights and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, and a colossal campaign of repression against Uyghurs in China.  
Twenty years during which the rights of Palestinians continued to be trammeled, Afghanistan endured new chapters of conflict and displacement, and hope of ending decades of violence and injustice in Colombia rose and sank.    
Twenty years marked by numerous national and provincial inquiries and inquests that have put an urgent change agenda in front of Canadians to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples. Governments talk of change, yet in 2020 protests to uphold land rights, in Wet’suwet’en territory and elsewhere, continued; First Nations children are still denied equality; and police violence, including killings, against Indigenous people in all corners of the country does not abate.   
Powerful movements such as #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo have brought essential focus to the violence and injustice caused by systemic anti-Black racism, racist police violence, colonialism, Islamophobia, and the deep roots of sexism. Around the world, however, an array of leaders instead champion agendas of racism, misogyny, fear, hate and division. And remembering and honouring Regis Korchinski-Paquet, D’Andre Campbell, Chantel Moore, Rodney Levi, Ejaz Ahmed Choudry and Mohamed-Aslim Zafis: we know that we face those currents of racist indifference, intolerance, and violence in Canada as well.   
These twenty years have witnessed a crushing global assault on the rights and safety of refugees, everywhere. That includes here at home, for despite much talk of welcoming refugees, Canada refuses to recognize the assault on the rights of refugees and migrants by the Trump Administration and suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States. The federal government instead shamefully chose to appeal, rather than embrace, a recent Federal Court ruling that the Agreement violates the Charter of Rights.   
 
Steps forward that should have been so straight-forward remain stalled or blocked. A deep frustration as I move on is that Canada has yet to join the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, a crucial treaty for the prevention of torture. Eighteen years to take this obvious step, more than four years since a public promise to do so was made. But nothing. Similarly, a failure of political leadership and imagination continues to thwart efforts by federal, provincial, and territorial governments to collectively coordinate meaningful nation-wide implementation of the country’s international human rights obligations. These should be easy wins, but stand instead as disheartening disappointments.   
Overarching all of this, the global climate crisis poses perhaps the greatest threat to human rights that the world has ever faced. The global movement for climate justice grows daily, led by young people around the world. Yet concrete action to avert this crisis is slow, often stymied by lack of political will and by far too many leaders in government and business who deny the science and play politics with humanity’s very survival.  
Sixth, for all that is both necessary and possible.  
Amidst uncertainty and despair, we must hold strong to the power of the people, the power of the street, the power of protest. In the past few years alone – Santiago, Khartoum, Hong Kong, Washington, Tehran, Beirut, Tyendinaga and so many public squares, alleyways, railway crossings and roadways in communities large and small, everywhere – that is where dreams are borne and change ignited. From near and far, distanced or linking arms, when we come together injustice does give way.  
Never would I have imagined wrapping up my time as Secretary General amidst the turmoil and anxiety of the COVID-19 pandemic. I am so grateful for my own and my family’s well-being and deeply aware that this has been a time of fear, illness and death for so many. We must now all commit to the opportunity and responsibility to address all that has been laid bare by the pandemic. If this not be the time when we tackle the deep inequalities and glaring inequity that permeate society, then when? This is an unprecedented moment and opportunity for transformative change, which each of us must both demand and create.  
Transformation must, at its very core, be about reconciliation in Canada with Indigenous peoples. Because that is what justice, humanity and history demands. Because that is both the vision and the pathway to a sustainable nation and world. And because now is the time. The urgency, the necessity, the understanding, and the possibility for reconciliation – guided by the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples – has never been greater. It requires all of us to learn more, dig deeper and go further.   
We look ahead and move forward in a time when truth is both on the march and in retreat, so much of which plays out in an ever-encroaching digital universe that is at the same time liberating and toxic. Misinformation abounds and fuels hate and fear. Truth is declared to be fake news, and established facts and proven science dismissed as lies and opinions. The struggle for human rights is at its heart a struggle for truth. For Amnesty International, truth is our mantra and our brand. Our candle is truth. We seek to expose the truth and we strive to realize universal truths of equality and justice. We simply cannot and will not let truth be sold short.    
And this future of street power, transformative change and truth is a future that must and will be entirely feminist, fully and intersectionally so! There is no other way ahead that will bring climate justice, root out systemic racism, and end conflict. And despite the ugly backlash and the virulent misogyny, feminism’s march is all around us. Look for it in yourself, embrace it in each other and demand it of our institutions and our leaders.     
And finally, gratitude.  
 
I cannot begin to express how deep lies my appreciation and admiration for the incredible people – staff, members and supporters – who make up the Amnesty International movement, in Canada and everywhere. I have climbed upon your shoulders. I have followed in your footsteps. We have held each other’s hands. I have been propelled by your generosity. I have been encouraged, energized, challenged and bolstered by you, no matter what has come at us. I think of dear Amnesty friends and mentors who have, sadly, left us over the years; your example and legacy are lodged in my soul.

0,President Trump Must Condemn White Supremacy and Racist Violence,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/president-trump-must-condemn-white-supremacy-and-racist-violence/,"Last night, President Donald Trump failed to condemn white supremacist groups and instead told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.” In response, Amnesty International USA’s End Gun Violence Campaign Manager, Ernest Coverson, released the following statement:  “Last night, President...","Last night, President Donald Trump failed to condemn white supremacist groups and instead told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by.” In response, Amnesty International USA’s End Gun Violence Campaign Manager, Ernest Coverson, released the following statement:  
“Last night, President Trump blew yet another dog whistle to the Proud Boys, a group the FBI has deemed an ‘extremist organization.’ While disappointing and horrifying, this isn’t surprising: President Trump has traded in bigotry since day one, putting ordinary people at greater risk of violence and harassment by white supremacists. 
“The continued failure of President Trump to denounce racial and ethnic hatred has only emboldened those who wish to normalize discrimination. We have seen how white supremacy, racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim, misogyny, and anti-LGBTQ sentiment are being used to further discrimination against already marginalized communities. The failure to hold accountable those who commit, encourage, or turn a blind eye to this hateful rhetoric only worsens the problem. 
“With a system that allows virtually unfettered access to guns, the president’s rhetoric becomes that much more dangerous and potentially violent. Just weeks ago in Kenosha, Wisconsin, we saw the tragic results of what happens when authorities fail to ensure the safety of those targeted by the hateful ideology of white supremacy. The right to protest should not be used as license to intimidate, harass and harm others.” 
Amnesty International USA will be closely monitoring over the course of the next four weeks and beyond to keep an eye out for protests and incidents of violence, likely to be spurred by the kind of rhetoric heard from President Trump. Threatening peaceful protesters and urging intimidation against the right to express one’s political opinion is unconscionable, and will not be tolerated.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has indicated this Throne Speech will be a ‘roadmap out of the pandemic towards a society that is fairer and more welcoming.’  
Amnesty International has sent an open letter to the Prime Minister and his cabinet, urging them to implement a genuinely transformative human rights agenda.  
We ignore today’s urgent challenges to our collective shame and at our collective peril. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare deep inequality at the heart of Canadian society, which can no longer be ignored. The failure to live up to the responsibility of all people in Canada to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples can no longer be ignored.  The refusal to address systemic racism at the root of continuing police violence against Indigenous, Black and racialized communities in the country can no longer be ignored. The harsh reality of gender inequalities and violations of the rights of women, girls, and gender diverse people can no longer be ignored. And the lack of decisive action to avert the global climate crisis can no longer be ignored.      
The global context is of course also of grave concern.  In a time of polarization and conflict, fueled by leaders on all continents who are intent on advancing agendas of intolerance and hate, the paucity of unwavering, principled human rights leadership on the world stage is staggeringly apparent and deeply troubling. 
Amnesty International has called on the government to make seven commitments, backed up by action and resources included in the next federal budget.   
Will you help us spread the word?  
If you follow federal politics, you know #ThroneSpeech2020 is coming up next week. We’re calling on @JustinTrudeau to adopt a genuinely transformative human rights agenda. Here are our seven recommendations  https://t.co/rvYawdeZNp

This is the latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organizations by the Government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations, Amnesty International India said today. 
“The continuing crackdown on Amnesty International India over the last two years and the complete freezing of bank accounts is not accidental. The constant harassment by government agencies including the Enforcement Directorate is a result of our unequivocal calls for transparency in the government, more recently for accountability of the Delhi police and the Government of India regarding the grave human rights violations in Delhi riots and Jammu & Kashmir. For a movement that has done nothing but raise its voices against injustice, this latest attack is akin to freezing dissent,” said Avinash Kumar, Executive Director of Amnesty International India. 
Amnesty International India stands in full compliance with all applicable Indian and international laws. For human rights work in India, it operates through a distinct model of raising funds domestically. More than four million Indians have supported Amnesty International India’s work in the last eight years and around 100,000 Indians have made financial contributions. These contributions evidently cannot have any relation with the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010.  The fact that the Government is now portraying this lawful fundraising model as money-laundering is evidence that the overbroad legal framework is maliciously activated when human rights activists and groups challenge the government’s grave inactions and excesses. 
The attacks on Amnesty International India and other outspoken human rights organizations, activists and human rights defenders is only an extension of the various repressive policies and sustained assault by the government on those who speak truth to power. “Treating human rights organizations like criminal enterprises and dissenting individuals as criminals without any credible evidence is a deliberate attempt by the Enforcement Directorate and Government of India to stoke a climate of fear and dismantle the critical voices in India.  It reeks of fear and repression, ignores the human cost to this crackdown particularly during a pandemic and violates people’s basic rights to freedom of speech and expression, assembly, and association guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and international human rights law. Instead, as a global power and a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, India must fearlessly welcome calls for accountability and justice,” said Avinash Kumar. 
As part of the Nobel Prize winning movement, Amnesty International India holds itself to the highest evidentiary standards. Our work in India, as elsewhere, is to uphold universal human rights and build a global movement of people who take injustice personally. These are the same values that are enshrined in the Constitution of India and flow from a long and rich Indian tradition of pluralism, tolerance and peaceful dissent.

BACKGROUND: 
CHRONOLOGY OF ATTACKS AND HARASSMENT OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL INDIA: 
On 25 October 2018, Amnesty International India endured a 10-hour-long raid as a group of officers from the Enforcement Directorate (ED), a financial investigation agency under the Ministry of Finance, entered its premises and locked the gates behind them. Most of the information and documents that were demanded during the search were already available in the public domain or filed with the relevant government authorities. The residence of a Director was also raided. 
Immediately after the raid, the bank accounts were also frozen by the ED. As a result, Amnesty International India was forced to let go of a number of its staff, adversely affecting its work in India including with the marginalized communities. Despite the ongoing investigations and before the framing of charges, the Government of India started a smear campaign against Amnesty International India in the country through selective leaking of documents gathered by the ED, to government-aligned media outlets. This resulted in a malicious media trial against the organization. 
In early 2019, the Department of Income Tax started sending investigative letters to more than 30 small regular donors. Apparently, the department did not find any irregularities but the process adversely affected the fundraising campaigns of Amnesty International India. 
In June 2019, Amnesty International India was denied permission to hold the press conference launch in Srinagar to release its third ‘Lawless Law’ report on the misuse and abuse of Public Safety Act in Jammu and Kashmir. It was forced to digitally release it.  
On 22 October 2019, Amnesty International testified at the US Congressional hearing on the situation of human rights in South Asia with specific focus on Jammu and Kashmir since the unilateral abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India. 
On 15 November 2019, two weeks after the testimony and amid rumours of impending arrests of the organization’s top officials, the offices of Amnesty International India and the residence of one of its directors were raided again by the CBI. The raids were conducted on the basis of a First Information Report filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs over unsubstantiated allegations of suspected violations of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act. It suggested investigations be launched under other laws like Prevention of Money Laundering Act. 
On 13 April 2020, Amnesty International India called on the Uttar Pradesh Government to stop its intimidation of journalists through use of repressive laws during a pandemic. On 15 April 2020, the Cyber Crime Police Station, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh notified Twitter to furnish information about Amnesty International India’s Twitter account @AIIndia which the organization uses to monitor and analyse developments in international human rights law and Indian constitutional and criminal law related to human rights issues. 
On 5 August 2020, marking the first anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, Amnesty International India released an update on the situation of human rights in Jammu and Kashmir. 
On 28 August 2020, marking the six-month anniversary of the riots that took place in North-East Delhi in February 2020, Amnesty International India released an investigative brief on the complicity of Delhi police in the riots which claimed the lives of at least 53 people, mostly from the minority Muslim community. 
The release of the two publications has provided fresh impetus to the establishment to harass and intimidate Amnesty International India through its investigative agencies. 
On 10 September 2020 Amnesty International India came to know that all its bank accounts were completely frozen by the Enforcement Directorate bringing most of the work of the human rights organization to a grinding halt.

The...","Access to safe abortion is an essential component of a fair and equal society, and is integral to realizing the full range of human rights, Amnesty International said today. The organization has published its updated policy on abortion that aligns with evolving human rights law and standards. The policy equips the organization to undertake stronger campaigning and advocacy around abortion and to better support local movements advancing sexual and reproductive rights. 
The updated policy recognizes abortion, provided in a manner that respects human rights, autonomy, and dignity, as the right of anyone who can become pregnant. Amnesty International is also calling for universal access to safe abortion and related care and information, in addition to full decriminalization. 
“Around 47,000 women die each year as a result of seeking unsafe abortions. This global tragedy will not end until abortion is fully decriminalized and made accessible and affordable to everyone. Abortion must be treated like any other health service, and anyone seeking an abortion must be treated with compassion and dignity and with respect for their human rights,” said Rajat Khosla, Amnesty International’s Senior Director of Research and Advocacy. 
“Our updated policy was developed in consultation with human rights experts, medical providers and the Amnesty movement, and informed by years of research and engagement with women and girls whose lives have been shattered by restrictive laws. We will continue to demand that governments respect reproductive autonomy, and campaign for safe abortion access for anyone who seeks it, without discrimination, coercion or stigma.” 
International legal norms and standards around abortion have undergone a substantial evolution in the past decade. In line with these changes, Amnesty International has updated its position to ensure it is better-placed to challenge the full range of human rights violations due to criminalization of abortion, to advocate for removal of all barriers to safe abortion and to promote reproductive, gender and economic justice. 
Amnesty International’s updated policy: 
“Abortion is not an isolated issue. Denying people the right to make decisions about their own bodies perpetuates gender and economic inequality, and entrenches stigma and discrimination,” said Rajat Khosla. 
“We recognize that abortion is a deeply complex subject, but punitive approaches do not address the many social, economic and personal issues that shape people’s decisions to end their pregnancies. Full decriminalization of abortion is essential to protect human rights and prevent further deaths and injuries due to unsafe abortions.”

Over the last few years, Amnesty’s researchers have documented child labour, environmental harms and violations of the rights of Indigenous peoples in the countries where battery minerals are mined. We have challenged the world’s leading electronics and automobile makers to develop a battery untainted by human rights abuses. 
We invite you to join our campaign for an ‘ethical’ rechargeable battery. 
In October together with Greenpeace International, Amnesty will launch 16 Principles for a Greener and More Ethical Battery. To help our activists and members get involved, Amnesty Canada will launch an exciting new education series that will include social media nano-learnings, a video, a made-in-Canada comic book by Ad Astra Comix and a resource guide. 
 
This fall, Amnesty will also launch our long-anticipated findings on lithium mining and the rights of Indigenous peoples in Argentina. Lithium is mined from the briny waters of salt flats such as the Salinas Grandes and Lake Guayatayoc. The report outlines the rights at stake and steps the Argentine government must take to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples living in one of the world’s most unique and delicate ecosystems.

A cornerstone of Amnesty’s commitment to addressing the climate crisis is to end our dependency on fossil fuels and campaign for a global transition to renewable energy. In order for this transition to be fair and accessible to everyone, governments must urgently and substantially invest in a just transition as if our lives depended on it. Amnesty believes that human rights must be at the centre of climate justice and a just transition. 
Thanks to the tireless work of climate scientists, grassroots activists, and respected youth leaders like Autumn Pelletier and Greta Thunberg (to name but a few), people are making important personal changes to reduce their carbon footprint, such as driving less, riding their bikes, using public transit, car-pooling and purchasing electric cars and bicycles. They are also taking to the streets in their communities to call on politicians to respond to the climate crisis with the urgency it merits. At the same time, people are recognizing that the climate crisis affects us all, but differently, and that movements for a just transition need to be grounded in the recognition of systemic racism and a commitment to be anti-racist in our activism, equity, human rights respect and dignity. All of these efforts contribute towards the kinds of system changes we need to confront the climate crisis and build a better, more just world.

For it to come into force, at least eleven countries must ratify it,...","Today, 26 September, is the deadline for countries to sign the Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Justice in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean (Escazú Agreement). For it to come into force, at least eleven countries must ratify it, therefore only one more is needed in addition to the ten countries that have already done so. 
“This agreement emerged from the need to urgently address the climate emergency that we are facing. When the treaty was opened for signatures exactly two years ago, hope also emerged that Latin America and the Caribbean could make history with a groundbreaking norm that could contribute to the protection of the environment and those who defend it. Countries in the region must not miss this important opportunity,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
We celebrate the fact that 23 countries, representing more than two thirds of the region, have signed and that ten states have responded urgently, as the environmental crisis requires, by ratifying the agreement. Countries such as Costa Rica or Santa Lucía are on the brink of joining – it is in the hands of their legislative authorities – and of becoming the final ratification needed to open up the possibility of implementing necessary policies for environmental protection in the region and the world. 
“Despite the fact that the Escazú Agreement coming into force could be a significant advance in the policies of the states in the region in the face of the climate emergency and crisis of violence against environmental defenders, the slowness of some states to ratify it shows the lack of interest in taking measures to create a more participative, accessible and fair environmental policy that still exists in some countries in the region.” 
Civil society organizations from all over Latin America and the Caribbean have formed coalitions and worked together with an almost unprecedented effort in coordination, with significant participation from young people, to call on states in the region to sign and ratify the agreement. 
The Escazú Agreement is the first regional environmental treaty in Latin America and the Caribbean. Its purpose is to set new standards for protection of the environment and human rights that guarantee access to information, citizen participation and access to justice on environmental issues in the region. In addition, it is the first international treaty to include specific measures for the protection of environmental rights defenders. 
“The importance of this type of regulation for the region is undeniable. Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico are among the most dangerous countries in the world for defenders of human rights and the environment. Although there has been progress in the discussions on the agreement in Colombia and Mexico, in Brazil, Guatemala and Honduras the delay is such that it seems to show a lack of political willingness,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“At Amnesty International we reiterate the importance of the implementation of international standards to strengthen the protection of the environment and those who defend it. We urge the states in the region to lead the way in building a more participative, accessible and fair environmental policy in the Americas, adhering to the Escazú Agreement as soon as possible.” 
Representatives of the United Nations have now said that the COVID-19 pandemic must be considered a wake-up call to rethink our relationship with the environment, therefore rather than an excuse this crisis must serve as further motivation to progress with the protection of our planet. 
Additional information: 
Of the 23 countries that have signed the agreement, only ten have ratified it: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, Guyana, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Uruguay. 
A further 12 countries have signed the agreement but have still not ratified it: Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Granada, Guatemala, Haiti, Jamaica, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Saint Lucia. 
On the list of countries that have neither signed nor ratified it are Chile, El Salvador, Cuba, Honduras, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Surinam, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. 
In its latest report “Defending Tomorrow” the international organization Global Witness puts Colombia, Brazil, Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala in first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth place respectively for numbers of killings of human rights and environmental defenders in 2019.

In my early childhood, up to the age of 11, I was living in my home country, a developing country. During this time, it was not difficult to see the socioeconomic disparities that existed within my community and the injustices that were continually committed against people who didn’t even have a voice. Human rights activism was often interpreted as subversive and activists were often punished for their efforts. For this reason, many people within my community resorted to philanthropy by giving back to those less fortunate than themselves. Growing up my family would donate clothes to charitable organizations and pass out sandwiches and meat to those struggling, particularly during Eid and Ramadan. These experiences instilled in me the importance of using my privilege to support and uplift others. 
Later on, when I attended elementary and secondary school in Canada, I become involved with social justice advocacy at my school and community as well as becoming part of my schools’ environmental club where we raised funds for environmental initiatives and advocated for environmental issues. It wasn’t until grade 7 that I had first heard about Amnesty International (AI). I recall learning about AI as a thrilling experience as they were advocating for many issues the people of my home country, particularly peaceful activists and journalists, were going through. It was exciting to see the struggles of my people heard on a global platform and advocated for! Since then, I continued to follow Amnesty’s work on their website and sign AI petitions and open letters. 
 
In the summer of 2020, I became aware through social media of AI Canada’s National Organizers Program to which I applied and was accepted to. So far, as a National Organizer, I have been able to participate in letter writing campaigns in support of the Black Lives Matter Movement, in support of the Urgent Action case of Pastor Steven Tendo, as wel as, most recently, help co-facilitate a Climate Justice webinar by youth for youth. I believe letter writing campaigns have had the greatest impact on me as an activist with AI so far. This is simply because I believe those issues are incredibly important and need to be addressed. Additionally, I find it quite liberating to be able to write a letter peacefully critiquing our governments without fear or hesitation. I look forward to continue volunteering with AI and to learn new skills that will help make me a better person and activist.

Climate change was cited as one of the most important issues of our time in a survey of more than 10,000 young people published by Amnesty International just months before the pandemic turned the world upside down. 
“Amnesty International stands with all children and young people taking part in climate strikes. Children globally have faced unimaginable disruption to their lives, education and health as a result of COVID-19. That they must take more time out of school to demand that adults do the right thing is utterly shameful, but young people know only too well the unthinkable consequences of climate inaction to their lives and human rights.” said Ashfaq Khalfan, Amnesty International’s Law and Policy Director.  
 “2020 was supposed to be the year of climate action, but tragically it has become instead the year of COVID-19. The impact of the pandemic cannot be underestimated, and recovery will take time. However, climate inaction must not be the political payoff.  Pandemic recovery efforts have seen emissions reduction targets fall by the wayside in a staggering act of political myopia, in light of the fact that global warming triggers disasters, diseases and other impacts of incommensurable proportion.” 
To allow us to limit global warming to pre-industrial levels of 1.5°C – avoiding the most catastrophic effects of climate change – governments agreed to submit updated pledges to reduce emissions and thus mitigate the climate crisis. Globally, only 12 countries have submitted plans so far with a deadline approaching at the end of the year. 
The current state of play indicates that many wealthy countries with a long history of fuelling climate change and states with the highest levels of emissions are not only falling behind in their plans but taking measures that will set climate action back several years. For example: 
The climate crisis is one of the biggest human rights issues of our time affecting the rights of millions to food, water, health and life, among others. Millions of people are already suffering from the disastrous effects of climate change–from devastating floods submerging one third of Bangladesh to unprecedented wildfires on the US West Coast as just the most recent examples. 
Climate change especially affects people who are already disadvantaged or facing discrimination, deepening current inequalities and injustices. Children with their under-developed immune systems, and particularly those most marginalised, are especially vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, from malnutrition due to changes in crop yields to mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and death from heatwaves. 
As world leaders are gathered for the United Nations General Assembly and G20 energy ministers are set to meet on 27 September, Amnesty International calls on governments to put climate action and human rights at the centre of their pandemic recovery plans. They should adopt plans to promote zero-carbon economies by, for example, stopping unconditional bailouts and subsidies to fossil fuel companies and investing in companies that deliver a just and human rights-consistent transition to a decarbonised economy. 
“The pandemic has shown us that many governments are capable of exactly the fast, decisive action that we need to address the climate crisis. When the stakes are so high, even those who benefit from the status quo are willing to overturn it. People have supported reasonable protection measures brought in by governments to protect their communities; even when they involve drastic changes to their daily lives. If governments are capable of pouring billions into furlough schemes and bailing out companies – then they should be capable of making the obvious decision to urgently phase out fossil fuels,” said Ashfaq Khalfan. 
“Leaders must avoid pandemic-induced tunnel vision and commit to the long-term well-being of their people. COVID-19 has driven many to the very edge of their capacity to survive and tested our collective resilience. But it has also renewed our determination for a radically different future – a more just, equitable and sustainable world that is fit for our children and grandchildren.”

“The 2020 Throne Speech is wide-sweeping and includes numerous bold spending and program promises, several of which might truly be transformative of Canada’s economy and social policies in many areas.  This was an unprecedented moment to ground that transformation in a full and unwavering recognition of and commitment to the country’s national and international human rights obligations, particularly those dealing with economic, social and cultural rights, and unfortunately that did not occur,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English Branch. “The phrase ‘human rights’ appears only once, linked to standing up for the rule of law internationally.  That does not come close to capturing the crucial importance, relevance and practical value of human rights in addressing the enormous challenges that Canada and the world face at this time.” 
Amnesty International had written to the Prime Minister well in advance of the speech, laying out seven key areas the organization hoped would be reflected in the Throne Speech. 
There is no reference to economic, social, and cultural rights in any way, including in areas such as the promises regarding the National Housing Strategy, where it is of essential relevance. 
While there is a commitment to bring forward legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples before the end of the year, which is long overdue and would be very welcome, promises have been made before and not kept. There is nothing concrete with respect to the Calls to Justice from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, other than to ‘accelerate’ work to create a National Action Plan, without any specific timeline, process, or commitment to ensuring the process is led by Inuit, Métis, and First Nations women, girls, and two-spirit people. 
This was a chance for a strong commitment to demonstrate leadership in working towards a nationwide ban on carding, street checks and racial profiling by police and security agencies. While there are indications of several legislative, policy and resourcing changes that will be pursued, there is nothing to suggest that truly fundamental reforms to policing to address systemic racism are being considered.  
The commitment to “accessible, affordable, inclusive and high quality childcare” and to a “feminist, intersectional response to this pandemic and recovery” guided by a “task force of experts whose diverse voices will power a whole-of-government approach” is encouraging.  We look forward to more details and the development of this plan.  
The commitment to “immediately bring forward a plan to exceed Canada’s 2030 climate goal” is crucially important, particularly since the current goals are wholly inadequate. We look forward to seeing the plan and an assurance that it is strongly reflective of Indigenous best practices and knowledge and incorporates a human rights framework.  Also encouraging is the promise to “legislate Canada’s goal of net-zero emissions by 2050”; however that is an overall global goal for 2050 and as a wealthy nation in the Global North which has been a major source of carbon emissions, Canada must endeavour to meet that goal much sooner.    
The commitment to “zero-emissions vehicles and batteries” and the reference to the fact that Canada has many of the required natural resources, such as nickel and copper, is a clear illustration of the need for accompanying human rights commitments, given the human rights violations and failure to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples in particular that are associated with the mining of such resources around the world, including in Canada. 
There was no commitment to advancing the proposal supported by more than 300 organizations and experts across Canada earlier this year for strengthened human rights oversight of the government’s COVID-19 response. 
There were only vague and general references to international affairs. Amnesty International looks forward to hearing more specifics about the promise that Canada will “invest more in international development”, particularly in the light of Canada’s longstanding low levels of funding in this area. There are no specifics with respect to the assurance that Canada will “continue to stand up for human rights and the rule of law”, including no references to arms sales to Saudi Arabia, no mention of obligations with respect to refugee protection and no update regarding the need to provide investigative powers for the recently established Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise.   
“A Throne Speech is, we recognize, primarily about high-level aspiration. And the government’s aspirations, for instance, with respect to implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples, instituting a national childcare program and strengthening the country’s climate targets are all crucially important. It is nevertheless disappointing that Canada’s aspirations are not explicitly and confidently framed in terms of human rights. Human rights are the guarantors of justice, equality, and dignity.  They also provide the road-map for economic and social systems that are sustainable and stable,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Directrice-générale of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare both the injustice and instability society faces when human rights are not taken seriously.  This was a crucial moment and missed opportunity to change course.”

0,Why is Amnesty Barred From Monitoring Julian Assange’s Extradition Hearings?,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/freedom-of-expression/why-is-amnesty-barred-from-monitoring-julian-assanges-extradition-hearings/,"By Stefan Simanowitz, Amnesty International’s media manager for Europe, Turkey and the Balkans The first day of Julian Assange’s extradition hearing, which started on Monday 7 September, drew more than two hundred people to gather outside the Old Bailey in London.

The first day of Julian Assange’s extradition hearing, which started on Monday 7 September, drew more than two hundred people to gather outside the Old Bailey in London. People in fancy dress mingled with camera crews, journalists and a pack of hungry photographers who would disappear regularly to give chase to any white security van heading towards the court, pressing their long lenses against the darkened windows. 
Arriving at the court each morning was an assault to the senses with the noise of samba bands, sound systems and chanting crowds and the sight of banners, balloons and billboards at every turn. One of the vans had come from Belmarsh high security prison, Julian Assange’s home for the last 16 months. 
If the outside was a carnival, the inside of the court soon became a circus. There have been multiple technical difficulties, a COVID-19 scare which temporarily halted proceedings and numerous procedural irregularities—including the decision by the presiding judge to withdraw permission for Amnesty International’s fair trial observer to have access to the courtroom. 
The Wikileaks founder was in court for the resumption of proceedings that will ultimately decide on the Trump administration’s request for his extradition to the U.S. The American prosecutors claim he conspired with whistleblowers (including army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning) to obtain classified information. They want him to stand trial on espionage charges in the U.S. where he would face a prison sentence of up to 175 years. 
Assange’s lawyers began with a request that the alleged evidence in a new indictment handed down in June be excluded from consideration given that it came so late. The judge denied this. In the afternoon session, the lawyers requested an adjournment until next year to give his lawyers time to respond to the U.S. prosecutor’s new indictment. They said they had been given insufficient time to examine the new allegations, especially since they had only “limited access” to the imprisoned Assange. Indeed, this most recent hearing was the first time in more than six months that Julian Assange had been able to meet with his lawyers. The judge rejected this request. 
Reacting to the decision, told me that: “The decision is an insult to the UK courts,to Julian Assange and to justice,” Kristinn Hrafnsson, the editor-in-chief of Wikileaks, told me afterwards. For the court to deny the request to adjourn is denying Assange his rights.” 
Amnesty International had requested access to the court for a trial monitor to observe the hearings, but the court denied us a designated seat in court. Our monitor initially did get permission to access the technology to monitor remotely, but the morning the hearing started he received an email informing us that the judge had revoked Amnesty International’s remote access. 
We applied again for access to the proceedings on Tuesday 8 September, setting out the importance of monitoring and Amnesty International’s vast experience of observing trials in even some of the most repressive countries. 
The judge wrote back expressing her “regret” at her decision and saying: “I fully recognize that justice should be administered in public”. Despite her regret and her recognition that scrutiny is a vital component of open justice, she did not change her mind. 
If Amnesty International and other observers wanted to attend the hearing, they would have to queue for one of the four seats available in a public gallery. We submitted a third application to gain direct access to the overflow room at the court where some media view the livestream, but this has also been denied. 
The refusal of the judge to not to give any “special provision” to expert fair trial monitors is very disturbing. Through its refusal, the court has failed to recognize a key component of open justice: namely how international trial observers monitor a hearing for its compliance with domestic and international law. They are there to evaluate the fairness of a trial by providing an impartial record of what went on in the courtroom and to advance fair trial standards by putting all parties on notice that they are under scrutiny. 
Amnesty International have monitored trials from Guantanamo Bay to Bahrain, Ecuador to Turkey. For our observer to be denied access profoundly undermines open justice. 
In the court, the overflow room has experienced ongoing technical problems with sound and video quality. More than a week after the proceedings began, these basic technical difficulties have not been properly ironed out and large sections of witness evidence are inaudible. These technical difficulties were not restricted to the overflow room. In court, some witnesses trying to “call into” the courtroom last week, were not able to get in. These basic technical difficulties have hampered the ability of those in the courtroom to follow the proceedings. 
We are still hopeful that a way can be found for our legal expert to monitor the hearing because the decision in this case is of huge importance. It goes to the heart of the fundamental tenets of media freedom that underpin the rights to freedom of expression and the public’s right to access information. 
The U.S. government’s unrelenting pursuit of Julian Assange for having published disclosed documents is nothing short of a full-scale assault on the right to freedom of expression. The potential chilling effect on journalists and others who expose official wrongdoing by publishing information disclosed to them by credible sources could have a profound impact on the public’s right to know what their government is up to. 
If Julian Assange is silenced, others will also be gagged either directly or by the fear of persecution and prosecution which will hang over a global media community already under assault in the U.S. and in many other countries worldwide. 
The U.S. Justice Department is not only charging a publisher who has a non-disclosure obligation but a publisher who is not a U.S. citizen and not in America. The U.S. government is behaving as if they have jurisdiction all over the world to pursue any person who receives and publishes information of government wrongdoing.

We firmly believe that without robust climate action at all levels of government, the climate crisis will continue to negatively impact a range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and disproportionately impact marginalized and vulnerable communities and groups. 
Amnesty’s intervention at the Supreme Court today will emphasize the fundamental importance of Canada’s international human rights obligations and the need for these commitments to guide Canada’s climate action. We will argue that constitutional ambiguities with respect to division of powers between provincial and federal governments should be resolved in a way that both maximizes Canadian compliance with international obligations and facilitates provincial adherence to our obligations.  
You can watch the Supreme Court of Canada’s live webcast today. 
The outcome of this case could have significant, long-lasting consequences for Canada’s present and future climate action.

“Breonna Taylor’s death is a tragedy. She was asleep in her bed when the police busted down her door and recklessly opened fire, taking her life. Black people in America have the same right to be safe as all people, though this is hard to conceive when we think of the abhorrent killings of Breonna, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Dijon Kizzee and too many more.   
“Breonna Taylor’s case reminds us of how Kentucky’s police use of lethal force statute puts accountability out of reach for unlawful killings by police  — and how police, who are supposed to protect life, so frequently only see one side of that principle. This case must serve as a wake-up call to our elected officials that they must meet this moment with a bold agenda for police reform, one that brings about meaningful accountability, reimagines public safety and provides justice for all. 
“We call on police to facilitate the right to peaceful protest in the wake of this news. Everyone has the right to take to the streets and make their voices heard, and police must meet their obligation under international law to enable that right.”

The Twitter Scorecard grades the social media company’s record on implementing a series of recommendations to tackle abuse against women on the platform, since Amnesty first highlighted the scale of the problem in its 2018 Toxic Twitter report.  Despite some welcome progress, Twitter needs to do much more to address the problem. The company has fully implemented just one of ten concrete recommendations, with limited progress in increasing transparency on how it handles reports of abuse. 
“Twitter is still not doing enough to tackle the deluge of abuse women face on the platform. Our analysis shows that despite some progress, Twitter is not doing enough to protect women users, leading many women to silence or censor themselves on the platform,” said Rasha Abdul Rahim, Co-Director of Amnesty Tech. 
 “We have outlined clear, straightforward steps that Twitter can take to make its platform a safer place for women to express their views. Twitter can and must do more to protect women from abuse.” 
Since the release of Toxic Twitter in 2018, Amnesty International has continued to highlight the scale of abuse women face on Twitter, including in Argentina, India, UK and USA. Meanwhile, women have continued to speak out about the abuse they experience on Twitter, and the company’s failure to adequately respond. 
The persistent abuse women face on the platform undermines their right to express themselves equally, freely and without fear. This abuse is highly intersectional and women from ethnic or religious minorities, marginalized castes, lesbian, bisexual or transgender women – as well as non-binary individuals – and women with disabilities are disproportionately impacted by abuse on the platform. 
Indian author and activist, Meena Kandasamy, said, “Being a Tamil, mixed-caste woman, who speaks out against India’s discriminatory caste system, has proved an explosive mix on Twitter. I receive a torrent of racist and misogynistic abuse, including rape threats. Twitter always seems to be playing catchup and is too slow to address the different types of abuse women face. Twitter is a powerful place to express ourselves, but Twitter needs to do more to clean up the platform and make it a safe place for women.” 
Amnesty International provided Twitter with concrete recommendations on how it can better meet its human rights responsibilities, highlighting ten we believe are key to helping to tackle online abuse against women. The Twitter Scorecard uses a traffic light system to grade Twitter’s progress in implementing the recommendations, which cover transparency, reporting mechanisms, and enhanced privacy and security features. Red means the recommendation has not been implemented, amber indicates work in progress, and green means the recommendation has been fully implemented. 
Due to the lack of meaningful data Twitter provides, it is difficult even to gauge the full extent of the problem. For example, Twitter still does not provide detailed country-level breakdowns of user reports of abuse, nor does it provide data about how many users report specific kinds of abusive language, for example abuse based on gender or race. 
Twitter is also reticent about disclosing detailed information about the number of content moderators it employs, including what kind of coverage they provide across different countries and languages. 
The social media platform needs to be more transparent as to how it designs and implements automated processes to identify online abuse against women. While Twitter has disclosed details on how it is using algorithms to combat misinformation during the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is yet to provide the same level of transparency on how algorithms are used to address abusive tweets. 
Twitter has made welcome progress in some areas, including improving the appeals process, by offering more guidance to users on how the process works and how decisions are made. The company was graded amber for its efforts towards increasing users’ awareness of privacy and security features and in educating users on the harm such abuse causes. 
Twitter has a responsibility to respect human rights, including the rights to live free from discrimination and violence and to freedom of expression and opinion. 
“It is totally in Twitter’s power to implement these changes that would make a real difference to millions of women’s experience on the platform,” said Michael Kleinman, Director of Amnesty International’s Silicon Valley Initiative. 
“Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey needs to match words with action to show he is genuinely committed to making Twitter a safer place for women. We will continue to press the company until we see more changes that truly show that abuse against women is not welcome on the platform.”    
Twitter’s response 
In response to our analysis, Twitter acknowledged it needs to do more. However, the company said its combination of human moderation and use of technology, allows it to take a more proactive response to online abuse.  On publishing disaggregated data by country or region, Twitter argued this could be open to misinterpretation and give a misleading impression of the problem. 
While Amnesty International acknowledges that context is important, there is nothing to stop Twitter providing context alongside data, and the company’s human rights responsibilities means it has a duty to be transparent in how it deals with reports of violence and abuse.

“At such a challenging time for human rights across Canada and around the world, but also tremendous openings for advancing real change, we are excited and honoured that Ketty Nivyabandi will be our next Secretary General,” said Lana Verran. “Her dynamism, conviction and experience offer precisely the inspiring leadership we need at this time.” 
Formerly holding the role of Advocacy and Research Manager at Nobel Women’s Initiative and having previously worked as a journalist in Burundi, Ketty has been a passionate defender of human rights throughout her life, driven by a commitment to grassroots movements, advocacy and the inherent power of people working for change. Prior to seeking asylum in Canada, she faced police violence as a leading organizer of women’s peaceful protests for democratic change in her country. 
A compelling public speaker, Ketty is frequently called upon as a keynote speaker and moderator, addressing women’s human rights, the situation in Burundi and other pressing human rights concerns at various advocacy events such as the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy, at McGill University’s Centre for Human Rights and Legal Pluralism, and the UN Commission on the Status of Women. 
“I am honoured to be appointed Amnesty International Canada’s next Secretary General.  It is a privilege to lead Amnesty’s work at this important juncture for human rights,” Ketty Nivyabandi said.  “Amnesty’s mission reflects the values I have always stood for and I am eager to join the world’s largest people-driven movement for human rights.” 
In keeping with Amnesty’s rich legacy of advocacy and research Ketty has supported global women activist movements (in Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, Cameroon, South Sudan) to shape public policy in her previous capacity at the Nobel Women’s Initiative.  She has led research and advocacy on massive human rights atrocities against the Rohingya and the threats faced by women human rights defenders in the Middle East. And as a global advocacy leader on human rights abuses in Burundi, Ketty has supported numerous local activists to reach safety including by leading successful digital campaigns for the release of detainees. 
Having developed strategies to improve staff well-being and reform organizational culture, Ketty will work collaboratively with Jayne Stoyles, Executive Director, under our co-leadership model.   As Jayne Stoyles expressed, “I am very excited to be welcoming Ketty. The work of AI Canada’s members and partners, and of our Amnesty colleagues around the world, will benefit greatly from her depth of experience as an advocate for human rights change, her passion as an activist and the warmth and humility Ketty exudes in her approach.” 
Ketty will officially take up the role as Secretary General later this year, after a transition period with outgoing Secretary General Alex Neve.  “I am thrilled that someone of Ketty’s experience, talents and passion is the next Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada,” said Alex Neve, “I have had several opportunities to work with her over the past few years and have always been inspired by her insights, moved by her eloquence, and energized by her unwavering commitment to the very essence of universal human rights.  Ketty’s leadership comes at a crucial time of challenge, responsibility and opportunity for human rights change and transformation, both nationally and internationally. Amnesty International Canada could not be in more capable and caring hands going forward.” 
“Human rights work is a critical as ever amid an ongoing pandemic, a divisive political climate, the urgent need to address systemic racism, the increasing human rights impact of the climate crisis and threats to democracy and the right to peaceful protest across the globe,” said Lana Verran. “We are confident that Ketty brings the energy and commitment needed for Amnesty International to be at the forefront of addressing these immense challenges, as we continue toward our goal of being a bigger, bolder and more inclusive human rights movement.” 
Amnesty International Canada will host an exciting event around International Human Rights Day on December 10 with Ketty Nivyabandi and Alex Neve in conversation. This will also be an opportunity to wish Alex well and to welcome Ketty. Watch for more details. A tribute book is also being prepared for Alex, and you are invited to contribute messages and photos through Bonnie Harnden at bcharnden@sympatico.ca until November 27.

0,EU companies selling surveillance tools to China’s human rights abusers,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/eu-companies-selling-surveillance-tools-to-chinas-human-rights-abusers/,"New Amnesty investigation highlights why EU export rules for surveillance technology fail. European tech companies risk fuelling widespread human rights abuses by selling digital surveillance technology to China’s public security agencies, a new Amnesty International investigation reveals. The...","European tech companies risk fuelling widespread human rights abuses by selling digital surveillance technology to China’s public security agencies, a new Amnesty International investigation reveals. The findings are published ahead of a crucial meeting in Brussels on 22 September where the European Parliament and EU member states will decide whether to strengthen lax surveillance export rules. 
Amnesty International found that three companies based in France, Sweden and the Netherlands sold digital surveillance systems, such as facial recognition technology and network cameras, to key players of the Chinese mass surveillance apparatus. In some cases, the export was directly for use in China’s indiscriminate mass surveillance programmes, with the risk of being used against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups throughout the country. 
Most EU governments, including France and Sweden, are resisting calls to strengthen export rules to include strong human rights safeguards in biometric surveillance technology, an area that European companies dominate. Germany, which has held the EU presidency since 1 July, and the Netherlands have both expressed the need for stronger human rights safeguards in the past but have so far failed to address this successfully at EU level. 
“Europe’s biometric surveillance industry is out of control. Our revelations of sales to Chinese security agencies and research institutions that support them are just the tip of the iceberg of a multi-billion Euro industry that is flourishing by selling its wares to human rights abusers, with few safeguards against end-use abuses,” said Merel Koning, Senior Policy Officer, Technology and Human Rights at Amnesty International. 
Across China, mass surveillance projects such as “Skynet” and “Sharp Eyes” are being rolled out to keep people under constant observation. China’s public security agencies are key players in developing this unprecedented expansion of surveillance. Biometric surveillance is ubiquitous in northwest China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where an estimated up to one million Uyghurs and members of other ethnic groups have been arbitrarily held captive in so-called “re-education camps”. 
“EU governments’ condemnation of the systematic repression in Xinjiang rings hollow if they continue to allow companies to sell the very technology that could be enabling these abuses. The current EU export regulation system is broken and needs fixing fast,” said Merel Koning. 
Biometric surveillance tools, including facial recognition software, are among the most invasive digital surveillance technologies that enable governments to identify and track individuals in public spaces or single them out based on their physiological or behavioural characteristics. These technologies pose a clear threat to the rights to privacy, freedom of assembly, speech, religion and non-discrimination. 
Amnesty’s investigation identified the sale of three different types of digital surveillance technologies to Chinese state security agencies, entities that contribute to the upholding of laws that violate human rights, as well as entities in Xinjiang. 
Morpho, which is now part of Idemia, a French multinational, was awarded a contract to supply facial recognition equipment directly to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in 2015. The company specializes in security and identity systems, including facial recognition systems and other biometric identification products. Amnesty International calls for a ban on the use, development, production, sale and export of facial recognition technology for identification purposes by both state agencies and private-sector actors. 
Amnesty’s research found that Axis Communications, a Swedish company, even boasts on its website of its involvement in expanding the Chinese surveillance state. Axis develops and markets network cameras, which specialize in security surveillance and remote monitoring. The company has supplied its technology to China’s public security apparatus and is repeatedly listed as a “recommended brand” in Chinese state surveillance tender documents dating from 2012 to 2019. 
The company’s website states it expanded the network of security cameras from 8,000 to 30,000 in Guilin, a city in the south of China with a population of approximately  5 million people, as part of an upgrade of the city’s Skynet surveillance programme. The cameras in the network have a 360-degree angle and a range of 300 to 400 metres, making it possible to track targets from all directions. 
“Chinese public security agencies are using products sold by European companies to build up their abusive surveillance capacity. These companies are profiting from of the sale of digital surveillance technologies that are linked to horrific human rights violations. The companies should have known full well that sales to China’s authorities were of significant risk but apparently took no steps to prevent their products from being used and studied by human rights abusers. In so doing, they totally failed in their human rights responsibilities. This is why the EU legislature needs to act to stop similar abusive trade,” said Merel Koning. 
A Dutch company, Noldus Information Technology, sold emotion recognition systems to public security and law enforcement–related institutions in China. The company’s “FaceReader” software is used for automated analysis of facial expressions that convey anger, happiness, sadness, surprise and disgust. FaceReader was found to be used by Chinese universities with links to the public security apparatus and the police, as well as by the Ministry of Public Security. China’s legal system falls short of international standards in numerous respects and is often misused by the authorities to restrict human rights.  
Amnesty International also found that Noldus sold its digital surveillance technology to at least two universities in Xinjiang between 2012 and 2018. This included supplying its “The Observer XT” software to Shihezi University in 2012. The university falls under the administration of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC). XPCC fulfils a special role “in safeguarding the country’s unification and Xinjiang’s social stability and in cracking down on violent terrorist crimes”. 
In 2012, it was already known that the Chinese government routinely conflates Uyghur cultural and religious practice with terrorism. In the years that followed, the technological advancement of the suppression of minorities in Xinjiang became apparent, with emotion and behavioural analysis systems of particular interest to the Chinese authorities. 
The investigated exports by the EU companies pose a significant risk to human rights. None of the companies provided Amnesty International with clear answers as to what due diligence was carried out before completing these sales. This is one of the reasons why the EU must take action now. 
Amnesty’s report illustrates the major shortcomings in the current export regulation framework of the EU, the Dual Use Regulation. Amnesty is calling on the EU legislature to include all digital surveillance technology under its export framework, strengthen human rights safeguards in export decisions and ensure all companies conduct a human rights impact assessment. 
“In response to Amnesty International, Axis Communications said that they do not require a license for the export of cameras for use in Chinese mass surveillance programmes. This is exactly the problem of the current EU exports regulation framework. EU governments need to face up to their responsibilities and rein in this unchecked industry,” said Merel Koning. 
“Until the EU does, they have serious questions to answer about their potential role in human rights violations perpetrated by the Chinese government.”

When protection becomes repression: Mandatory quarantines under COVID-19 in the Americas documents how the authorities in three countries have disproportionately held migrants, refugees, people returning to their countries of origin, and low-income communities in state-run quarantines, often in unsanitary and sometimes inhumane conditions without adequate food, water and medical care, which may amount to ill-treatment. The appalling conditions stand to make them counterproductive spaces where people are at risk of contracting COVID-19. 
“In many parts of the world, authorities have asked people to stay at home or voluntarily quarantine to mitigate the risk of contracting COVID-19. But when states lock up tens of thousands of people without ensuring each detention is necessary and proportionate, detain them in appalling conditions under military or police supervision, and discriminate against them or use the quarantine as punishment, they convert a public health intervention into a punitive and repressive tactic,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
By the end of August, according to government figures, Venezuelan authorities had mandatorily quarantined some 90,000 Venezuelans who had returned home after being left jobless and homeless in neighboring countries such as Colombia and Peru, only to be sent to unsanitary and sometimes inhumane quarantine centers under military control. 
While El Salvador and Paraguay had largely closed their state-run quarantines or reduced them in scale by the end of August, President Bukele’s government had quarantined more than 16,000 people, including those accused of breaking the mandatory national lockdown, people returning from overseas, or those suspected of having been in contact with anyone who had tested positive for COVID-19. As of late June, authorities in Paraguay had also mandatorily quarantined some 8,000 people, mainly Paraguayans who had returned to the country after losing their jobs in neighboring Brazil’s informal sector as COVID-19 lockdowns were enforced there. 
Amnesty International reviewed and verified dozens of videos available on social media or sent to the organization directly, mostly filmed by people placed in mandatory quarantine centres including warehouses, sports stadiums and other facilities, describing the conditions in which they were being held. It also carried out 14 phone interviews, reviewed dozens of newly passed laws, policies, and protocols related to lockdowns and the implementation of the mandatory quarantines, as well as court documents, and reports by independent monitors and journalists. 
The organization received information in all three countries that people have been quarantined often for well beyond the 14 days currently recommended by the WHO, and sometimes for more than a month. The people held in quarantine did not have sufficient access to information about how long they would be detained for or the scientific criteria that would be used at any given time to determine their discharge from quarantine or isolation. This constitutes a violation of their right to information and the requirement under international human rights law that any deprivation of liberty, even when in pursuit of the protection of public health, must be provided by law and be necessary, proportionate and time-bound. 
Authorities should only hold people in state custody when alternative, less invasive measures, such as voluntary quarantine measures and education campaigns, have failed. If they do mandatorily quarantine people, they must provide the appropriate conditions, safeguard against human rights violations and ensure that quarantines are not used discriminatorily to target specific communities. 
“While governments have had to respond quickly to an unprecedented pandemic, Amnesty International found their implementation of state-run mandatory quarantines was defined by arbitrariness, coupled with police and military enforcement,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“Instead of providing the appropriate conditions and safeguards against human rights violations, authorities in Venezuela and El Salvador, in particular, have converted a public health intervention into a punitive response, disproportionately impacting low-income communities, and refugees and migrants returning to their countries of origin.” 
In El Salvador, for example, the Minister of Justice and Security warned in April that people who broke the national lockdown would be placed in a containment centre, “far from their families and run the risk in those centres of quarantine of also contracting the virus.” This indicated that quarantine was seen as a punishment and that the authorities were fully aware that centres lacked the appropriate standards to prevent contagion. 
“I’d like to forget all this, but I can’t,” Ana Cristina told Amnesty International after describing how she had spent 40 days sleeping on a dirty mattress on the floor in a quarantine facility in El Salvador. She was taken there in mid-April by the police who accused her of breaking the national lockdown when she was out buying groceries and medicine, an activity that was considered essential and allowed at the time of her detention. 
The most openly disturbing example of state-sponsored campaigns of stigma and discrimination has come from Venezuela. In recent months, while requiring that all returning Venezuelans be placed in mandatory quarantine facilities, high level officials of President Nicolás Maduro’s government have simultaneously described Venezuelan refugees returning from Colombia as “biological weapons” sent to infect people living in Venezuela. Senior officials have also described those returning as “traitors.” 
This narrative, based on the returning Venezuelans’ perceived political views and deliberate association with COVID-19, coupled with their automatic placement in state-run mandatory quarantines, raises concerns that their deprivation of liberty was discriminatory and arbitrary. 
Amnesty International is calling on governments who detain people in state-run quarantines for public health purposes to immediately grant humanitarian organizations and independent human rights monitors access to these centres so they can monitor the conditions, safeguard against ill-treatment and provide urgently needed water, food and other supplies to comply with international human rights obligations and WHO guidelines on quarantine settings. 
Authorities must also prevent indefinite detentions. They must ensure time limits for mandatory quarantine and isolation are limited to the minimum period necessary, as informed by evolving scientific evidence and best practice and given clear information about the length and process of their detention. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and countries across the Americas face the possibility of repeated lockdowns, this initial research into state-run quarantines highlights the need for authorities to avoid resorting to coercive, punitive and discriminatory approaches as they implement public health measures. 
“We know from other pandemics that punitive approaches do not protect communities and associating specific communities with a virus only drives stigma and discrimination. Instead, human rights-based approaches that empower people with the knowledge they need to protect their own health and providing them with the resources and support they need to comply with voluntary measures, have historically proven more effective,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

The organization...","Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the organization’s lack of access to the Julian Assange extradition hearing, which began on 7 September at the Old Bailey in London, undermines the recognition of trial observers as guardians of international fair trial standards. The organization lodged three separate applications to request access to the premises of the Court for the hearing. All applications were rejected, signaling a retreat on the part of the UK authorities from the principle of open justice. 
 Amnesty International has called on the US government to drop all charges against Julian Assange for his publishing activities and on the UK authorities not to send Assange to the USA or any country where he would be at risk of serious human rights violations. As part of its research, advocacy and campaigning work on the Assange case, Amnesty is committed to monitoring the UK extradition hearing by engaging expert international trial monitors to observe and document the proceedings. 
On 17 August, Amnesty wrote to UK Minister of Justice Robert Buckland requesting formal accreditation and a designated seat in the courtroom for a trial observer to monitor the Assange proceedings, which were to begin on 7 September. The request was based on past experience: for the first phase of Julian Assange’s extradition hearing in February 2020, an Amnesty International trial monitor was seated in the court room for the bulk of the hearing. The trial monitor was the sole representative of an international human rights organization seated in the well of the courtroom and reporting on the proceedings. 
A staff person from HM Courts and Tribunals Service made contact on 1 September to inform Amnesty that the request for access to the September hearing had been rejected, but remote access would be permitted. When our trial monitor attempted to access the hearing on the morning of 7 September, he was unable to get the link to work. Upon inquiring with the Court, he was informed by email that his remote access had been revoked. In declining remote access for Amnesty and approximately 40 other groups/individuals, the judge stated that she wanted to have control over the courtroom and noted that since the hearing began in February an image of Julian Assange sitting in Court had been circulated online in violation of court rules. 
At that point, the only way for Amnesty to monitor the trial was to have our observer queue in the line for access to approximately two seats in the public gallery of an overflow court room on the Court premises, where a limited number of media workers and political observers were viewing the proceedings by livestream. 
In Amnesty’s view those seats are reserved for the public-at-large and trial monitoring organizations should not be vying with members of the community for the few seats available in the public gallery. Moreover, access to the public gallery is on a first come, first served basis for persons who queue up in the morning. Trial monitoring requires consistent and guaranteed access to the court in order to fully report on the proceedings for their duration; no such consistency and guaranteed access to a seat are assured when attempting to secure a place in the court’s public gallery. In addition, no devices or writing utensils are permitted in the public gallery, making accurate recording/documenting of the proceedings near impossible. 
Amnesty submitted an urgent application to the judge on 7 September requesting again that our trial monitor be permitted into the courtroom. The next day, it was also rejected. Court was adjourned early on 10 September due to a threat of COVID-19 infection and the need to test affected persons. The tests were negative. When the hearing resumed on 14 September, Amnesty submitted yet another application – this time for access strictly to the overflow room. That final application was rejected on 16 September with the judge noting that she would make no “special provision” for Amnesty’s trial monitor. 
Amnesty International remains committed to monitoring the extradition hearing of Julian Assange and will continue to advocate for its expert trial monitor to gain access to the court premises to observe and report on what transpires in court. We call on the UK authorities to acknowledge the crucial role trial monitors play in observing legal proceedings and by doing so to renew its full commitment to the principle of open justice. 
FAIR TRIAL MONITORING AS INTERNATIONAL NORM 
Amnesty International has for many years sent expert observers to trials all over the world where important human rights principles are at stake. The acceptance of international trial observers (whether sent by foreign governments or by nongovernmental organizations) has become an international legal norm. The practice is well-established and accepted within the international community, and is linked to international fair trial standards, including the right to a public hearing and the principle of open justice. Our assessment of a trial or legal proceeding seeks to establish whether the practice in the particular case is consistent with the laws of the country where the trial is held, and whether those laws and the practice in the case conform to international standards, enshrined in treaties to which the state is a party and other non-treaty standards. 
International expert trial monitoring achieves three important goals: 
• Evaluate the fairness of a trial or legal proceeding by providing an impartial and independent record of what transpired. 
• Advance internationally recognized fair trial standards by putting the trial participants, including in particular the judge and prosecutor, on notice that they are under scrutiny. 
• Identify needed reforms in the legal systems of the country. 
The role of an international trial monitor is analogous but distinct from the press or other media. International trial monitors not only report on legal proceedings, but also analyse the proceedings for adherence by the state to its international human rights obligations, including the right to a fair trial. The presence of trial monitors signals to the presiding judge that independent and impartial experts in procedural and substantive areas of international human rights law are observing the proceedings and will hold the state to account for violations of fair trial guarantees. The press provides people with information in the public interest thus upholding the public’s right to access to information about what their government is up to. Trial monitors serve open justice by documenting legal proceedings with the aim of holding the state accountable for complying with its human rights commitments. International trial monitors are the independent eyes and ears of the world when it comes to fair trial standards. 
Amnesty International regularly sends trial monitors all over the world to observe and document proceedings. Our monitors have observed trials and other legal proceedings in US federal courts and at the Guantanamo Bay Naval base in Cuba; and in Bahrain, Honduras, Ecuador, Hungary, Israel , Spain, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, among others. 
Amnesty International is supported in its pursuit to gain access as international trial monitors to the Assange proceedings by a range of authoritative resources, including the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ Manual on Trial Monitoring.1 The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, in an address to the UN Human Rights Council in February 2016, has stated that “By observing court proceedings, gathering information on the trial of human rights defenders and analysing legal practices, trial monitors demonstrate support for defenders and contribute more broadly to the strengthening of judicial systems.” 
Likewise, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has stated, “At its most basic level, the act of monitoring a trial is an expression of the right to a public trial and increases the transparency of the judicial process. In individual cases, trial monitoring may serve to improve the effective and fair administration of justice or bring attention to serious deficiencies.” 2

This follows a recent report by the UN Group of Eminent International and Regional Experts on Yemen, which specifically names Canada as one of the countries “perpetuating the conflict” in Yemen through ongoing weapons sales to Saudi Arabia. 
“Canada has now been publicly shamed in front of the international community for its ongoing weapons transfers to Saudi Arabia, while the devastating war in Yemen rages on,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada. “Legal obligations under the ATT have not deterred this government’s unrelenting support for weapons exports to Saudi Arabia. It has ignored the groundswell of civil society opposition to these exports. Hopefully, the UN’s report will provoke a different response.” 
The ATT is an international treaty that governs the arms trade. It requires states party to assess weapons exports in order to determine if there is a risk that they could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law or international human rights law. It also prohibits weapons exports where there is a “substantial risk” that it would undermine peace and security. Canada has been a state party to the ATT for one year, and is legally bound by the treaty. 
In 2019, the value of Canadian arms exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled, increasing from almost $1.3 billion dollars in the previous year to almost $2.9 billion dollars last year. They now account for over 75% of Canada’s non-US military exports. Canada’s pledged humanitarian aid for Yemen, 40 million dollars, pales in comparison. 
“Continued arms exports to Saudi Arabia, a country where women and other vulnerable or minority groups are systemically oppressed, also undermine Canada’s commitment to a feminist foreign policy, and go against the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), which Canada endorsed in 2011,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. 
Moreover, in April 2020, the government announced plans to create an arms-length advisory panel of experts, and to spearhead an international effort on the establishment of an inspections regime. Despite multiple inquiries by civil society organizations about these plans, no further information has been provided.

He has committed no crime, yet he has been in jail for over two years. Well that’s not fair, is it?! 
Bernardo is a respected leader of Maya Q’eqchi’ (pronounced ke chi) Indigenous communities. They asked him to take legal action on their behalf to stop the damming of the Cahabón River.  
The dams would create electricity and profit for some. But dozens of Indigenous communities oppose the dams because they violate their human rights and seriously affect the environment on which they depend. There would be fewer fish and less access to water, both of which the communities need to survive. 
The government wanted to stop opposition to the dams. So they arrested Bernardo, accused him of a crime he did not commit and said he was guilty even though there was no evidence.  
Bernardo says: “They sentenced me for robbery. I am not a thief. On the contrary, they are stealing natural resources. They are stealing the river.” 
Guatemala has a history of jailing Indigenous activists to silence them. Bernardo should not be in jail at all.  
During the pandemic, there’s an extra worry. Bernardo is in danger of getting COVID-19 because of crowded conditions in jail.  
Please speak up now. Call for Bernardo to be freed. Your message could be a lifesaver! 
Please write a short, polite letter to Guatemala’s Attorney General.

Responding to the findings, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:  
“Amnesty International condemned the probable commission of crimes against humanity in Venezuela in May 2019. In a milestone for the victims of human rights violations, the much anticipated and hard-hitting report of the Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela endorses this serious denouncement and supports the thousands of victims in their pursuit of justice that has been denied to them in their country. We share the UN’s call to the international justice system, including the International Criminal Court, to guarantee the rights of truth, justice, reparation and non-repetition.” 
“The Fact-Finding Mission’s report echoes and expands upon the denunciations that Venezuelan and international human rights organizations have made in recent years. The authorities under the command of Nicolás Maduro continue to commit grave human rights violations and crimes under international law, such as extrajudicial executions, torture, arbitrary detentions and excessive use of force. The mandate of this international scrutiny mechanism must undoubtedly be renewed and strengthened. To fail to do so would be to turn our backs on the victims, on truth and on justice.” 
In August, 84 national and international human rights organizations called on states at the UN Human Rights Council to renew and strengthen the important mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela during its 45th session. States should ensure that the Fact-Finding Mission has sufficient funding and is empowered to collect, consolidate, preserve and analyze evidence for future prosecutions or other accountability purposes, including international justice mechanisms, in order to avoid impunity for crimes under international law and gross human rights violations committed in Venezuela.

If there’s one thing 2020 has underscored, it’s our reliance on the online world for social connection and interaction. For many of us, online platforms and services like Facebook and Google’s offered a lifeline during the pandemic, allowing us to stay in touch with family and friends, to move work and schooling online and to get up-to-date health information. But this convenience comes at a cost to our human rights, including our mental health, as is powerfully shown in The Social Dilemma, a new documentary released on Netflix last week. 
 
The Social Dilemma opens our eyes to the way our lives are constantly monitored – and controlled – by these platforms. It’s the Truman Show on steroids, monitoring one third of the planet. 
Back in April former Google CEO Eric Schmidt expounded “the benefit of these corporations — which we love to malign — in terms of the ability to communicate … the ability to get information, is profound…” and said that people should be grateful that “these companies got the capital, did the investment, built the tools that we’re using now and have really helped us out.” In the documentary, however, Silicon Valley insiders paint a very different picture. They argue that the worst aspects of humanity keep manifesting themselves on these platforms as a direct result of how the platforms were designed. 
These platforms are designed to optimize three things: i) how long can they keep eyeballs glued to screens; ii) how many new users they can get; and iii) how much ad revenue they can generate from serving ads to people whose eyeballs are on screens. 
This all feeds their underlying business model, which is essentially to harvest and monetize our personal information. This model’s fundamental characteristic is to aggregate vast amounts of data on people by keeping them on the platforms for as long as possible, use that data to infer incredibly detailed profiles on people’s lives and behaviour, and monetize it by selling those predictions to whoever wants to influence them. 
As we warned in our 2019 report, the surveillance-based business model of Facebook and Google is not only inherently incompatible with the right to privacy, but poses a systemic threat to a range of other rights including freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought, and the right to equality and non-discrimination. 
Algorithms on YouTube determine what video will play next, while on Facebook they determine the content on our feeds and what ads will be served to us. Very often these algorithms amplify disinformation and divisive content, fuel racism, and even influence our own beliefs and opinions. 
The film reveals how teams comprising predominantly white men in Silicon Valley are explicitly tasked with exploiting the vulnerabilities of our human psychology: our addictive nature, our need for social validation and our bias towards incendiary and sensationalist content. Precisely because these companies worked out that this is the best way to keep us on for longer, get more and more data about us, make better predictions about us and profit from selling us ads. 
In other words, the whole information ecosystem that currently serves one third of the planet was set up not to serve us but to manipulate and use us. Facebook and Google services appear “free” but, as former Google designer Tristan Harris says in the film, “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product”. And the dominance of the companies’ platforms means it is now effectively impossible to engage with the internet without “consenting” to their surveillance-based business model. 
 
Although the film positions this as a “social dilemma”, it does not need to be a dilemma at all. Despite what we have been led to believe, the internet does not need to depend on surveillance. People who signed up for platforms when they were far more privacy-respecting or before they were acquired by Facebook or Google now face a choice between leaving a service they depend on or submitting to constant surveillance. This is not – and should not be – a legitimate choice. 
We urgently need governments to step up and introduce regulations to overhaul the business model and protect our rights. This a systemic and structural issue that won’t be easy to address and will require a mix of political, legal and structural solutions. 
Efforts to set much stricter limits on the tracking and use of personal data won’t be enough if they don’t address the concentration of data – and power – in the hands of Facebook and Google. At the same time, the increasing chorus of politicians, regulators and academics who propose that Big Tech should be “broken up”, will fail to address the systemic human rights abuses unless they push for measures that holistically tackle the surveillance-based business-model itself. 
No one approach will work on its own, nor can we solve the social dilemma alone. We need leadership and urgent action from our governments to protect us from the abuses of Big Tech.

“We demand an immediate end to the excessive use of security forces against protestors seeking justice for the death of lawyer Javier Ordoñez. In addition, we urge the authorities to send a strong message of condemnation and carry out prompt, exhaustive, independent and impartial investigations into the human rights violations committed by the Colombian police.” 
On 9 September, two police officers violently detained Javier Ordoñez, immobilising him and shooting at him with electric Taser X2 guns for allegedly not complying with selective isolation regulations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Once immobilised, and not posing any danger to the officers whatsoever, they continued to apply direct shocks to his body for approximately five minutes. Javier Ordoñez asked them to please stop, as did witnesses who were recording the incident from close by. He died in hospital hours later. 
In accordance with international human rights standards, electric Taser guns and other similar so-called “less lethal” weapons must be used under similar protocols as lethal weapons, as they can cause serious injuries and even death. Governments must limit their use to situtions in which the lives of the officers who carry them are in genuine and imminent danger; they must only be used as a stun weapon in situations which otherwise would require the use of lethal force, following the principles of legality, neccessity and proportionality in the use of force. The deliberate use of potentially lethal force to mainatin order in the face of threats that are not severe, that do not pose a serious and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of third parties, is considered disproportionate use of lethal force. 
“The use of Tasers in direct contact with the body, as in the case of Javier Ordoñez, is absolutely unacceptable. The prolonged use on a detained and immobilised person who did not represent any danger whatsoever to the officers is clearly punitive, with the aim of intentionally causing severe pain and injuries; thus it constitutes torture,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.  
“In such situations, Tasers should only be used by officers who have undergone a high level of rigourous training and are subject to strict systems of monitoring and accountability, in accordance with UN regulations on the use of force and firearms by police. If governements cannot comply with these regulations, the use of Tasers must be stopped.” 
Following the death of Javier Ordoñez, there were protests on 9 September in Bogotá and other cities, some with acts of vandalism and violence on the part of some protestors. 
Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Team has verified video evidence of different instances of excessive use of force by the National Police in response to these protests. For example, there is evidence of police officers savagely dragging a woman in the vicinity of the Police Immediate Action Commandos (CAI) in Galerías, Bogotá. 
The organization has also verified two incidents wherein police officers fired repeatedly at the place where the protests were taking place, injuring at least one person. One of the incidents took place near CAI Rincón De Suba, at Carrera 93; the other took place near CAI Verbenal at Calle 187, Bogotá. In a video of the second incident, two police officers on motorcycles can be seen driving through the crowd, firing indiscriminately and leaving one person injured on the ground. 
Social unrest has continued to escalate and Amnesty International is also verifying disturbing images of the protests on 10 September and the possible disproportionate use of force by security forces. 
On 10 September the Minister of Defense, who is responsible for the National Police, reported that 403 people were injured (194 of which were members of the security forces) and 10 people were killed (seven in Bogotá and three in Soacha). In the same statement, the Minister of Defence referred to the protests as systematic and coordinated acts of vandalism. On 11 September, the Minister apologised for “any violation of the law or lack of knowledge of the regulations that any members of the institution have been involved in” and announced the removal of five officers from their posts in order to avoid them interfering with the investigation into the death of Javier Ordoñez.  
“It’s unfortunate that the Minister of Defence considers the people’s call for justice and a police force that respects human rights as an act of vandalism. This stigmatization only encourages the police to violate the human rights of the protestors even more,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.  
This is not the first time that the organization has denounced human rights violations by the Colombian Police. In November 2019, Amnesty International verified at least five human rights violations committed by security forces in response to social protests.

Prime Minister of Canada 
80 Wellington Street 
Ottawa, Ontario 
September 10, 2020 
Dear Prime Minister, 
We write this Open Letter, on behalf of 400,000 supporters of Amnesty International across the country, in times of considerable uncertainty, turmoil, injustice and fear; but also of mobilization, courage, determination, and possibility. 
Against that backdrop, you have indicated that your government’s upcoming Throne Speech will lay out a “plan to rebuild a stronger, more resilient Canada” and offer a “roadmap out of the pandemic towards a society that is fairer and more welcoming.” Central to those goals is the imperative to implement a genuinely transformative human rights agenda. This Throne Speech must acknowledge that respect for human rights will be central to all aspect of adopting laws, developing policy, making budgetary choices and taking action. Towards that vision, we urge you to take up the following seven recommendations: 
Background 
We ignore today’s urgent challenges to our collective shame and at our collective peril. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare deep inequality at the heart of Canadian society, which can no longer be ignored. The failure to live up to the responsibility of all Canadians to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples can no longer be ignored.  The refusal to address systemic racism at the root of continuing police violence against Indigenous, Black and racialized communities in the country can no longer be ignored. The harsh reality of gender inequalities and violations of the rights of women, girls, and gender diverse people can no longer be ignored. And the lack of decisive action to avert the global climate crisis can no longer be ignored.      
The global context is of course also of grave concern.  In a time of polarization and conflict, fueled by leaders on all continents who are intent on advancing agendas of intolerance and hate, the paucity of unwavering, principled human rights leadership on the world stage is staggeringly apparent and deeply troubling. 
Amnesty International is calling for seven commitments to be reflected in the government’s Throne Speech, backed up by action and resources included in the next federal budget. 
(1)          Embrace economic, social and cultural rights 
The many grave human rights travesties in the COVID-19 spotlight reflect deeply-rooted inequalities, racism, sexism, discrimination and exploitation that have remained unaddressed despite efforts of communities and activists to press for change over many decades. High rates of death of older people in long-term care facilities, concerns in isolated First Nations communities, low pay and poor working conditions for essential healthcare and other workers, the pandemic’s disproportionate toll on women and LGBTI people in the workforce, higher rates of COVID in racialized communities, increased levels of gender-based violence in the home, outbreaks among migrant agricultural workers and in meat-packing facilities, inadequate health care in prisons and immigration detention, risks faced by homeless persons, and heightened vulnerability of people living with disabilities all have one thing in common.  
At the heart of all of these grave injustices is a failure and refusal — endemic in governments at all levels in Canada — to embrace economic, social and cultural rights, including rights to housing, education, health, food, clean water, safe working conditions and an adequate livelihood. It is not enough to recognize that changes are needed to Canada’s social safety nets. The pathway out of the pandemic will falter without recognition of the impact of intersectional violations of these fundamental rights. 
(2)          Demonstrate genuine respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples 
2020 began with a wave of protests across the country in solidarity with Indigenous land defenders in Wet’suwet’en Territory in British Columbia. While it was at times contentious and volatile, it also opened up much-needed debate and conversations about the consequences of the longstanding and disgraceful failure to recognize and uphold the land rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada. At the time there appeared to be some potential for new approaches, but this was overtaken and seemingly forgotten in the face of the COVID-19 crisis. 
This Throne Speech must include concrete action that will spur progress in reconciliation with and strengthened respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples.  Two overarching commitments, among many others, that have been made previously by your government have been disappointingly delayed and there is uncertainty as to their standing.    
(3)          End systemic racism 
The police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May sparked a wave of protests about entrenched anti-Black racism in policing and justice that continue throughout the United States. At the same time there have been renewed and increased demands to address the systemic racism that fuels police violence against BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour) communities in Canada. Systemic racism permeates all aspects of society in Canada, including education, workplaces, arts and culture, retail and service industries, politics and government, law and the justice system, social services, the non-profit sector, and encounters with police. 
Recent video footage and accounts of killings and assaults of BIPOC individuals by the police, or troubling deaths during exchanges with police, has made it clear that there is far to go in addressing systemic racism and white privilege in Canada. There is not yet any convincing indication of concrete action toward that goal. 
(4)          Address gender inequality 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated human rights abuses already being experienced by women and LGBTQ2S people. Rights abuses are felt most acutely by BIPOC and women and gender diverse people with disabilities. Increased gender-based violence, record job losses, increased unpaid care work, and lack of childcare are increasing inequality, and addressing these issues must be central to a feminist pandemic recovery plan. 
(5)          Take bold climate action 
While the health and economic crises provoked by the COVID-19 pandemic have swept around the world with devastating impact, attention to the global climate crisis has waned. At a time when delays can be catastrophic, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference has been postponed by one year. But the climate crisis itself has not been put on hold. Prime Minister, you have recently expressed an intention to launch an “ambitious green agenda” to guide Canada’s economic recovery from the pandemic. What is needed is a national plan to significantly reduce our emissions and phase out the production and consumption of fossil fuels, while ensuring that no one is left behind and that sufficient climate financing is available to countries in the Global South. 
(6)          Implement international human rights obligations 
While Canada has an admirable, though not perfect, record of signing on to human rights treaties and engaging with UN human rights reviews, the same cannot be said of the country’s record of living up to those obligations and implementing the recommendations from those reviews.  In 2017 your government hosted a long overdue meeting of federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for human rights. Ministers agreed to improve their approach to implementing international human rights obligations. There has been little progress and plans for a follow-up meeting in May 2020 were delayed because of the pandemic. 
Concerns about these shortcomings increased dramatically in the face of COVID-19.  The human rights impact of the pandemic and economic downturn is substantial. Institutions that provide human rights oversight, including Parliament, legislatures, municipal councils, courts and human rights commissions have been scaled back. Over 300 organizations and experts have called on governments in Canada to adopt measures to oversee the human rights impact of their responses to the pandemic.  Your government has indicated some interest in doing so, under the auspices of the Minister of Justice, but there has been no progress. 
(7)          Be a consistent voice for human rights around the world 
Alongside the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, entrenched human rights abuse continues across the globe. Yet with governments preoccupied by the pandemic and many leaders fueling conflict and divisions, principled and decisive human rights leadership is lacking. 
Your government has adopted a feminist international assistance policy and committed to developing a white paper on feminist foreign policy, but contradictions and inconsistencies far too often belie that conviction.  That includes the: 
Prime Minister, Amnesty International has often called on you and your predecessors to make human rights a priority. We do so with particular urgency and expectation at this time. That is because the scale of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, and the large-scale recovery efforts that are required provide an unprecedented opportunity for fundamental change. We cannot afford measures that take us back to where we were. 
Addressing those realities is not a matter of tweaks or of a launching a reform agenda as is conventionally imagined. It is not a matter of simply spending more money (though how spending priorities are set is certainly part of the equation). Rather, this is a time for change that is truly transformational; change that will necessitate considerable political will and leadership. This is the time for change that is entirely about human rights. 
Sincerely,

The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted by the UN General Assembly 13 years ago, on September 13th, 2007, as a global minimum standard to address widespread, severe, and systemic violations of the collective and individual human rights of Indigenous peoples. 
Since that time, the Declaration has been reaffirmed nine times by the General Assembly by consensus. No country in the world formally opposes it. 
The Declaration does not create new rights. It affirms the pre-existing, inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, which constitute the “minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the Indigenous peoples” globally. Implementation of the Declaration’s minimum standards within Canada is long overdue. 
The federal government has publicly committed to introducing legislation to guide national implementation of the Declaration. 
The process of moving such legislation forward must not be allowed to languish in endless hearings and debate. 
As Canada continues to cope with the tragic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and grapples with the challenges of reopening and rebuilding the economy, implementation of the Declaration is now more urgent than ever. 
Worldwide, COVID-19 and the economic impacts of measures to contain the pandemic are hardest felt by marginalized and vulnerable populations, including Indigenous peoples. Federal legislation to implement the Declaration is needed to protect and rebuild Indigenous Nations in this moment of crisis. 
Importance of fall session of Parliament 
Indigenous Nations, organizations, and land defenders, human rights groups, and other civil society partners are urging the federal government to bring the proposed implementation legislation before the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity so that it can be passed into law during this session of Parliament. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada called the Declaration “the framework for reconciliation.” The Declaration lays the foundation for peaceful, collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships between Indigenous peoples and states by ensuring that the basic human rights of Indigenous peoples can no longer be simply ignored or pushed aside. 
Those who continue to oppose implementation of the Declaration have focused their attacks on the very provisions most essential to reconciliation. 
Self-determination, and its essential corollary, free, prior and informed consent, are about bringing an end to a long and tragic history of governments in Canada imposing arbitrary and profoundly harmful decisions on Indigenous peoples. “Consent” should not be confused with “veto” – which implies an absolute right, regardless of the facts and law in any given case. Misunderstandings and misinformation over Indigenous consent cannot continue to delay and obstruct federal legislation to implement the Declaration. 
Implementing the Declaration is the necessary next step in the positive evolution of Canadian law and policy, which today increasingly recognize the decision-making authority and jurisdiction of Indigenous governments. The Declaration creates space for legal pluralism and for the laws and legal systems of Indigenous peoples to be respected and upheld. Respect for the right of self-determination is also essential to the health and wellness of Indigenous peoples. 
Federal legislation will not bring about an overnight transformation.  
As agreed by the federal government, Bill C-262 – the former private member’s bill on the Declaration – will be the “floor” for the proposed legislation. C-262 was intended to establish a process for the government to work with Indigenous peoples to identify reforms needed to bring federal laws and policies into line with the requirements of the Declaration. Specific reforms in areas such as resource development would inevitably involve further consultation and, if laws are to be changed, additional Parliamentary debate. 
Crucially, however, adoption of implementation legislation will provide the immediate benefit of resolving ongoing uncertainty and confusion resulting from years of federal government delays in implementing the Declaration. Adoption of implementation legislation will clearly communicate to other levels of government, to industry, and to the public the federal government’s intention to uphold its human rights commitments and obligations in a spirit of partnership and collaboration with Indigenous peoples. 
In 2019, the British Columbia legislature adopted by consensus the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. BC is the first province to adopt legislation committed to the implementation of the Declaration. To a large extent, this Act was modeled on C-262. The Act continues to contribute significantly to positive exercise of human rights by Indigenous peoples and to harmonious relations in the province. 
Importance of a new relationship 
The Declaration provides the basis for decolonization and upholding the rights of Indigenous peoples, including the inherent right to self-determination. 
Political leaders of all stripes have talked about the importance of building a new relationship with First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples throughout Canada. Putting those promises into action is essential to meeting Canada’s fundamental legal and moral obligations. It is also essential to building a healthy, strong and inclusive society. 
The past year has demonstrated the tragic consequences of failing to close the wide gulf in health, quality of life, and access to justice between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and communities in Canada. 
While the COVID-19 pandemic affects us all, it is clear that the greatest burden is borne by those who have been provided with the least resources for staying healthy. Addressing the crisis of unsafe water, overcrowded housing, and employment insecurity among Indigenous communities in Canada is not something that can be put off until after the pandemic. 
Media attention to incidents of police violence against Indigenous peoples and racialized communities has similarly put a spotlight on the dangers created by systemic racism in policing. At the same time, as the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls demonstrated, the Canadian justice system has long failed to provide adequate protection to those in greatest need, including Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit persons facing threats of violence. 
The systemic racism faced by First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples further underlines the importance and urgency of ensuring that Indigenous peoples have the opportunity and resources to determine for themselves what measures are needed to best protect the safety and health of their communities. 
We all hope that the coming year will be one of healing and rebuilding. Critically, as Canada moves forward, we need to do more than build back: we need to build back better and different. 
The opportunity for Indigenous peoples to make their own decisions, based on their own laws, traditions and values, and the assurance that other orders of government will respect and support those decisions, is crucial to ensuring that economic development decisions and the design and provision of social services will be sustainable and meet the real and urgent needs of Indigenous peoples in Canada. 
Long overdue implementation of the Declaration is key. 
  
Background 
Human rights declarations are adopted globally by the UN General Assembly. The expectation that national governments will create national action plans to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is set out in a series of consensus resolutions of the UN General Assembly, including the outcome document of the 2014 World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. 
Bill C-262, a private members bill to establish a legislative framework for implementation of the Declaration, was passed by the House of Commons in 2018 and would already be part of Canadian law except for filibustering in the Senate.

For decades, women human rights defenders across Latin America have been fighting an uphill battle to ensure sexual and reproductive rights, including access to safe abortion, are a reality for all. Over the last five months that battle has turned into a war. 
The figures have been shocking for a long time. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned them into a catastrophe, with a potential bleak future. 
Over the last five months, already high rates of violence against women have risen exponentially across the world. Countries such as Chile and Mexico have reported increases of more than 50 percent in calls to emergency helplines for women who are victims and survivors of violence. 
Experts worry about the many women who are trapped at home with their abusers without access to a phone, a computer or anyone they can contact for help or support. 
Enforced lockdowns and other barriers to mobility have also prevented many women from accessing essential health services, including sexual and reproductive health care, contraceptives and safe abortions. 
The UN has painted a bleak picture of what is to come. Their latest estimates say that lockdowns over a six-month period could leave 47 million women across the world unable to access contraceptives. This could lead to an estimated seven million additional unintended pregnancies. Many could take place in Latin America, where access to safe abortions has been limited by draconian laws and a lack of information.   
Experts and frontline workers worry that many of those women, trapped in vicious cycles of marginalization and violence, will turn to unsafe and life-threatening procedures. The consequences are too frightening to contemplate. But activists across Latin America have been stepping up to the challenge and designing strategies to help those in need. 
Johana Cepeda, a nurse and human rights activist from Colombia, says the pandemic has added additional hurdles to those that many women already faced when trying to access a safe abortion. 
Voluntary termination of a pregnancy is only legal in Colombia under three specific circumstances that the country’s Constitutional Court approved in 2006: when the life or health of the woman is at risk, when the pregnancy is the result of rape, or in cases of fatal foetal impairment. 
“The barriers to access range from lack of information to incorrect interpretations of the health clause of the ruling. Many consider the concept of ‘health’ as limited to having an illness but lack a wider understanding of it as including physical, mental and social wellbeing,” Cepeda explains. 
Most clinics offering abortion services in Colombia are located in urban centres. With a significant proportion of the population living in rural areas, geography is often a factor that prevents women from accessing health care. 
Appointment with doctors are usually booked over the phone or the internet. But since the start of the pandemic and the lockdowns that followed, many women have found themselves living in abusive situations or lacking the privacy needed to seek help confidentially. 
“For women who have been in isolation with violent partners who abuse them or control their decisions, even calling for information has been extremely difficult,” Cepeda says. “Strict quarantines make it difficult for women to travel. For many, if a police officer stops them and asks where they’re going, it’s not easy to say they’re going to get an abortion.”  
The Collective for the Life and Health of Women, a feminist organization that provides support for women to access legal abortions in Colombia, has documented 30 cases of women who have faced barriers when trying to access abortions between March and the end of May 2020. The unreported number is likely to be much higher. They found that private and public health services are deprioritizing any health issues not related to the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the fact that some, such as unwanted pregnancies, are particularly time sensitive. 
The situation is similar in other countries across the region. In Chile, abortion has also been permitted since 2017 in just three circumstances: when the pregnancy is a result of rape, when the life of the pregnant woman is at risk, and in cases of fatal foetal impairment. Even then, a woman seeking an abortion must secure approval from two specialist doctors. Activists say these requirements amount to life-threatening hurdles. 
Gloria Maira, a human rights activist and coordinator of the Action for Abortion in Chile, a network of organizations and activists working for women’s right to access safe abortions, says that, despite the recent legislation, abortion remains extremely hard to access in the country. 
“There are many obstacles that limit women’s ability to make their own decisions,” Maira says. “The lack of information about the law, problems with its implementation and the difficulties when it comes to the accreditation of the reasons for the abortion are some of them. The implementation of the law has been minimal.” 
Half of obstetricians in Chile are believed to refuse to provide abortions, even under the circumstances permitted under the law, due to objections on the grounds of their religious beliefs, according to a poll by the Ministry of Health. Feminist organizations say many others lack information about the law, a subject that is yet to be included in most medical schools’ curriculums. 
This leaves many women with no option but to resort to life threatening back-street abortions. 
Javiera Canales, a lawyer and human rights activist with Miles Chile, an organization that promotes sexual and reproductive rights, says that the figures tell a very concerning picture. 
“In the last three years, we’ve documented 128 cases of access to lawful abortion by children under 14 years of age. However, in 2019 alone, there were 647 children aged 10 and 13 that were admitted to programmes for prenatal care. This tells us their lawful access [to abortions] is being blocked,” Canales says. 
“The question is: why wasn’t the law applied in those rape cases? Nobody has explained this because no one has been looking at it.” 
The difficulties in accessing health care services paint a bleak picture of the future for women in Latin America.  
“Women will continue to abort,” Canales says. “Our concern is that they will turn to unsafe back-street abortions again.” 
Local activists are extremely worried that a lack of access to safe abortion will lead to a rise in preventable deaths. 
The organization Marie Stopes International estimates that around 1.9 million women that were served by their programmes around the world were not able to access their services between January and June 2020. They estimate that the disruption could lead to an additional 1.5 millon unsafe abortions and 3,100 additional maternal deaths. 
Maira says that, in Chile, human rights organizations have been filling in the gap left by authorities when it comes to prioritizing the provision of sexual and reproductive health services for women, particularly for those living in rural areas who have less access. 
“The networks are reporting an increase in the demand of safe abortions, which would not be surprising as sexual violence has also increased but the lack of abortion medication is making any response very challenging,” Maira explains. 
Fernanda Doz Costa, deputy director for the Americas at Amnesty International, says that by denying turning a blind eye to women’s sexual and reproductive rights, world leaders are risking a new pandemic. 
“For decades, activists across Latin America have warned of the wave of preventable deaths and health complications caused by the lack of adequate health care for women. Health authorities, the UN and the IACHR are already calling on governments to guarantee access to sexual and reproductive health services, which are essential health care and, as such,  should not be suspended under the pandemic.” 
Faced with a shortage of contraceptives and medicines used during abortion procedures since Chile closed its borders and the reprioritization of non-COVID-19 related health services, local activists are taking a proactive approach to helping women. 
Almost as soon as the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, local organizations found ways to continue to provide free legal, health, social and psychological assistance online. 
Miles, for example, is organizing transport for women living in cities where no doctor would approve a legal abortion so that they can reach other health centres. Other networks of activists have been expanding to reach the whole country. 
Maira says part of the problem is that President Sebastián Piñera, who is a vocal opponent of the law allowing safe abortions, has kept the issue off the table. 
“The pandemic is providing an excuse to the government who, since before, did not want to guarantee access to abortion,” she explains. 
Things have also changed a lot in Colombia since the eruption of the pandemic as activists say reproductive health services have been deprioritized. 
“We had to rethink our strategies and the way we support women, but what unites us is the need women have to access these essential services and the responsibility we feel for other women who need us,” Cepeda says. 
One of the strategies they have been pushing for in Colombia is the use of telehealth in the public sector, so women can have access to the medication they need and take it at home, without the need to go to a clinic. This is a service that is already in use in the private sector, Cepeda explains. 
“The situation is very frustrating,” Canales adds. “But the small battles that we win, such as seeing a woman able to access the care she needs or free herself from her aggressor are the little victories that fuel our fight.

The groups hailed from more than 60 countries around the world – from Azerbaijan to Zambia, from Morocco to Malaysia, from Vietnam to Venezuela. 
The signatories stressed the need to address rampant human rights violations across China, including in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. They also highlighted the impact of China’s rights violations worldwide, including the targeting of human rights defenders; global censorship and surveillance; and rights-free development that has caused environmental degradation.  
“This global coalition of organizations, 50 UN experts, and dozens of governments are all demanding an end to China’s impunity at the UN Human Rights Council,” said John Fisher, Geneva director at Human Rights Watch. “The UN needs to act on the growing chorus of voices calling for China to be held accountable for its rights abuses.” 
The groups’ call echoes an unprecedented statement by more than 50 UN human rights experts, who in June 2020 detailed the Chinese authorities’ serious rights violations and called for “decisive measures to protect fundamental freedoms in China”. 
“China’s disdain for human rights no longer affects only its citizens – its support for dictators and efforts to rewrite international standards are making the work of defending human rights harder than ever,” said Sarah Brooks, Brussels Liaison at the International Service for Human Rights. “This joint statement, for the first time, unites organizations from around the world fighting for their own communities with common cause”. 
In their statement, the coalition highlighted China’s efforts to distort the mandate of the UN Human Rights Council by persecuting activists from China who use UN mechanisms to seek redress, and opposing initiatives to bring scrutiny of serious rights violations and international crimes in countries around the world. China typically rejects UN consideration of its human rights record as “gross interference”. 
“China has systematically persecuted rights defenders in reprisal for their cooperation with UN human rights operations – torture, enforced disappearance, imprisonment, and stripping licenses from lawyers,” said Renee Xia, director of Chinese Human Rights Defenders. “The UN system should no longer tolerate such treatment.” 
The coalition endorses the UN experts’ calls for a special session of the Human Rights Council to evaluate the range of violations by China’s government, and an impartial and independent UN mechanism focused on China. The groups also urge the UN Secretary-General and High Commissioner for Human Rights to take responsibility for publicly addressing China’s sweeping rights violations. 
“The international community can no longer sit back and allow the Chinese authorities to trample on human rights at home and abroad,” said Joshua Rosenzweig, the head of Amnesty International’s China team. “Without decisive action now, things will only get worse. It is urgent for UN member states to work together and ensure that violations committed by Beijing are officially monitored and meaningfully challenged. No state should be above the law.”

The last time I saw Julian Assange he looked tired and wan. 
Dressed neatly in casual business attire, the Wikileaks founder was sitting in a glass-enclosed dock, at the back of a courtroom adjoining Belmarsh high security prison in London, flanked by two prison officers. 
I had travelled from the US to observe the hearing. He had travelled via tunnel from his cell to the courtroom.  
Today, Julian Assange will be in court again, for the resumption of proceedings that will ultimately decide on the Trump administration’s request for his extradition to the US. 
But it is not just Julian Assange that will be in the dock. Beside him will sit the fundamental tenets of media freedom that underpin the rights to freedom of expression and the public’s right to access to information. Silence this one man, and the US and its accomplices will gag others, spreading fear of persecution and prosecution over a global media community already under assault in the US and in many other countries worldwide. 
The stakes really are that high. If the UK extradites Assange, he would face prosecution in the USA on espionage charges that could send him to prison for decades – possibly in a facility reserved for the highest security detainees and subjected to the strictest of daily regimes, including prolonged solitary confinement. All for doing something news editors do the world over – publishing public interest information provided by sources .  
Indeed, President Donald Trump has called Wikileaks “disgraceful” and said that its actions in publishing classified information should carry the death penalty. 
The chilling effect on other publishers, investigative journalists and any person who would dare to facilitate the publication of classified information of government wrongdoing would be immediate and severe.  And the US would boldly go beyond its own borders with a long arm to reach non-citizens, like Assange, who is Australian.  
The US government’s relentless pursuit of Assange – and the UK’s willing participation in his hunt and capture – has now landed him in a prison typically reserved for seasoned criminals. It has diminished him both physically and emotionally – often to the point of disorientation. Breaking him by isolating Assange from family, friends and his legal team, seems part and parcel of the US’s strategy – and it seems to be working. 
You don’t need to know the vagaries of extradition law to understand that the charges against Assange are not only classic “political offences” and thus barred under extradition law, but more crucially, the charges are politically-motivated.  
The 17 charges levelled by the US under the 1918 Espionage Act could bring 175 years in prison; add a conviction on the single computer fraud charge (said to complement the Espionage Act by dragging it into the computer era), and you get another gratuitous five years. Assange is the only publisher ever to bear the brunt of such espionage charges.   
There is no doubt that the charges are politically-motivated under this US administration, which has all but convicted Assange in the public arena. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed that Wikileaks is a “hostile intelligence service” whose activities must be “mitigated and managed.” The flagrantly unfair prosecution of Assange is an example of how far the US will go to “manage” the flow of information about government wrongdoing and thus undermine the public’s right to know.   
Assange was on Barack Obama’s radar, too, but the Obama administration declined to prosecute Assange. Current US Attorney General William Barr, however, has turned out not one, but two indictments since 2019, the latest at the end of June. That second indictment was a surprise not only to Assange’s defence team, but to the Crown lawyer and the judge who were also taken unawares by the new indictment.  
Earlier this year, sitting 20 feet away from Julian Assange, I was struck by how much of a shadow of his former self he had become. He did spontaneously stand up several times during that week of hearings to address the judge. He told her he was confused. He told her he could not properly hear the proceedings. He said that barriers in the prison and in court meant that he had not been able to consult with his lawyers. He was not technically permitted to address the judge directly, but he did repeatedly, flashes of the aggressive tactics used in the past to advocate for himself and the principles he has espoused.  
If Julian Assange is extradited it will have far reaching human rights implications, setting a chilling precedent for the protection of those who publish leaked or classified information that is in the public interest. 
Publishing such information is a cornerstone of media freedom and the public’s right to access information. It must be protected, not criminalized.

0,No safe haven: New report highlights Canada’s failure to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/no-safe-haven-new-report-highlights-canadas-failure-to-prosecute-individuals-accused-of-war-crimes-and-crimes-against-humanity/,"OTTAWA – The recent murder of a Liberian national who had settled in Ontario has made one thing clear: Canada is failing to bring those suspected of crimes against humanity and war crimes to justice.

In late June, Bill Horace was shot dead in London, Ontario. He had been widely accused of committing mass murder, rape and torture in Liberia during the 1990s. Despite a mountain of evidence against him, Canadian officials never charged Horace, allowing him to live freely in this country since he first arrived in 2002. 
On the heels of Horace’s murder, Amnesty International is releasing a new report in the No Safe Haven series, which documents how judicial systems around the world – including those in Bulgaria, Germany and Spain – are failing to effectively prosecute those suspected of crimes under international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. This latest report details how Canada’s Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Program is grossly underfunded and underused. 
“More often than not, Canada washes its hands of the responsibility to adequately prosecute alleged war criminals, failing to take any action or opting to deport them without any guarantees they will be investigated for their crimes or be protected from serious human rights violations themselves,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International’s English branch in Canada. “Longstanding failure to sufficiently resource efforts to bring persons suspected of responsibility for crimes under international law and human rights violators to justice in Canada through universal jurisdiction means that Canada risks impunity for those accused of the worst possible crimes in the world. Canada must do everything to ensure that such individuals face justice, rather than evade justice, in Canada.” 
In 2000, Canada enacted the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act (CAHWCA), which enshrines universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in Canadian law. The result is that such crimes are criminalized in Canada even when committed abroad. But over the two decades since, only two individuals have been prosecuted under the CAHWCA, both linked to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. 
“This is not what was envisioned when Canada championed the International Criminal Court (ICC) and amended our domestic legislation to ensure this country would play a key role in delivering international justice,” said Lloyd Axworthy, who was the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs when the CAHWCA was enacted and led international efforts to set up the ICC. “The intention was for Canada to dedicate the resources and political will needed to ensure that individuals accused of masterminding and carrying out terrible atrocities – genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity – would have nowhere to hide and would, at long last, face justice for their terrible deeds.” 
In R v Munyaneza, Désiré Munyaneza was convicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide committed throughout 1994 in Rwanda and sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole for 25 years. 
In 2009, Jacques Mungwarere faced prosecution for genocide and crimes against humanity in Rwanda, also during the 1990s. In July 2013, Mungwarere was acquitted, and the government is not appealing the decision. 
No other charges have been laid for more than ten years. 
“For 20 years, Canada has failed to adequately take up cases of universal jurisdiction,” said Fannie Lafontaine, Canada Research Chair on International Criminal Justice and Human Rights at Laval University. “Faced with an inadequate budget for criminal prosecutions, the War Crimes Program, which is tasked with ‘denying safe haven’ to individuals suspected of committing crimes against humanity and war crimes, has generally opted to screen individuals and deny them entry into Canada rather than seek prosecution. This means that those who have survived and witnessed horrific crimes around the world are left without adequate justice.” 
From 1997 to 2007, over 17,000 cases of suspected war criminals were reviewed in the offices of the Canada Border Services Agency and Citizenship and Immigration Canada. More than 3,700 people were barred entry to Canada as a result. Between 2009 and 2015, 138 individuals were removed from Canada as there were reasonable grounds to believe they were involved in crimes against humanity, war crimes, or genocide, 285 people were denied refugee protection, 47 claimants were found inadmissible, and one person’s citizenship was revoked. 
The budget for the War Crimes Program, in its entirety, is $15.6 million per year. This budget has remained static since the program’s inception in 1998, but the costs of conducting investigations have risen significantly. 
In this latest No Safe Haven report, Amnesty International systematically reviews Canada’s efforts to implement its obligations to combat impunity for the most serious offences under international criminal law. Coordinated by Sébastien Jodoin, Canada Research Chair in Human Rights and the Environment at McGill University, and developed with the input of lawyers, legal scholars, and law students across Canada, the report makes several recommendations to the Canadian government, including increasing resources for the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Program, improving the protection of and support for victims and witnesses and ending legal and political obstacles.

UPDATE JANUARY 6, 2021 > Bail application denied! Read more: UK: Decision to refuse Assange bail renders his continued detention ‘arbitrary’ 
Julian Assange is currently being held at Belmarsh, a high security prison in the UK, on the basis of a US extradition request on charges that stem directly from the publication of disclosed documents as part of his work with Wikileaks. He faces up to 175 years if convicted. Initial hearings on the case were held last February with Amnesty’s Julia Hall there as an observer. 
On March 25, 2020, Julian Assange’s lawyers applied for bail, reiterating health concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Bail was denied. Decreasing the prison population and the number of people in detention centres is a crucial means of slowing the spread of COVID-19 and keeping people safe. If Julian Assange has an underlying condition that puts him at risk, he should be immediately released on bail, as should any detainees and prisoners at such risk who does not pose a risk to society. 
UPDATE: The full extradition hearing resumed on September 7, and ran for four weeks. On October 1, the District Judge announced that she will pronounce the judgement on January 4, 2021.  
Amnesty International was repeatedly denied observer status.  Read our responses from Julia Hall and Stefan Simanowitz.  You can follow @StefSimanowitz and @JuliaHall18 on Twitter for updates on the case.  
In the context of the Assange case, publication of disclosed documents mirrors the work of investigative journalists. Punishing this kind of activity can have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression, leading journalists to self-censor from fear of prosecution. 
Amnesty International strongly opposes any possibility of Julian Assange being extradited or sent in any other manner to the USA. Such a transfer brings with it the risk of serious human rights violations including possible detention conditions that would amount to torture and other ill-treatment (such as prolonged solitary confinement. Additionally, the fact that he was the target of a negative public campaign by US officials at the highest levels undermines his right to be presumed innocent and puts him at risk of an unfair trial. 
International human rights law and standards forbid the transfer of an individual to another country where there is a real risk they would face serious human rights violations.

Julian Assange’s extradition hearing resumes today and is expected to last several weeks. 
The hearing will decide on the Trump administration’s request for Julian Assange’s extradition to the US, where he faces a sentence of up to 175 years for publishing materials that document possible war crimes committed by the US military. 
“This hearing is the latest worrying salvo in a full-scale assault on the right to freedom of expression. If Julian Assange is prosecuted it could have a chilling effect on media freedom, leading publishers and journalists to self-censor in fear of retaliation,” said Amnesty International’s Europe Director, Nils Muižnieks. 
“If Julian Assange is extradited it will have far reaching human rights implications, setting a chilling precedent for the protection of those who publish classified information in the public interest.” 
The US extradition request is based on charges that stem directly from the publication of classified documents as part of Assange’s journalistic work with Wikileaks. Publishing such information is a cornerstone of media freedom and the public’s right to access public interest information, and must be protected rather than criminalized. 
In the US, Julian Assange could face trial on 18 charges, 17 of them under the Espionage Act; and one under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He would also face a real risk of serious human rights violations including detention conditions that could amount to torture or other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement. Julian Assange is the first publisher to face charges under the Espionage Act. 
The fact that Assange was the target of a negative public campaign by US officials at the highest levels undermines his right to be presumed innocent and puts him at risk of an unfair trial. 
“The UK must abide by its obligations under international human rights law, which forbid the transfer of individuals to another country where they would face serious human rights violations,” said Nils Muižnieks.

The case will begin at the Old Bailey, London, on the morning of 7 September. Stefan Simanowitz will be outside the court with an Amnesty International spokesperson. 
Amnesty will have trial observers monitoring remotely the entire series of hearings. During the first week, Sebastian Elgueta (@sebelgueta), a UK based barrister, will be monitoring. 
Background: 
Amnesty International also has concerns with regard to Julian Assange’s physical and mental well-being, particularly with the spread of COVID-19. 
Conditions in UK prisons and detention centres are substandard. It is imperative that health and safety protocols are put in place to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, while ensuring that prisoners’ and detainees’ rights are protected. Bail or release should be considered for any detainee or prisoner who has serious underlying health conditions and is particularly at risk of infection.

He returned home on 4 September 2020, after serving his one-year sentence. 
To mark World Press Freedom Day in May, over 4000 Amnesty supporters from across Canada spoke out for Roberto’s freedom, highlighting to authorities that his underlying health conditions put him at particular risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. During his detention since September 2019, Roberto Quiñones Haces regularly reported the prison conditions in which he was held. On 31 March, he wrote in Cubanet that even though prison authorities implemented certain measures regarding COVID-19, “the quality of the food is still deplorable. Despite reports of the vulnerability of older adults (prisoners over 60) to COVID-19, many of them are kept in cubicles where they live in overcrowded conditions with almost two dozen people.”  
Although it is good news that Roberto Quiñones is finally home, his conviction and imprisonment for merely expressing his opinions, should never have happened. The Municipal Court of Guantánamo had sentenced him in August 2019 for resistance and disobedience. 
After his release, Roberto thanked Amnesty International deeply for all the support and hard work on his behalf and reconfirmed his commitment to defend independent journalism and freedom of expression in Cuba. Amnesty International will continue to monitor his situation.

Rafael Acosta Arévalo, a retired captain in the Venezuelan Navy, disappeared in the town of Guatire in the state of Miranda on 21 June 2019. Amnesty International obtained 550 pages of the criminal case file from the investigation into two officials of the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) attached to the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM), who are accused of involvement in his death. 
“Contrary to the outcome of the investigation by the Venezuelan justice system, Rafael Acosta Arévalo did not die in a hospital. He was forcibly disappeared, tortured and died before a judge. Justice has not been done in this case,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The information available shows that Rafael Acosta Arévalo was the victim of enforced disappearance from 21 June to 26 June, the date on which the Venezuelan authorities announced he had been arrested. According to an official document in the case file, the DGCIM officials took him to a hospital on 28 June, but hours later, as he was dying, he appeared before a military court which presented charges against him, despite the fact that he was retired and no longer a member of the Armed Forces. 
Amnesty International’s investigation found that Rafael Acosta Arévalo died on 28 June 2019 in the room where the arraignment hearing took place, without receiving medical care in the moments before his death. This evidence contradicts the official version of the Venezuelan authorities, who stated publicly that he died at the Vicente Salias Military Hospital after receiving medical treatment. 
Amnesty International has received multiple reports of arbitrary detentions and initial periods of incommunicado detention, as well as the existence of clandestine detention centres run by the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN) and the DGCIM. In this case, despite the lack of information on Acosta Arévalo’s whereabouts in the days prior to his death, one of the defendants in the case – who is attached to the DGCIM – declared that the victim was transferred from Guatire to a “basement”. Amnesty International calls for an impartial and independent investigation to be carried out by a civilian authority – not a military one – into the possibility that Rafael Acosta Arévalo was transferred to a clandestine detention centre where he was tortured. 
Other findings from the investigation suggest that the officers accused – and subsequently convicted – in the case of Rafael Acosta Arévalo gave contradictory versions of the events. The police records of the investigation do not link the actions of those convicted to the death of the victim and, in addition, the charges brought against the officials suggest that Acosta Arévalo’s death was accidental, ignoring the fact that it was the consequence of multiple and serious injuries that compromised his lungs to the point of causing severe cerebral inflammation. 
“In the 550 pages of the case file that Amnesty International has had access to, the word torture is not mentioned even once, despite the fact that there are multiple documents that refer to the more than 50 physical injuries sustained by the victim and his precarious state of health when he appeared before the military court to be charged, seven days after his family reported his disappearance and two days after the authorities admitted that he had been detained,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, stated in July 2020 that: “Documented cases included severe beatings with boards, suffocation with plastic bags and chemicals, submerging the head of the victim under water, electric shocks to the eyelids, and sexual violence in the form of electric shocks to genitalia. Detainees were also exposed to cold temperatures and/or constant electric light, handcuffed and/or blindfolded for long periods of time, and subjected to death threats against themselves and their relatives.” 
Amnesty International maintains that there are hundreds of cases, like that of Rafael Acosta Arévalo, which should be investigated by an independent international mechanism that guarantees justice, truth and reparation for the victims of human rights violations and crimes under international law, given that it is not possible to achieve this through the Venezuelan justice system. It should be noted that the cases of arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture, extrajudicial execution and civilians subject to criminal proceedings before military courts in Venezuela are part of a systematic, generalized policy for which individual criminal responsibility at the highest levels of government must be determined 
The Venezuelan justice system has been called into question for lending itself to the criminalization of dissidents and endorsing arbitrary detentions and other crimes under international law and human rights violations. Therefore, today more than ever, it is essential that the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission, which was created by the Human Rights Council and will present its first report this September, is renewed, without precluding the involvement of other international bodies. 
“The new evidence shows how little confidence there is in the Venezuelan justice system to deliver truth, justice and reparation for victims of human rights violations. The case of Rafael Acosta Arévalo highlights the need for international mechanisms to assume leadership in the search for truth, justice and reparation for victims of crimes under international law and human rights violations in Venezuela. It is vital that the international community support, strengthen and safeguard the work of the Fact-Finding Mission,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.

Every health worker has the right to be safe at work, and it is a scandal that so many are paying the ultimate price,” said Steve Cockburn, Head of Economic and Social Justice at Amnesty International. 
“Many months into the pandemic, health workers are still dying at horrific rates in countries such as Mexico, Brazil and the USA, while the rapid spread of infections in South Africa and India show the need for all states to take action. 
“There must be global cooperation to ensure all health workers are provided with adequate protective equipment, so they can continue their vital work without risking their own lives.” 
In a 13 July report Amnesty International found that over 3,000 health workers had died after contracting COVID-19. The latest figures are driven by increasing rates of COVID-19 in several countries, as well as the availability of new data sources. The countries with the highest estimated numbers of health workers who have died from COVID-19 include Mexico (1,320), USA (1,077), UK (649), Brazil (634), Russia (631), India (573), South Africa (240), Italy (188), Peru (183), Iran (164) and Egypt (159). 
Figures for countries may not always be directly comparable due to different methods used to collect data, and definitions of health workers used in different countries. 
These figures are likely to be a significant underestimate, due to underreporting by many of the countries included in the analysis. 
South Africa strike 
Amnesty International’s new figures come amid widespread industrial action in South Africa. Today the National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) is expected to protest outside parliament, with plans for a nationwide strike on 10 September if demands are not met. 
The government has so far failed to meet the demands of workers, which include the adequate provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), active involvement of workers in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Committees at workplaces, psychosocial support, transport, and hazard pay for frontline workers. 
By early August, at least 240 health workers were known to have died in South Africa after contracting COVID-19. South Africa has experienced a surge in COVID-19 related deaths since July, and there are now more than half a million confirmed cases in the country as a whole. 
Surge in India 
India has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases in the last few months, with over 3,690,000 confirmed cases across the country, and over 65,000 deaths. Figures from the Ministry of Health reported in the media last week state that over 87,000 health workers have been infected, and 573 have died. Over half of the health worker deaths (292) occurred in the state of Maharashtra. 
Health workers in India have been raising concerns about safety. In August, hundreds of thousands of community health workers (ASHA workers) went on strike to demand adequate PPE, better pay and just and favourable conditions of work. 
1,320 deaths in Mexico  
The number of COVID-19 infections has recently passed seven million in Latin America, and Amnesty International recorded especially high numbers of health worker deaths in Mexico (1320), Brazil (634) and Peru (183). 
In Mexico, the official health worker death toll is a staggering 1320. As of 25 August, the Mexican Ministry of Health confirmed 97,632   cases of COVID 19 among health workers. 
There have been reports that hospital cleaners in Mexico are especially vulnerable to infection. Many cleaners in health settings in Mexico are outsourced, which means they have less protection. In May Amnesty International documented the case of 70-year-old Don Alejandro, who works as a cleaner in state hospital facilities in Mexico City. Don Alejandro told Amnesty International he had requested to be re-assigned to clean in administrative areas, due to his risk profile for COVID-19, and that his employer granted this request but reduced his income by approximately 16%. 
Amnesty International highlighted the fact that the Mexican government has been keeping a detailed registry of health worker deaths, with disaggregated data on age, gender and profession. Such transparency is essential and all countries should be making this kind of detail available; it may also go some way to explaining the disturbing figures from Mexico relative to other countries. 
Lack of PPE and clear protocols in Brazil 
In Brazil, at least 634 health workers have died from COVID-19. According to Associação Brasileira de Saúde Coletiva (ABRASCO), a health professional association, health workers have complained about insufficient PPE, a lack of clear protocols to manage infections, the absence of mental health support, minimal social protection for family members, and precarious contracts for those recruited on an emergency basis. 
“We are calling on all governments to take urgent measures to protect the lives of health workers. As well as increasing the supply of protective equipment, they must listen to health workers who speak out about their working conditions, and respect their rights to organize,” said Steve Cockburn. 
“Throughout the pandemic governments have hailed health workers as heroes, but this rings hollow when so many workers are dying from a lack of basic protection.” 
Methodology 
Working with a data scientist, Amnesty International regularly reviews and collates data related to deaths among health care workers from multiple sources. Sources include memorial pages, government figures, lists compiled by national medical associations, and lists and obituaries published in media around the world. All sources and explanatory information are available on the online interactive map.

Grassy Narrows Youth, Canada  
 
For more than 50 years, the people of Asubpeeschoseewagong (Grassy Narrows) First Nation have suffered the effects of mercury poisoning in one of Canada’s worst health crises. Generations of Indigenous youth have been particularly affected and have taken their place at the forefront of the calls for a healthy environment. Over 15,000 messages from Write for Rights participants in Canada contributed to the 400,000 letters Prime Minister Trudeau received from around the world. 
After years of delay, a $19.5 million agreement to build a care facility was finally signed on April 2, 2020 — an important step towards justice for the people of Grassy Narrows. Read more. 
Yasaman Aryani, Iran 
 
In Write for Rights history, only two cases have ever amassed over one million actions — that of Edward Snowden during Write for Rights 2017 and Yasaman Aryani in 2019. Activists worldwide spoke out for Yasaman’s freedom following her sentence to 16 years in prison for standing up to Iran’s forced veiling laws. Yasaman’s case is part of a wider crackdown on women’s rights defenders campaigning against forced veiling in Iran.  
In February, a partial victory — an Iranian Appeals Court substantially reduced Yasaman’s sentence, from 16 to 5.5 years. We won’t stop until she’s free.  
Magai Matiop Ngong, South Sudan 
 
Magai Matiop Ngong was only 15 when he was sentenced to death. But thanks in part to a hefty 765,000 actions during Write for Rights, his death sentence was cancelled in July 2020 and he was taken off death row! 
“To Amnesty, tell them that I am so happy and grateful for what they have done to me and my family…”, said Magai. “I’m so blissful and blessed to have them as a support for my life and freedom.”

Sarah Mardini and Seán Binder, Greece 
 
Write for Rights activists took 729,072 actions for Seán Binder and Sarah Mardini. The pair worked as rescue workers for an organization in Lesvos. Their job was to spot boats in distress at sea and to help refugees who were fleeing abuses in their home countries. Those tasks were cut short by charges such as smuggling and spying. They still await trial.  
The campaign has increased awareness not only about their situation, but also the broader issues they represent. In March, Sarah and Sean were featured in a new Amnesty campaign “Free to Help” about the hundreds of people who are being punished across Europe just for helping or showing solidarity with those in need. Amnesty continues to monitor the case of Seán and Sarah closely and are in contact with them and their lawyers.  
Marinel Sumook Ubaldo, Philippines 
 
Pictured above: Marinel joined the Amnesty International delegation attending the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Spain. 
Marinel Sumook Ubaldo is a survivor of Typhoon Yolanda that hit the Philippines hard in 2013. At the age of 16, the disaster propelled her to become a climate justice activist. She says that Write for Rights increased her confidence and determination: “It made a huge different to the way I see my activism. It boosts me to believe more in myself. I have realized that, indeed, there is power in numbers…From the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of my community Matarinao, thank you for fighting with us.” 
The Office of the President has acknowledged the 528,000 letters sent to them, and the Philippine government appears to have turned its attention towards the needs of Typhoon Yolanda survivors in Matarinao. You can follow Marinel’s updates on Instagram here. 
Nasu Abdulaziz, Nigeria 
 
The solidarity for Nasu Abdulaziz and his community has been huge. By the end of February 2020, Amnesty Nigeria had received over 20,000 solidarity messages for him and the Governor of Lagos state received over 400,000 letters and messages demanding justice for Nasu and his community. So far, the authorities have not taken steps to investigate the shooting of Nasu that occurred when bulldozers arrived and evicted 30,000 people from his community. However, there has been an ongoing dialogue between his community and the authorities towards a resettlement program.  
Amnesty Nigeria met with Nasu to handover thousands of cards and letters from Amnesty supporters around the world (pictured above). Nasu expressed his thanks to everyone who took part in Write for Rights: ”I am very happy to receive all these messages. It means that people care about me and what happened!”  
Ibrahim Ezz El-Din, Egypt 
 
We unfortunately do not have a recent update on Ibrahim Ezz El-Din, a human rights researcher who was forcibly disappeared following his arrest in Cairo in June 2019. Ibrahim’s whereabouts were unknown until November 2019, when he appeared before the Supreme State Security Prosecution. Ibrahim, who appeared weak and having lost much weight, told the prosecutor that he was tortured during his detention to extract information about his relationship to the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms and its work, and was kept in inhumane and degrading conditions of detention, at several security agencies locations. 
Your support has provided solidarity to Ibrahim’s family, his colleagues and the Egyptian human rights community at large. Ibrahim’s mother expressed her gratitude to everyone who has taken action on his case: “I would like to thank everyone who stood for Ibrahim until he reappeared, after his disappearance for [almost] 6 months. And I call on you to continue supporting him until his release… Ibrahim remains in detention for no reason.” 
In April 2020, Amnesty put out an Urgent Action for Ibrahim’s immediate release, as his mental and physical health was deteriorating, putting him at particular risk if exposed to COVID-19. We will continue to campaign until Ibrahim is free and reunited with his loved ones. 
Emil Ostrovko, Belarus 
 
As Write for Rights gathered steam in December, authorities in Belarus shaved two years off the eight-year prison term of Emil Ostrovko. He had been arrested in April 2018 while waiting at a bus stop on the outskirts of Minsk. Police officers beat the 17-year old and accused him of distributing illegal drugs. 
Emil’s health and spirits have suffered greatly, and he expressed how much he’s treasured the greetings from all over the world. “They have given me enormous strength and inspiration. This campaign made me believe in the importance of fighting for my rights. It showed me that my life mattered and that I am not forgotten. Many of my fellow prisoners are young people like me and their circumstances are like mine. They ask me to share solidarity cards with them and they keep them as symbols of hope and encouragement. Thank you so much!”   
Emil’s mother, Yula Ostrovko, added her own words of thanks: “This campaign has made a huge difference in Emil’s life and in the lives of many other children. They all excitedly waited for your letters and read them all together. I don’t have enough words to express my gratitude to Amnesty International and its supporters – just tears of joy. I didn’t expect that so many people in the world would support us in this terrible situation and I remain strong because of all of you and your solidarity.” 
Yiliyasijiang Reheman, China 
 
There has been no news on the whereabouts of Yiliyasijiang Reheman, the Uyghur who disappeared while studying in Egypt. But as in so many of these cases, our action makes a difference in the lives of the family members who have been enduring the long wait to reunite with their loved ones. Yiliyasijiang’s wife Mairinisha shared her reaction to the Write for Rights campaign for her husband: “I’m very grateful for everyone who supports me. I feel that I’m not alone.”  
Amnesty is continuing to campaign in support of Yiliyasijiang and to end the targeting of Uyghurs in China and beyond. You can take action here. 
José Adrián, Mexico 
 
José Adrián, a Mayan teenage boy with an undiagnosed disability that impacts his capacity to hear and communicate easily, was only 14 years old when police arbitrarily arrested and beat him near his home in Yucatan, Mexico in February 2016.  
Thanks to constant advocacy work, including through Write for Rights, José Adrián and his family are about to reach a written agreement with the Commission for Attention to Victims. It includes a scholarship to continue school and psychological treatment. José Adrián has also received an official letter to indicate that he now has no criminal record. “I thank the people who have supported me. You have changed my life, and I thank you all,” he said.

“The policy of repression of the government of Nicolás Maduro has led to hundreds of arbitrary detentions of those who dare to question it. These releases should not be seen as an act of benevolence, but a first step towards reparation for the injustices and arbitrary actions committed in a society submerged in a deep human rights crisis,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Among those who will benefit from this measure are the prisoner of conscience and union leader Rubén González, 61, detained since November 2019 in the La Pica prison in the state of Monagas, and the parliamentarians Gilber Caro and Renzo Prieto, arbitrarily detained in the headquarters of the Special Actions Force (FAES) of the Bolivarian National Police since December 2019 and March of this year respectively. 
There are also other cases on the list that Amnesty International has expressed its concern over in recent months, such as Maury Carrero, detained arbitrarily in April and subjected to periods of being held incommunicado by officials from the Directorate for Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM); and Nicmer Evans, detained in July by unidentified officials and charged with ‘incitement to hatred’ – seemingly for having published messages on social media expressing his disagreement with the government of Nicolás Maduro. Among the more than 100 people included in the pardon are people arbitrarily detained in the intelligence service headquarters, people who had already been released with measures restricting their freedom and people in exile with outstanding arrest warrants. 
“The release of the people under this measure must be carried out immediately, guaranteeing their human rights. The Venezuelan authorities must not prolong the deprivation of liberty of these people one more day,”  continued Guevara-Rosas. 
“The pardon issued by President Maduro must not in any way be considered as an acknowledgement of responsibility of those receiving it. It must serve as a turning point to stop the practice of arbitrary detentions and unfair trials, including the use of military courts, against those with differing opinions in Venezuela,” Erika Guevara-Rosas concluded. 
Despite the fact that the pardon has been granted to more than 100 people, there are still many cases of people arbitrarily detained who should also be released. Likewise, Amnesty International will continue to report on the situation of other people such as Leopoldo López, Villca Fernández, Rosmit Mantilla, Geraldine Chacón, Gregory Hinds, Luis Carlos Díaz and Juan Requesens, who have been released under conditions that severely limit their right to freedom.

Yesterday, after many years of campaigning by women’s rights and survivors’ groups, the government agreed to amend the Criminal Code to finally recognize in law that sex without consent is rape. 
“This is a historic victory, not just for the campaigners who have fought long and hard for this day, but for everyone in Denmark. A human rights-compliant consent law would position Denmark as an example for other countries in Europe that care about access to justice for rape survivors and true gender equality,” said Amnesty International’s Women’s Rights Researcher, Anna Błuś. 
“The new legislation must recognize the simple truth that sex without consent is rape and make absolutely clear that physical violence is not required for the crime to be considered rape. Even in long-term relationships and marriages, consent can never be assumed.” 
Yesterday, Danish Justice Minister, Nick Hækkerup, committed to “move away from a system where there had to be coercion and violence for this crime to be considered rape to a system of consent. It is rape if one does not agree on it.” 
This recognition is of vital importance. 
Changing outdated and dangerous rape laws is a major step towards ending pervasive stigma and endemic impunity for this crime. Law reform can also be a crucial starting point for changing behaviours and attitudes, but to do so it must be accompanied by concerted efforts to challenge widespread harmful myths and gender stereotypes. 
“Legislation reform has the potential to also influence mindset, so this commitment by the Danish government is a welcome step forward,” said Anna Błuś. 
“We now look forward to seeing the text of the law, and hearing how the authorities intend to challenge rape myths and negative gender stereotypes at all levels of society. This will require institutional and social change, as well as comprehensive sexuality and relationships education, including on sexual consent. We are confident that, led by survivors, Denmark can forge a new path which other countries in Europe will follow.”

BACKGROUND 
Shockingly, if the law is passed, Denmark will be only the tenth country in the European Economic Area to recognize that sex without consent is rape. Greece and Spain have recently announced that they will amend legislation to recognize this fact. 
Rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the 24,000 women found by a recent study to have experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017, just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions.

The report, Trampling humanity: Mass arrests, disappearances and torture since Iran’s 2019 November protests, documents the harrowing accounts of dozens of protesters, bystanders and others who were violently arrested, forcibly disappeared or held incommunicado, systemically denied access to their lawyers during interrogations, and repeatedly tortured to “confess”. They are among the 7,000 men, women and children arrested by the Iranian authorities within a matter of days during their brutal repression of the protests. 
Victims include children as young as 10 and injured protesters and bystanders arrested from hospitals while seeking medical care for gunshot wounds, as well as human rights defenders including minority rights activists, journalists, and individuals who attended ceremonies to commemorate those killed during the protests. Hundreds have since been sentenced to prison terms and flogging and several to the death penalty following grossly unfair trials which were presided over by biased judges behind closed doors, frequently lasted less than an hour, and systematically relied on torture-tainted “confessions”. 
“In the days following the mass protests, videos showing Iran’s security forces deliberately killing and injuring unarmed protesters and bystanders sent shockwaves around the world. Much less visible has been the catalogue of cruelty meted out to detainees and their families by Iranian officials away from the public eye,” said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Instead of investigating allegations of enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment and other crimes against detainees, Iranian prosecutors became complicit in the campaign of repression by bringing national security charges against hundreds of people solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, while judges doled out guilty verdicts on the basis of torture-tainted ‘confessions’. This litany of crimes and violations, committed with total impunity, has been accompanied by a wave of forced televised ‘confessions’ in state propaganda videos and grotesque statements from top officials who have praised intelligence and security forces as heroes for their role in the brutal crackdown.” 
Amnesty International has recorded the names and details of more than 500 protesters and others, including journalists and human rights defenders, who have been subjected to unfair criminal proceedings in connection with the protests. 
Prison terms meted out to those convicted have ranged from between one month and 10 years for vague or spurious national security charges such as “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”, “spreading propaganda against the system”, “disrupting public order” and “insulting the Supreme Leader”. Of these, at least three, Amirhossein Moradi, Mohammad Rajabi and Saeed Tamjidi, were sentenced to death for “enmity against God” (moharebeh) through acts of vandalism, and another, Hossein Reyhani, is awaiting trial on a charge carrying the death penalty. 
More than a dozen known to Amnesty International have received flogging sentences, in addition to prison terms, and at least two have had their flogging sentences implemented. 
Amnesty International is urging member states of the UN Human Rights Council and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to address the prolonged, systematic impunity for gross violations of human rights in Iran, including by supporting the establishment of a UN-led inquiry with a view to ensuring accountability and guarantees of non-repetition. 
The organization is also urging all UN member states to forcefully call on the Iranian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release anyone who continues to be imprisoned solely for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly in connection with the November 2019 protests; quash all convictions resulting from unfair trials, including those that relied on statements obtained through torture or other ill-treatment; and hold those responsible to account. 
Torture epidemic 
Amnesty International’s research found that there was widespread use of torture and other ill-treatment by police, intelligence and security agents and prison officials against men, women and children, both during arrest and later in detention. 
Prosecution and judicial authorities failed in their legal obligations to conduct independent and impartial inspections of detention facilities, including those run by security and intelligence bodies, and to ensure that legal provisions banning the use of secret detention and torture and other ill-treatment against detainees are respected. 
Torture was used to punish, intimidate and humiliate detainees. It was also routinely used to elicit “confessions” and incriminating statements, not just about their involvement in the protests, but also about their alleged associations with opposition groups, human rights defenders, media outside Iran, as well as with foreign governments. 
The organization’s research found that victims were frequently hooded or blindfolded; punched, kicked and flogged; beaten with sticks, rubber hosepipes, knives, batons and cables; suspended or forced into holding painful stress positions for prolonged periods; deprived of sufficient food and potable water; placed in prolonged solitary confinement, sometimes for weeks or even months; and denied medical care for injuries sustained during the protests or as a result of torture. 
Other documented methods of torture included stripping detainees and spraying them with cold water, and subjecting detainees to extreme temperatures and/or bombardment of light or sound; forcible extraction of the nails from fingers or toes; pepper spraying; forced administration of chemical substances; using electric shocks; waterboarding; and mock executions. 
Information received by Amnesty International from primary sources also reveals that interrogators and prison officials perpetrated sexual violence against male detainees, including through stripping and forced nakedness, sexual verbal abuse, pepper spraying the genital area, and administering electric shocks to the testicles. 
One victim from Khorasan Razavi province who was subjected to waterboarding told Amnesty International: “They [my interrogators] would drench a towel in water and place it over my face. Then they would pour water slowly over the towel, which made me feel like I was suffocating… They would stop… until I started to feel better and then they would start torturing me this way again. They also punched, kicked and flogged me on the soles of my feet with a cable.”  
One man who was subjected to electric shocks recounted: “The electric shocks were the worst form of torture… It felt like my entire body was being pierced with millions of needles. If I refused to answer their questions, they would raise the voltage levels and give me stronger electric shocks. I would shake violently and there would be a strong burning sensation coursing through my whole body…. The torture has had lasting effects on my mental and physical health. To this day, I still can’t sleep at night.” 
A victim from Tehran province who was suspended from his hands and feet from a pole in a painful method his interrogators referred to as “chicken kebab” told the organization: 
“The pain was excruciating. There was so much pressure and pain in my body that I would urinate on myself… My family know that I was tortured, but they don’t know how I was tortured. I feel choked with tears because there is no one here I can speak to.” 
In all cases documented by Amnesty International, victims reported various forms of psychological torture to give forced “confessions”, including the use of degrading verbal insults and profanities; the intimidation and harassment of their family members; threats to arrest, torture, kill or otherwise harm their family members, including elderly parents or spouses; and threats to rape detainees or their female family members. 
Enforced disappearances  
Amnesty International’s research shows that many detainees were subjected to enforced disappearance for weeks or even months while held in undisclosed locations run by the security and intelligence bodies including the ministry of intelligence or the Revolutionary Guards. Other detainees were held in overcrowded prisons or police stations, military barracks, sports venues and schools. 
Distressed relatives told the organization that they visited hospitals, morgues, police stations, prosecution offices, courts, prisons and other known detention centres to enquire about the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones, but the authorities refused to provide them with information and threatened them with arrest if they kept seeking information or publicly spoke out about them. 
In one case documented by Amnesty International, the authorities arrested a family member of two people who were forcibly disappeared for enquiring about their fate and whereabouts. 
Amnesty International is aware of three ongoing cases of enforced disappearance, where the authorities continue to conceal their fate and whereabouts from their families. They include brothers Mehdi Roodbarian and Mostafa Roodbarian from Mahshahr, Khuzestan province. 
Methodology 
The organization’s research involved in-depth interviews with 60 victims of arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment or their relatives or close acquaintances; two protesters who were in hiding; and 14 other informed individuals; information received through written messages from several hundred others inside the country and analysis of video footage, official statements and court documents.

Bernardo Caal Xol is a Maya Q’eqchi’ teacher and trade unionist who is in jail, although he has committed no crime. 
Authorities prosecuted Caal Xol with trumped up charges as he was successfully leading a peaceful struggle by communities seeking to protect the Cahabón River from big dam projects that violate indigenous rights, affect fish stocks and limit Indigenous communities’ access to water. Caal Xol was convicted without evidence. Since then, on six separate occasions, authorities have cancelled scheduled court hearings for an appeal of the wrongful conviction.

I am not a thief. On the contrary, they are stealing natural resources. They are stealing the river.” 
 
In July, Amnesty declared Caal Xol a prisoner of conscience.  
It is all the more urgent to call for his release because of the dangerous threat of COVID-19 contagion in jail. 
 
Thousands of signatures from Canada, along with those from other countries, will help convince Guatemala’s Attorney General to review the conviction of Bernardo Caal Xol and release him from wrongful imprisonment. 
Please sign our action here >> 
Letters are an important way to add weight to e-action calls for the release of Bernardo Caal Xol. Write a short, polite, personalized message to Guatemala’s Attorney General:

Last year, millions of people marched in climate strikes organized by youth around the world, demanding urgent action to stop the climate crisis. 
The next global climate strike will take place virtually on Friday, Sept 25th and we hope you will get involved! 
Here are five ways to participate in the climate strikes: 
1. Youth climate justice webinar – Join our climate justice webinar on Tuesday September 22nd. More information, bios of the amazing youth climate activists who are the panelists for the event, and the registration link are all here! 
2. Video project – Whether you’re planting a garden, saving energy at home, avoiding plastic, creating a sharing economy, or making sustainable investments, each of us has the power to take action in the global effort to mitigate climate change. So, tell us, what are you doing right now for climate change? We invite you to share your story in a very brief video (selfie or safely physically distanced from your videographer) of what you’re doing right now for climate change. These videos will be woven together in a collage recording for the Climate Strike. See here for more information. 
3. Let us quote you! – Send us a sentence about why you care about climate justice, and we will share as many as possible via social media. Or you can post it to your own social media channels using the hashtag #climatestrike and tagging @AmnestyNow on Twitter or @amnestycanada on Instagram.  
4. Poster project – Post a picture of your favourite nature spot using the hashtag #climatestrike. And/or make a creative poster for the climate strike and share that as well. Remember to use the hashtag #climatestrike and tag Amnesty Canada so that we can repost it. You could also tag your local media, your MP and MPP to let them know that you are striking for the climate. See here for more information. 
5. Support youth climate strikers – Visit https://fridaysforfuture.ca/ for a map of climate strike events being organized by youth across Canada. 
Governments have understandably been focused on COVID-19 lately, but the pandemic has not washed the climate emergency away. This is a vitally important moment because countries are required to set their 2030 climate targets by the end of this year (and climate scientists have raised the alarm that the world must reduce global emissions by 45% by 2030 to avoid a climate catastrophe). This is the moment to shape the future we want! Governments must continue to make maximum efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Amnesty Canada will be launching a petition to the Canadian government in early September. For more information and updates, please visit www.amnesty.ca/climate 
If you want to take further action to stop the climate crisis and really roll up your sleeves, we encourage you to join Amnesty Canada’s Climate Justice and Corporate Accountability Specialized Team. To join, contact Elena at edumitru@amnesty.ca.

Activists against anti-Black racism in the United States and Canada have raised troubling questions about the possible role of Luis Kutner — said to have had leadership roles in the early years of Amnesty International and/or Amnesty International USA — in events that led to 21-year-old Black Panther leader Fred Hampton being shot and killed in December 1969 by the FBI and local police in Chicago.  FBI documents, declassified in 2018, reveal information Kutner provided to the FBI prior to the raid that resulted in Fred Hampton’s murder at the hands of police.  
Amnesty International has carried out a detailed review of its archives for the period in question. The recent statement released by Amnesty International USA clarifies that Luis Kutner was not a co-founder of Amnesty International, as has been frequently suggested publicly. He did for a short period of time serve as a member of an advisory committee within Amnesty International USA, but was not responsible for or involved in operations, governance or decision-making.  Amnesty International has seen nothing that would suggest that Luis Kutner’s role in the events that led to the killing of Fred Hampton was in any way connected to his advisory role with Amnesty International USA. There is nothing to indicate that Amnesty International had any knowledge or suspicions that Kutner was collaborating with or providing information of this nature to the FBI.    
The record is clear that the FBI committed human rights violations in operations against the Black Panther Party.  In 1981 Amnesty International released a global report, Proposal for a commission of inquiry into the effect of domestic intelligence activities on criminal trials in the United States. The report lays out Amnesty International’s serious concerns with respect to human rights violations committed by COINTELPRO (an FBI covert intelligence program) in operations targeting both the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement.  Amnesty International called for a Commission of Inquiry to be established, having concluded that, “COINTELPRO involved abuses of the criminal justice system, … COINTELPRO involve[d] specific violations of law, and the law and the constitution were ‘not given a thought’ under the FBI’s policies.” Amnesty International has also campaigned on behalf of unjustly imprisoned former Black Panther Party members, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Albert Woodfox.  
 Critically, more than 50 years after his death, there has never been full justice and accountability for Fred Hampton’s killing. That is of concern to Amnesty International especially as Black people, including activists and organizers, continue to be unfairly surveilled, targeted, and killed with impunity by police in North America. A coroner’s inquest concluded that the police actions against Fred Hampton were justified, but this was based only on police and government witnesses and evidence.  A subsequent federal grand jury found the police raid to have been “ill-conceived” but went no further.  A lengthy civil trial that spanned twelve years and included an appeal to the United States Supreme Court eventually resulted in out of court settlements, including with Fred Hampton’s family, in 1982.   
It speaks to a history of impunity and racism that has been repeated time and time again in Canada as well when the justice system has been tasked with investigating police killings of Black and Indigenous people, and is again in the news with the announcement that Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit will not be pursuing charges against police in connection with the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto on May 27, 2020.  
This is not just of historical note. Fred Hampton’s murder at the hands of the FBI and Chicago-area police more than five decades ago underscores why it is so vital to insist that there be full justice and accountability as police killings of Black individuals continue at an alarming rate across the United States today. This must end. And it serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need to tackle the systemic racism in Canada, including within police and justice systems, that harms Black and Indigenous communities.  
Amnesty International has not historically understood its role in both failing to address and perpetuating systemic anti-Black racism. While the organization may not have had anything to do with Fred Hampton’s death, there are still issues of concern about systemic racism internally within the organization and externally with respect to Amnesty’s human rights work that must lead to fundamental change. We commit to supporting and empowering Black communities in appropriate ways and unequivocally affirm as an organization that Black lives matter.

It violates section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which protects the right to life, liberty and security of the person.  
Under the STCA, refugee claimants must claim protection in the first country in which they arrive in most cases.  The agreement assumes the US is a ‘safe’ country which upholds international human rights and the Refugee Convention.   
However, Justice Ann Marie McDonald found that refugee claimants returned under the STCA often face arbitrary immigration detention in conditions that “shock the conscience.” She recalled the case of Ms. Mustefa, a refugee claimant who was turned away by Canada under the STCA, only to be locked in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell and given meals that she could not eat due to her religious beliefs. When Canadian officials return claimants to such conditions, they are complicit in that mistreatment.  
In spite of these clear human rights violations, the government has launched an appeal.  It’s crucial to let Members of Parliament and Minister Marco Mendicino know that it is unacceptable for any more refugee claimants to be returned under the STCA, given the clear risks of human rights violations.  
Canada must act immediately to distance its refugee policy from the US and end the Safe Third Country agreement so that refugees who turn to Canada for protection are able to do so. It must drop the appeal of the Federal Court decision.

Magai removed from death row in South Sudan,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/write-for-rights-victory-magai-removed-from-death-row-in-south-sudan/,“Thank you so much. I have no words. You have no idea how my heart is filled with happiness.” – Magai Matiop Ngong  We campaign. We write. We advocate. And news like this is what we work for: 18-year-old Magai Matiop Ngong has been removed from South Sudan’s death row! ...,"We campaign. We write. We advocate. And news like this is what we work for: 18-year-old Magai Matiop Ngong has been removed from South Sudan’s death row!  
Before his life changed forever, Magai was a 15-year-old high school student. He loved running and singing, and had ambitions to be the president of South Sudan so that he could help people when he grew up.   
But his dreams came to a sudden end in 2017 when he was convicted of murder. Magai’s cousin had argued with a neighbour. When the neighbour got a gun, Magai did too. Magai fired warning shots into the ground, but one of the shots ricocheted and injured Magai’s cousin who later died. Magai faced trial without a lawyer and told the judge that he was only 15 and tried to explain that the killing was an accident. But the judge sentenced him to death by hanging. “The feeling is not good at all,” said Magai. “To be informed that you are going to die, I am not happy for that…”  
During Amnesty’s Write for Rights 2019, human rights supporters from around the world sent 765,000 messages to President Salva Kiir, urging him to commute the sentence. The appeals reminded him that, according to South Sudanese and international law, sentencing a child to death is illegal. 
Amnesty International welcomed the Court of Appeals’ decision on July 14th to quash Magai’s death sentence. Magai expressed his thanks to the thousands of Amnesty activists who supported him: “To Amnesty, tell them that I am so happy and grateful for what they have done to me and my family… I’m so blissful and blessed to have them as a support for my life and freedom.”  
Within South Sudan, the campaign to save Magai’s life contributed to wider discussion about the government’s use of the death penalty, especially against children. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, as it violates the fundamental human rights to life, to security of person and to freedom from cruel, degrading treatment. May the decision in Magai’s case pave the way toward abolition of the death penalty in South Sudan.   
Thank you truly to everyone who took action in solidarity with Magai!

“The Belarusian authorities have to date refused to engage in a dialogue with the protesters, nor, apparently, have they taken steps to investigate the massive human rights violations committed by the police during the first few days of the post-election protests,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.   
“According to our information not a single criminal case has been opened against police who brutally tortured hundreds of peaceful protesters. Yet, dozens of criminal cases have been launched against these protesters, often without any credible evidence of wrongdoing. Belarusians are peacefully demanding accountability to prevent this dangerous culture of impunity.  
“Unlike those who govern them, Belarusians have shown exceptional restraint and held singularly peaceful rallies – so much so that tens of thousands of demonstrators who marched across the capital Minsk and other cities cleared the streets of rubbish, and took off their shoes when climbing on benches.”  
Background  
On 31 August, Belarusians opposing the 26-year rule of President Alyaksandr Lukashenka held one the biggest protest rallies in the country’s modern history, attended in Minsk and in other cities by at least 100,000 demanding the president’s resignation and investigation of human rights violations.  
In the lead-up to 31 August at least 50 journalists were detained, and several had their accreditation revoked or were deported from Belarus. On 31 August itself, at least 140 peaceful protesters were detained. Several senior members of the opposition Coordination Council have been arrested on dubious criminal charges.  
During the first three days of post-electoral protests, on 9-12 August, the authorities responded with widespread arrests, harassment and intimidation, using rubber bullets, stunt grenades, tear gas and water cannons against protesters. Over 6,700 people were detained and hundreds have delivered testimony of widespread torture and other ill-treatment of detainees in police stations and detention facilities.

Today, the International Day of the Disappeared, marks 1,500 days since Burundi journalist Jean Bigirimana went missing, allegedly after being arrested by the country’s National Intelligence Service. Jean has not been seen or heard from since 22 July 2016, and his wife Godeberthe Hakizimana and two young sons are still waiting for answers. 
“More than four years after Jean Bigirimana’s enforced disappearance, the Burundian government’s failure to account for him is an affront to the principles of truth, justice and accountability,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The agony of Jean Bigirimana’s family is unimaginable. President Ndayishimiye’s government must end the practice of enforced disappearances immediately, and fully investigate and, where there is sufficient evidence of criminal responsibility, prosecute perpetrators of enforced disappearances. Families have the right to know the truth about the fate of their loved ones.” 
Until his disappearance, Jean Bigirimana, who had studied law at university, pursued his passion for journalism at the Iwacu Press Group, one of Burundi’s last remaining independent media organizations. 
He was among a few journalists who defied the intimidation and harassment that forced many media workers to flee Burundi in the aftermath of the failed coup of 13 May 2015. The coup attempt followed late President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to run for a controversial third term in office. 
Jean Bigirimana was last seen on 22 July 2016 in Bugarama, Muramvya province, some 45km from the capital Bujumbura. Witnesses reported that he was taken by people believed to be members of Burundi’s National Intelligence Service (Service National de Renseignement – SNR). On that day, one of Jean’s colleagues at Iwacu newspaper received an anonymous call alerting him to the arrest. 
Jean Bigirimana’s colleagues at Iwacu immediately started searching for him. When they received information about a sighting of two bodies, they scoured the area with the National Independent Human Rights Commission (CNIDH) and the police. Two bodies were discovered in an advanced state of decomposition, but Godeberthe Hakizimana was able to confirm that neither was her husband’s. The bodies were never identified. 
Godeberthe Hakizimana’s efforts to find her husband have been met with hostility; in June 2017, she found a note with death threats in front of her home. Although she reported the matter to the police, there was never any follow-up. Like so many other families of people who have disappeared, Jean Bigirimana’s wife and children have suffered both material consequences and emotional distress while they maintain their hope for answers. 
“The Burundian government should ratify and implement the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance as a first step towards rebuilding trust with the families of victims and their wider communities,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“We will continue to fight for truth along with Jean Bigirimana’s family, until they get the answers they deserve.” 
The UN Commission of Inquiry on Burundi in its September 2019 report documented “numerous disappearances”, expressing “deep concern” about the frequency of such disappearances.

We will be advocating for the continued need to connect survivors who were taken with their families and raising awareness about the ongoing human rights fight, the class action lawsuits and the settlement. 
From the late 1950’s to the 1980’s, many children were adopted not just out of their Indigenous community, or out of province, but some were sent as far away as Germany, Britain, and Australia. The Provincial, Territorial and Canadian governments gravely violated the rights of these families: to belong to their Indigenous nation, to learn their culture and language, to not be subjected to assimilation, and to not be subjected to genocide. 
 
Colleen Hele-Cardinal, cofounder of the Sixties Scoop Network writes, 
“I had known that eventually we would receive a settlement and had anticipated that I would be happy and maybe even celebrate the win. 
Nothing prepared me for the grief that manifested at a cellular level; my body remembering and reliving decades of physical and emotional pain. It was a reminder of what we, as Sixties Scoop survivors, collectively lost – large extended families, our communities, our languages, ceremonies and the knowledge that comes from ancestors who hunted, fished and thrived since time immemorial on their traditional lands. Without forced adoption, I would have grown up with my family and had the support and safety that comes from being part of a family and community experiencing the same struggle to fit into a society that hated the colour of my skin. I would still endure the ignorance and violence that is the fabric of Canadian culture – racism – but I would have been in my community. 
That Saturday morning, I woke up to a slew of messages from other survivors and checked my bank account, anticipating the funds that would be deposited. There it was — a lump rose from my stomach to my throat. I could not name this feeling at first and then the tentacles of anger and grief crept into my heart, coursed through my veins with every single beat. All-day I felt disconnected and weepy.”

Health workers on the frontline are the first to know if government policy is not working, and authorities who silence them cannot seriously claim to be prioritising public health.”Sanhita Ambast, Amnesty International’s Researcher and Advisor on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic in March 2020, health and essential workers have played an extraordinary role in the response to it. Across the world, they have put their health and well-being at risk, working in very difficult circumstances and often with very little support, to ensure that we are able to access the essential services we need, including health care, food and other nutritional supplies, and emergency services. 
Despite this, states have repeatedly failed to protect them and their human rights. Health and essential workers across the world have faced enormous challenges in doing their jobs. They have been left exposed, silenced, and attacked. 
Exposed: Thiusands of health workers across the globe are known to have lost their lives due to COVID-19  during the pandemic, and several others have been working in unsafe environments with increased exposure to the disease due to shortages in personal protective equipment(PPE). 
Silenced: Health and essential workers have faced reprisals from the authorities and their employers simply for speaking out about safety concerns at their workplace. 
Attacked: Health and essential workers have experienced discrimination, violence, and stigma from members of the public, just for doing their job. 
New analysis by Amnesty International has found that at least 7,000 health workers have died around the world after contracting COVID-19. At least 1,320 health workers are confirmed to have died in Mexico alone, the highest known figure for any country. 
 
We are currently focusing on three cases around the world: 
Malaysia: On 2 June 2020, Malaysian police dispersed a peaceful picket against a hospital cleaning services company. Picketers’ complaints included allegations of unfair treatment of union members and insufficient PPE for cleaners. Five activists were arrested, remanded overnight, and charged for “unauthorised gathering”, violating their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
Add your name to the call for the charges to be dropped 
Russia: Doctor Tatyana Revva, from the intensive care unit in Kalach-on-Don and a whistle-blower, is facing formal reprimand and potential dismissal after she repeatedly complained to the hospital’s management about the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical workers, as well as other work-related issues. She might also face criminal prosecution for libel following the complaint her hospital manager had filed with the police.   
Add your name to the call to stop harassment of health care workers 
Egypt: At least nine health care workers have been arrested for raising safety concerns and criticizing the government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis. They are being detained under vague charges of “spreading false news” and “terrorism”. The Egyptian authorities have subjected health care workers who speak out to arbitrarily detentions, threats, harassment, and punitive administrative measures. 
Add your name to the call for the immediate release of all health workers detained solely for expressing their views 
 
Here are some suggested general messages. Add links to action (above) and report (see further below). 
Governments must be held accountable for failing to protect health and essential workers from COVID-19 #ExposedSilencedAttacked 
Health workers can help governments improve their response to the pandemic and keep everyone safe. But they can’t do this if they are in prison or silenced. #ExposedSilencedAttacked 
Health workers faced retaliation in every region after raising safety concerns in the context of the COVID-19 response. #ExposedSilencedAttacked 
Around the world, health and essential workers organized strikes, protests or threatened to strike due to their working conditions #ExposedSilencedAttacked 
#ExposedSilencedAttackedfor doing their job. If health workers and essential workers are not safe, neither are we. Protect essential workers. Protect health workers. Protect everyone.

But it didn’t take long for my family to realize that this was simply untrue. Hard work rarely ever led to results and whenever it did, my parents were accused of “stealing jobs”. In 2008 my family moved from the US to Canada. It is strange knowing that no matter where you seemed to go, these same experiences follow you around. 
I had always known where I stood when it came to “controversial issues” (still can’t believe that human rights are controversial). It did not feel though that I had the resources or knowledge to object the injustices that were around me, let alone the world. 
One of my friends had been volunteering for a while with Amnesty International when she invited me to their first Youth Café in Toronto. I was reluctant to go, assuming that I would be practically alone. As I settled in, it was anything but true. Around me I found peers excited and determined to not only learn about injustices but also to fight against them. It was exhilarating seeing and hearing other young people feeling as strongly as I do. Later that night I had expressed my interest in joining the organization and honestly, it was one of the major points in my life.  
I became a National Organizer with Amnesty International Canada. As a National Organizer, I was able to help plan and organized events that shed light on serious human rights issues. Most recently I had been a part of a team of around 4-5 people, and together we facilitated a public event shedding light on false stereotyping surrounding those who seek refuge. That night, we used various forms of art, words and actions to raise awareness and engage young people into taking action. 
 
One of my favourite things as an organizer is how versatile the position is. I remember when I first joined, I was afraid to voice my opinions, I wasn’t used to it. So I opted to take the notes for the meetings. As I began feeling more comfortable, I took on planning roles, sometimes proposing my own initiatives. It sparked the leadership in me, a skill that I wasn’t even aware I possessed. 
Through Amnesty, I also found my interest in social media, and in how we can utilize it to raise awareness about issues and to engage people to take action. The support I always felt pushed me to try things I may have not otherwise tried. Through Amnesty I found an outlet to express myself and to be a part of the change I want to see in the world.

School and daycare closures...,"The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating existing gender inequalities as public health guidelines and lockdown measures lead to higher rates of gender-based violence and less access to sexual and reproductive information and health services including gender-affirming care. School and daycare closures and restrictions have substantially added to the unpaid care work disproportionately carried out by women. In a few short months, we have gone back to 1980s levels of women’s labour force participation, with fears the situation will become ever more dire as the pandemic wears on. 
Not all women, girls, and gender diverse people are experiencing the pandemic in the same way. Women, girls, and gender diverse people who are Black, Indigenous, and other people of colour; people with disabilities, LBTI folks, sex workers, refugees and migrants, and people living in poverty already faced heighted risks of violence, discrimination, and other human rights violations, and the pandemic has further heightened these risks. 
We’ve already gone in a gender equality time machine back to the 1980s in just a few short months – let’s not keep sliding backwards at breakneck speed to the 1950s! It’s time to push back, because a pandemic is no excuse to violate gender rights! 
The pandemic is forcing parents—disproportionately mothers—to take on more unpaid care work. Women are losing their jobs and leaving work more than men, often to focus on unpaid care work, placing women at greater risk of living in poverty, which then heightens the risk of experiencing other rights violations. Marginalized women have been unable to access quality, affordable, inclusive childcare for a long time. The pandemic has simply laid bare the problems that already existed in how childcare operates in Canada. 
Gender discrimination is at the root of why women are disproportionately impacted by a lack childcare in Canada, and advocating for a national childcare plan for Canada is absolutely a women’s rights issue. Advocating for a pandemic recovery plan rooted in gender justice means advocating for  quality, affordable, available, and inclusive childcare for children aged 0-12!

Since the Hirak protest movement, which is calling for radical political change in Algeria, started in February 2019, at least eight journalists have been imprisoned over their reporting or social media posts, often after being convicted on bogus charges such as “harming Algeria’s territorial integrity”, “insulting the president of the republic” or “inciting a gathering”. Several news websites well known for their critical stance towards the government are facing disruption to their accessibility via Algerian networks. 
“The Algerian authorities are willing to do whatever it takes to silence criticism. Journalists have recently been imprisoned for sharing videos, criticizing the president, and expressing support for protest movements,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Amnesty International is calling on the authorities to cease the systematic judicial harassment of journalists and to respect the right to information by lifting the blockade on news websites.” 
Judicial harassment of journalists 
On 24 August, a first-instance court in the city of Constantine sentenced journalist and activist Abdelkrim Zeghileche to two years in prison over two of his Facebook posts. Zeghileche is the director of the independent radio station Radio Sarbacane. According to one of his lawyers, the first post described Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as “a fraud who was brought in by the military” and led to Zeghileche being charged with “insulting the president of the republic”. 
In a second Facebook post, published on the page of the political initiative Constantine – Perspectives Algériennes, Zeghileche called for the creation of political parties, which led to his conviction on the charge of “harming the integrity of the national territory”. Since his arrest on 23 June, Zeghileche has been detained in Koudiat prison in Constantine. 
In another high-profile case, on 10 August, Sidi M’hamed first instance court in Algiers sentenced prominent journalist Khaled Drareni to three years in prison over his coverage of the Hirak protest movement, as well as his appearances in foreign media. Drareni was charged with “harming the integrity of the national territory” and “incitement to unarmed gatherings”. Drareni is the founder of the Casbah Tribune website and the Algeria correspondent for TV5 Monde, a French TV network. He was convicted along with activists Samir Benlarbi and Slimane Hamitouche, who were each sentenced to a two-year suspended prison sentence. 
Drareni, Benlarbi and Hamitouche filed appeals against their convictions and a trial to hear these is due to begin on 8 September. 
On 4 August, journalist Mustapha Bendjama, editor-in-chief of Le Provincial, a regional newspaper, was interrogated in the eastern city of Annaba for around 90 minutes for a post he shared on his Facebook page demanding the release of a detained Hirak activist. Le Provincial had previously published articles and commentary in support of the movement’s demands. According to Bendjama, he has been interrogated at least 20 times in relation to his coverage of Hirak protests and is facing three separate legal cases over his Facebook posts. 
According to the National Committee for the Liberation of Detainees (CNLD), which monitors the trials of Hirak activists, on 17 June, Ali Djamel Toubal, a correspondent for the Ennahar newspaper based in the western city of Mascara, was sentenced to two years in prison before he was provisionally released on 18 August. On the day of his arrest, Toubal shared a video on Facebook in which a gynaecologist talked about the deteriorating working conditions for doctors in the city of Ain Amenas. 
Between 12 June and 8 July, Merzoug Touati, a journalist with news website L’Avant-Garde Algérie, was detained in the eastern city of Béjaïa while heading to cover a protest in support of detained Hirak activists. The first instance court in Béjaïa fined Touati 100,000 Algerian dinars (around US$776) for “offending public officials”. 
“All these journalists are being punished for carrying out their legitimate work. Instead of bullying journalists, the authorities in Algeria must ensure that all journalists in the country are able to carry out their work free from intimidation, harassment and threat of arrest,” said Amna Guellali. 
According to the CNLD, as of 25 August, at least 42 individuals are detained in connection with their participation online and offline to Hirak protests. 
Disruption of media outlets 
In addition to the harassment of journalists, several news websites have been made inaccessible in Algeria, with the authorities admitting that they have blocked at least two of them. On 15 April, Minister of Communication Ammar Belhimer, admitted that the authorities and without prior notification, have blocked two online independent media, Maghreb Emergent and RadioMPost, pending “further legal proceedings” against its director, Ihsane El Kadi, for “defamation and insult” against president Abdelmadjid Tebboune. The two media outlets remain blocked and inaccessible in Algeria. 
Other several news websites well known for their critical stance towards the government are facing disruption to their accessibility via Algerian networks. For example, Tout sur l’Algerie (TSA) and Interlignes have been mostly inaccessible since 2019. 
Since 23 August, online news website L’Avant-Garde Algérie has been inaccessible since 23 August 2020. 
Amnesty International ran a technical test on 26 August 2020. It found that, while it was able to access all three websites either by connecting to them from outside Algeria or using a virtual private network (VPN) inside the country, it could not do so when using the state telecommunications operator, Algérie Télécom, from within Algeria.

Ali al-Nimr,...","In an announcement published today on the Twitter account of Saudi Arabia’s Human Rights Commission, the country’s public prosecutor has ordered a review into the death sentences of three young men who were minors at the time of arrest and have been at imminent risk of execution. Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoun, three young Shi’a activists, were all arrested as children in 2012 and charged with offences relating to their participation in anti-government protests in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. 
Responding to the news, Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director, said: 
“The announcement to review the death sentences against these three young men is a significant and long overdue step towards justice. We call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to ensure that any retrial that follows is conducted in a fair, transparent and open manner with access to legal representation. The authorities must also ensure that the ‘confessions’ extracted from them through torture are not used in proceedings against them. 
“Crucially, the young men should not be subjected again to a deeply flawed trial before the Specialized Criminal Court, which was established to try individuals accused of terror-related crimes. Instead, the authorities must ensure that any retrial is conducted in a regular court. 
“The country’s use of the death penalty for a range of crimes continues, reaching an appalling high number of executions last year with 184 individuals put to death. The announcement to review the death sentences of the young men should not be used as an attempt to whitewash the country’s image before the international community and ahead of its hosting of the G20 Summit in Riyadh in November. 
“We call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to establish an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty completely.” 
Background 
According to information received by Amnesty International, the families of the detainees have found out about the review of the death sentences of their loved ones through the news and had not been officially notified by the authorities. 
At the time of their arrests, Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoun were aged 17, 16 and 17 respectively. Before they turned 18, all were held at a centre for juvenile rehabilitation, an indication that the authorities recognized them as juveniles at the time. 
On 27 May 2014 the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh sentenced Ali al-Nimr to death for a range of offences including taking part in anti-government protests, attacking security forces, possessing a machine-gun and carrying out an armed robbery. Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon were also sentenced to death by the same court in October 2014 on a list of similar charges. In all three cases the court appears to have based its decision on “confessions” the young men say were extracted through torture and other ill-treatment. 
Ali al-Nimr has said that during interrogations by officials in the Ministry of Interior’s General Directorate of Investigations (GDI or al-Mabahith) prison, he was beaten, kicked and otherwise ill-treated by four officers who forced him to sign statements that he was not allowed to read and was misled into believing were release orders. Instead of ordering an immediate investigation into Ali al-Nimr’s allegations, the judge claimed that he asked the Ministry of Interior to look into the allegations of torture against its own security officers. No investigation was known to have been carried out, and the judge meanwhile proceeded to convict and sentence Ali al-Nimr to death relying entirely on the “confession”. 
In April, Amnesty International obtained information about a Royal Decree announcing the end of the use of the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime in discretionary cases not involving the counter-terror law. The announcement follows the issuing in 2018 of the Law on Juveniles, which prevented judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those under 15 years old. It did not stop them from using the death penalty in cases of those who are convicted of hadd crimes (those with fixed and severe punishments under Shari’a) or crimes punishable by qisas (retaliation), a category of crimes under Shari’a in which murder and bodily harm are punishable by the same harm, such as the death penalty for murder and infliction of the same injury for bodily harm. The law therefore fell short of Saudi Arabia’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The announcement, which was a step forward from the Law on Juveniles, should still be followed by clear implementing regulations which do not exclude any minors from the reform. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to execute the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The protests come after local police shot and severely injured Jacob Blake as he tried to get into his car.  
“Once more, we are witnessing why it is crucial for the United States to protect the rights of protestors who are exercising their right to hold peaceful public assemblies and to end gun violence. Simply put, it is the duty of law enforcement officers to protect those who’ve gathered to protest. While Wisconsin is an open carry state, law enforcement officers should ensure that armed private individuals are not endangering public safety or targeting peaceful protestors.  
“Law enforcement officers in Wisconsin and all over the U.S. have expressed concern over open carry laws in the past, as these policies escalate violence and endanger police and the public. The only requirement to openly carry a loaded firearm in Wisconsin is that the individual be 18 years old—no permit is needed. Two people are dead and one injured because an armed private individual—who did not even need a permit to carry his loaded gun—decided to target them. Open carry laws, especially where no permit is required to carry, endanger the public and should be repealed. The U.S. is failing to protect people’s right to live and to protest safely. 
“With the Black Lives Matter movement growing into the largest social justice movement in the country’s history, it is more important than ever for law enforcement officers to dedicate themselves to ensuring that everyone can have their voices heard without losing their lives or being harmed.”  
Last month, AIUSA released a report in an effort to ensure that local, state and federal law enforcement agencies comply with recommended best practices for policing protests.

The letter also calls for the Council to establish an independent investigation into ongoing human rights violations.  
 “The 2020 electoral campaign has been marked by an unprecedented level of protest activity, and an equally unprecedented crackdown on human rights by the authorities. Police have used excessive force including stun grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons against peaceful demonstrators, subjected them to beatings and torture in incommunicado detention. Likewise, several protesters have been killed. The authorities have shown they won’t hesitate to use violence against their own citizens, and that they intend to obstruct a local investigation into these law enforcement abuses,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  
“We are concerned that if the authorities’ actions go unchallenged, more blood will be spilled on the streets of Belarus. The UN Human Rights Council should mandate an international investigation into human rights violations and crimes under international law committed in the lead-up to, during and after the presidential election, with a view to swiftly deterring further serious violations.”  
The open letter has been co-signed by 16 organizations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH).  
Background  
In the three days after the 9 August presidential election the authorities confirmed the arrest of at least 6,700 protesters. According to Viasna Human Rights Center, at least 450 of the detainees reported being tortured, including through severe beatings, or otherwise ill-treated, forced to perform humiliating acts and threatened with rape and other forms of violence, while held in incommunicado detention for up to 10 days. 
Since 12 August, the authorities have taken steps to de-escalate the situation, refraining from mass arrests and releasing all those detained. However, the threats against peaceful protesters recently made by President Alyaksandr Lukashenka and his subordinates together with the recent deployment of the armed forces in the country’s capital Minsk and elsewhere, signal a possible new spiral of violence and accompanying human rights violations.

Patricia has been targeted by death threats and attacks because of her important work. So have other Amazonian women defenders. The goal is to intimidate them into abandoning their opposition to destructive oil, mining and logging projects given a green light by authorities who prioritize corporate interests at the cost of human rights and the environment. 
But the women refuse to be stopped. There is simply too much at stake for their communities and future generations. So Patricia and more than 100 women came together in a coalition of other courageous women defenders known as Mujeres Amazónicas, Spanish for Amazonian Women.  
“Women are by definition more at risk than men,” explains Patricia Gualinga. “Women can be threatened sexually, physically… We women unite because we have to; because we know that together we have more power and protection on multiple levels. By coming together we protect ourselves. And that’s why Mujeres Amazonicas exists; so we’re not alone.” 
In March, Patricia and other determined Amazonian women defensoras marched in Ecuador’s capital and met with authorities to demand the protection of their rights. 
 
“We want justice, we want our rights respected,” the leaders of Mujeres Amazónicas told authorities. “We are women of peace, but we are also like a beehive; what affects one of us affects us all. We will be here as long as there are violations of human rights and of our territory.” 
 
Promises made 
Supported with more than 252,000 petitions from Amnesty supporters in Canada and around the world in support of the rightful calls of Mujeres Amazónicas, the authorities made important pledges. 
The Attorney General’s Office committed to visit Pastaza to look into failures by provincial prosecutors to adequately, impartially investigate the attacks and death threats suffered by four leaders of Mujeres Amazónicas. The Attorney General’s Office also vowed to produce a Protocol to ensure effective, coordinated investigation in future of any crimes against women human rights defenders. Equally importantly, the Ecuadorian government pledged to design a Protection Policy for Human Rights Defenders by October 2020. 
Promises broken 
Unfortunately, due to the health emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the visit to Pastaza did not materialize and Mujeres Amazónicas heard nothing about the commitments made to them. Finally, after months of silence, Patricia Gualinga and Margoth Escobar received disturbing communication from prosecutors in June. They were asked to provide the investigation files. They were also told that insufficient, technically flawed evidence meant there was “nothing more to investigate”.  
As Amnesty said in a public statement, until those responsible for the physical attacks, burning of Margoth Escobar’s home, and death threats against all the women defenders are identified and brought to justice, all Mujeres Amazónicas will remain in a situation of risk. It is the obligation of the State to protect the women from harm and end the impunity that fuels further attacks. 
Renewed pressure needed 
It is vital that the Prosecutor’s Office feels pressure from both inside and outside Ecuador to honor its commitments to Mujeres Amazónicas and advance the investigations, actively exploring the link between the attacks and the women’s efforts to stop destructive resource extraction projects in the Amazon. 
Mujeres Amazónicas are counting on our support as they continue to risk their lives to defend the environment so vital to their communities and all of humanity. 
Letters show the authorities that Mujeres Amazónicas have staunch allies who continue to watch what happens and call for accountability.

At Amnesty’s AGM last May, activists reflected artistically on their own hopes for a healthy environment and then symbolically wove those hopes into a solidarity weaving which we later delivered to Amazonian Women. The weaving was accompanied by a photo album showing the activists who took part and their artwork. “We will keep this solidarity gift that you have given us in our hearts always,” Salomé Aranda told us. 
Think about how you might use art to make visible your solidarity with Amazonian Women or to raise awareness and engage support for threatened earth defenders. For more information, contact Elena Dumitru >> edumitru@amnesty.ca  
For inspiration, below are some photos of the activists who helped to weave the solidarity message we sent to Amazonian Women.

Are you looking for ways to promote human rights work in your community beyond signing petitions and writing letters? Are you looking for a new challenge? Join us! 
My name is Tosha Mallette and I am an Amnesty member at my local group in Vernon, B.C, as well as the Co-Chair of the Fieldworker Coordinating Committee. I really enjoy documentaries and learning about the world and the issues we face. Learning about a problem is always the first step I take in my activism, but I also recognize that it’s also important to take action on what I’ve learned. This approach of education informing action is what brought me to Amnesty International and to the Fieldworker Program. 
When I first joined Amnesty years ago, I was introduced to monthly meetings and letter writing as a way to contribute to Amnesty’s human rights work. The world of activism was new to me, but I knew I found the right place to turn my energy into action for human rights, both locally and globally. After becoming comfortable with monthly meetings and letter writing, I found myself looking for a way to branch out further into my community. The Fieldworker Program was just what I needed, and it continues to help me grow in my activism journey. 
In the Fieldworker Program, we emphasize skills training and education to support passionate individuals to foster grassroots activism within our communities. Some of the main skills we develop as Fieldworkers are public speaking, workshop design, and conflict resolution. 
Perspectives from the Team: What is your favourite thing about being a Fieldworker?  
“One of my favourite parts about being a Fieldworker is sharing the empowerment to make a difference with people from different backgrounds and life experiences.” – Tosha Mallette (Vernon, B.C.) 
“My favorite thing about being a Fieldworker is to be able to share the company of Youth and get inspired by their energy and driving force to change the world for good” – Dr. Priti Maheshwari (Lethbridge, AB) 
“The amount of injustice happening around us can feel overwhelming. Helping bring people together as a Fieldworker, and creating meaningful actions that impact change and awareness, is a very rewarding part of this role”- Arunan Sivalingam (Calgary, AB) 
“Developing and implementing plans for events and projects focused around our human rights work”- Gord Barnes (Regina, SK) 
“One of my favourite parts of being a Fieldworker is the opportunities that I get to empower individuals and communities to realize their activism leadership. I have always been passionate about connecting people who are passionate about human rights with the tools and resources that they need to succeed. For example, I really enjoy helping the uOttawa Amnesty team to be better advocates by connecting them to my experience, amnesty resources and plans for semester activism.” -David Menendez (Ottawa, ON) 
“Defending human rights is the best way to respond to a world in disarray. Being part of Amnesty’s Fieldworker team means that I get to help build an international movement that is a force for good.” – Justin Campbell (St. John’s, NL) 
If you’re looking for the next step in your activism journey, apply to be a Fieldworker! Email Shauna MacLean at smaclean@amnesty.ca to apply or find out more. We look forward to having you join our team!

The victims were all boys and young men, and the youngest victim was just...","Angolan security forces tasked with implementing COVID-19 restrictions killed at least seven people between May and July 2020, according to a new investigation by Amnesty International and Angolan rights organization OMUNGA. The victims were all boys and young men, and the youngest victim was just 14 years old. The organizations believe the true death toll is likely to be much higher. 
Through interviews with friends and relatives of seven victims, as well as eyewitnesses, Amnesty International and OMUNGA have pieced together details about the killings. Angolan security forces have repeatedly used excessive and unlawful force when dealing with breaches of state of emergency regulations imposed to control the spread of COVID-19. 
“The stories we heard from relatives and eyewitnesses are harrowing. One teenage boy was shot in the face while he lay injured; another was killed when police fired on a group of friends practicing at a sports field. A state of emergency is no excuse for such outrageous human rights violations,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“There must be a thorough, independent, impartial, transparent and effective investigation into these killings, and perpetrators must be brought to justice in fair trials. There must be proper oversight to ensure that Angolan security forces comply with international human rights standards when enforcing COVID-19 prevention measures.” 
Amnesty International and OMUNGA were able to verify the killings of seven boys and young men by security forces. They received multiple eyewitness accounts of the police’s use of excessive force and firearms, which often targets disadvantaged communities. All the killings took place in poorer neighbourhoods. Both Angolan National Police (Polícia Nacional de Angola – PNA) and Angolan Armed Forces (Forças Armadas Angolanas – FAA) officers are suspected to be responsible. 
On the evening of 13 July, José Quiocama Manuel, a motor taxi driver known as Cleide, was shot dead by police while he was on his way to a friend’s house in the Prenda neighbourhood of Luanda municipality. According to witnesses, at around midnight people in the neighbourhood started shouting that the police were coming. Cleide and Maurício, a 16-year-old boy, tried to hide, but a police officer fired at them. Maurício was shot in the shoulder and survived, but Cleide died instantly. 
On 4 July, 16-year-old Clinton Dongala Carlos was shot in the back by police. Clinton was returning from dinner at his aunt’s house, a 300-metre walk, in the Cacuaco Municipality of Luanda province. According to witnesses, Clinton was chased by a group of security force agents, two from the FAA and three from the PNA, and an officer shot Clinton in the back while he was running home. 
According to witnesses, officers asked local residents for water and poured it on Clinton’s face as he lay injured. The neighbours, who were hiding in terror, then heard a second shot. When the officers left, they saw that Clinton had been shot in the face. 
On 3 July at around 7 am, police shot and killed Mabiala Rogério Ferreira Mienandi, known to his family as Kilson. Kilson was at a sports field with a group of friends, who were playing soccer and dancing. According to witnesses a police vehicle approached and, without giving any warning, officers started shooting at the boys, who ran in all directions to hide. Kilson was hit by a bullet. According to witnesses, three policemen then got out of the car and approached Kilson. They kicked him three times and then drove off. 
“The authorities have used emergency measures to impose arbitrary restrictions on human rights. Any use of force by security forces should be exceptional and must comply with the state’s international human rights obligations, particularly the obligation to respect and protect the right to life and physical integrity and security of the person. This is set out in Article 3 of the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials which states that law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty,” said João Malavindele, Executive Director of OMUNGA. 
“The ultimate aim of combating the spread of COVID-19 should be to save lives and protect livelihoods. When state agents are responsible for the killing of people, it defeats this purpose.” 
One young man with pre-existing health problems died during an incident where police intimidated and humiliated him. 
On the morning of 17 June, 20-year-old João de Assunção was heading to the communal bathroom in his village in Palanca neighbourhood, Luanda province, when he was stopped by PNA officers. João said he would go and get his mask, but officers asked him to perform a somersault while pointing their guns at his face. João told them he felt tired and ill and could not, and an officer fired into the air next to his head, to intimidate him. João fell to the ground. The neighbours told officers that João had problems with his heart and hypertension, and he was taken to Hospital Cajueiros, where he died. The results of the autopsy have not yet been released. 
On the evening of 5 June, 15-year-old Altino Holandês Afonso went to see his grandmother and aunt at the canteen they owned. Shortly after he arrived, police began shooting in the streets, possibly to disperse people. 
Witnesses told Amnesty International and OMUNGA that an officer chased Altino, who tried to run to his aunt’s home, and shot him in his stomach just outside the door. Witnesses also alleged that the officer who shot Altino was drunk. 
The youngest victim in Amnesty International and OMUNGA’s investigation was 14-year-old Mário Palma Romeu, known as Marito, who was shot dead by police on the morning of 13 May. Marito had gone to buy sugar for his mother at the Tombas beach square in Benguela municipality, Benguela province. That morning, young men working on fishing boats on the same beach started a riot, and the police were called to intervene. A police officer shot twice into the air to disperse the young men. The second shot hit Marito’s head and he died instantly. 
On 9 May, police officers shot 21-year-old António Vulola, known as Toni Pi, who had been hosting friends to celebrate the birth of his first child. According to witnesses, at around 10PM Toni Pi and his friend André accompanied other friends to the public transportation stop. On their way home they saw five PNA officers beating and dispersing a gathering of young people, and started running home as they were not wearing masks. The police officer fired at them and Toni Pi was fatally hit in the head. 
There are ongoing criminal investigations against the state agents suspected to be responsible for the deaths of Mário, Altino, Clinton, Mabiala Kilson, João, António and José Cleide. The association Mãos Livres is providing legal assistance to ensure that the human rights violations and abuses are promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigated, those suspected to be responsible are brought to justice, and that the families receive justice and effective remedies, including adequate compensation. 
“Angolan authorities should ensure that the ongoing investigation is swift, independent and impartial. The state agents suspected to be responsible for human rights violations and abuses must be held to account and families provided justice, truth and reparation.” said João Malavindele. 
“Nobody should have to fear for their life, and the Angolan authorities must hold to account anyone who arbitrarily deprives an individual of their rights, including the right to life.”

However, the Canadian government failed to give the Ombudsperson the powers needed to conduct effective investigations (for example, the Ombudsperson cannot compel corporate disclosure). Without an effective Ombudsperson, the individuals and communities who seek justice for allegations of murder, sexual violence, dispossession from their land, dangerous and exploitative working conditions, poisoning of land and water, and other human rights abuses, will continue to be unable to have their voices heard in Canada. 
Please sign our parliamentary petition, urging the Canadian government to empower the Ombudsperson with the power to investigate human rights abuse allegations and enact a law that compels businesses to respect the most current international human rights standards across the entirety of their global operations and supply chains.

“Not content with arresting thousands of protesters, torturing detainees and beating up journalists and medics, the Belarusian authorities have now accused peaceful opposition leaders of being a threat to national security. This demonstrates just how far the regime of Alyaksandr Lukashenka is willing to go to cling to power. If anything is threatening peace and security in Belarus it is the authorities’ violence against their own people. 
“This development has once again proved that there is no space in Belarus for any opinion that questions or criticizes President Lukashenka’s government. It has extinguished any remaining illusions that the authorities are interested in respecting human rights and the rule of law. 
“We continue to call on the Belarusian authorities to end abuses against peaceful protesters, and remind them of their obligation under international law to respect the right to freedom of expression. The Prosecutor’s announcement is likely to appal protesters, and the people of Belarus must be able to express their views without fear of reprisals.”

The...,"Amnesty International demands that the Russian authorities fully investigate the circumstances of the unexpected and critical deterioration of the health of opposition leader Aleksei Navalny and allow him to immediately be diagnosed by and receive treatment from doctors that his family trusts. The politician was hospitalized and placed in intensive care in Omsk (Siberia) on his way from Tomsk to Moscow.  
“The administration of the hospital must provide full access to information about his treatment to his family and doctors of his or their choice. There have already been reports that his chosen doctor was not allowed to see the test results and was not informed of the course of treatment. In light of assumptions about possible poisoning, this only adds to suspicions,” said Natalia Zvyagina, Director of Amnesty International’s Moscow office.  
“Given the grave allegations that have been suggested as the cause of Aleksei Navalny’s illness, there must be a prompt and independent investigation into the circumstances surrounding his hospitalization. If criminal intent is proven, those who ordered and perpetrated this crime must be brought to justice.  
“What has happened to Aleksei Navalny is undeniably similar to incidents involving other hardline critics of the Russian authorities, including the politician Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr. and Pussy Riot punk band producer Pyotr Verzilov. Aleksei Navalny himself became seriously ill previously during his administrative arrest a year ago. None of these incidents were investigated.”  
Background  
Vladimir Kara-Murza Jr., a Russian journalist and politician who lobbied the United States and the European Union to impose personal sanctions against President Vladimir Putin’s entourage, was hospitalized twice – in May 2015 and February 2017 – with symptoms of severe poisoning. Doctors indicated that the cause of poisoning was “the toxic effect of an unidentified substance”.  
Pyotr Verzilov’s doctors from the Charité clinic in Berlin, where the activist was taken for treatment after alleged poisoning in September 2018, came to the conclusion that the cause of his condition could be a substance that entered his body from outside. They were also unable to determine its nature.  
On 28 July 2019, Aleksei Navalny was hospitalized from a detention center, where he was serving so-called administrative arrest for organizing peaceful protests. The authorities claimed that the cause of the deterioration of health was an allergic reaction, but the politician himself believed that he was poisoned. No investigation into these circumstances has been reported opened.

The post included the following statement from Nasrin Sotoudeh: 
Human rights activists, 
 In the midst of the coronavirus crisis which has engulfed Iran and the world, the conditions of political prisoners have become so difficult and arduous that their continued detention is impossible under these oppressive conditions.  
The case of political [prisoner] convicts are based on unbelievable charges of espionage, spreading corruption on earth, acting against national security, corruption and prostitution, and forming illegal groups on Telegram channels, charges which can carry ten years of imprisonment or the death sentence.  
Many defendants, from the beginning of the formation of the case until the verdict is issued, are denied access to an independent lawyer or [the ability] to freely communicate with their own lawyer. Judges of the Revolutionary Court recklessly and repeatedly state to political [prisoner] defendants that they issue verdicts solely based on reports from intelligence and security agencies, and the interrogator tells the defendant the verdict upon their arrest.  
Lawyers who express anger with the judges of the Revolutionary Court are sent to prison. Defendants who have faced unbelievably serious charges are given the maximum sentence, and some cases, even more than the maximum sentence. Then a political prisoner who has been issued with their sentence under such unjust conditions will sit in disbelief hoping for a legal path forward.  
Courts of appeal, parole, suspension of punishment and postponement of sentences, as well as a new law which emphasises issuing a minimal sentence has been promised, but in extrajudicial proceedings the exercise of all these legal rights is left to the discretion of the interrogators and so the last doors left for political prisoners are closed. Many of these prisoners are now eligible for parole, and many would be released through implementation of the new law, but prisoners are still treated as if there was no such law and that they have no right to such legal opportunities. Prisoners’ pleas seeking viable legal paths have been left unanswered.  
For all the pleas left unanswered and for the demand of the release of political prisoners, I will go on hunger strike.  
In the hope of the establishment of justice in my country, Iran.

0,Venezuela: Authorities are repressing and failing to protect health workers as the COVID-19 pandemic gathers force,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/venezuela-authorities-are-repressing-and-failing-to-protect-health-workers-as-the-covid-19-pandemic-gathers-force/,"As the daily number of COVID-19 cases reported in Venezuela has accelerated at the quickest rate yet in recent weeks, authorities are failing to take action to protect the population and, in particular, the doctors, nurses and hospital and clinic workers who are being sorely hit, and even jailing...","As the daily number of COVID-19 cases reported in Venezuela has accelerated at the quickest rate yet in recent weeks, authorities are failing to take action to protect the population and, in particular, the doctors, nurses and hospital and clinic workers who are being sorely hit, and even jailing those who speak out about their dire labour conditions, said Amnesty International today.      
“The Venezuelan authorities are either in denial about the number of health workers to have died from COVID-19, or they do not have accurate information about the precarious conditions in hospitals and the dire need for better protection of staff and patients alike. Either way, the government is being utterly irresponsible,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“While the Nicolás Maduro government has called on the population to applaud health workers in recent weeks, what they really need is not clapping, but concrete government action to procure the resources they need to work in safety, and allow their voices to be heard without reprisals.” 
According to the organization Medicos Unidos de Venezuela, 71 health workers died from 1 July to 16 August, with 37 of those deaths coming in just the first 16 days of August. This total represents almost 30% of the total deaths reported by authorities from COVID-19 in Venezuela which stand at 288. However, authorities are failing to disaggregate deaths by sector and many deaths of health workers are not being counted in the official register. 
Amnesty International gathered information indicating that on 16 August there were 691 patients hospitalized for symptoms of COVID-19 in the main hospitals of the city of Caracas alone. This raises doubts about the veracity of the official daily numbers of cases across the country, with authorities reporting just 1,148 new cases of COVID-19 across the entire country on 16 August. 
Venezuela stands out as a stark example of state reprisals against health workers. Since Amnesty International began monitoring the situation of health workers across the Americas in early April, Venezuela is the only country that has gone so far as to jail those who have spoken out publicly about risks to their safety and that of patients. 
While reprisals against health workers who act as whistle-blowers have occurred in many countries of the region, to Amnesty International’s knowledge, Venezuela is the only country in the region that has arrested health workers and brought them before military and civil tribunals. To date, Amnesty International had received information of at least 12 health workers who have been detained during the pandemic, including many whose due process was violated as they were not informed of the charges against them. Amnesty International has reported for years now the policy of repression implemented by Maduro’s government to silence and control the population which includes arbitrary detentions and torture to a wide range of people who have raised their voices. 
In recent years, approximately 50 per cent of the country’s doctors have left the country, according to the Venezuelan Medical Federation (FMV), leaving Venezuela with scarce human resources to face the pandemic. The exit of so many medical personnel comes in the context of the humanitarian emergency and human rights crisis that has seen 5.2 million flee the country. 
The health workers who stayed in Venezuela earn between 4 and 18 USD a month, and many have had to walk to work, sometimes for over 10 km, as they cannot afford transport. According to the civil society watchdog Monitor Salud, 68% of 296 health workers surveyed in Caracas from March to June arrived at work without any food in their stomach before starting an arduous shift. The average living expenses of groceries and basic utilities per month for each Venezuelan are estimated at USD 513, according to the national research organization CENDAS. 
Venezuelan labour law states that workers should be protected from risks at work, but according to the local NGO PROVEA, workers are being left completely exposed without personal protective equipment (PPE). In the small number of cases where workers are supplied with PPE, they are being forced to re-use masks for prolonged periods of time, making them ineffective. There have also been alarming reports of government delegates assigned to certain states visiting hospitals cloaked in full protective gear, when health workers have been left with very little equipment. 
In mid-July, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) donated 20 tonnes of PPE for 31 hospitals across the country. While this is an important contribution to protecting Venezuela’s health workers, there are 240 hospitals throughout the country and authorities have the responsibility to ensure protective equipment for all hospitals. In addition, hospital staff from the states where the PAHO donations were said to have been delivered reported no change in their daily working conditions after donations arrived in the country. It is imperative that civil society groups have more precise information on these humanitarian donations, in order to activate an independent monitoring mechanism to ensure that aid is arriving where it is most needed. 
The Venezuelan government must do more to properly diagnose and assess the country’s need for international cooperation in the form of donations, as well as taking concerted efforts to re-assign resources to ensure health workers have access to gloves, surgical gowns and masks. The government must also ensure that there are sufficient cleaning products and disinfectant in hospitals. Close to half of the country’s hospitals have no water or shortages of water, and according to workers organizations, many of them have not been properly disinfected once during the pandemic.

While this tragedy occurred in the US and the context, scale and scope of anti-Black racism differs accordingly, we recognize and acknowledge that similar incidents have and continue to occur here and that Canada has its own underlying history of anti-Black racism. Reconciliation with that history must begin with truth, even if hearing it is painful.  Racism and the systems that uphold it are, for the most part, very much out in the open.  Equality does not live in a statement or a gesture. Reconciliation is not an event; it is a journey.  
It is certainly a journey we face throughout Amnesty International, including the English Branch here in Canada. And while some elements of that journey have been done well, in other ways we have faltered. Intentions cannot create true equality and we continue to look both inward and outward to determine the work that needs to be done, in the short term and the long term. It is impact, not intention that matters at the end of the day. It also requires us to look at how we arrived where we are and to own the circumstances we find ourselves in today. Whether or not we have been the perpetrators of the actions and structures that continue to perpetuate racism in our country and in our organizations, we are the caretakers of those structures and are required to look closely at how they came into being and the role we must now play in dismantling them. 
As part of this, we must continue to work with grassroots allies and partners to better understand how and where the expertise, knowledge and resources Amnesty International brings can add the most value and be welcomed, while we continue our essential journey of learning and making significant internal changes to address both systemic and other forms of oppression. AI Canada will focus its contribution to addressing anti-Black racism where organizations and individual partners with the greatest expertise and history of anti-Black racism work believe we can add value. That is why we are establishing an external Reference Group to advise us as we continue to develop goals and activities for the long-term, grounded in tremendous respect for those who have been doing the hardest and most emotionally intensive work to expose and address racism in Canada for years or even decades. 
We will continue to provide updates on our progress on our website and through our publications and social media. In the meantime, some of highlights of this work have included: 
As many of you already know, Amnesty Canada (ES) engaged Anti-Oppression Consultant Yamikani Msosa in 2018  to help conduct staff surveys focused on understanding staff demographics and providing opportunities for staff to share experiences of oppression and other behaviours that undermine the emotional and psychological safety of a workplace. The surveys and resulting work began in January 2019. 
An ad hoc Anti-Oppression Advisory Committee was created to support  the Board, staff, and consultants to develop and begin to implement an action plan to ensure that there is a big picture framework and a comprehensive plan with clear deliverables and timelines. The Action Plan is tailored to our issues and needs but draws significantly from similar work at AIUSA and on the requirement of the Amnesty Movement for a section-level Gender and Diversity Action Plan, as well as on the plan to improve staff well-being at the International Secretariat (IS). 
Activities undertaken to date have included: attention to all human resources and interpersonal issues; anti-oppression training and externally facilitated conversations; assessments and deeper training for all managers; increased attention to internal practices that support inclusivity; improved hiring practices to include lived experience and professional expertise in anti-oppression as core competencies; and analysis of white saviour narrative in external communications. 
While many of these activities continue, as they must, additional priorities have been added for 2020. These include an emphasis in the Secretary General recruitment process on lived experience and a background in racial justice and social justice work; more rigorous requirements for staff and managers to continue to learn and self-reflect on core anti-oppression concepts and demonstrate resultant changes in behaviour and work; clearer expectations of workplace behaviours grounded in co-created values; additional emphasis on improving the outcomes of performance management and conflict resolution efforts; and ensuring that anti-racism is a clear focus within staff training and discussions. 
For some time there has also been interest in implementing an Anti-Oppression survey for members and volunteer leaders. Such a survey is currently being developed.  It is intended to inform how the Action Plan should be expanded to address issues of oppression and discrimination within our membership base as the previous survey and current plan are focused on the staff level 
A broader Anti-Oppression Committee is now also envisaged, comprised of Board members, staff, volunteers, and youth members whose mandate is to oversee and address issues that relate to anti-oppression within our organization. It is our hope that this standing committee will allow us to maintain momentum and oversight in all the anti-oppression work we complete as an organization. 
The Board intends to provide an update to members quarterly and hold a session at the 2021 AGM dedicated to reporting on this plan. 
We  know that despite all the energy and focus on this internal work, the anti-oppression action plan we’ve developed needs to be updated to incorporate even more focus on dismantling systemic racism and the individual work and learning required to make this a reality. 
Our commitment to you is that we will report back to membership with a clear plan for incorporating a focus on anti-Black racism into our broader anti-oppression work. We aim to do so by mid-October. 
As we undertake this work, we want to echo and support the following commitments and acknowledgements made by the International Board in their June statement to sections:  
Dismantling systemic racism is a long, hard road that focuses not only on the systems we live and work within, but also the racism and white supremacy that is deeply rooted within many of us as individuals. As an organization, we have already started down this path, but know we still have a long way to go. While COVID-19 and the financial challenges at the IS will make this journey even more challenging, the Board and our staff are committed to the work of becoming an anti-racist organization and engaging with these issues. 
As a Board, we will not only continue to prioritize and fund this work for the organization, but also commit to doing the work as individuals to learn, grow, and change our own behaviours as we begin to dismantle our own biases and the systemic racism that lives within us. 
We will inevitably make mistakes along the way and ask that you continue to challenge us to be better as an organization for our members, staff, volunteers, and the rights holders we are here to support. To quote acclaimed researcher and author of How to be an Antiracist, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi, “The good news is that racist and antiracist are not fixed identities.  We can be a racist one minute and an antiracist the next.  What we say about race, what we do about race, in each moment, determines what – not who – we are.” 
We thank you for your ongoing support and hope you will join us in this journey. Several anti-racism resources and materials are available here and you can read the statement from the International Board of Amnesty on racism and Black Lives Matter here. 
As always, if you have any comments, questions or concerns, please reach out to the Board at haveyoursay@amnesty.ca.

The organisation monitored the largely peaceful protests on 8 August where tear gas, rubber bullets and pump action pellets were fired indiscriminately into crowds; gathered testimony from victims, eyewitnesses and physicians; and verified footage of security forces using force in a reckless and unlawful way.  
“With their lives in ruins, and still reeling from the physical and emotional trauma of the explosion, thousands of people took to the streets in Lebanon to call for justice. Instead, state forces shot at and tear-gassed them,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“Instead of meetings its basic responsibilities towards the thousands of people left homeless and impacted by the blasts, the state seems to be on the attack against its population. 
“Lebanese security forces caused several serious injuries, and further eroded the trust of a population already struggling with multiple crises. All those responsible for this outrageous violent conduct must be thoroughly investigated and held to account for their criminal actions.” 
Videos verified by Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab show that there was a punitive shoot-to-harm use of force, indicating authorities intended to punish protestors and dissuade others from protesting. Analysis also confirmed security force members who were dressed in civilian clothes had fired into crowds. 
Eye injuries caused by rubber bullets and pellets 
Amnesty International interviewed six protesters who were in downtown Beirut on 8 August when the crackdown escalated. They all reported seeing security and military forces shooting rubber bullets and tear gas canisters directly into the crowd at chest level and from close range, indicating that they were shooting to harm. Protesters also reported suffering injuries from small rubber pellets fired from an unidentified source. 
Doctors have reported at least six cases of eye injuries. All of the injured were aged between 18 and 21, and had been hit in the eyes with pellets. The medical team at the Department of Ophthalmology at the American University of Beirut removed the eye of one young man completely, while others lost their sight to varying degrees. 
One doctor told Amnesty International: “We did six open eye operations on Tuesday following to the explosion, and six open eye operations on Saturday following the protests. The first six were injured by glass, the second six by pellets.” 
Amjad* was shot in the neck with a rubber bullet, according to medics. A vein was hit, and he suffered significant blood loss before being taken to Rizk Hospital. 
He said: “We were in Riad Al-Solh Street. I saw the riot police and the army shooting directly at the protesters from a close range. They were around 12 meters away from us, and then I felt blood pouring from my neck. I pressed on the wound with my fingers and walked in the direction of the Red Cross to get help. I then fainted and the people there helped me.” 
Under international guidelines, rubber bullets may only be used as a targeted tool to stop individuals engaged in violence, and should never be fired indiscriminately into crowds, as they can cause serious injury. In addition, they may only ever be aimed at the lower part of the body with a view to minimizing injury. 
“Lebanon’s security forces fired a range of weapons in a way that was solely intended to harm people. To do this in the aftermath of a national tragedy is just cruelty beyond belief,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
Tear gas canisters fired into crowds 
Security forces and riot police indiscriminately fired tear gas canisters into the crowds from launchers, causing several serious injuries. 
Jad* was in the Azarieh district when he was hit in the face by a tear gas canister, suffering a broken nose. He told Amnesty International: “As we were packing to leave, I was hit in the face above my right eye with a tear gas canister. My nose is broken and my whole face is swollen.” 
Faten* was hit by a tear gas canister in her right shoulder. She was also in the Azarieh district when riot police attacked the crowd. 
She told Amnesty International: “The riot police were only 10 meters away. I felt I was hit by something on my shoulder. I couldn’t feel my arm anymore. I thought I lost it, and then I collapsed. They were shooting tear gas at chest level directly at the people.” 
Tear gas canisters fired from launchers can cause serious harm. Tear gas should only be used in situations of widespread violence for the purpose of dispersing a crowd, and only when all other means to contain the violence have failed. 
“It is unlawful to use tear gas if the canister is fired directly at a person. The horrific injuries sustained by protesters are no doubt a result of security forces setting out to deliberately hurt people,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
Although there were minor acts of violence by a small number of protestors, this does not justify use of force to disperse the entire protest, or allow security forces to treat the entire protest as an unpeaceful one. The authorities must respect the right of the majority to exercise their right to peaceful assembly, even where it is being exercised in the presence of minor acts of violence by a minority. 
To date, all security and military agencies’ statements have denied any responsibility. One member of the Lebanon Internal Security Forces died in circumstances that remain unclear. 
Amnesty International identified Nobel Sport MP7 tear gas canisters and grenades; canisters of SAE Alsetex SM6 tear gas and Alsetex launchers, made in France; and M203 UGL grenade launchers. 
Doctors targeted 
Doctors who had attended the protests said they soon realized dozens of people required urgent medical care. They reported injuries and wounds on heads, faces, necks, arms, chests, backs, legs, and spleens. Doctors were also targeted with tear gas as they tried to treat injuries. 
Doctor Elie Saliba told Amnesty International that he was assaulted three times on 8 August while in Martyr’s Square: he was hit by a pump action pellet in the shoulder, then by a spray of pellets on the head and face, and then beaten by army officers. 
After being hit by the pellets, he said he approached an army officer to ask why they were shooting into the crowds. The army officer told him, “You elected this regime”, and Dr Saliba replied: “I never elected any of the leaders of the corrupt regime.” He was then assaulted. 
Dr Saliba said: “When he heard ‘corrupt’, he pushed me violently. I turned my back to leave. A soldier hit my back with his ranger, and I fell on the ground. Three officers started kicking my body. I saw my wife running to me, I feared they would hit her, so I found some strength to stand up and run away, hold her and leave with her. They hit me because I said ‘corrupt’. I didn’t offend him, the army or insult anyone.” 
“Doctors and aid workers have endured an overwhelmingly traumatic week, working relentlessly on saving lives following the blasts. Now they find themselves not only having to treat casualties of state violence, but also being shot at and beaten. Where is the basic human decency?,” said Lynn Maalouf. 
Calls for international investigation 
On 4 August, a large explosion in the port area of Beirut killed at least 220 people and left an estimated 7,000 more injured. Lebanon’s President Michael Aoun said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely in a warehouse. Amnesty International has called for an independent investigation into the incident. 
“The Lebanese authorities must cooperate with an international investigation into the explosion, and focus on delivering truth, justice and reparations to the many victims,” said Lynn Maalouf.

COVID-19 has presented a set of huge new challenges which require governments to listen to advice, be open to criticism and scrutiny from experts, and consult those most affected in order to find solutions that minimize harm. States need to learn quickly from mistakes, adapt, innovate, and provide flexible and differentiated responses to the vast problems arising from the pandemic. This can only be achieved when diverse opinions and debate are allowed, and when different sectors of society are listened to and encouraged to participate. As the WHO says, a crucial way to fight COVID-19, is to “inform, empower and listen to communities”. 
At a time of great crisis, what we would expect to see is governments bringing people together, fostering solidarity, and striving to protect those most at risk. Indeed, amid the shock of the first few weeks of the pandemic, many of us dared to hope that this huge upheaval might be an opportunity to create a more just, inclusive and caring world, and an environmentally friendly future. 
What we have seen instead is many states lashing out at those whom they perceive as critics. Instead of unifying society, thin-skinned authorities in places like Nicaragua, Poland, or Tunisia, have ignored, criminalized, or suppressed information and critical voices. Other leaders have used this calamity to further their power and crack down on civic space, including in Hungary, the Philippines, Thailand, Azerbaijan or Zimbabwe. As the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression recently put it: 
“People have suffered because some governments would rather protect themselves from criticism than allow people to share information, learn about the outbreak, know what officials are or are not doing to protect them.” 
This is reflected in the abundant documentation of abuses against human rights defenders that we have seen and denounced in the last few months. In our briefing Daring to stand up for human rights in a pandemic we have put together dozens and dozens of individual cases – likely to be just the tip of the iceberg – of people paying a high price for their work defending human rights. 
They include whistleblowers in the health sector, community activists, and journalists and bloggers sharing information and raising questions about the handling of the pandemic. Indigenous communities have been left without adequate health care and under siege from those encroaching on their lands; and at-risk activists have been left without protection and made into easy targets for attackers. Women and LGBTI activists have faced increased gender-based violence and discrimination, and imprisoned human rights defenders and dissidents suffer additional punishment as they continue to be held in overcrowded, unsanitary prisons where they are exposed to the virus. 
There are so many individual stories of human rights defenders under attack. One that stands out for me as it epitomizes state contempt for them, is that of Atena Daemi, a woman human rights defender in Iran, imprisoned for her anti-death penalty activism. After four years in prison and being subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including the denial of medical care, in June, she was sentenced to two additional years and 74 lashes on trumped up charges designed to keep her in detention for her human rights activism. 
The pandemic has deepened pre-existing inequalities and poverty, humanitarian crises and the impact of discrimination and racism in every society. It is likely that this will encourage more people than ever to mobilize for their rights. And indeed we have seen movements coming together to defend human rights and protest peacefully, stepping up and playing different roles in their own communities. This has included providing information on how to protect ourselves from COVID-19 when information is lacking or contradictory, and denouncing the lack of adequate prevention measures and health services. More and more human rights defenders are involved in delivering humanitarian aid and advocating for groups that are marginalized and discriminated against, fighting government pushbacks on human rights under the cover of emergency legislation, and continuing with their long standing human rights work. States could learn a great deal from their resilience, adaptability, determination and innovation. 
This is why human rights defenders are important actors in the fight against the pandemic, and why states should see them as allies, not enemies. Without all the individuals and collectives who defend human rights worldwide, it will be almost impossible to tackle COVID-19 and save as many lives and livelihoods as possible. As well as being a state obligation, is in the interest of states and society at large to recognize, protect and enable human rights defenders to carry out their crucial work. Only then can we mitigate the harshest impacts of the crisis, and ensure those most at risk are not left behind in the process.

For over 500 years we have faced invasions, the loss of our...","For over 500 years we have faced invasions, the loss of our ancestral lands, ethnic and socioeconomic discrimination that has led to displacement, illnesses, death, and the constant threat of cultural and physical extermination. 
For decades, large companies and governments have offered us what they call “economic development” in exchange for the extraction of irreplaceable natural resources. In reality, those uncontrolled practices have enslaved us and contaminated our lands, in a habitat that is of vital importance not only for the Peoples who live together there but for the whole planet. 
Our home, the Amazon, not only contributes significantly to the gross domestic product of many countries in the region but also contributes the largest quantity of oxygen to the world. However, the Peoples who protect it are deprived of fundamental rights such as basic services, education, and health. 
One of the most recent examples of these abuses took place on 7 April. While the world was trying to understand how the novel coronavirus pandemic was changing life in cities, many Indigenous communities in the Ecuadorian Amazon were left without water following the collapse of the bases and pipelines of the Trans-Ecuadorian Pipeline System and Crude Oil Pipeline. 
The massive oil spill in the waters of the Coca river, located on the border between the Amazonian provinces of Napo and Sucumbíos, has clearly endangered the communities that live there and depend on it. 
Without rivers to fish in, they have been left without their main source of food. Without water, surviving has become a daily battle. 
The oil companies responsible for the spill have sent some food rations and bottled water, but neither they nor the government have agreed on long-term actions to guarantee the life and health of those who live in the area. 
While the World Health Organization advises hand washing as the main prevention method in the face of the pandemic, the affected communities barely have a small amount of water to drink. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has now been added to the list of threats that the uncontrolled extractive activities of hydroelectric, oil, mining and timber companies represent. 
In response to this new danger, governments in Latin America have replicated the same historic patterns when facing the problems of Indigenous Peoples: indifference, inaction, and imposition. In some cases where action has been taken, health policies that do not respect cultural diversity are developed and implemented, and specific budgets for care for Indigenous Peoples are not assigned. 
But the Indigenous communities and organizations in the Amazon basin have not continued waiting for help that we know will never arrive. 
In the first instance, we have called on governments and international organizations to take action and enter into dialogue through letters, declarations and data surveys to warn of the serious situation that the Indigenous Peoples are experiencing in the face of the alarming rise in contagion and deaths in the Amazon.  
Communication channels with different national and local authorities have been developed in order to agree on joint management methods to guarantee that those who need it can access the care they need in a timely manner. However, our demands have not been listened to so far. For this reason and in accordance with our principles as Indigenous Peoples, we have developed our own care protocols, emergency and action plans taking into account the needs of each community. 
In some cases, for example, we have organized among ourselves to limit and control entry to and exit from the communities, we have increased and expanded the use of ancestral medicine, created our own information and care campaigns, and we have put together specific help groups that coordinate the distribution of medicine and food to the most affected areas.  
Faced with the lack of action by governments to address our needs, the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) launched a campaign to raise emergency funds. The fund has the aim of collecting and channelling 100% of the resources to the Indigenous communities of the nine countries of the Amazon basin facing the COVID-19 emergency. 
Decisions on grants and governance of the fund are carried out under the strict coordination and communication of a governing board that includes Indigenous leaders of COICA and its member organizations and, to a lesser extent, representatives of participating, donor and advising social organizations. All the money raised is completely and exclusively sent to the communities that need it most, by providing kits with food, medical supplies, and protection. 
This fund will be a lifeline for many Indigenous communities, but it is not enough. 
In the context of a pandemic that will probably last for some time, we need dialogue and action in order to develop and implement culturally appropriate health policies, with plans and budgets specifically aimed at care for Indigenous Peoples. If governments really want to take care of the guardians of the earth, this is the only possible way. It is no longer an option not to take action. If we do not act now, we will be witnesses to ethnocide. 
While the Amazon is alive, humanity is safe.

“Testimonies suggest that the five young men were victims of enforced disappearance, allegedly at the hands of agents of the Honduran state security forces. If confirmed, this crime under international law would mark another atrocious chapter in the country’s recent history,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“We demand that the Juan Orlando Hernández administration take urgent measures to find the five missing people, including four Garifuna activists from the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras, alive. The authorities must also carry out a swift, exhaustive, independent and impartial investigation to identify and punish all those responsible for planning and carrying out this crime. We cannot allow impunity to encourage endless cycles of violence and grave human rights violations.” 
Witnesses state that on 18 July, individuals dressed in police investigations branch uniforms took four members of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), Alberth Snider Centeno Tomás, Suami Aparicio Mejía García, Gerardo Mizael Rochez Cálix and Milton Joel Martínez Álvarez from their homes; along with a fifth person, Junior Rafael Juárez Mejía. 
Amnesty International sent an open letter to President Juan Orlando Hernández on 24 July, demanding that his government guarantee that it will find the victims, ensure justice for the events and provide collective protection for the Garifuna community in El Triunfo de la Cruz. 
On 8 October 2015, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of the Garifuna community in Triunfo de la Cruz and found the Honduran state guilty of violating this community’s right to collective property. Previously, on 28 April 2006, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had issued protective measures to the Triunfo de la Cruz community and requested that the government adopt the necessary measures to protect the community’s right to ownership of its ancestral lands. 
In a report published on 29 July, the international organization Global Witness named Honduras the country the fifth most lethal country in the world for people defending the rights to land and the environment, and the first per capita. 
“The Honduran government must immediately comply with its international obligations, including recognizing the Garifuna community’s ancestral territory, and implement a comprehensive plan for collective protection that combats the structural causes of the violence against them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“It’s imperative that President Hernandez prioritizes the situation of the people and communities who defend human rights in his agenda, so that these terrible events do not happen again, and the communities can defend their rights without fear of reprisals.”

Minister of Foreign Affairs 125 Sussex Drive
Ottawa, Ontario K1A 0G2 
August 4, 2020 
Dear Minister Champagne, 
We write on behalf of Amnesty International Canada and Above Ground to request your immediate assistance with regard to urgent concerns for the safety of human rights defenders who belong to the Rios Vivos movement in Colombia. 
Canada is directly and very seriously implicated in the situation of risk faced by members of Rios Vivos, given that it arises from devastating impacts of the Export Development Canada-financed Hidroituango Dam project on the Cauca River in Colombia. 
The dam has had disastrous consequences for the environment and for communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and food security. There were abundant, credible warnings about these and other negative consequences before EDC approved its financing. The dam has also exacerbated armed conflict and repression against community leaders who have spoken out in defense of their rights. Six leaders have been killed and scores of others have been tortured, forcibly displaced, attacked or threatened with death. 
Today the situation has become more dangerous than ever. Rios Vivos tells us that paramilitaries move freely and control the area with fear, and the acquiescence of the military. Amidst a COVID quarantine, Amnesty has documented a chilling number of killings of human rights defenders and social leaders who are unable to move around to seek safety in hiding. 
Members of Rios Vivos were awarded collective protection measures in 2019 because they were assessed to be at “extraordinary risk”. Yet these protection measures have not been implemented, leaving many defenseless. Individual protection measures for Rios Vivos spokesperson Isabel Zuleta, who met with Global Affairs Canada officials during a visit here late last year and who has suffered threats and attempts on her life, reports that her individual protection scheme was recently ‘reassessed’. Despite ongoing threats, she faces reduced protection. 
Beyond the ever-present threat of further violence against them, members of Rios Vivos are also facing elevated risk amidst the pandemic. We have received reports from Rios Vivos that Empresas Públicas de Medellin, the company building the EDC-financed Hidroituango project, has as many as 4,000 workers working from camps and that 900 have been infected with COVID-19. The threat of contagion into vulnerable, marginalized communities whose food security, health and safety has already been compromised by the dam, is huge and extremely worrying. 
Rios Vivos asked for the camps to be shut down because of the danger they pose due to COVID-19 infection. The company allegedly told them this was not possible because the workers are there to ensure the dam does not collapse. Rios Vivos subsequently requested to no avail that the company reduce the number of workers to the absolute minimum needed to operate alert mechanisms, which they have been told is about 100 workers. 
Given the situation of extreme risk for the human rights defenders of Rios Vivos, and in keeping with the mandate provided by the government of Canada’s Voices At Risk guidelines, we ask you to take the following action that has been requested by Rios Vivos: 
We look forward to hearing back from you as soon as possible with regard to these recommendations. 
Sincerely, 

Alex Neve                                                                      Karen Hamilton
Secretary General                                                          Program Officer

P.S. On July 22, we had the opportunity to also share these recommendations with policy advisors in the office of Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng, during a meeting to discuss the action requested by thousands of our supporters who sent emails to Minister Ng and EDC President Mairead Lavery to express concern about the impact of the EDC-financed Hidroituango Dam on Rios Vivos. Minister Ng’s office suggested to us that your office has the relationships, role and capacity to respond to these concerns and move our recommendations forward and urged us to pursue this with you.

Dear Minister Ng, 
We were grateful for the opportunity to meet by phone with members of your staff on July 22. We asked for the call following the unsatisfactory response from Export Development Canada’s President and CEO, Mairead Lavery, to the thousands of emails she received from Amnesty Canada supporters and others. The emails denounced EDC’s 2016 loan to help build the Hidroituango dam in Colombia and called on the agency to provide reparations to the affected communities and advocate for their protection. 
During the call, we spoke again of the serious human rights and environmental harms related to the dam’s construction and near collapse. We also expressed grave concern for the safety of members of the Movimiento Ríos Vivos Antioquia, an association of communities affected by the dam. We called on your office to urge Colombian authorities to immediately implement the collective protections that have already been ordered for Ríos Vivos members, who face violence and death threats for publicly opposing the dam, and to not reduce the protection measures provided to Ríos Vivos spokesperson Isabel Zuleta. 
We further requested that your office urge Colombian authorities to close Hidroituango’s work camps in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19, and to ensure the provision of humanitarian assistance to affected communities, whose ability to provide for themselves has been compromised by the dam’s construction, its near collapse and now the quarantine. 
Your office urged us to raise these particular concerns with your Cabinet colleague, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne. We have indeed done so, and have copied you on that correspondence. In our meeting we requested that your office, and you personally, similarly raise these concerns directly with Minister Champagne, which we are reiterating here. 2 
During the call we also urged the government to complete its review of EDC’s governing legislation, the Export Development Act, and adopt reforms to make the agency accountable for the human rights consequences of its decisions. The review is currently stalled in the Standing Committee on International Trade, where the former Minister of International Trade Diversification, Jim Carr, referred his report on the review in June 2019. Your office committed to ensuring that the next steps in this review are taken in the fall. 
Lastly, we called for an independent review of EDC’s decision to provide a loan to EPM despite warnings of corruption and social and environmental harm. As we noted, the Inter-American Development Bank Group has already approved an investigation into its decision to lend money for the project. 
We thank you again for the opportunity to speak with your staff. Together with Ríos Vivos, we look forward to updates from your office on steps the Canadian government is taking to ensure that its export bank no longer supports destructive projects like Hidroituango. 
Sincerely, 
Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada

“The horrific scenes in the aftermath of the explosion yesterday were devastating for a country already suffering under the strain of multiple crises. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families at this tragic time. 
“Whatever may have caused the explosion, including the possibility of a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely, Amnesty International is calling for an international mechanism to be promptly set up to investigate how this happened. 
“Amnesty International also calls on the international community to urgently increase humanitarian aid to Lebanon at a time when the country was already struggling with the severe economic crisis, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
Background 
Yesterday (4 August), an explosion in the port area of Beirut, Lebanon, killed at least 100 people and left an estimated 4,000 more injured. 
Lebanon’s President Michael Aoun has said the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely in a warehouse. Today, an official three-day period of mourning has been declared, as rescue workers continue to search through rubble for survivors. 
Amnesty International believes an international investigation, free from any potential domestic political interference, is necessary to ensure truth, justice, and reparations for victims.

0,Annexation formalizes ongoing theft of Palestinian land,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/annexation-formalizes-ongoing-theft-of-palestinian-land/,"Amnesty International Canada is deeply concerned with and strongly opposes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to “annex” a large portion of the West Bank in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In the upcoming weeks, Israel is expected to “annex” at least 30% of the West...","Amnesty International Canada is deeply concerned with and strongly opposes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to “annex” a large portion of the West Bank in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
In the upcoming weeks, Israel is expected to “annex” at least 30% of the West Bank. 
In May 2020, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced his plan to “annex” parts of the Jordan Valley, namely the City of Jericho. It is expected that at least 60,000 Palestinians will be forced to leave their homes. Prime Minister Netanyahu has also announced that the displaced Palestinians would not be granted Israeli citizenship. 
Israel’s “annexation” plans follow the January 2020 announcement by President Donald Trump’s so-called “deal of the century”, which proposed areas of the occupied West Bank to be annexed by Israel. 
Amnesty International Canada strongly believes that the “annexation” would serve only to worsen human rights violations and enshrine the entrenched impunity that has fuelled decades of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave violations. The UN Special Rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 warned: “International law is very clear: annexation and territorial conquest are forbidden by the Charter of the United Nations.” 
Annexation formalizes land theft that has been going on for decades. Since 1967, Israel has continuously violated international law and “annexed” parts of the West Bank. 
Annexation first began in 1967 when Israel unilaterally “annexed” East Jerusalem and included this Palestinian part of the city, as well as the surrounding area of 64 square kilometres, within the boundaries of the Israeli municipality of Jerusalem. 
Further “annexation” of Palestinian territory would certainly stand to deepen and exacerbate decades of severe and entrenched human rights violations against Palestinians living in the West Bank. Any Israeli move to “annex” territory in the West Bank is null and void under international law, but it will not be treated as such by Israeli courts. Thus, their application of Israeli law to the territory will have the effect of denying rights under international law to Palestinians in the territory. 
Moves towards formalization (under domestic Israeli law) and further land grabs of Palestinian territory would result in the continuation of Israeli settlement expansion. It would also further entrench the policies of institutionalized discrimination that Palestinians face in the OPT as well as the continuation of mass human rights violations resulting from the occupation. 
Annexation will have a devastating impact on Palestinians’ nationality status, their right to property and restrict their right to move freely. 
In an open letter addressed to Prime Minister Trudeau, Amnesty International Canada urges Canadian government to explicitly oppose the West Bank “annexation” plan. 
Amnesty International Canada urged the Canadian government to pursue all possible steps to address and bring an end to the human rights violations caused by decades of Israeli occupation and unlawful settlements in the West Bank. International humanitarian law obliges Canada to do so.

0,Iran: Leaked official letters reveal state denial of COVID-19 crisis in prisons,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/iran/iran-leaked-official-letters-reveal-state-denial-of-covid-19-crisis-in-prisons/,Leaked official documents newly obtained by Amnesty International reveal that the Iranian government has ignored repeated pleas by senior officials responsible for managing Iran’s prisons for additional resources to control the spread of COVID-19 and treat infected prisoners. The organization...,"Leaked official documents newly obtained by Amnesty International reveal that the Iranian government has ignored repeated pleas by senior officials responsible for managing Iran’s prisons for additional resources to control the spread of COVID-19 and treat infected prisoners. The organization reviewed copies of four letters signed by officials at Iran’s Prisons Organization, which operates under the supervision of the judiciary, to the Ministry of Health, raising the alarm over serious shortages of protective equipment, disinfectant products, and essential medical devices. The Ministry of Health failed to respond, and Iran’s prisons remain catastrophically unequipped for outbreaks. 
The details in the letters stand in stark contrast to public statements by the former head of the Prisons Organization and current advisor to the head of the judiciary, Asghar Jahangir, who has lauded Iran’s “exemplary” initiatives to protect prisoners from the pandemic, and denied reports of increasing infection rates and COVID-19-related deaths inside prisons resulting from overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and lack of access to health care. 
“These official letters provide damning evidence of the government’s appalling failure to protect prisoners. Requests for urgently needed disinfectant products, protective equipment and medical devices have been ignored for months. This is particularly alarming as the letters also note the presence of a highly vulnerable population in Iran’s prisons” said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“Overcrowding, poor ventilation, lack of basic sanitation and medical equipment, and deliberate neglect of prisoners’ health problems, are making Iranian prisons a perfect breeding ground for COVID-19. The Iranian authorities must stop denying the health crisis in Iran’s prisons and take urgent steps to protect prisoners’ health and lives.” 
The head of the health care office of the Prisons Organization first submitted a letter to Iran’s Ministry of Health on 29 February 2020. Four follow-up letters were submitted on 25 March 2020, 12 May 2020, 14 June 2020, and 5 July 2020 and these have been seen by Amnesty International. 
The letter dated 25 March 2020 requests disinfectant products and protective equipment to last three months, including “5,400,000 masks, 10,000 N95 masks, 3,600,000 latex gloves, 10,000,000 plastic gloves, 450,000 litres of hand sanitizers and 1,000,000 litres of surface disinfectant, 5,000 face shields, 5,000 protective goggles, 5,000 protective gowns, 300 air ventilation systems and 250 de-infestation machines”. The letter also highlights the urgent need for funding to purchase hundreds of essential medical devices including blood pressure and blood glucose monitors, thermometers, pulse oximeters, stethoscopes and defibrillators.  
While the letter does not clarify how many prisons these items and devices are intended for, the figures raise concerns about very serious shortages in prisons across the country. 
The letter warns that “security hazards” and “irreparable harm” will result from inaction, particularly considering that Iran’s prisons are “populated with individuals who have pre-existing medical problems, use drugs, and/or suffer from malnutrition, anaemia, and infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis”. It also notes that Iran’s prisons house “older [people], pregnant women, nursing mothers and their infants who suffer from a weak immune system due to their low socio-economic status and hygiene”.  
Subsequent letters repeat these requests and note the absence of any government response. In the latest letter obtained by Amnesty International, dated 5 July 2020, a senior official at the Prisons Organization states that they had received no response from the Ministry of Health and asks for an urgent meeting. 
State denial 
On 6 April 2020, Asghar Jahangir said in a media interview that Iran must be recognized internationally for its efforts to protect prisoners during the COVID-19 outbreak, and claimed that prisoners enjoy “better standards of health care and sanitation than they would in society”. He also claimed that medical teams had been stationed in prisons across the country to monitor the health of prisoners daily, and that prisoners who show symptoms are immediately tested and transferred to hospitals outside the prison if the results are positive. As a result, he claimed that there has not even been a single case of COVID-19 related death in prisons. 
However, the documents obtained by Amnesty International, together with the information received from prisoners and their families and independent human rights defenders, paint a far grimmer picture. 
Amnesty International has received distressing reports of prisoners displaying COVID-19 symptoms being neglected for days, even when they have pre-existing heart and lung problems, diabetes or asthma. When their conditions worsen, many are merely quarantined in a separate section in the prison or placed in solitary confinement, without access to adequate health care. 
At least one prisoner who tested positive, Zeyab Jalalian, has been forcibly disappeared since 25 June 2020; she had been on hunger strike from six days earlier over the authorities’ refusal to transfer her to a medical centre outside Shahr-e Rey prison (also known as Gharchak prison) in Tehran province for COVID-19 related treatment. 
Sometimes, as seen most recently in the case of ailing human rights defender and prisoner of conscience Narges Mohammadi, authorities have refused to inform prisoners of the results of their COVID-19 tests. 
Independent human rights groups with contacts inside prisons have reported more than 20 cases of suspected COVID-19 related deaths in prisons including from Ghezel Hesar prison (2) in Alborz province; Greater Tehran Central Penitentiary (6) and Shahr-e Rey prison (2) in Tehran Province; Urumieh prison (8) in West Azerbaijan province; Kamyaran (1) and Saqez (1) prisons in Kurdistan province; and Sepidar prison (1) in Khuzestan province.  
A request by WHO officials to visit Evin prison in Tehran was rejected in March 2020, according to media reports. 
Cruel and inhumane conditions 
The Iranian authorities announced that between late February and late May 2020, they had temporarily released around 128,000 prisoners on furlough and pardoned another 10,000 in response to the outbreak. On 15 July 2020, as COVID-19 cases spiked again, the spokesperson of the judiciary announced that the head of the judiciary had issued new guidelines to facilitate a second round of leaves.  
However, hundreds of prisoners of conscience have been excluded from these welcome measures, including human rights defenders, foreign and dual nationals, environmentalists, individuals detained due to their religious beliefs and people arbitrarily detained in connection with the November 2019 protests. The authorities have also continued to detain unjustly convicted protesters, dissidents, minority rights activists and human rights defenders to begin serving prison sentences. Some prisoners of conscience who had been granted leave in March 2020 have also been called back to prison. 
According to recent official statements, as of 13 June 2020, Iran’s prison population was around 211,000, two and half times more than the officially declared capacity of 85,000. In July of last year, Iran’s prison population was 240,000, according to officials. 
Other widely documented concerns in Iran’s prisons include lack of proper ventilation and air conditioning facilities, filthy and insufficient bathroom facilities, lack of adequate facilities and products for prisoners to wash their dishes and clothes and maintain personal hygiene, low water pressure in the showers, widespread insect infestations, insufficient potable water and low quality food, and a severe shortage of beds, meaning many prisoners have to sleep on the floor. 
Since the outbreak of the virus, in some prisons, prisoners have also complained about the authorities’ improper use of bleach to disinfect surfaces, exacerbating poor air quality and leading to severe coughs, chest tightness and asthma attacks. 
Amnesty International has previously documented the Iranian authorities’ deliberate denial of health care to prisoners of conscience and others held in relation to politically-motivated cases, putting their lives and health at grave risk. In some cases, the denial of health care was intended to punish, intimidate or humiliate prisoners or obtain forced “confessions”. 
“We once again call on Iranian authorities to urgently address overcrowding in prisons, including by immediately and unconditionally releasing all those detained for the peaceful exercise of their rights,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
“They must also consider releasing others, especially children, pre-trial detainees, and those who may be more at risk from the virus. Prisoners must have equal access to COVID-19 prevention, testing and treatment.” 
Amnesty International also calls on the Iranian authorities to ensure access to adequate food, water, health care, hygiene and bedding for all prisoners. They should end the use of torture and other ill-treatment, treat detainees with dignity and humanity, and allow international monitors, including the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, to conduct independent, unannounced inspections of prisons in line with international standards. 
Background 
Since March 2020, the appalling conditions in Iran’s prisons and concerns over the spread of the coronavirus have led to hunger strikes, protests, rioting and escape attempts in prisons across the country. The authorities have generally responded to the protests in prisons violently, using excessive or unnecessary force, and in some cases firing tear gas, metal pellets and live ammunition, resulting in deaths and injuries.

Their goal is to call everyone to justice who made decisions that led to the disaster on August 4, 2014.  
They also want the Province of British Columbia to suspend the company’s permit to pipe mine waste-water directly into Quesnel Lake. Since April, thousands of Amnesty activists have signed our petition to the BC government calling on them to pull the discharge pipes from Quesnel Lake.   
Scientists researching the impacts of the disaster on Quesnel Lake tell us the pressure is working: the province recently re-started a water testing group to investigate troubling reports of ongoing contamination of the lake.  
But more than ever, pressure is needed to protect Quesnel Lake from further contamination.  
Mount Polley Mining Corporation recently filed an appeal of its water discharge permit and is seeking to remove most of the conditions placed on it, such as ending water discharges by 2022. It sees no reason to stop using Quesnel Lake for its mining waste. 
 
Community groups, like the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake, are fighting back. They are calling on the province to suspend the company’s discharge permit and comply with a requirement that it research and develop better means of treating and discharging its waste-water. We will keep you informed of ways you can support this appeal process.  
Despite calls for accountability from two United Nations bodies and thousands of people around the world, the communities will mark another anniversary of corporate impunity this August 4. 
We celebrate the tenacity, courage and vision of the community activists who, six years on, continue to work tirelessly to seek justice and protect Quesnel Lake from further harm. Their work matters, and not just for their communities. When those responsible are finally held accountable for the human rights and environmental harms associated with the disaster, it will bring mining-affected communities one step closer to ending impunity for corporate human rights abuses. 
It could help make communities that host mining projects safer.  
 
Communities are not giving up and we are not giving up. The road to justice, especially for corporate human rights abuses, is often long and it is with humility and deep respect that we undertake this work of solidarity and accompaniment.

However, the Court ordered that its decision will only take effect after six months, in other words on January 22, 2021. 
In a letter to Prime Minister Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Freeland, Public Safety Minister Blair, Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Mendicino, and Minister of Justice and Attorney General Lametti, the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International and the Canadian Council of Churches have implored the government to: 
The Federal Court’s decision is based on the extensive evidence presented of wide-ranging and very serious human rights violations associated with immigration detention in the United States, and in particular of the actual experiences of people returned by Canada to the USA under the Safe Third Country Agreement.  
One of the applicants, Nedira Jemal Mustefa, was “immediately imprisoned” after being returned to the United States. She was detained for one month, including one week in solitary confinement which she described as a “a terrifying, isolating and psychologically traumatic experience.” Ms. Mustefa lost 15 pounds because her dietary requirements as a Muslim were not respected. She was “detained alongside people who had criminal convictions” and held in “freezing cold” conditions in which prisoners were “not allowed to use blankets during the day.” She “felt scared, alone, and confused at all times” and “did not know when [she] would be released, if at all.”  
Based on the evidence of Ms Mustefa, as well as of other individuals who had been detained, and lawyers and advocates who work with refugee claimants and migrants in detention centres and jails, the Court concluded that “detainees demonstrate both physical and psychological suffering because of detention, and a real risk that they will not be able to assert asylum claims.” 
The Court determined that “imprisonment flows automatically from a finding of ineligibility under the STCA” and noted that “failed claimants are detained without regard to their circumstances, moral blameworthiness, or their actions. They are detained often without a release on bond and without a meaningful process for review of their detention.”  
The Court considered the government’s position that without the Safe Third Country Agreement,  the numbers of refugee claimants arriving in Canada would rise. The Court’s conclusion, however, was that the “evidence offered by the [government] on this point is weak. In the past, Canada has demonstrated flexibility to adjust to fluctuations in refugee numbers in response to needs.” 
The government has been provided by the Court with six months grace before the ruling takes effect. There is no need for the government to wait – on the contrary, the government should move immediately to rectify this longstanding and very serious human rights violation. Every day that the rules remain in effect, more people risk being returned to face imprisonment and mistreatment. Similarly, the government should refrain from launching an appeal that will further prolong and protract this intolerable situation.  
By any measure, respect for the rights of refugee claimants in the United States at this time constitutes a human rights crisis, particularly when it comes to the prevalence, arbitrariness and cruel and inhumane conditions associated with immigration detention, which fall far below required international human rights standards.  Canada should not continue to be complicit in these deeply troubling human rights violations for another day, let alone for six months.   
There is no compelling or convincing evidence that implementing the court’s decision would give rise to increased numbers of refugees beyond Canada’s ability and resources to respond. What is most important is that we act immediately to uphold the Charter, respect our international human rights obligations and ensure the safety and dignity of refugees.  We note as well that if refugees are able to make claims for protection at official land border posts it will be manageable and feasible for the government to adopt measures that public health officials recommend as being necessary to address any concerns related to COVID-19. It will also bring an end to the crossings at Roxham Road. 
Canadians have been deeply troubled by the longstanding lack of respect for the rights of refugees and migrants in the United States, which has worsened precipitously in recent years. Embracing this ruling and moving immediately to suspend operation of the STCA provides an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of Canada’s commitment to refugee protection at a time when such leadership is in short supply and urgently needed around the world.   
In responding to the judgment, the government must choose between overall policy objectives and protecting individuals from “imprisonment or the deleterious effects of cruel and unusual detention conditions, solitary confinement, and the risk of refoulement”. The Court was clear that there is only one choice that is acceptable “in our free and democratic society”. The treatment that Ms. Mustefa experienced is sufficient to ‘shock the conscience’. We cannot continue to send people back to the United States knowing that they will be treated in ways that are fundamentally unjust, causing grave and lasting harm.

The report, Legacy of Terror: The Plight of Yezidi Child Survivors of ISIS, also addresses the urgent need to end the enforced separation of women and their children born of sexual violence by IS members. 
Between 2014 and 2017, IS committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, and what the UN describes as genocide against the Yezidi community in Iraq. 
The 56-page report reveals the extensive challenges now faced by the estimated 1,992 children who have returned to their families after being abducted, tortured, forced to fight, raped and subjected to numerous other horrendous human rights abuses by IS. 
“While the nightmare of their past has receded, hardships remain for these children. After enduring the horrors of war at an extremely young age, they now need urgent support from the national authorities in Iraq and the international community to build their future,” said Matt Wells, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues. 
“Survivors of horrific crimes, these children now face a legacy of terror. Their physical and mental health must be a priority in the years ahead if they are to fully reintegrate into their families and community.”  
Many child survivors have returned from IS captivity with debilitating long-term injuries, illnesses or physical impairments. The most common mental health conditions experienced by these children include post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. Symptoms and behaviours often displayed include aggression, flashbacks, nightmares, withdrawal from social situations, and severe mood swings. 
Physical and mental health crisis 
Humanitarian workers, mental health professionals and caregivers told Amnesty International about particular challenges for two groups of child survivors: former child soldiers, and girls subjected to sexual violence.  
Thousands of Yezidi boys captured by IS were starved, tortured and forced to fight. As a result, these former child soldiers are especially likely to suffer from serious health conditions or physical disabilities, such as lost arms or legs.  
Yezidi boys are often isolated upon their return, as their families and communities struggle to acknowledge their experiences during captivity. They have often been subjected to intense propaganda, indoctrination and military training, deliberately intended to erase their former identities, language, and names.  
Of the 14 former child soldiers interviewed, more than half told Amnesty International they had not received any form of support – whether psychosocial, health, financial, or otherwise – after their return. 
Sahir*, who was forcibly recruited at the age of 15, said: “I was forced to fight. I had to do it or die. I didn’t have any other option. It was out of my control. To survive, I did the fighting. It’s the worst thing that can happen to any human, the most degrading… [After returning from captivity] what I was looking for is just someone to care about me, some support, to tell me, ‘I am here for you’… This is what I have been looking for, and I have never found it.” 
Yezidi girls suffered a wide range of abuses in IS captivity, including sexual violence. Girl survivors of sexual violence suffer from a range of health issues, including traumatic fistulas, scarring, and difficulties conceiving or carrying a child to term. 
Randa*, a 14-year-old who was in IS captivity for five years, said: “I was a child when they made me marry. They made me suffer. I want my future to be better. I want IS to be held accountable for what they did to me.”   
One doctor, whose organization has provided medical and psychosocial care for hundreds of women and girl survivors, said that almost every girl she had treated between the ages of nine and 17 had been raped or subjected to other sexual violence. Amnesty International found that existing services and programmes for survivors of sexual violence have largely neglected girls.  
“These children were systematically subjected to the horror of life under IS, and now they’ve been left to pick up the pieces. They must be given the support they desperately need to rebuild their lives as part of the Yezidi community’s future,” said Matt Wells. 
Women with children born of sexual violence 
Yezidi women and girls gave birth to hundreds of children as a result of sexual enslavement by IS fighters. Many of these children have largely been denied a place in the Yezidi community due to a number of factors, including the stance of the Yezidi Supreme Spiritual Council and the current legal framework in Iraq, which mandates that any child of an ‘unknown’ or Muslim father must be registered as Muslim. 
Several women interviewed by Amnesty International said they were pressured, coerced or even deceived into leaving their children behind, causing severe mental anguish. These women were also falsely assured that they would be able to visit or reunite with their children at a later stage. All of the women interviewed who were separated from their children said they had no contact with or access to them. They said they felt unable to speak with their families or community about wanting to reunite with their children, due to fears for their own safety.  
Janan*, 22, said: “I want to tell [our community] and everyone in the world, please accept us, and accept our children… I didn’t want to have a baby from these people. I was forced to have a son. I would never ask to be reunited with his father, but I need to be reunited with my son.” 
Hanan*, 24, whose daughter was taken from her, said: “My feeling is the same feeling as all the other mothers [in the same situation]. We have all thought about killing ourselves, or tried to do it… We are human, we have our rights, and we want our children to be with us. Whatever we experienced with IS, we are going through something worse now. We need a solution.” 
Amnesty International is calling for international organizations such as the UNHCR to prioritize and fast-track these women and children for resettlement or humanitarian relocation, with the co-operation of the national authorities and foreign governments. 
“These women were enslaved, tortured and subjected to sexual violence. They should not suffer any further punishment. They need to be reunited with their children, and any future separations must be prevented. They must be offered the opportunity of international resettlement or relocation together with their children, given the enormous risks they face in Iraq,” said Matt Wells. 
Access to education and other concerns 
Yezidi child survivors were deprived of formal schooling during their years in captivity. Many now miss out on available programmes for accelerated learning, either because they are unaware they exist or because they are discouraged by excessive bureaucracy. As a result, many child survivors opt out of the education system entirely. However, experts interviewed by Amnesty International agreed that attending school is essential in helping child survivors overcome their trauma.  
Nahla*, a 16-year-old survivor, said: “After I returned back to school, things became more normal, and I felt better. You need school to have a future.” 
Many Yezidi child survivors have returned speaking Arabic instead of Kurdish, preventing them from reintegrating fully with their families and community. Already impoverished, many families are also in severe debt after having to pay tens of thousands of US dollars as ransom to secure their children’s release. 
“Ahead of the sixth anniversary of the IS assault against Yezidis, the national authorities in Iraq and the international community must do all they can to ensure full reparation for the violations of these children’s rights, and to provide them with the support they are entitled to,” said Matt Wells. 
Methodology  
Amnesty International visited the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 17 to 27 February 2020, and interviewed 29 survivors taken captive by IS as children; 25 family members who care for child survivors; and 68 experts and officials, including doctors, psychotherapists, staff members of NGOs, UN officials, and government officials.

“While this story has had a happy ending, such potential tragedies could be avoided if Malaysian and Thai authorities allowed Rohingya refugees to disembark from boats instead of callously pushing them back out to sea.   
“The situation of remaining Rohingya refugees still stranded at sea for months is desperate. ASEAN governments must immediately launch co-ordinated search and rescue missions for remaining survivors; allow all boats carrying refugees and migrants to land safely in the nearest country; and meet their humanitarian needs. Unless this happens, more lives will inevitably be lost.”   
Background   
On 26 July 2020, the Malaysian coastguard reported that 24 Rohingya were missing, after they had tried to swim to shore on Langkawi. Only one reportedly reached land. Later that evening, 26 Rohingya were found alive on an island off Langkawi, including men, women and children. As many as hundreds of other Rohingya may still be at sea on a larger “mother boat” in critical condition. Such boats have been pushed away by both Malaysian and Thai authorities.   
In recent months, hundreds of Rohingya refugees have been stranded at sea for weeks and months, and scores are believed to have died. Fleeing violence in Myanmar and poor conditions in Bangladesh refugee camps, many have made attempts to reach Southeast Asia, with boats often the only option. In most cases, Southeast Asian governments have blocked them from landing safely and seeking asylum, and failed to launch search and rescue operations, against their obligations under international law and regional commitments.  
In June, 269 Rohingya were detained on arrival in Langkawi after their boat broke down. At the time, the Malaysian Maritime Agency said they had been transferred from a larger “mother boat” on which dozens of people were believed to have died and been thrown into the sea during a journey lasting months.

His detention was the result of the Australian government’s cruel and unlawful asylum policies, which involved sending thousands of asylum seekers to Pacific Island nations of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and Nauru. Amnesty International’s research found that the conditions for people trapped in these centres amounts to torture under international law. 
Behrouz gained a reputation as a journalist and human rights defender by talking about violations in the press and social media throughout his ordeal. He published over 100 news articles from detention, including his autobiographical book, No Friend But The Mountains, published in July 2018 while he remained detained. 
Executive Director of Amnesty International Aotearoa New Zealand, Meg de Ronde said, “Today is a day for celebration. Today is the first day in Behrouz’s life that he is free. Free from the persecution of the Iranian authorities simply because he is Kurdish. Free from the deliberate cruelty of the Australian government. Free from the physical and mental abuse of the PNG guards. Free from the crushing injustice of being denied his rights. Free to heal. Free to be who he is. Free to become whoever he wants to be.” 
Amnesty activists have campaigned for years alongside coalition partners and the refugees detained on Manus Island and Nauru to end this humanitarian crisis.

Pride is a celebration of 2SLGBTQ+ communities. Every year these communities host events to centre identities that are often pushed to the margins of society by creating spaces by and for themselves. 
Usually, there are events around the world from large public parades and parties to smaller community gatherings. COVID-19 has forced many Pride organizers to cancel this year’s in-person events and look to alternative ways of celebrating. Regardless of its form, what remains at the foundation of the Pride movement is protest and a fight for human rights. 
 
Pride as we understand it today owes its beginnings to a revolt against police violence led by Black and brown trans women, sex workers and drug users at Stonewall Inn in New York City. Because of systemic oppression and discrimination, 2SLGBTQ+ people were considered a threat to heterosexual society.  Police surveilled and often broke up gatherings by raining physical violence upon queer and trans people at and around gay venues in the city. 
There had been different riots and revolts before Stonewall but one fateful night in 1969, the people fought back against the police and forced the officers to retreat. To commemorate the event a year later, the community led a march to Central Park called the Christopher Street Liberation March. Thus, the Pride parade was born. It caught on and cities around the world began putting on their own. 
 
Three people who have been met with long-overdue acknowledgment for their tireless organizing against injustice, including at Stonewall, are Black and brown trans women Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera and Miss Major. 
Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera were both community organizers, sex workers and trans women who organized against homelessness. Miss Major also has a long history of organizing and community building for the safety of queer and trans folks focusing on the injustices Black and brown trans people experience. 
Violence is pervasive against trans women of colour, and particularly against Black trans women and gender non-conforming folks. Due to long-entrenched stereotypes and discrimination, trans women experience high rates of violence and murder. Policing institutions have come under scrutiny for their lack of attention to cases of violence against trans and gender non-conforming folks and, in some cases, their active violence against these groups. In the United States in 2020 alone, at least 16 trans women or gender non-conforming people have been murdered. Many were Black trans women. 
The impact of colonization, imperialism, and white supremacy in erasing and suppressing global queer histories and identities cannot be left out of this conversation either. Policing sexuality and gender is one of the ways colonialism operates. For example, Two Spirit people existed before and continue to exist after the colonial state of Canada was created but experience the violence of colonialism, residential schools, and imposed religious values and beliefs. 
The police in Canada have a long history of surveillance and repression of queer and trans people. Operation Soap in the 1980’s was a coordinated police raid on bathhouses in Toronto resulting in mass arrests of gay men who frequented the venue. In many ways we are still fighting against the surveillance, policing and oppression of 2SLGBTQ+ identities, even though today we might legally have some protections in Canada. For example, conversion therapy is still a topic of debate, 2SLGBTQ+ youth experience high levels of homelessness, and funding for queer and trans health and support programs is insufficient. 
  
Pride’s origins are much different than the often-whitewashed version we see in advertisements from Pride’s corporate sponsors or often Pride organizations themselves. It is also common for the media to portray queer and trans people as white and ignore the fact that a significant proportion of members of 2SLGBTQ+ communities are Black, Indigenous, or People of Colour (BIPOC). While the media landscape is changing, there are still misconceptions about what queer and trans people look like. 
The current global protests against police violence are an opportunity to bring into focus how much institutional violence people with intersecting identities face and, at the same time, how much work Black and Indigenous people and people of colour have done to advance 2SLGBTQ+ rights from before Stonewall to today. The Black Lives Matter movement in Canada led a worldwide conversation about police violence and the intersections of identities that are so often erased and cemented an understanding of the pervasive nature of anti-Blackness in all areas of society. Black people are queer people, too. Queer people are Black people, too. 
In 2020 we are witnessing a stark picture of the intersections of many systemic oppressions: police violence, white supremacy, anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, the murders of trans and gender nonconforming people, inequities related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing epidemic of opioid-related deaths. 
Systemic oppressions are interconnected and rely on each other. We cannot fight for the rights of 2SLGBTQ+ people without also fighting for the rights of Black people, sex workers, drug users, migrants, low-income folks, people who are homeless or anyone who experiences marginalization. Anyone can be queer or trans and anyone can have multiple identities. The decriminalization of drugs and sex work is central to the fight for queer and trans rights and against police violence. Much police violence is directed against queer and trans folks, many who are BIPOC, in the context of policing sex work and drug use—often a result of discrimination and exclusion from society. 
We need to imagine and build a better future. We need to shift funding from policing to ensuring that people have what they need to live full, healthy and safe lives. We must fight for racial justice at the same time as 2SLGBTQ+ rights because they are intertwined. Pride might look different this year, but it is arguably the most authentic Pride since Stonewall.

Moreover,...","The decision of Colombia’s Ministry of Defense to begin ground-spraying operations in coca plantations in some areas of the country could result in human rights violations in the campesino farming communities that depend on coca for their livelihoods, Amnesty International said today. Moreover, beginning a process of forced eradication of crops could exacerbate the situations of conflict in the country, leaving rural communities in an even more dangerous situation, particularly for social leaders in the country.  
“Operations to forcibly eradicate coca crops in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are a death sentence for rural communities,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. “Spraying illicit crops does not only mean robbing rural communities of their only livelihood amid the pandemic, but it could also destroy legal crops, an importance source of food. In addition, these operations expose a population with limited access to health services to contagion.” 
The COVID-19 pandemic requires a response from the Colombian government that is coordinated, coherent, comprehensive and respects human rights. Entering rural community areas in order to carry out operations to forcibly eradicate crops without their due consent, exposing them to possible infection with COVID-19 and affecting their way of life could result in human rights violations in addition to exacerbating the humanitarian crisis faced by many rural communities.  
The Committee for Social Integration in Catatumbo (CISCA) has reported to Amnesty International the difficulties posed by the measures taken by the government to mitigate the pandemic. The members of this organization believe that the government must guarantee the rights of rural communities in the context of social isolation and immediately stop the deployment of operations for the forced eradication of coca crops that infringe upon the food sovereignty of the population.  
“Waking up every day in this country, particularly in areas like Catatumbo, requires creativity and bravery; creativity to guess where the fight will be that day and bravery to survive physically, morally and culturally,” said CISCA.  
Amnesty International calls on the Colombian authorities to urgently take adequate measures to guarantee the rights of rural communities, including their rights to health, water and food. Furthermore, they must implement a state presence other than the military, stopping coca eradication operations and respecting the provisions of the Peace Agreement.   
Additional information: 
Despite the health emergency declared due to COVID-19 and the state of economic, social and ecological emergency throughout the country, and requests from several social organizations to suspend the operations for the forced eradication of coca during the emergency, operations have continued to be carried out in at least seven departments in the country since the government ordered mandatory preventative isolation due to the pandemic on 25 March. 
Local organizations have reported excessive use of force by military personnel, and the Inter-Church Justice and Peace Commission has reported that the police and the army have carried out these operations without taking into account health and hygiene protocols to avoid the spread of COVID-19.  
On 11 July, the Colombian Ministry of Defense informed municipal governments in the Catatumbo region, including Convención, Teorama, Acarí and Sardinata, that the National Police’s Anti-Narcotics Directorate would begin ground-spraying operations in coca plantations on 20 July in areas authorised by the national environmental licensing authority.

“We asked the Court to look at the impact of the Safe Third Country Agreement on women, men and children who can’t find safety in the U.S. and to assess the legality of Canada sending them back to detention and potential deportation to persecution,” said Dorota Blumczynska, CCR President. “The Court could hardly fail to be moved by the testimonies of the appalling experiences of people in the US immigration detention system, after Canada closed the doors on them. Their experiences show us – and convinced the Court – that the U.S. cannot be considered a safe country for refugees.” 
The Court found that sending refugee claimants back to the US violates their Charter right to liberty and security of the person because many of them are arbitrarily detained in the US in immigration detention centres or county jails, often in atrocious conditions and in clear contravention of international standards. 
The Court has suspended the effect of its decision for six months to leave time for Parliament to respond. Given that the Court has clearly set out the ways in which detention in the US violates people’s fundamental rights, the organizations call on the Government of Canada to immediately stop sending people back to the US under the Safe Third Country Agreement, and not to appeal the decision. 
“While the Federal Court has provided the government with six months leeway, it is imperative that Canada immediately end the return of claimants to the US,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General, Amnesty International Canada. “The Safe Third Country Agreement has been the source of grave human rights violations for many years, unequivocally confirmed in this ruling. That cannot be allowed to continue one more day; and is of even greater concern now given the prevalence of COVID-19 in immigration detention in the United States. Canada should further revoke the Order in Council which practically closes the border to refugee claimants as part of Canada’s COVID-response.” 
“The Canadian Council of Churches has long advocated that every human being who is physically present in Canada has a legal right to life, liberty and security of person under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms,” said Peter Noteboom, General Secretary of The Canadian Council of Churches. “The U.S.-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement stands in the way of guaranteeing those legal rights.”  
Under the Safe Third Country Agreement, implemented in 2004, refugees who present themselves at a Canada-U.S. border post seeking to make a refugee claim in Canada are, with limited exceptions, denied access to the Canadian refugee system and immediately returned to the United States. Since the Agreement does not apply to people who cross into Canada other than at an official border post, people in need of safety in Canada have been crossing in significant numbers in between ports of entry. Withdrawing from the Agreement would not only ensure that Canada meets its legal obligations, but would also allow people to present themselves in an orderly way at ports of entry, ending irregular crossings.

As this powerful system travelled...","The history of colonization around the world is a story about control of land and perceived resources: the juggernaut of colonial power moving its way from territory to territory, continent to continent, claiming lands, resources, and people across the globe. 
As this powerful system travelled around and gobbled up people to enslave, it also gobbled up the land that had been cleared of its rightful caretakers, land that was rich in quantity, quality and economic resources both above and below the soil. The two processes are connected: removing humans through whatever means, including forced displacement, labour, social collapse and infection; and asserting ownership over territory through violence, edicts, and renaming. All to gain economic, geographic, and political power. 
In the last few months, there have been several examples of violence against Indigenous, Black, and Afro-Indigenous people in this country by police departments and the RCMP. Some chiefs of police and RCMP leaders, including Commissioner Brenda Lucki, have publicly asserted that systemic racism is not a problem in their organizations. Their statements and their refusal to critically examine and address racism in their own forces show a lack of fundamental understanding of systemic racism, the intent behind the creation of police forces in Canada as well as a blatant dismissal of decades of inquests, inquiries, royal commissions, and external investigative reports into police conduct, including Amnesty International’s intervention at the Ipperwash Inquiry. 
Despite Commissioner Lucki’s initial denial and clumsy about-face on the issue of systemic racism within the RCMP, a recent poll suggests that 75% of Canadians believe there is systemic racism within the country’s national police force. Given the RCMP’s history, this should not be surprising. The organization’s purpose has been and continues to be enforcing the imposed laws of a settler-colonial state. 
State violence is not just created by policing. It includes racial laws, inequitable provision of services, intentional neglect and exclusion, social bias, and the ways institutional policies impact the well-being of Black, Indigenous and People of Colour. State violence includes the child and family welfare system, the education system, representation in governments at all levels, and healthcare, among many others. Some Premiers have denied the existence of systemic racism in a very similar manner to heads of police forces.  
Due to the work of Cindy Blackstock through the First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the federal government refused and failed to provide equal services to First Nation children for decades. If we look at the work by Black parents and organizations advocating for their children, we see the same discrimination: lack of funding, lack of training, lack of support. It would be hard to make an argument that Canadian society is not intrinsically biased, racist, and oppressive. Canada is, by definition, a settler-colonial society. 
Brief history of the RCMP and Indigenous people  
The government of John A. MacDonald established the North West Mounted Police (later the RCMP) to facilitate the transfer of Indigenous territory to the federal government. This was enforced by displacing Indigenous peoples from their traditional territories through forced relocation, starvation, and war. The government then created a pass system whereby Indian Agents determined whether a First Nations person could leave the reserve. This law was in place until 1940 and relied on police and RCMP to enforce it. The RCMP was also an active agent in ensuring Indigenous children were taken from their families and placed in Indian Residential Schools violating many human rights.  The RCMP is an institution founded to protect and enforce white supremacy and has much to reckon with and account for before any attempts at reform can be legitimately undertaken. 
Police forces in Canada do not have a better record in their relationships with Indigenous people and communities. Proportionally, Indigenous and Black people are far more likely to die in a police shooting than white people. As journalist Brandi Morin has shown, police kill 1.5 out of every 100,000 Indigenous people, and 0.5 out of every 100,000 Black people. Compared to the general Canadian rate of 0.3 per 100,000 and the rate for white Canadians of 0.13 per 100,000, the disparity is stark. To be clear, nobody should be killed by the police. 
Brief history of Canada policing and criminalizing Black people 
The experiences of Black people in Canada, including enslavement, are often omitted from school curricula, museum exhibits, and official stories, except to highlight Canada’s position as the beacon of freedom at the end of the Underground Railroad.  This perpetuates the often common misperception that anti-Black racism is ‘not as bad’ here as in the United States when it is actually baked into our society. Black people in Canada have experienced enslavement, criminalization, immigration bans, and discrimination resulting in underservice and exclusion in education, housing, healthcare, and employment. Many Black Canadians have been pushed to Canada from other countries ravaged by colonialism, and their experiences in Canada are similar each with their own distinctions. There are global threads of white supremacy, violence, exploitative resource extraction, and disposability of Black people that run parallel to the experiences of Indigenous people on this colonized land. 
Living in Canada as a Black person comes with the imposed presumption of criminality, manifesting in the surveillance and over-policing of Black individuals and communities, unjust encounters with police officers, and introduction into a system which treats Black people more harshly for the same crimes and results in a disproportionate number of Black people in prisons. Indigenous people are also disproportionately represented in the prison system for similar reasons. 
These struggles are connected and continue today 
The impacts of colonialism and white supremacy continue to similarly affect Black and Indigenous people in Canada today, albeit in distinct ways. Both are criminalized by wider society as the reason for their own experiences of racism and even their deaths. Both are systemically excluded from and surveilled/overpoliced in public space, excluded from access to education, jobs, housing and food security. The social determinants of health are placed far out of reach for many Black and Indigenous people in Canada. The convergence of criminalization, systemic racism, and frequent interactions with police lays the foreground for violence and death for Black people and Indigenous people alike. 
The media pitting Black & Indigenous people against each other is wrong 
Black liberation and Indigenous sovereignty are inextricably linked. The history of Afro-Indigenous people in Canada is often erased, yet there are many people who are Black and Indigenous and there are longstanding relationships between the many different communities. In a country built on white supremacy, it is a threat to the order of society for oppressed people to work in solidarity with each other because this poses a real challenge to power. A common tactic of those in power is to pit different groups against each other as if each were the problem. We see this in authorless newspaper headlines like “Let’s Save Some Outrage for Treatment of Indigenous People”. We see this in the ways we have been socialized to believe in a scarcity of rights or resources and a quick regression to “what about us?” when one group seems to be making civil and human rights advances. We can wholly reject the idea that there is only so much freedom to go around and work together for liberation for all. The answer to ending police violence against Black people and Indigenous people does not lie only in the smaller objectives like municipal governments shifting money from police budgets to social supports, it lies in dismantling whole systems designed to keep us apart and keep us without true power, sovereignty, and agency. 
We can do better 
What can we do to make Canada an anti-racist state? We could follow the lead of individuals and organizations who have been advocating for justice for years. We can build on the ideas and actions of those who have come before us and create a new society and way of interacting with each other that respects the rights and autonomy of Black and Indigenous people and honours their futures. We already mentioned Cindy Blackstock, but there are others like Larissa Crawford, Zanana Akande, Grand Chief Wilton Littlechild, Lillian Dyck, Anthony Morgan, Sandy Hudson, and Robyn Maynard among many others, who show us the way forward. 
The federal government could start by paying the damages to First Nations children ordered by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, governments could immediately make restorative changes to their funding mechanisms and make restorative justice a priority. We can call for the removal of police officers from schools, ensure that all children receive the same access to quality and culturally appropriate education, and push governments to strengthen social programs to respond to the needs and priorities of communities. Of the groups advocating for defunding and reducing the scope of police services, Black Lives Matter Canada also promotes the creation of alternatives including harm reduction, decriminalizing sex-work, and secure housing options. 
Black and Indigenous communities know their own histories and priorities for the future. They have been building and advocating for solutions for a long time. The most supportive work that could be done in collaboration, would be to empower, echo and fund the suggestions and demands of Black and Indigenous people for how to build a society that respects human rights and ensures that all people thrive and create better futures.

The law is dangerously vague and broad: virtually anything could be deemed a threat to “national security” under its provisions, and it can apply to anyone on the planet. 
The Chinese authorities forced the law through without any accountability or transparency: it was passed just weeks after it was first announced, bypassing Hong Kong’s local legislature, and the text was kept secret from the public and allegedly even the Hong Kong government until after it was enacted. 
Here are 10 reasons why everyone should be worried about this new law: 
Under this new law “secession”, “subversion”, “terrorism” and “collusion with foreign forces” incur maximum penalties of life imprisonment. But these offences are so broadly defined they can easily become catch-all offences used in politically motivated prosecutions with potentially heavy penalties. 
The United Nations human rights office and expert bodies have already repeatedly expressed concerns about the national security law, stating the broadly worded legislation can lead to “discriminatory or arbitrary interpretation and enforcement which could undermine human rights protection”. 
The central and Hong Kong governments have long accused individuals and civil society organizations of being steered by “foreign forces” in their activities, such as organizing and attending peaceful protests, receiving donations and criticizing the government. Anyone who participates in these activities is now potentially at risk of being charged for “colluding with foreign forces” and other new “crimes”. 
On the mainland, Amnesty International has documented the Chinese government’s routine use of “subversion” charges to jail journalists, lawyers, scholars and activists. In 2017, a court in China sentenced dissident Wu Gan to eight years’ imprisonment, citing his criticism against the government on the internet as proof of “subversion” of state power.  
Immediately after the law’s passage, authorities started to use it to crack down on legitimate and peaceful expression. 
People were arrested for possessing flags, stickers and banners with political slogans. Police and officials have also claimed that slogans, T-shirts, songs and pieces of white paper could endanger national security and lead to criminal prosecution. 
Two days after the law was passed, the Hong Kong government declared that “Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times”, a common political slogan during last year’s protests, “connotes ‘Hong Kong independence”, or separating Hong Kong from China, and effectively forbade its use. 
These examples show how the law and its usage contravene international human rights laws and standards. These stipulate that peacefully expressing one’s opinion about political systems does not constitute a threat to national security. 
 
In the name of national security, the law gives the Chinese central and Hong Kong governments new expansive powers to oversee and manage schools, social organizations, media and the internet in Hong Kong. 
The media industry has expressed concerns about the law’s potential impact on press freedom in Hong Kong. The New York Times, for example, has already decided to relocate some of their Hong Kong staff to South Korea. 
Many worry that measures similar to those in mainland China will be rolled out to control foreign journalists. Currently, journalists must obtain accreditation from the Chinese government before they can legally work in mainland China.  
The Hong Kong government has also attempted to excessively restrict the rights of students to enjoy freedom of expression on campus. The local Secretary of Education said students should not sing songs, chant slogans or conduct activities that contain political messages. Even discussing political issues in classrooms could now create risks. 
The law also gives law enforcement agencies the power to remove online content or obtain user data without a judicial warrant. In response to these new and unfettered executive powers, major online platforms such as WhatsApp, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Google have suspended processing requests from the Hong Kong government for user data. 
Under the national security law, suspects could be removed to mainland China, handled within the mainland’s criminal justice system and tried under mainland law. This is the same prospect that sparked the series of large-scale protests from mid-2019. 
Being charged with a national security crime on the mainland can lead to arbitrary or even secret detention. Those charged might not be able to contact their families and might be left without access to lawyers of their choice if they are placed under “residential surveillance in a designated location“ – a measure that enables investigators to hold individuals outside the formal detention system for periods up to six months. As is often the case, detainees held in this way are at great risk of torture and other ill-treatment. Human rights lawyer Li Heping was beaten, drugged and subjected to electric shocks when he was secretly detained during the 2015 lawyers’ crackdown. 
The wording of the Hong Kong national security law asserts jurisdiction over people who are not residents of Hong Kong and have never even set foot there. This means anyone on Earth, regardless of nationality or location, can technically be deemed to have violated this law and face arrest and prosecution if they are in a Chinese jurisdiction, even for transit. Accused foreign nationals who don’t permanently reside in Hong Kong can be deported even before any trial or verdict. 
Social media companies, for example, can be asked to remove content deemed unacceptable by the Chinese government, even if these were posted outside of Hong Kong or if the companies’ offices and servers are located in other countries. 
Under the new law, investigating authorities can search properties, restrict or prohibit travel, freeze or confiscate assets, censor online content and engage in covert surveillance, including intercepting communications – all without a court order. 
The authorities can also require information from organizations and individuals, even if the information in question may be self-incriminating. Anyone failing to comply can be fined or imprisoned. This essentially removes for national security cases a person’s right to silence, an essential component of the presumption of innocence. 
The rights to remain silent under questioning and not to be compelled to testify against oneself are generally recognized in international human rights law and standards and lie at the heart of the notion of a fair trial. They are broad, apply during questioning by the police and trial and for any crime, regardless of severity, and prohibit any form of coercion, whether direct or indirect, physical or psychological. 
 
The Chinese central government is setting up an Office for Safeguarding National Security in the heart of Hong Kong. The office and its staff do not fall under Hong Kong’s jurisdiction. This means any actions, including their operation in the city, are not reviewable by local courts or subject to local laws. Office personnel are not subject to inspection, search or detention by local law enforcement in Hong Kong. The office and its staff in effect enjoy complete immunity, regardless of what crimes or human rights violations they are accused of, in violation of the victims’ rights to justice, to establishment of the truth and to receive full reparations. 
Mainland China’s national security officers have routinely violated the rights of individuals facing national security charges with impunity. These agencies systematically monitor, harass, intimidate and detain human rights defenders and dissidents, with evidence of torture and other ill-treatment. 
The Hong Kong government has set up another new body, the Committee for Safeguarding National Security, with a delegate from the Chinese central government to “advise” it. 
The committee has the power to hand-pick personnel in law enforcement and prosecution to handle national security cases. Budget and appointment of personnel related to safeguarding national security will also bypass legislative scrutiny. The Chief Executive can appoint judges to handle national security cases in a way that appears to undermine judicial independence. 
Under the new law, the committee does not have to disclose its work. Decisions made by the committee are not subject to review by the courts. 
In addition, the Hong Kong Police Force has established a new national security division that can conduct covert surveillance without judicial control.   
This arguably means the public cannot use legal procedures as a check against abuse of power and breaches of Hong Kong’s legal obligations, including human rights obligations under international and domestic law. 
 
Although the national security law includes a general guarantee to respect human rights, including core human rights treaties like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, other provisions in the law could override these protections. 
The law grants immunities and vast exemptions to the national security institutions and their personnel and in fact states explicitly that it trumps any Hong Kong laws in case of conflict. This means that, on the face of it, the national security law could be seen to negate any existing human rights protection in the territory. 
China’s own national security law has a similar provision on respect for human rights, yet this has provided little or no protection to people targeted: there are lawyers, scholars, journalists, pastors and NGO workers who have all been convicted of national security offences simply for exercising their freedom of expression and defending human rights. 
The Hong Kong Chief Executive has repeatedly justified limiting human rights in the name of national security, including in ways that would violate international standards. 
This draconian law is so vague it prevents anyone from knowing how and when they might transgress it and has consequently had an instant chilling effect across the territory. 
Many Hongkongers who were regularly sharing news online about the protests since June 2019 have shut down their social media accounts for fear of violating the law. Shops and restaurants that had previously posted banners and stickers in support of the protest movement removed them even before the law was in force. Within days, public libraries started to sort out books on “sensitive” issues and authored by activists critical of the government. 
One hour after the law passed, prominent activist Joshua Wong withdrew from Demosisto, the pro-democracy group he led. Later, Demosisto announced its disbandment, and another key member, Nathan Law, announced that he had left Hong Kong. Law was worried that continuing his international advocacy work in Hong Kong could pose an imminent threat to his personal safety. 
Within one week after the enactment of the law, at least seven politically active groups disbanded. 
The Hong Kong national security law has failed to genuinely protect national security while safeguarding human rights. The consequences are grave – the undefined nature of key aspects of the law has created fear among people in Hong Kong, as no one knows what may constitute an offence of “endangering national security” and, hence, put them at risk of criminal prosecution, removal to the mainland or deportation from the territory. 
It is recognized that every government has the right and duty to protect its citizens and that some countries have specific security concerns. But these may never be used as an excuse to deny people the right to express different political views or to exercise their other human rights as protected by international legal standards. It is quite clear that the Hong Kong national security law is another example of a government using the concept of “national security” to repress political opposition, with significant risks for human rights defenders, critical media reporting and civil society at large.

Highlighting the lack of services available for child survivors of sexual violence and other violations, and calling for an urgent increase in international funding and dedicated services for children, Angelina Jolie’s remarks cited Amnesty International’s research: 
“Many children were murdered, but nearly 2,000 have returned. Many suffer from post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. 
“They experience flashbacks and recurrent nightmares that are typical for children who have experienced trauma and abuse. 
“Many of the children witnessed the murder of their relatives, and the rape of their mothers.” 
She added: “If we are not able to live up to our promise of a survivor-centred approach for Yezidi children, who make up just one relatively small group of survivors, then how many more children and young adults are suffering in silence at the global level?” 
Angelina Jolie urged the Security Council to live up to their promises to survivors of conflict-related sexual violence, saying: “We have to be prepared to admit where we have failed, and do the hard work to support survivors, change laws and attitudes and bring perpetrators to account, over many years…These are all promises that must be kept.” 
On 30 July, Amnesty International will release Legacy Of Terror: The Plight of Yezidi Child Survivors of ISIS. It documents the experiences of children who were abducted, enslaved, tortured, forced to fight, raped and subjected to numerous other horrendous human rights abuses. 
The report highlights how the national authorities and international community are failing to meet these child survivors’ rights and needs related to physical and mental health, education and civil documentation. It also reveals new findings on the situation of Yezidi women who gave birth to children as a result of sexual violence by IS members during their captivity. 
“Angelina Jolie was absolutely right to flag the woeful deficiencies in support for child survivors of sexual violence and other horrors inflicted during war. Coming almost six years on from IS’s onslaught on the Yezidi community, our upcoming report will highlight that, even if the atrocities are in the past, the trauma is still very much present for children brutalized by the conflict,” said Matt Wells, Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues at Amnesty International. 
Embargoed copies of the report and press release will be available on 23 July.

G20 Finance Ministers convening on 18-19 July should commit to cancelling the debt of the world’s poorest countries, scaling up investments in health and social protections, and phasing out fossil fuels, to ensure a just and sustainable recovery from the pandemic.  
“COVID-19 has exposed the glaring inequalities that exist in our world. If we are to build resilience to future crises, we need to make long-term structural changes that will require courage and leadership from G20 countries,” said Julie Verhaar, Amnesty International’s Acting Secretary General. 
“The flawed priorities of the rich and powerful have led us to a state of global emergency. G20 countries must break with the past by investing in people and human rights, leading the way to a just, sustainable and inclusive recovery.” 
Debt cancellation  
Amnesty International is calling on the G20 to cancel the debt owed by the world’s poorest countries for at least the next two years, freeing up resources for countries to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The poorest 77 countries will spend nearly $85 billion in debt repayments in 2020 and 2021. About 40% of this is owed to rich countries, and the remainder to international institutions and private lenders. According to Jubilee Debt Campaign, 64 countries spend more on debt repayments than on public healthcare. 
In April, the G20 committed to suspending up to $12 billion of debt payments for 77 countries in 2020 – but states seeking this offer will still be obliged to pay this money back, with interest, in future years.  
“It should be unthinkable that any country would spend more money on debt repayments than healthcare in the face of a pandemic. The current G20 plan not only falls short of what is needed to respond right now, it also piles up problems that will prevent countries recovering in the future,” said Julie Verhaar.  
“Debt repayments should never take precedence over efforts to ensure people’s human rights. The G20 must ensure that the world’s poorest countries are not locked into a vicious cycle of debt, ill-health and economic paralysis.” 
Under international human rights law, wealthier states including the G20 countries have an obligation to assist countries that are struggling to mobilize adequate funding to respond to the pandemic. 
Amnesty International is also calling for debt cancellation to be accompanied by robust transparency and accountability mechanisms in all donor and recipient countries, to ensure that money freed up is not lost to corruption or wasteful expenditure. Debt cancellation must be additional to other forms of financial assistance, and not merely diverted from other existing areas of aid. 
UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated last month that a large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response, amounting to at least 10 percent of global GDP, is needed to address the impact of COVID-19. 
Inclusive recovery and climate justice 
At their last meeting in April, G20 Finance Ministers committed “to support[ing] an environmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery”, consistent with the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development.   
Such a recovery must include investment in health, a new deal for social protection, and investment in sectors that deliver green and decent jobs. 
However, in the last few months several countries, such as the US, UK and Russia have allowed fossil fuel companies, the aviation industry and other carbon-polluting companies to benefit from economic stimulus measures, such as tax rebates and loans. These have largely been granted with no conditions attached, meaning that these industries can continue to function and even expand without having to commit to reducing emissions or using the government support to just support workers. 
Given the size of their economies and their contribution to the climate crisis, G20 states must lead in adopting stimulus packages and recovery measures that facilitate the transition to a zero-carbon economy, foster a resilient society and put people and their human rights – especially those most affected by the transition – at the centre. 
This means refraining from any unconditional bailouts to fossil fuel and aviation companies, and investing instead in renewable energy produced in a manner consistent with human rights. G20 states must ensure all workers and communities dependent on sectors affected by the transition to a zero-carbon economy are supported in obtaining green and decent jobs and protecting an adequate standard of living. 
“Unless there is rapid action to tackle the climate crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the looming threats facing humanity,” said Julie Verhaar. 
Background 
COVID-19 has dictated that the G20 meeting on 18-19 July is held virtually.  
The vast majority of states, including 17 G20 members, are party to human rights treaties that include the obligation to respond to requests for international cooperation and assistance, such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR).  
General Comment 14 of the CESCR states that, given that some diseases are easily transmissible beyond the frontiers of a state, the international community has a collective responsibility to intervene to address this problem. Economically developed states have a special responsibility and interest to assist poorer states in this regard.  
The UN Guiding Principles on foreign debt and human rights state that external debt repayments should not interfere with recipient governments’ efforts to realise their core rights obligations, including with respect to economic and social rights such as health, social protection and livelihoods, and should be renegotiated with creditors accordingly.

Last year, he was a student at a university in the capital city, Santiago. While he was in his psychology classes, Gustavo knew that people all over the country were grumbling about the increase in bus, subway and train tickets. The prices of other items had already gone up, so some just couldn’t pay for more.  
The grumbles turned into protests. On November 8, he went to one of the huge demonstrations. 
Police were there. They had loaded their guns with buckshots. Those are pellets coated with rubber. Buckshot is dangerous enough that world standards do not allow their use by police. When police fired into the crowd, their buckshots hit many protestors and injured them badly. No police commander stopped the shooting.  
Buckshots struck Gustavo in both eyes and he suddenly went blind. 
Police commanders later investigated what happened to Gustavo but they decided that no officer could be blamed. Well that’s not right. They should not have been using buckshot at all. And they should at least apologize to Gustavo and make up for the damages they caused to him. 
Gustavo’s case became famous in Chile because he didn’t just suffer bruises or broken bones; he lost his eyesight. If we can get justice for him, it will be easier to get justice for the others who were also injured.  
There’s something else our letters will do. They will help to make sure that police commanders obey the limits of their powers and make sure the police act properly in the future.

Since 2015, Bernardo Caal has defended the rights of the communities of Santa María Cahabón, who have been affected by the construction of the OXEC hydroelectric plant on the Oxec and Cahabón rivers in the northern department of Alta Verapaz. He filed a series of injunctions against the project and in 2017 the high courts acknowledged that the right to free, prior, and informed consultation of the Indigenous communities was violated. 
In retaliation, Bernardo Caal was accused of carrying out alleged acts of violence against employees of NETZONE SA, an OXEC contractor, on 15 October 2015. On 9 November 2018, a court sentenced him to seven years and four months in prison for the crimes of unlawful detention with aggravating circumstances and aggravated robbery.  
“Having reviewed the ongoing criminal proceedings against Bernardo Caal, it’s clear that there’s no evidence of the crimes that he’s accused of. On the contrary, the proceedings against Bernardo show the same patterns of criminalization of human rights defenders that we have documented in the country for years. We therefore declare today that he is a prisoner of conscience, we demand his freedom and we ask that the Attorney General’s Office review his case and investigate the officials who carried out the investigation,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“Unfortunately, in Guatemala those who speak out to defend their rights continue to be criminalized. The authorities continue to use the criminal justice system to silence and imprison human rights defenders, and this time it is Bernardo who has had to spend more than two years in prison only for being one of the public faces of the complaints of the Q’eqchi’ People. The Guatemalan authorities must put an end to these unfair practices that jeopardize the right to defend human rights.” 
In a public letter sent today to the Attorney General, María Consuelo Porras, Amnesty International expressed its concern over the irregularities and negligence in the criminal proceedings against Bernardo Caal – such as the lack of objective evidence to support the charges – that coincide with the patterns of criminalization previously documented by the organization in cases against those defending the land or environment.  
In 2016 and 2019, the High-Risk Crimes Court A issued two acquittal judgements in other cases of criminalization of human rights defenders in which it indicated the misuse of the criminal justice system against human rights defenders and ancestral authorities in the country, without the existence of evidence or crimes. 
Amnesty International defines prisoners of conscience as those who have not used or advocated violence but are imprisoned or subjected to other restrictions on their freedom due to their religious, political or other beliefs, their ethnic origin, sex, colour, language, national or social origin, sexual orientation or gender identity, or other status. Bernardo Caal is the first prisoner of conscience to be declared by the organization in Guatemala since the signing of the Peace Agreements that brought an end to the internal armed conflict in the country in 1996.  
Bernardo Caal’s lawyers have been appealing his sentence since 30 November 2018. However, the trial has been unduly delayed and the hearing has still not been held due to the fact that on four occasions the designated judges did not appear or submitted an excuse not to hear the case. The next hearing is scheduled for 28 July 2020.

By failing to effectively monitor for illegally grazed cattle entering its supply chain, JBS fails to carry out adequate due diligence as established under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Under the terms of the UN Guiding Principles, JBS contributes to human rights abuses against Indigenous peoples and residents of Reserves by participating in the economic incentives for cattle illegally grazed in protected areas, the organization said. 
“JBS has been aware of the risks that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas may enter its supply chain since at least 2009,” said Richard Pearshouse, Head of Crisis and the Environment at Amnesty International. 
“JBS failed to implement an effective monitoring system for its supply chain, including its indirect suppliers. It needs to make good on the harms caused and promptly put in place systems to avoid this happening again.” 
While Amnesty International did not find any evidence indicating that JBS is directly involved in human rights abuses in the three sites investigated, it did find that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas have entered the company’s supply chain. The organization is urging JBS to take action by the end of 2020 to remedy this. 
World’s largest beef exporter 
Brazil has an estimated 214 million cattle, more than any other country. Its beef industry, worth BRL 618 billion (USD$124 billion), accounts for 8% of its GDP. 
Roughly three-quarters of Brazil’s beef is consumed domestically, but the remaining quarter enters the global supply chain in sufficient quantities to make Brazil the world’s largest exporter. The main destinations include China, Hong Kong, Egypt, Chile, the European Union, United Arab Emirates and Russia. 
The Amazon region has seen the largest growth in Brazil’s cattle industry. Since 1988 the number of cattle there has almost quadrupled to 86 million in 2018, accounting for 40% of the national total. Some of this expansion is destroying large swathes of protected rainforest in Indigenous territories and Reserves. 
In total, 63% of the area deforested from 1988 to 2014 has become pasture for cattle – a land area five times the size of Portugal. Amnesty International documented this process in detail in a briefing in November 2019. 
According to government data, Indigenous territories in the Amazon lost 497km² of rainforest between August 2018 and July 2019 – a 91% increase compared to the corresponding period a year earlier. 
Human rights abuses in three protected areas 
Amnesty International visited three sites over the course of its investigation – the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous territory and the Rio Jacy-Paraná and Rio Ouro Preto Reserves, all in Rondônia state. 
The organization did not find any evidence indicating that JBS is directly involved in human rights abuses in the three sites investigated. 
However, in all three, recent illegal land seizures have led to a loss of traditional lands, which are protected under Brazilian law. Indigenous land rights are protected under international human rights law. Commercial cattle ranching is prohibited by law in the three sites. 
Threats, intimidation and violence often accompany these illegal land seizures, which come amid a wider context of rural violence. According to one estimate, there were seven killings, seven attempted murders and 27 death threats against Indigenous people in Brazil’s Amazon region in 2019. 
In December 2019, while patrolling their territory, some Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people found that approximately 200 hectares had been recently cleared and burned. Araruna, an Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau man in his 20s, told Amnesty International: 
“We are concerned about the recent invasions … because they are increasing and getting closer and closer to the villages. We found a huge area recently deforested. We saw a helicopter sowing grass so that they can bring cattle in the future.” 
In January 2019, another group of Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau people recalled encountering around 40 armed invaders – likely grileiros, who clear forested areas to create cow pasture – deep inside Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory, just two kilometres from an Indigenous village. Others previously described hearing gunshots ring out at night or receiving death threats against their children. 
Elsewhere, entire communities have been forced off their land and fear being killed if they return. Most of the residents of the Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve were evicted to make way for cattle ranches over the last two decades. According to a former resident, only three people remain out of approximately 60 families who previously lived on the Reserve. 
“Everything became farmland”, Sara, another former Reserve resident who was evicted from her own land in 2017, told Amnesty International. 
Amnesty International’s analysis of satellite imagery corroborated the former residents’ testimonies – land that was previously heavily forested has now been cleared, with cattle and drinking ponds for cattle now visible. 
The devil is in the data 
Brazilian law requires state agencies to collect extensive data about cattle ranching. This includes information about: the location of ranches, including those in protected areas; the number, age range and sex of cattle herds; and transfers of animals between ranches. Although this data is in the public interest, it is not currently publicly available. 
Amnesty International filed seven freedom of information requests with IDARON, the state of Rondônia’s animal health control agency. 
The data IDARON provided show a steep rise in commercial cattle ranching in protected areas, where the practice is illegal. From November 2018 to April 2020, the number of cattle rose by 22%, from 125,560 to 153,566. 
IDARON data also show 89,406 cattle were transferred off farms located in protected areas where commercial cattle ranching is illegal during 2019. The overwhelming majority are sent to other farms before going to slaughter. This means that even beef which comes from legal ranches may have been previously grazed illegally in protected areas. 
Amnesty International finds that state animal health control agencies such as IDARON effectively enable illegal commercial cattle ranching. They do so by registering commercial cattle farms and issuing documents for cattle movements despite the farm being in a Reserve or Indigenous territory. 
“The data we’ve accessed and analyzed – from Brazil’s own government agencies – set alarm bells ringing. This information should not be hidden from the public eye,” said Richard Pearshouse. 
“How do you stop illegal cattle ranching in Brazil’s Amazon? A good place to start is to stop officially registering farms in protected areas and stop issuing transfer permits for cattle moving from those farms.” 
JBS’s contaminated supply chain 
In Brazil, cattle are often moved between different farms. Farms selling cattle to meat-packing companies are called direct suppliers and other farms where cattle grazed before are known as indirect suppliers. Researchers estimate that as many as 91-95% of farms buy cattle from indirect suppliers. 
Amnesty International, in collaboration with the NGO Repórter Brasil, analyzed official animal health control documents which show JBS directly purchased cattle from a farm in the Rio Ouro Preto Reserve on two occasions in 2019. 
Additionally, in 2019 JBS repeatedly purchased cattle from two farmers who operate both illegal farms in protected areas and legal farms outside. One farmer illegally grazes cattle in the Rio Jacy-Paraná Reserve and another in the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau Indigenous territory. 
In each case, the farmers registered cattle movements from a farm inside one of the protected areas to a farm outside the protected area, and then registered separate cattle movements from the legal farm to JBS. 
In two instances, the second transfer was registered just minutes later. Both movements involved an identical number of cattle of an identical age range and sex. In these cases, the cattle were older than 36 months, a typical age when cattle are transferred for slaughtering. According to experts interviewed by Amnesty International, this could suggest the practice of cattle laundering. 
Cattle laundering – moving cattle through intermediary farms to make them appear legal – circumvents existing monitoring systems. 
Amnesty International sought specific information from JBS on whether the company had processed any cattle from farms located in the three protected areas in 2019. The company responded: “We do not purchase cattle from any farm involved in the illegal grazing within protected areas,” and that it has “an unequivocal zero deforestation approach throughout its supply chain.” 
It also stated that “JBS closely monitors its suppliers for compliance in all aspects of our Responsible Procurement Policy and has not previously identified issues relating to human rights abuses of Indigenous communities or other protected groups.” 
JBS did not answer a question about monitoring indirect suppliers, instead noting that “the traceability of the entire beef supply chain is an industry-wide challenge and a complex task.” 
JBS has been aware of the risks that illegal cattle may enter its supply chain – in 2009 it signed two non-deforestation agreements with Brazil’s Federal Public Prosecutor’s office and, separately, with Greenpeace – but has taken insufficient measures to remedy the problem. External audits have noted that JBS does not monitor its indirect suppliers. 
Amnesty International is calling on JBS to promptly implement an effective monitoring system, including of its indirect suppliers, and ensure that cattle illegally grazed in protected areas at some stage of their lives do not enter JBS’s supply chain. At the latest, this system should be in place by the end of 2020. 
A federal prosecutor in Pará state concluded in 2019 that: “today no company that buys in the Amazon can state that there isn’t cattle coming from deforestation in its supply chain (…) No meat-packing company and no supermarket either.” 
“With deforestation in the Amazon at its highest level in a decade, the onus is now on JBS and other meat-packing companies in Brazil to carry out due diligence measures to ensure their direct and indirect suppliers are not contributing to human rights abuses against the Amazon’s Indigenous and traditional residents,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
Notes to editors 
About naming conventions 
Out of security concerns, pseudonyms have been used to refer to Indigenous people and traditional residents of Reserves. 
In this report, Amnesty International has also withheld the names and other identifying information of farmers grazing cattle in protected areas, to protect the safety of people who shared information on commercial cattle ranching in protected areas. 
About Amnesty International’s research 
Amnesty International’s 18-month investigation spanned several states in Brazil’s Amazon region, interviewing 24 Indigenous people and traditional residents of Reserves, as well as 18 government agency officials and other experts. The organization also analyzed satellite imagery of recently deforested areas and sifted through official animal registry and transfer data from multiple state agencies. 
This report follows on from the organization’s previous research in protected areas of the Amazon in 2019, warning about the impending threat of clashes and deforestation, documenting violence against Indigenous peoples, and exposing cattle farming as the main economic driver of new deforestation. 
About JBS 
JBS is a Brazilian-based multinational company established in the central state of Goiás in 1953. It describes itself as “one of the worldwide food industry leaders”. As the largest beef producer in the world, JBS is in a unique position to exercise leverage, influence and control to prevent or mitigate human rights impacts in its supply chain. 
The second largest shareholder of JBS is Brazil’s state-owned national development bank, Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econômico e Social – BNDES, with 21% of shares. 
In 2019, JBS claimed it operates 37 meat-packing plants in Brazil with a total slaughter capacity of 33,550 cattle per day. In the same year, JBS recorded a net revenue of BRL 32 billion (US$ 6 billion) from the sale of beef and related products. Its beef products are sold (domestically and in foreign markets) under different brands, including Friboi, Maturatta Friboi, Do Chef Friboi, Swift Black and 1953 Friboi. 
Amnesty International wrote to JBS in June 2020 with its findings and a list of targeted questions. Key portions of the response from JBS are included in the report.

Since the start of the pandemic, an army of companies – from the Big Tech players down to start-ups most of us haven’t heard of yet – rushed to be part of the Covid-19 response. This is the transformative ‘disruption’ to the healthcare sector they’ve been betting on – it just arrived a little differently than expected. But while they look set to cash in during the crisis, it could come at a terrible cost to our privacy.   
The world of biotech was already blossoming before murmurings of an untreatable mystery virus started to circulate at the end of last year. There are now countless companies offering everything from personalized fitness plans based on your genes to dietary advice based on the bacteria in your gut. These companies and the VC firms that back them believe there is a huge, untapped market for selling AI-driven insights based on health data. Big Tech also wants in. 
If these dynamics were already in motion, they have been on fast track since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a meeting with healthcare start-ups, big tech firms, and major healthcare players to discuss how they could help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The government then quietly granted access to millions of UK health data records to Amazon, Microsoft, and Google – plus controversial data-mining firm Palantir – to build a Covid19 Datastore, aggregating data from multiple sources, including testing data. On the other end of the spectrum, start-ups such as EverlyWell, Let’s Get Checked and CircleDNA that sell home testing kits for things like genetics and blood diagnostics have rushed to market new covid-19 testing kits. 
But while tech companies are renowned for moving fast, they also famously break things. One of the things that could be left broken is our right to privacy if bio-invasive surveillance creeps in as a new norm. 
Covid-19 presents an unprecedented opportunity for tech companies to get their hands on health data. The fact that health data is governed by strict data privacy regimes in Europe and the US has long been a frustration for those who want to cash in on the sector, as it takes gargantuan datasets to train the kinds of AI models that can be monetized. One way private ventures can gain access to health data is by partnering with governments. Even if they cannot walk away with direct patient records, they can walk away with the lucrative AI models built from those records, which is the key that unlocks the value of the data. This helps explain why Palantir, a data-mining firm that frequently run contracts worth millions of dollars, has agreed to assist the government’s Covid-19 response for the cost of just £1. 
Another way that companies can access data is by building up their own private vaults of health data directly from consumers. Google knew this when it moved to acquire FitBit for $2.1 billion at the end of 2019 and Fitbit’s CEO also knew it when he said, “ultimately Fitbit is going to be about the data.” 
This has been the model used by the home diagnostics market. Because they go ‘direct to consumer’, companies can solicit consent from consumers to use their genetic and other intimate health data for research, giving them a very free reign in what they can then do with that data. The company 23andme, which maps people’s ancestry based on their DNA, controversially made millions of dollars selling the behavioural, health, and genetic insights it had accumulated from its huge customer-base to Big Pharma and biotechnology companies. 
The problem is that once health data is on the market, it can be used in all kinds of ways that could never have been understood or predicted when someone ticked a ‘consent’ box. Advertisers, including pharmaceutical companies, can use AI models trained on genetics to target people who flag as higher risk for specific health conditions – despite the science behind such ‘predictions’ being shaky at best. Meanwhile, insurance companies may use the insights generated by big data to determine who gets coverage and at what price. Meanwhile, privately-held genetic data has already been used by law enforcement without the awareness or consent of those whose data was shared. 
These are the mechanics of surveillance capitalism at work – the fact that the business model underpinning most digital services has been designed from the get-go to mine, profile and influence people at scale by capturing our data – and attention – and selling it to others. Last year, Amnesty International warned that this “surveillance-based business model” poses an unprecedented threat to human rights by forcing people to make a Faustian bargain: give up their intimate data – and their rights – in order to access the benefits of the modern world. This is simply not a legitimate choice and invalidates the so-called ‘consent’ that many companies rely on to justify their invasive data practices. 
As companies scramble to create an even more intimate marketplace of our data – one that trades in insights about our biological selves – you don’t need to strain hard to imagine the endgame. Start-ups like China-based iCarbonX, dubbed “the next Google in BioTech”, have painted that vision for us. iCarbonX reportedly wants to capture more data about your body that has even before been possible- combining genetic sequencing, data from frequent blood tests, microbiome insights and physical data from both wearable fitness devices and products like their smart mirror, which, according to their CEO, aims to produce “an exact 3-D figure of you: the fat, the muscle—your entire body shape, plus facial recognition, and what’s going on with your skin”. The main product currently advertised on the company’s website? A covid-19 testing kit. 
While Covid-19 didn’t create this problem, it looks set to accelerate it. It is now clear that continuous high-levels of population-scale testing will be necessary if we are to co-exist with the virus out-of-lockdown. This means there is a major new market for testing. But people need to be able to trust that when they take a Covid-19 test – be it provided through the NHS, their employer or a private company – that their data is protected and won’t be used for any other purpose. Data protection might not feel like a priority in a crisis, but we will be living with the consequences long after the pandemic is over if we fail to draw a protective line around our health data now.

Amnesty International, the Toronto Association for Democracy in China, and the Alliance Canada Hong Kong laid a commemorative wreath on the Liu Xiaobo Empty Chair Memorial, which sits in Ottawa on the front lawn of the Canadian offices of Amnesty International. 
“We must honour Liu Xiaobo’s legacy and remember that his fight for a free, democratic China is far from over,” said Cheuk Kwan, of the Toronto Association for Democracy in China (TADC). “This small gesture of remembrance serves to remind us that his spirit will never fade, even as we witness the horrifying deterioration of human-rights in Hong Kong.” 
On June 30, almost two weeks before the anniversary of Liu Xiaobo’s death, Chinese authorities approved the passage of the national security law, banning all individuals, institutions, and organizations in Hong Kong from “engaging in activities that endanger national security”. 
The broad, vaguely defined offences under this new legislation similarly feature in China’s own National Security Law, which has been used to crack down on dissent. 
“It was only a year ago when we witnessed the horrific human-rights crackdown in Hong Kong, as authorities clamped down on millions of people taking to the streets in protest of a proposed extradition law,” said Cherie Wong, of the Alliance Canada Hong Kong, who presented the wreath on behalf of TADC and the Alliance Canada Hong Kong. “Now, we have seen Chinese authorities go a step further in criminalizing all forms of dissent under this dangerous new national security law.” 
Among his many accomplishments, Liu Xiaobo co-wrote Charter 08, a manifesto calling for freedom of expression, human rights, and political reforms in China. He was arrested and sentenced to 13 years in prison in 2009. 
Nearly a year later, Liu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China. The Chinese government refused to allow him to travel to Oslo to receive the prize. His absence was marked by an empty chair on stage during the award ceremony. 
Liu died in prison of liver cancer on July 13, 2017, after Chinese authorities refused his request to seek treatment abroad. 
“Three years after Liu Xiaobo’s death, we are reminded that we must do everything we can to uphold his powerful legacy,” said Ihsaan Gardee, Director of Programs and Communications at Amnesty International. “Whether in China or elsewhere, we will continue holding all governments to account until we see human rights for everyone.” 
Canadian sculptor Ruth Abernethy created a bronze replica of the “empty chair”, which was unveiled on the front lawn of Amnesty International’s Ottawa office during a ceremony on Aug. 13, 2019. 
Members of the public are welcome to visit the Liu Xiaobo Empty Chair Memorial at 312 Laurier Ave. East, Ottawa.

The organization’s analysis of available data has revealed that more than 3000 health workers are known to have died from COVID-19 worldwide – a figure which is likely to be a significant underestimate.  
Alarmingly, Amnesty International documented cases where health workers who raise safety concerns in the context of the COVID-19 response have faced retaliation, ranging from arrest and detention to threats and dismissal.  
“With the COVID-19 pandemic still accelerating around the world, we are urging governments to start taking health and essential workers’ lives seriously. Countries yet to see the worst of the pandemic must not repeat the mistakes of governments whose failure to protect workers’ rights has had devastating consequences,” said Sanhita Ambast, Amnesty International’s Researcher and Advisor on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
“It is especially disturbing to see that some governments are punishing workers who voice their concerns about working conditions that may threaten their lives. Health workers on the frontline are the first to know if government policy is not working, and authorities who silence them cannot seriously claim to be prioritising public health.” 
Thousands have lost their lives 
There is currently no systematic global tracking of how many health and essential workers have died after contracting COVID-19.  
However, Amnesty International has collated and analysed a wide range of available data that shows that over 3000 health workers are known to have died after contracting COVID-19 in 79 countries around the world.  
According to Amnesty International’s monitoring, the countries with the highest numbers of health worker deaths thus far include the USA (507), Russia (545), UK (540, including 262 social care workers), Brazil (351), Mexico (248), Italy (188), Egypt (111), Iran (91), Ecuador (82) and Spain (63). 
The overall figure is likely to be a significant underestimate due to under-reporting, while accurate comparisons across countries are difficult due to differences in counting. For example, France has collected data from just some of its hospitals and health centres, while figures of deceased health workers provided by health associations in Egypt and Russia have been contested by their governments.  
Shortages of life saving protective equipment 
Health workers reported serious shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) in nearly all of the 63 countries and territories surveyed by Amnesty International.  
This includes countries which may yet see the worst of the pandemic, such as India and Brazil and several countries across Africa. A doctor working in Mexico City told Amnesty International that doctors were spending about 12% of their monthly salaries buying their own PPE. 
In addition to a global shortage of supply, trade restrictions may have aggravated this problem. In June 2020, 56 countries and two trade blocs (the European Union and the Eurasian Economic Union) had put in place measures to either ban or restrict the export of some, or all, forms of PPE or its components. 
“While states must ensure there is sufficient PPE for workers within their territories, trade restrictions risk exacerbating shortages in countries that are dependent on imports,” said Sanhita Ambast. 
“The COVID-19 pandemic is a global problem that requires global cooperation.” 
Reprisals 
In at least 31 of the countries surveyed by Amnesty International, researchers recorded reports of strikes, threatened strikes, or protests, by health and essential workers as a result of unsafe working conditions. In many countries, such actions were met with reprisals from authorities.  
In Egypt, for example, Amnesty documented the cases of nine health care workers who were arbitrarily detained between March and June on vague and overly broad charges of “spreading false news” and “terrorism”. All those detained had expressed safety concerns or criticized the government’s handling of the pandemic.  
Another Egyptian doctor told Amnesty International that doctors who speak out are subjected to threats, interrogations by the National Security Agency (NSA), administrative questioning, and penalties. He said: 
“Many [doctors] are preferring to pay for their own personal equipment to avoid this exhausting back and forth. [The authorities] are forcing doctors to choose between death and jail.” 
In some cases, strike action and protests have been met with heavy-handed responses. 
In Malaysia for example, police dispersed a peaceful picket against a hospital cleaning services company. The picketers’ complaints centred around what they said was the unfair treatment of union members by the company as well as a lack of sufficient protection for hospital cleaners. Police arrested, detained and charged five health care workers who were protesting for “unauthorized gathering” in violation of their rights to freedom of association and assembly. 
“Health and essential workers have a right to raise their voices against unfair treatment,” said Sanhita Ambast. 
“Health workers can help governments improve their response to the pandemic and keep everyone safe – but they can’t do this if they are in prison, and they can’t do it if they are afraid to speak up.” 
There have also been reports in several countries of health and essential workers being fired or facing disciplinary action for speaking out about their concerns. 
In the USA for example, certified nursing assistant Tainika Somerville was fired after posting a video on Facebook where she read out a petition calling for more PPE. Tainika says staff at the nursing home in Illinois where she works were not informed that they were working with COVID-19 patients and found out through the media.  The nursing home had reported 34 infections and 15 COVID-19 related deaths as of May 29. 
In Russia, Amnesty International highlighted the cases of two doctors, Yulia Volkova and Tatyana Reva, who are facing retaliation after complaining about a lack of PPE. Yulia Volkova has been charged under Russia’s fake news laws and faces a fine of up to RUB 100,000 (USD 1,443), while Tatyana Reva is facing disciplinary proceedings that may result in her dismissal. 
Unfair pay and lack of benefits 
In addition to unsafe working conditions, Amnesty International has documented how some health and essential workers are being unfairly paid or in some cases not paid at all. 
In South Sudan for example, doctors on the government’s payroll have not received their salaries since February and do not receive welfare packages or medical cover. In Guatemala, at least 46 facilities staff were not paid for the two-and-a-half months they spent working at a COVID-19 hospital. 
In some countries, there are no additional benefits for health and essential workers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in other countries benefits exclude certain categories of workers.  
Amnesty International is calling on states to consider COVID-19 an occupational illness.  
As part of this they must ensure that health and essential workers have access to compensation and other support in case they contract the infection. They must also be included in priority groups for COVID-19 testing. 
Stigma and Violence 
Amnesty International documented several cases where health and essential workers experienced stigma and violence because of their jobs. For example, a nurse in Mexico was reportedly drenched with chlorine while walking on the street, and in the Philippines, attackers poured bleach in the face of a hospital utility worker.  
These incidents point to a climate of misinformation and stigma and underscore the importance of governments providing accurate and accessible information on the spread of COVID-19. 
In Pakistan, Amnesty International has recorded several instances of violence against health workers since April. Hospitals have been vandalized, doctors have been attacked, and one was even shot by a member of the Counter Terrorism Force. 
There have been several statements from ministers in Pakistan claiming that hospitals have the necessary resources, despite reports that hospitals have been forced to turn away even critical patients, due to the shortage of beds, ventilators and other life-saving equipment. This puts health workers in danger as people don’t believe them when they say they do not have room for more patients. 
Recommendations 
“We call on all states affected by COVID-19 to carry out independent public reviews into their preparedness for and responses to the pandemic, with a view to better protecting human rights and lives in the event of a future mass disease outbreak,” said Sanhita Ambast. 
This should include a review into whether the rights of health and essential workers – including the right to just and favourable conditions of work, and the right to freedom of expression – were adequately protected.  
States must ensure adequate compensation for all health and essential workers who have contracted COVID-19 as a result of work-related activities. They must also investigate cases where workers have faced reprisals for raising health and safety concerns, and provide effective remedy to those who have been unjustly treated including by reinstating workers who have lost their jobs for speaking out.  
Background 
For the purpose of this briefing, “health workers” refers to everyone involved in the delivery of health and social care in any capacity, including but not limited to doctors, nurses, social care workers, cleaners, ambulance drivers and facilities staff. While the briefing largely focuses on health workers, given available information, the same issues apply to a broader range of ‘essential workers’ who have been exposed to COVID-19 in a range of frontline jobs during the pandemic. 
All figures are correct as of 6 July 2020.

“As the world remembers those who lost their lives in Srebrenica and shows solidarity with survivors, it is wholly unacceptable that families of more than 1,000 victims are still searching for their remains. The truth about the fate of their loved ones has been buried for a quarter of a century making it hard for them to find peace or some measure of closure. 
“This sombre anniversary also marks 25 years of struggle to secure justice, truth and reparation for survivors, including victims of wartime rape and sexual violence. While many perpetrators, including Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, have been brought to justice, survivors are still facing insurmountable obstacles to obtaining truth, justice and remedy for their suffering. 
“Srebrenica is a reminder that no society is immune to the gravest of crimes. Genocide does not happen overnight. Years of hateful populism exploiting divisions in society, supported by campaigns of misinformation and propaganda, usually precede violence. To learn lessons from Srebrenica and make true the pledge of ‘never again’, we must begin by confronting hate speech and discrimination in all forms.”

BACKGROUND 
More than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed after the Bosnian Serb Army attacked Srebrenica, a designated UN “safe area”, on 10-11 July 1995, despite the presence of UN peacekeepers. 
In 2017, the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia found Mladić guilty on 10 of 11 counts, including genocide and persecution on ethnic and religious grounds of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, as well as extermination, murder, deportation and other inhumane acts. 
While the bodies of more than 7,000 victims of the Srebrenica genocide have been exhumed, identified and buried, more than 1,000 people are still missing or their remains awaiting recovery and identification. 
Despite high-level prosecutions of some principal architects of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, there is still a huge backlog of cases pending before courts in the country.  
11 July is the European Union’s official day of remembrance for the victims of the Srebrenica genocide.

It convicted Taner Kılıç of ‘membership of the Fethullah Gülen Terrorist Organization (FETÖ)’ under Article 314/2 of the Penal Code, sentencing him to six years and three months’ imprisonment. The court convicted İdil Eser, Günal Kursun and Özlem Dalkıran for ‘knowingly and willingly supporting FETÖ’ under Article 220/7 of the Penal Code, sentencing each of them to 25 months’ imprisonment. The remaining seven human rights defenders were acquitted. 
While Taner had previously been accused in the indictment of membership of FETÖ, all the others in the case had been accused of supporting “terrorist organizations”. The judgment was the first time in which FETÖ was recorded as the proscribed organization that they were accused of assisting. The sentence against Taner is standard for people convicted of membership under Article 314/2 of the Penal Code while the 25-month sentences handed down to the others are in the lower range given to people convicted under Article 220/7 of the Penal Code. The sentences do not come into force until they become final after all appeals have been exhausted, and as such all the human rights defenders are at liberty, as the court did not order their detention. Only Taner is subjected to judicial controls, in the form of an international travel ban, which remains in force.  
The verdict was a majority decision of the three judges: in a highly unusual move, one judge issued a dissenting opinion that all defendants should be acquitted. The four human rights defenders that were convicted were those with the strongest links to Amnesty International (Taner was the Chair of Amnesty Turkey at the time of his detention and current Honorary Chair, İdil was Amnesty Turkey Director at the time of her detention, Özlem a former Chair and founder of Amnesty Turkey and Günal one of Amnesty Turkey’s most longstanding members. The four are also the highest profile human rights defenders among the 11 on trial. While the reasoned verdict has not yet been released, the acquittal of seven human rights defenders who attended the Büyükada workshop, and the reasoning of the prosecution in the case suggests that the convictions were due to their previous activism rather than participation in the Büyükada workshop. Taner was convicted despite the central allegation – that he downloaded and used the ByLock messaging application – was disproven by the State’s own evidence. The approach taken by courts in Turkey in ByLock cases, of which there are thousands, would normally be to acquit in such circumstances. 
The verdict makes crystal clear the nature of the case as a politically orchestrated attack against the individuals as human rights defenders, with the intention of silencing independent civil society in Turkey.   
The July 3 verdict of the first instance court is subject to a two-stage appeal. The first is to the regional appeals court (İstinaf), and the second to the Court of Cassation (Yargıtay). On 6 July, the prosecutor wrote to the trial court indicating intention to appeal the acquittals of Nejat Taştan and Veli Acu. This is a fairly standard response, since the prosecutor requested their conviction along with the four defenders convicted, in his summing up of the evidence (mütaala) in November 2019. 
The reasoned judgment is unlikely to be released before September 2020, and the appeal to the regional appeals court is unlikely to be heard before the middle of 2021. 
Defence lawyers will argue that a hearing should be held by the regional appeals court rather than a paper review which is the usual process. The regional appeals courts that have been in operation since 2016 have thus far proved completely ineffective in overturning abusive convictions such as this one. The Court of Cassation is much more likely to overturn first instance courts’ decisions but is similarly under government control. The Court of Cassation is unlikely to rule on the case before 2022 but may not issue its judgment until 2025 or beyond. 
Taner’s application to the European Court of Human rights has been communicated to the government, who have responded. The case has been awarded priority status, but it not known when the European Court will issue a ruling, although it is likely to happen before the appeals process is exhausted in Turkey. 
Ministry of Justice officials in Ankara told Amnesty International that they were not available for a meeting until after July 2020. Therefore, we will be writing our concerns in a letter to the Minister of Justice  
Amnesty sections should raise our concerns with Turkish ambassadors around the world as soon and as widely as possible. Sections also should seek meetings with their Ministries of Foreign Affairs to brief them about the outcome of the trial and urge them (with an emphasis on states who are friends and allies of Turkey) to communicate their concerns to the Turkish authorities. In these meetings we should express the following points: 
The prosecution is known as the “Büyükada case” because 10 of the 11 human rights defenders on trial were detained during a human rights workshop on Büyükada island near Istanbul in July 2017. Taner had been detained the previous month and his prosecution was joined with theirs on the ground that he directed the Büyükada workshop that they participated in. According to the indictment of October 2017, the aim of the “secret” Büyükada workshop was to promote chaos and therefore support terrorist organizations. Taner was released after more than 14 months and eight of the others were released after almost four months pre-trial detention. The trial at the first instance court took over two-and-a-half years and 12 hearings and was subjected to a series of delays due to the state not presenting evidence and latterly because of Covid19. 
The central allegation directed at Taner, that he had downloaded and used on his phone the messaging app ByLock, that the authorities say was used by the Gülen movement to communicate was proved to be false, including by the state’s evidence in the form of police forensic reports. The prosecution failed to move on from the absurd allegations made against the human rights defenders, which they failed to substantiate, while defence lawyers comprehensively disproved them. Despite this, the prosecution requested that six of the human rights defenders be convicted in its summing up of the evidence in November 2019, which contained glaring factual errors and ignored evidence presented during the trial. The court issued its verdict on 3 July 2020, convicting four human rights defenders. All remained at liberty pending appeals.

The call came in an open letter sent this morning to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair. 
“Facial recognition surveillance is invasive and inaccurate. This unregulated technology poses a threat to the fundamental rights of people in Canada,” said Tim McSorley, National Coordinator of the Ottawa-based International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group (ICLMG), which, along with OpenMedia, initiated the campaign.  
Studies have shown the racial biases in facial recognition surveillance, with leading technology mis-identifying Black, Asian and Indigenous faces 10 to 100 times more than white faces. As the letter points out, at a time when society is pushing to address systemic racism in policing, adopting a technology that is known for its racial biases is a move in the wrong direction. 
Even if these biases could be addressed, though, the dangers posed by facial recognition surveillance to our rights would persist. “The use of facial recognition surveillance undermines our freedoms of association, assembly, expression and movement, as well as the right to privacy and protection against unreasonable search and seizure,” said McSorley. 
Canada’s existing privacy laws do not regulate biometrics, including facial recognition, allowing the technology to be adopted by police forces across the country without any oversight or clear rules. For example, the RCMP has used the highly controversial Clearview AI facial recognition technology without consulting the Privacy Commissioner or issuing a Privacy Impact Assessment. The federal police force went so far as to publicly deny its use of Clearview AI’s technology, when it had actually been operating it for several months. 
Along with the ban on the use of facial recognition surveillance by law enforcement and intelligence agencies at the federal level, the signatories are also calling on the government to: 
Even with a ban on federal facial recognition surveillance in place, it will also be crucial to establish limits around other uses of facial recognition at all levels of government. For example, provinces and municipalities must act to halt the use of facial recognition by local and regional law enforcement. 
Other jurisdictions are recognizing the dangers of facial recognition technology, with several US cities banning its use by law enforcement. Even companies that produce the technology have been forced to recognize its dangerous nature, with many halting sales to law enforcement. In Canada, the federal Office of the Privacy Commissioner is investigating the RCMP’s use of facial recognition technology, and OpenMedia has launched a petition calling for a country-wide ban on the use of facial recognition surveillance by law enforcement. 
“The federal government has the opportunity to be a leader on this issue by taking a firm stance on facial recognition surveillance. Minister Blair must enact a ban on its use now, before we see more harm done,” said Laura Tribe, Executive Director at OpenMedia.

Almost half a million Rohingya children do not have access to formal education inside the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. When the children of other parts of the world are able to study online during the pandemic, the situation is pushing our children further behind. The world should not leave us behind, caged in a camp like this. 
We are a scared community. Due to the spread of rumors about COVID-19 through word of mouth, people are now more scared about reporting illness and receiving treatment. 
The internet blackout is keeping us in the dark about information related to COVID-19. Bangladesh has been so kind to us. Letting our people suffer in a pandemic by limiting access to essential information is against the country’s humanitarian goodwill.  
Since the camps were put under lockdown, people are having difficulty accessing relief supplies. Many non-government organizations that operated inside the camps before cannot offer support under the current circumstances. Some of the NGOs, that still operate inside the camps, cannot reach to us regularly or in time. 
Right now, people are facing many hardships in their daily lives. Some households have to go without food at the end of the month. 
More people seem to be suffering or dying from fever, cough, runny nose and symptoms of flu than before. They are afraid of visiting health facilities or reporting their illness because of the stigma around contracting COVID-19. Three persons have died from the virus inside the camp to date. We do not know how many lives this virus will cost us. 
We are not able to follow the preventive guidelines. We live in a very crowded space. About five to 10 people live in an 80-square feet shelter. We are unable to maintain social distance. We can hardly maintain a hygienic environment where there is only one toilet for 50 families. 
With lack of access to authentic information about Covid-19 many of us do not even know about the virus too well. 
We escaped a genocide from Myanmar before, now we are scared about what more suffering this pandemic will cause to us.

Human rights are incomparable and cannot be prioritized. Nothing is as important as health and starvation can lead to death. Our younger generation is already being exploited into trafficking, drugs and unwanted activities without access to education. 
For now, we can prioritize issues that are urgent. As COVID-19 is devastating countries around the world, it is no surprise that the virus has reached the refugee camps. We need proper healthcare management and food supply to stay alive. These are issues that can affect our people sooner than others. 
There should be widespread testing in the camp to tackle the spread of COVID-19. This will only be possible when people are assured about their well-being and not frightened by coercive quarantine and stigmatisation about their illness. Information should be accessible and transparent. 
Many NGOs halted their operations after the COVID-19 outbreak. These paved in many new challenges. Many daily wages labourers don’t have money to complete their meal. The traditional food ration doesn’t make a complete meal. People have to buy vegetables and fishes from their own pocket. Some Rohingya youths had jobs at NGOs. But now they lost those jobs and are facing a hard time. 
The closure of learning centres has major impact on students. They do not have internet access or online education facility. We should come forward with an alternative solution such as distance learning. 
There has been some progress in female leadership as some stubborn women came forward to educate women about their rights as women and human and create awareness about gender-based violence and other issues. Since we didn’t have females in leadership before, it’s too early to break the tradition in a community, marginalized for decades. 
The pandemic could aggravate sexual and gender-based violence, as more women have to stay in confinement of shelters in refugee camps. 
I’m really concerned for we have shortage of youths (both male and female) in leadership who can guide the community in the right direction. We can bridge the gap with education and training. 
A voluntary, safe and dignified repatriation with our rights is as urgent as a vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19.

Follow Saad on Twitter @saadhammadi 
Rahima Khatun*, a Rohingya woman, was dragged by the authorities to an isolation facility soon after someone with the same name as hers tested positive for COVID-19 in one of the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. Rahima said to caregivers that she had never given a swab in her life, but to no avail. The healthcare facility, where she was brought for isolation, carried out a test on her as she protested. 
She had to be in an isolation facility for two days. Once she tested negative the healthcare facility let her go back to her shelter in the camp. Her traumatic experience scared others in the camp. Now people are afraid of testing. 
At the end of the second week of June, nearly 400 people were tested in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, home to nearly one million Rohingya with a population density of 40,000 people per square kilometres. About 40 Rohingya refugees have been confirmed with COVID-19 in the camps and two persons have died from the virus as of 15 June. Widespread transmission of the virus cannot be confirmed but healthcare providers are worried that experiences such as that of Rahima Khatun have turned health conditions into stigma for people in the Rohingya community. This has created a trust deficit between the Rohingya and the different actors including majhis (camp leaders from Rohingya community), community volunteers and camp in-charge. 
There are handful of unexplained deaths among elderly people and a flu epidemic spreading in the camps. “Every other household has some symptoms,” said a humanitarian worker. Rumours and anxiety about the consequence of testing positive with coronavirus have resulted in a drop in medical consultations by 50 percent between end of March and first week of May. Hearsays about people who tested positive with coronavirus being killed in response to prevent the spread of the disease have caused fears about reporting illness. 
The disruption in some of the services inside the camps is poised to have a long-term impact on the lives of refugees. 
An ongoing restriction on access to internet and telecommunications for the Rohingya in the refugee camps has limited their right to seek urgent protection for sexual and gender-based violence, receive prompt and reliable information about COVID-19 and communicate with family members on phone. 
The future of more than half a million Rohingya children hangs in balance, with still no access to quality education in the refugee camps. Bangladesh government in January this year agreed in principle to provide Rohingya children, who represent more than half of the refugee population, with education in the Myanmar curriculum. The education programme, which was supposed to be piloted among 10,000 children by June this year, could not be implemented because of the pandemic. 
The pandemic has reduced opportunities for the Rohingya to receive cash for work within the community. For women in the camps, this has meant confinement into domestic settings and increased vulnerability to sexual and gender-based violence. 
Twenty-seven percent Rohingya women and girls reported experiencing gender-based violence on a normal day without the pandemic, according to a study by the International Rescue Committee. This is said to be a significant underrepresentation of the scale of GBV in the camps where 57 percent of the cases were of physical assault. 
Refugees are increasingly seeking informal justice mechanisms and mediation usually from majhis, in absence of regular legal counsellors in the camp. In some cases, majhis are also exploiting the current situation by asking for money from refugees to facilitate them to access services including healthcare in absence of humanitarian actors. 
Amidst this uncertainty, some Rohingya families have their dear ones stranded in the sea for several months. Bangladesh has received two boats with about 700 Rohingya. The first boat with 396 Rohingya arrived in Cox’s Bazar on 16 April. Bangladeshi authorities on 7 May towed a second boat with another 277 Rohingya to Bhashan Char, a remote silt island, that has yet to complete a safety and sustainability assessment by the UN. Another 30 Rohingya refugees who came ashore in Cox’s Bazar around the same time after several weeks in the sea were subsequently sent by the Bangladesh authorities to Bhashan Char. The authorities said that the 307 Rohingya people have been taken there to complete the quarantine procedure. It has been more than a month now and they are still away from their families in the remote island. The Rohingya refugees kept in the island for an indefinite period could be victims of arbitrary detention. 
The Rohingya have suffered for nearly four decades becoming victims of crimes against humanity. COVID-19 must not be an excuse to deprive the Rohingya refugees of their human rights. Bangladesh and the international community must protect the rights of the Rohingya refugees by sharing responsibility through continued cooperation and assistance.

0,Myanmar: Indiscriminate airstrikes kill civilians as Rakhine conflict worsens,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/myanmar-indiscriminate-airstrikes-kill-civilians-as-rakhine-conflict-worsens/,"Airstrikes kill civilians, including children Arbitrary detention and torture in crackdown on insurgents Residents unprotected against COVID-19 amid internet blackout Amnesty International has collected new evidence showing that indiscriminate airstrikes by the Myanmar military have killed...","Amnesty International has collected new evidence showing that indiscriminate airstrikes by the Myanmar military have killed civilians, including children, amid worsening armed conflict in the country’s Rakhine and Chin States. 
These attacks and other serious human rights violations by the Myanmar military, also known as the Tatmadaw, are taking place in townships where internet has been cut off for more than a year. Residents have been in the dark over the threat from COVID-19 and deprived of information about humanitarian assistance. Rakhine State has been largely spared a major COVID-19 outbreak, although cases were on the rise in June. 
“While Myanmar authorities were urging people to stay at home to help stop COVID-19, in Rakhine and Chin states its military was burning down homes and killing civilians in indiscriminate attacks that amount to war crimes,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director. 
“Despite mounting international pressure on the military’s operations in the area, including at the International Court of Justice, the shocking testimonies we have collected show just how deep impunity continues to run within Myanmar military ranks.” 
In May and June 2020, Amnesty International remotely interviewed more than two dozen ethnic Rakhine and Chin people affected by military operations, including airstrikes and shelling; analyzed fresh satellite imagery of burned down villages; and verified video footage showing violations carried out by the Myanmar military. 
The conflict has escalated since the 4 January 2019 attack by the Arakan Army (AA), an ethnic Rakhine armed group, against several police posts in northern Rakhine State. The incident prompted a retaliatory order from the government to ‘crush’ the AA and marked a turning point in the escalation of the conflict, which has since displaced tens of thousands. 
In recent days an additional 10,000 people fled their homes as a result of heavy fighting and warnings of advancing military operations, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimated. 
Myanmar officially labelled the AA an unlawful organization on 23 March 2020. Fighting surged between March and May 2020, while Myanmar also grappled with its first COVID-19 cases. Over 30 civilians were killed or injured in May alone as a result of the conflict, according to the UN. 
The victims are predominantly from Buddhist and some Christian ethnic minorities in Rakhine and Chin States, though media reports have also documented violations against Rohingya civilians. 
‘The whole village saw the plane’ 
The Myanmar military’s airpower has inflicted enormous damage and human suffering. In Chin State, three people from a cluster of ethnic Chin villages called Meik Sar Wa in Paletwa Township described airstrikes which they said took place on 14 and 15 March 2020. 
“The whole village saw the plane … the sound was so loud,” one resident said, adding that the attack happened at around 11am. 
After hearing explosions, he ran to his father’s house and found his brother with a fatal stomach wound, as well as the body of his brother’s 16-year-old friend. He said his uncle, who was in a different house at the time, was also killed in the same airstrike. 
Two people from another family in the same village cluster told Amnesty International that an airstrike killed nine people in their community, including a seven-year-old boy. “Our family is destroyed,” the boy’s father said. 
An ethnic Rakhine farmer from Lel Hla village tract in Paletwa Township, Chin State, said fighting erupted around a nearby village called Hnan Chaung Wa on 7 April 2020. He said airstrikes killed seven and injured eight people, corroborating news reports of these incidents. After helping move dead bodies and injured people, he later witnessed two fighter jets launch another round of attacks closer to his own village and saw two columns of smoke rising from burned property. 
He fled to the town of Paletwa the next day but airstrikes followed there as well. 
Under customary international humanitarian law, an indiscriminate attack is a war crime if it leads to civilian deaths. 
Detention, torture and other violations  
Witness testimonies also show that Myanmar soldiers arbitrarily detained civilians in Rakhine State for perceived connections with the AA, sometimes resorting to torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
Two former residents of Mrauk U Township in Rakhine State told Amnesty International their family member was detained and tortured after Myanmar soldiers started shooting on 29 February 2020. 
One of the women, the detained man’s wife, visited her husband in detention and said that he told her he had been tied up and beaten for four nights and five days. As a result of the beatings he now has trouble breathing. 
“He wasn’t given food or water…They kicked and hit him with rifles in the back and kicked his chest as well,” she said. “Before this, he was tall and big, but when I saw him … he was visibly thin.” 
Soldiers held a knife to his throat and obtained a forced “confession” about his supposed links to the AA. He was charged under the Counter Terrorism Law, which has been increasingly used in recent months against journalists reporting on the conflict, and people perceived to be linked to the AA. 
The beating of detainees appears to be widespread. In May the military admitted its forces punched and kicked blindfolded detainees after a video of the disturbing incident went viral. 
Arbitrary detention was documented in several townships. A villager from Rakhine State’s Kyauktaw Township witnessed Myanmar soldiers arrest ten villagers, including her husband, on 16 March 2020. She told Amnesty International that soldiers punched, kicked and hit the detainees who resisted with guns. These troops were said to be from the 55th Light Infantry Division, which Amnesty International has previously documented as carrying out violations in Rakhine State. 
“Until now I have no news about my husband, and I’m devastated,” she said. 
Myanmar soldiers also appear to regularly confiscate or destroy civilian property and commandeer monasteries as temporary bases. Amnesty International similarly documented the use and confiscation of civilian property by soldiers in Rakhine State and northern Shan State in 2019. 
Residents said soldiers took rice, firewood, blankets and clothes, mobile phones and personal documents, gold bracelets and necklaces. Livestock was slaughtered or taken. Myanmar soldiers also knocked down doors, broke windows, and damaged small Buddhist shrines kept at home. 
Amnesty International also documented incidents of the burning or destruction of villages in different townships in Rakhine and Chin States. 
Satellite imagery of several conflict-affected villages shows widescale burning consistent with Myanmar military tactics.  Both the military and the AA have blamed each other for the village burning. 
In one village tract in Minbya Township, a displaced person said that on 29 March Myanmar soldiers burned down around 10 houses and one school building, adding that two villagers died in the incident. 
In Chin State, a 41-year-old ethnic Rakhine man who tried to return to his old village, Sein Nyin Wa in Paletwa Township, after being displaced for nearly two months reported seeing only ash from a vantage point on 24 May. 
Amnesty International was not able to document operations and abuses by the Arakan Army in the reporting period due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and limited access to conflict-affected areas and witnesses. However, reports suggest the Arakan Army has continued a pattern of abuses previously documented by Amnesty International. This includes endangering the lives of civilians during attacks, intimidation of local communities, and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. 
‘We’re becoming deaf and blind’: internet blackout during a pandemic 
In June 2019, Myanmar authorities shut down the internet in nine conflict-affected townships in Rakhine and Chin States: Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Maungdaw, Minbya, Mrauk-U, Myebon, Ponnagyun, and Rathedaung in Rakhine State, as well as Paletwa in Chin State. 
The shutdown was lifted in five townships in late August 2019, but reinstated in February 2020. At the time of writing, only Maungdaw has regained mobile internet access. 
The government has said the internet blackout is necessary because the Arakan Army uses mobile internet to coordinate attacks against officials, plant anti-personnel mines, and incite hatred against the authorities. However, the blackout has limited access to information about COVID-19. 
“There are only a few people who are aware of COVID-19 in the camps,” one relief worker told Amnesty International, estimating that about five percent understand the threat. 
One displaced resident from Minbya Township said people had to learn about COVID-19 from television, print newspapers and illegal satellite dish connections. 
“I’m worried because for war you can hide in the bush or nearby, but for the virus you can’t hide,” he said. “It’s like we’re becoming deaf and blind, and there’s nobody to report on what’s happening in Minbya.” 
While serious violations by the Myanmar military continue, Amnesty International reiterates its call for the UN Security Council to refer the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court (ICC). 
“The reliance on airstrikes and internet blackouts may be new, but one constant is the military’s remorseless neglect for civilian life,” said Nicholas Bequelin. 
“The atrocities have not stopped – in fact, the Myanmar military’s cruelty is only getting more sophisticated. This relentless pattern of violations is clearly a matter for the ICC. The Security Council must act.”

0,UN: Russia and China launch despicable veto of lifesaving aid for millions of civilians in Syria,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/un-russia-and-china-launch-despicable-veto-of-lifesaving-aid-for-millions-of-civilians-in-syria/,"Reacting to the Russian and Chinese veto of a UN Security Council draft Resolution that would have renewed the provision of cross-border humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria, Sherine Tadros, Amnesty International’s Head of UN Office, said: “It’s impossible to overstate the importance of...","Reacting to the Russian and Chinese veto of a UN Security Council draft Resolution that would have renewed the provision of cross-border humanitarian aid to civilians in Syria, Sherine Tadros, Amnesty International’s Head of UN Office, said: 
“It’s impossible to overstate the importance of ensuring the crossing points, delivering vital aid, stay open. For millions of Syrians, it is the difference between having food to eat and starving. For hospitals, it is about having enough supplies to save lives. That’s why Russia and China’s abuse of the veto power is despicable and dangerous.” 
There have been months of negotiations between Security Council members over which crossing points into Syria should remain open for the delivery of humanitarian aid and other key services, including health and education. The UN cross-border delivery mechanism, set up in 2014 and renewed ever since, is due to expire in just three days, on 10 July. If that happens it will severely impact the ability to deliver aid to millions of Syrians in time. 
“What is also regrettable is the fact that the crossing point of Al-Yarubiya in north-east Syria seems to have been sacrificed along the way in the search for a compromise with Russia and China. The members of the Security Council must hold firm. There are over one million Syrian civilians in those areas that rely on that crossing point for the delivery of aid. With rising cases of COVID-19 in Syria, this aid is more vital than ever. Will the Security Council act to help them, or will they be abandoned?” 
Background 
The UN cross-border aid delivery mechanism was established by resolution 2165 (2014). The most recent mandate renewal expires on 10 July 2020. That renewal, adopted on 10 January, re-authorized two border crossings (Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa on the Syria/Turkey border) for six months but did not re-authorize the al-Ramtha (Syria/Jordan border) and the Al Yarubiyah (Syria/Iraq border) crossings. The draft was adopted as resolution 2504 by a vote of 11 in favour, none against, and four abstentions (China, Russia, the UK, and the USA). 
In May, Amnesty International published a report detailing 18 cases – the majority in January and February 2020 – where Syrian and/or Russian government forces targeted medical facilities and schools in Idlib, western Aleppo and north-western Hama governorates in north-west Syria. 
As a result, before the 5 March ceasefire almost 1 million people in Idlib – many of whom had been displaced repeatedly – were forced to flee again and languished in dire conditions in recent months. Amnesty International has campaigned since then for the resolution to be adopted to continue the lifeline of aid reaching them.

Companies which operate in the settlements are contributing to human rights violations and tacitly supporting Israel’s policy of forcing Palestinians out of their homes and crushing their basic rights,” said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
Earlier this year the United Nations published a database listing more than 100 companies with business links to settlements, including TripAdvisor. Listed companies which continue their involvement in settlements are knowingly breaching their international obligations to “avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities and address such impacts when they occur”. 
Amnesty’s research shows that the tourism industry plays an important role in driving settlement expansion by drawing in visitors who boost their economies, and by legitimizing and normalizing the existence of settlements. TripAdvisor is the most visited online tourism website by foreign visitors to Israel, and it promotes at least 70 places to stay or things to do in Israeli settlements.

“Indigenous people continue to experience institutionalized discrimination in the justice system and a disproportionately high level of interaction with police, which is furthered by the practice of street checks. In an era of reconciliation, this is simply unacceptable.” 
– Chief Don Tom, Vice President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs 
We are urgently calling on the Vancouver Police Board and the Province of BC to immediately ban police street checks. 
The BC Civil Liberties Association, Black Lives Matter-Vancouver, Hogan’s Alley Society, Union of BC Indian Chiefs, and WISH Drop-In Society are releasing an open letter, co-signed by 68 organizations, including Amnesty International, as well as a petition for an immediate municipal and provincial ban on police street checks. 
Sign the petition to the Province of BC, Vancouver Police Board, and Vancouver City Council calling for an immediate ban on street checks: 
If you are in Vancouver, sign up to speak at City Council on Tuesday, July 7 to end street checks or send an online comment to City Council. 
A street check is a discretionary and arbitrary police practice where police stop a person in public, question them outside the context of an arrest or detention or police investigation, and often record their personal information in a database. 
Street checks are a racist police practice. In Vancouver, for example, Indigenous and Black people are significantly over-represented in the numbers of street checks conducted by the Vancouver Police Department. Between 2008 and 2017, Indigenous people accounted for over 15 percent of street checks despite being 2 percent of the population, and Black people accounted for 4 percent of street checks despite making up 1 percent of the population. In 2016, Indigenous women, who comprise 2% of Vancouver’s women population, accounted for 21 percent of women who were street checked. 
“The issue of police street checks is fundamentally connected to anti-Black racism and police violence.” – Lama Mugabo, Director of Hogan’s Alley Society 
Street checks are a harmful practice across BC. While there has been much emphasis on street checks in Vancouver, the same pattern emerges in municipal police departments across the province. Data from Abbotsford, Central Saanich, Nelson, New Westminster, Oak Bay, Port Moody, Saanich, and West Vancouver police departments reveal a decade of racial targeting of Black, Indigenous and racialized Latino/a/x, Arab, and South Asian people, with Indigenous women particularly over-represented in all departments’ data on street checks. In West Vancouver in 2018, Indigenous women represented 17.6 percent of women who were street checked, despite making up 0.6 percent of the population there. 
Street checks regularly take the form of controversial wellness checks. Police wellness checks disproportionately affect homeless people, sex workers, people who use drugs, and people in mental health distress. Such checks, carried out by officers in full uniform and carrying a gun, are an inappropriate means of providing care for people living in poverty and/or vulnerable due to gendered, colonial, and racial violence. Police wellness checks often have a tragically fatal impact; a CBC investigation reveals that since the year 2000, around 70 percent of police-involved fatalities in Canada have been of people in mental health or substance use crisis, or both. 
Street checks are an illegal police practice. There is no applicable statute actually authorizing street checks in BC. No police officers in BC have explicit statutory authority or power to conduct street checks. There are also no common law policing powers justifying street checks. Both the Vancouver Police Board and the provincial Director of Police Services have the jurisdiction to end the police practice of street checks in Vancouver and BC, respectively. 
Amidst local and global protests against police killings of Black and Indigenous people, political leaders making statements about systemic racism are not enough. We need action now. The harmful, racist and illegal policing practice of street checks must end in Vancouver and across BC.

“Today, we have borne witness to a travesty of justice of spectacular proportions. This verdict is a crushing blow not only for Taner, Özlem, İdil and Günal and their families but for everyone who believes in justice, and human rights activism in Turkey and beyond. 
“The decision of the court is staggering. During 12 court hearings, each and every allegation has been comprehensively exposed as a baseless slur. The court’s verdict defies logic and exposes this three-year trial as the politically motivated attempt to silence independent voices it was from day one.”   
“This case has been a litmus test for the Turkish justice system. As such, it is tragic to see the part it has played and continues to play in criminalizing the act of standing up for human rights. We will continue to stand with our friends and colleagues as they appeal these shameful verdicts.”

Amnesty International is also calling on the international community to take firm action against the “annexation” proposals and illegal Israeli settlements in occupied territory.  
“International law is crystal clear on this matter – annexation is unlawful. Israel’s continued pursuit of this policy further illustrates its cynical disregard for international law. Such policies do not change the legal status of the territory under international law and its inhabitants as occupied nor remove Israel’s responsibilities as the occupying power – rather it points to the ‘law of the jungle’ which should not have a place in our world today,” said Saleh Higazi, deputy regional director for Amnesty Middle East and North Africa. 
“Members of the international community must enforce international law and restate that “annexation” of any part of the occupied West Bank is null and void. They must also work to immediately stop the construction or expansion of illegal Israeli settlements and related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories as a first step towards removing Israeli civilians living in such settlements. 
Null “annexation” 
Under a deal to form a coalition government in April, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and political rival Benny Gantz agreed that a cabinet and parliament deliberations on the domestic process of “annexing” parts of the occupied West Bank, that include Israeli settlements and the area of the Jordan Valley, could begin as of 1 July. 
Annexation is the claim to acquire territory by force and is a flagrant violation of international law. Such a step by Israel would violate the UN Charter, jus cogens norms of international law, and obligations under international humanitarian law. The prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force is enshrined as a fundamental principle in Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.  
Under domestic Israeli law, moves towards further “annexation” of Palestinian territory would mean a continuation of Israeli settlement expansion. It would also further entrench policies of institutionalized discrimination and mass human rights violations that Palestinians face in the OPT resulting from the occupation. 
According to reports, the Israeli proposal could include as much as 33% of the total area of West Bank. 
Recently, dozens of UN experts have voiced concerns that the proposed annexation plan would create a “21st century apartheid”. 
Illegal settlements  
Israel’s policy of settling its civilians in occupied Palestinian territory and displacing the local Palestinian population continues to contravene fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states: “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.”  It also prohibits the “individual or mass forcible transfers, as well as deportations of protected persons from occupied territory”.  
Transferring the occupying power’s civilians into the occupied territory is a war crime. Furthermore, the settlements and associated infrastructure are not temporary, do not benefit Palestinians and do not serve the legitimate security needs of the occupying power. Settlements entirely depend on the large-scale appropriation and/or destruction of Palestinian private and public property which are not militarily necessary.  
“Settlements are created with the sole purpose of permanently establishing Jewish Israelis on occupied land; this is a war crime under international law and “annexation” has no bearing on this legal determination.” Said Saleh Higazi 
Background: 
On 20 April, following Israel’s third elections in 10 months, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his political rival Benny Gantz formed a coalition government under a unity deal. The deal included an agreement which would allow Israel’s government to start the domestic process of “annexing” parts of the occupied West Bank that include Israeli settlements and the area of the Jordan Valley. Israel’s “annexation” plans follow the announcement by US President Donald Trump’s so-called “deal of the century” in January 2020 which proposed areas of the occupied West Bank be annexed by Israel. 
Amnesty International has made it clear that the Trump Administration’s plan would serve only to worsen human rights violations and enshrine the entrenched impunity that has fueled decades of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave violations.  
The international community should also reject the so-called “deal of the century”, and any other proposal seeking to undermine the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including the right of return of Palestinian refugees. Amnesty also calls on governments to offer their full political and practical support to the International Criminal Court (ICC) as it decides on its jurisdiction over the “situation in Palestine”.

The guidelines aim to protect communities, workers and the environment from the risks posed by thousands of mine waste storage facilities, which are failing more frequently and with more severe outcomes. 
Safety First: Guidelines for Responsible Mine Tailings Management states that the ultimate goal of tailings management must be zero harm to people and the environment and zero tolerance for human fatalities. Last year’s tragic dam collapse in Brazil killed 270 people and destroyed the town of Brumadinho, and came on the heels of tailings dam failures at the Mount Polley mine in Canada and the Samarco mine in Brazil, among others. Across the world, communities in the shadow of large tailings dams live in a state of perpetual fear. 
The guidelines come as the Global Tailings Review, co-convened by the international mining industry association, ICMM, investors and the UN Environment Programme, prepares to unveil the first Global Tailings Standard “for the safer management of tailings storage facilities.” 
Current industry standards, including the draft of the Global Tailings Standard released in 2019, do not adequately protect communities and ecosystems from failures. The trend in tailings dam tragedies are a consequence of allowing mining companies to sacrifice safety to cut costs, control auditors and silence dissent among workers. 
Additional report highlights: 
The group publishing the report  includes frontline organizations in mining affected communities from Brazil, Tanzania, Papua New Guinea, India and elsewhere as well as global groups such as Amnesty International Canada, Earthworks, IndustriALL Global Union Federation, MiningWatch Canada, the Natural Resources Defense Council, The Movement of People Affected by Dams (MAB) and the Sierra Club. 
The full report can be found here (including the executive summary). A summary table of the guidelines can be found here, infographics here and here. The Spanish language version is here. Photos and additional spokespeople available upon request. 
Community groups and civil society organizations from around the world highlight the importance of “Safety First: Guidelines for Responsible Mine Tailings Management”: 
“We need independent guidelines on tailings safety because we cannot trust the information that comes from mining companies and their contractors. In Minas Gerais, we have hundreds of at-risk dams which are the result of the historic irresponsible conduct of mining companies. We urgently need guidelines and regulations to manage toxic mine waste dams. We hope that the case of Brumadinho becomes a milestone and an inflection point for mining across the world.” Carolina de Moura of Associação Comunitária da Jangada, Brumadinho, Brazil 
“We’ve seen the disasters of Mount Polley Mine and other failures worldwide–now at an average of over 22 every decade-grossly impacting Indigenous communities, neighboring communities and the land and watersheds they protect. The free, prior and informed consent of local communities is essential to improving the safety of mine tailings storage.” Loretta Williams of First Nations Women Advocating Responsible Mining, Canada 
“In both Alaska and Canada, laws regulating mining have long been outdated.  We need responsible and safe mining–safe not just for mine employees but for the rest of us who live nearby or downstream. We need clean water for future generations.” Frederick Olsen, Jr, of the Southeast Alaska Indigenous Transboundary Commission, US 
“Governments and international institutions need to move urgently to implement these 16 guidelines to end mine waste failures worldwide. Industry self-regulation will not provide adequate protection. There must be a strong global response to this global problem, putting safety first, not profits.”  Ugo Lapointe, MiningWatch Canada, Canada 
“For too long the mining industry has been allowed to cut costs at the expense of safety. Implementing these guidelines would improve tailings dam safety, require respect for affected communities–including the right to say no to tailings dams–and hold mining companies legally and financially accountable for their actions. Any regulations that do not meet the bar set by these guidelines do not go far enough to protect people, ecosystems and livelihoods from catastrophic failures.” Jan Morrill, Earthworks, US 
“By cutting corners on tailings dam design and construction, companies gamble with people’s lives. Respect for human rights and the environment is a responsibility that must be held in the highest regard and factored into all decisions related to tailings dam safety. ‘Human rights above profit’ must become the industry’s new mantra.” Tara Scurr, Amnesty International Canada 
“Mining activities in the Amazon have always been touted as “development” but this rhetoric hides the numerous negative impacts felt by territories and communities. A list of 47 at-risk dams from the National Mining Agency included seven dams in the Amazon states of Pará, Mato Grosso, and Amapa. Mining threatens people, animals, and environmental contamination in the Amazon like we saw in Brumadinho and Mariana in Minas Gerais.” Larissa Santos, Justiça Nos Trilhos, Pará, Brazil 
“As stewards of our lands and waters, we carry a sacred responsibility to the health of future generations of all life. It is critical that mining standards are updated to prevent further harm. “ Gapaygw’m Ganauu. (Pansy Wright-Simms), Wilp Luutkudziiwus Nation, Canada 
“Protecting water and communities needs to become the primary consideration for deciding if a mine is permitted and how toxic mine waste will be managed. “ Gretchen Fitzgerald, Sierra Club Canada Foundation, Canada 
“The San Finx tailings dams illustrate how abandoned facilities continue to threaten lives and livelihoods decades after operations end. Over time, the dams have been simply ignored, threatening thousands of mussel-gatherer families in the Noia estuary downstream.” Joám Evans Pim, Fundação Montescola, Galiza, Spain 
“Mining and its associated activities, whose practices are based on colonial era laws and policies, pose an unacceptable risk to the health, safety, and livelihoods of First Nations throughout British Columbia…By unanimous resolution, the UBCIC Chiefs’ Council fully opposes mining and its associated activities in the headwaters of sacred river systems, and near any aquifers, salmon-bearing streams, or river-ways of cultural and environmental significance.” Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, Canada 
“South African mining bosses keep the administration of tailing dams a secret and lack transparency. They are not accountable to people impacted by their projects.” Hassen Lorgat, Bench Marks Foundation, South Africa 
“These guidelines will help communities understand how to achieve better than ‘best practice’ and hopefully encourage the global mining industry and governments, by adopting these guidelines, to improve the sustainability performance of mines and mining companies around the world.” Gavin Mudd, Mineral Policy Institute, Australia 
“The Mount Polley tailings disaster highlighted the risks these waste dams pose to communities and watersheds in British Columbia. The mining industry can and must do better with their waste and water to reduce risks to the environment and our communities.“ Nikki Skuce, Northern Confluence Initiative, Canada  
“Mine wastes and the pollution that results are often an inter-generational problem. In the Great Basin of the United States there are many mines sites that will require active management for hundreds of years. We need to take responsibility now and not pass on a toxic legacy to our future generations.” John Hadder, Great Basin Resource Watch, USA 
“The 1971 dam failure at the Certej Gold Mine in Romania led to the death of 89 people. Now, Eldorado Gold plans to restart the Certej mining project. It would lead to deforestation, two open pits, two huge waste dumps and the use of cyanide to mine the gold. The new tailings dams would threaten human lives and the environment.” Roxana Pencea Bradatan, Mining Watch Romania, Romania 
“Mining disasters affect us all, but they disproportionately affect Indigenous communities where mining operations are often located. To allow unsafe mining operations in or near Indigenous communities is a clear instance of environmental racism which we should act swiftly to eradicate.” Ana Simeon, RAVEN (Respecting Aboriginal Values and Environmental Needs), Canada 
“We live with the legacy of an abandoned lead and zinc mining site full of waste which has released acid mine drainage into our water since 1979 and is unchecked by the EPA. For the 10 tribes located in this watershed, where is the justice?” Earl L. Hatley, LEAD Agency, Inc., USA 
“No mine waste in our oceans.” Jonathan Mesulam, West Coast Development Foundation, Papua New Guinea  
“The upstream dam construction design is an inherently risky design and poses an unacceptable risk to the health and safety of communities downstream from these structures.” Al Gedicks, Wisconsin Resources Protection Council 
“The risks of containment failure with any large-scale mine are catastrophic, so safety first needs to be the guiding principle for mine siting, design, and construction. All of this is being ignored today in the context of the reckless Pebble Mine, abandoned by the legitimate mining industry but still being pursued by an underfunded Canadian company that has elevated profits over the public interest. This has to stop.” Joel Reynolds, Natural Resources Defense Council, USA 
“People and communities affected by mining are entitled to full reparation for the damage suffered, including damage to ways of life and life plans. The reparation will only be complete when it guarantees the right to restitution, indemnity, compensation, satisfaction and non-repetition.” – Tatiana Ribeiro de Souza, Grupo de Estudos e Pesquisas Socioambientais (GEPSA), Brazil 
“Mining cannot continue to be a one-sided business regarding the distribution of wealth in one hand, and of social and environmental malaises in the other hand.” Marcos A. Pedlowski, PhD in Environmental and Design and Planning, Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense, Brazil 
“The Mt. Polley disaster is too much, and dams under construction in British Columbia are time bombs that will affect my children & grandchildren. More recycling, less consumption, and more justice in mineral extraction.” Stan Tomandl, The Friends of the Stikine Society, Canada 
“While British Columbia touts itself as having some of the safest mine tailings standards in the world, it obviously doesn’t. It falls well short of these 16 guidelines for best practices. This tells us how far we are from truly ensuring safe mine waste storage in Canada and worldwide.” BC Mining Law Reform Network, Canada 
“Globally we confront repeats of community megadeaths from tailings dam failures. These guidelines address the technical failures that make mines a death threat and we pray that corporations and regulators will apply them now.” Richard Kamp and Ricardo Segovia, E-Tech International 
“Safety of tailing management is related to the volume of production. Mining activities should be much smaller therefore tailings can be managed and mining activities do not create massive environmental damage.“ Pius Ginting, Aksi Ekologi & Emansipasi Rakyat (AEER), Indonesia 
‘While mining provides essential minerals for our societies and our energetic transition, we must ensure that these extractive activities are reduced to exploit only what is necessary and embrace a zero waste and circular economy approach. Mine tailings are a huge health and environmental hazard and leave a costly legacy to future generations. Let’s adopt the most stringent standards to maximize the efficiency and safety of the management.” Louise Hénault-ethier, David Suzuki Foundation, Canada 
“The upstream dam construction design is an inherently risky design and poses an unacceptable risk to the health and safety of communities downstream from these structures.” Al Gedicks, Wisconsin Resources Protection Council, United States 
“With recent dam failures in Michigan, the potential for a planned tailings dam on the Menominee River is a recipe for disaster that will affect municipal water supplies and the Great Lakes watershed.” Dale Burie, President of Coalition to SAVE the Menominee River, United States 
“After witnessing disasters at mines like Mount Polley, community members downstream of existing and proposed tailings impoundments are kept awake at night by the what-ifs. What if the impoundment fails because the company is using an unsafe design? What if the impoundment can’t stand up to an earthquake? What if there are a series of unprecedented storm events due to climate change that liquefy the tailings? Regulators must ensure that facilities are sited only where appropriate to prevent disasters, and mining companies should be forced to use Best Available Technology with the highest safety standards possible to help prevent what-if scenarios from ever happening.” Mary Costello, Rock Creek Alliance, United States 
“Indigenous peoples’ lands throughout the world are disproportionately affected by mining. The storage of mine waste and the construction of tailings dams is a matter of vital concern for them, as poor practices in these areas have had devastating impacts on their well-being. Respect for indigenous peoples’ territorial, self-governance and cultural rights is essential in decisions-making around storage of mine waste and tailing dam construction. This implies that their free prior and informed consent (FPIC) must be obtained in accordance with international human rights law standards and indigenous peoples own customs and decision-making processes.” Cathal Doyle, Lecturer and researcher in International Human Rights Law, Business & Human Rights, Indigenous Peoples and Minority Rights, Middlesex University, U.K. 
“Open pit mining is a violence against nature and humanity. When will we realize that the cost is too high?” Barbara Silburt, Halifax Chapter of the Council of Canadians 
“The dumping of tailings in oceans or other bodies of water should never be allowed. Norway is one of five countries allowing dumping in marine waters, and today tailings are being dumped in five Norwegian fjords. The government has even issued permits for three more. Friends of the Earth Norway works together with other Norwegian and international organizations to stop this dumping. Our main answers to the question of what to do with the tailings, are to find alternative uses (circular economy) and backfilling.” Mads Løkeland-Stai, Naturvernforbundet – Friends of the Earth Norway  
“Being a neighbourhood that was potentially downstream from a large mine, these issues are of grave concern to us. After our experience, we feel that every effort should be taken to ensure proper safeguards are in place as mandatory policy instead of being addressed on a one-off basis.” Randy Sunderman, Aberdeen Neighbourhood Association, BC, Canada 
“One of the risks of the proposed Ajax Mine (now rejected by BC and Canada) was the risk that the huge tailings that would sit above the city of Kamloops would collapse from unstable glacial till and the waste would end up running through the middle of Kamloops along Peterson Creek. The existing tailing and pit water from the old Afton mine still present a risk to drinking water for people who live along the creek.” Paula Pick, Kamloops Area Preservation Association (KAPA), Canada 
“ If it had been built, the KGHM Ajax mine waste facility would have been twice the size of the Mount Polley site that failed in 2014, upwind and upstream of a population of approximately 90,000 people, and within 2km of homes and schools in the nearest neighbourhood. A failure of this size from a site perched at a higher elevation above a valley community could bring catastrophic outcomes. It is time to change laws and require standards that ban mine waste sites above inhabited areas”  Gina Morris, Kamloops Moms for Clean Air, Canada 
“Teck Resources’ Elk Valley coal mines are the poster child of BC’s poor mining policy, polluting local waters, killing fish, contaminating local civic water wells and that then cross the international border into Montana, exceeding US standards for selenium. Despite BC’s archaic mining laws, the province continues to approve new mines and expansion with no long term solution to Teck’s water pollution of international waters, while refusing to agree to the engagement of the International Joint Commission.” Dave Hadder, Headwaters Montana, United States 
“Contamination is not always visible to the naked eye. In Madagascar the Rio Tinto QMM ilmenite mine is discharging its wastewater into local lakes and rivers which now demonstrate elevated levels of uranium and lead, well above WHO safe drinking water guidelines, and directly linked to the extraction process… The management of the mine wastewater through a series of mine tailings ponds, and the mine’s required dam facility (which has been downgraded to ‘excavated storage facility’) have yet to be proven to be adequate to protect the environment and local people, having been subject to two overflow incidents in the last two years during heavy rainfall. Much stricter international controls and standards are required to tackle this problem especially where in-country capacity is low and transparency and governance is weak.” Yvonne Orengo, The Andrew Lees Trust, U.K.  
“Mining produces waste. Providing safeguards to ensure that 100% of that waste remains safely and permanently situated in a controlled environment is the only way in which we can justifiably extract resources required by modern society.” Fred Coriell, Save the South Fork Salmon, Idaho, United States 
“Mine waste represents a significant risk to the environment and to the communities, especially in fragile regions. Given that the mining waste remains at its location for centuries, it is imperative to manage the waste properly to avoid damage to the surrounding environment and waters. Unless the waste management program is technically viable and is supported by significant capital, the mining project should not be authorized.” Dmitri Kharitidi, Coalition des Opposants à un Projet minier en Haute-Matawinie (COPH), Canada 
“Slam (mining residues) will be the only legacy that mining will bequeath to future generations of Abitibi in exchange for the plunder of our mineral resources.” Henri Jacob, Action Boréale, Canada 
“The current abdication of environmental regulations has created a terrible opportunity for the company and government collaborators to ‘develop’ properties in an extremely vulnerable zone at the toe of the dam, that happens also to be the epicenter of recorded seismic activity, to be populated by low-income laborers and apartment-dwellers.” Ivan G Weber, Weber Sustainability Consulting, United States 
“We are very concerned about the tailings dams being constructed in Ecuador, particularly the Tundayme dam for the Mirador mine. This dam is slated to be the tallest tailings dam in the world at 260 meters high (three times higher than any other existing dam), with much steeper slopes than usual, thus creating a greater danger of collapse. The dam is in the valley of the Tundayme River, part of the upper Amazon Basin, with thousands of people living downstream. Despite the mine being in an area of high rainfall and high earthquake risk, EcuaCorriente has no plans for any potential tailings dam collapse. Additionally the kind of dams being constructed in Ecuador are constructed in a series of sequential lifts over a number of years. These sequential lifts are known to cause a higher risk of dam collapse, and most developed countries like Australia do not recommend their use. Despite this, Australian companies like Newcrest are constructing these mines in Ecuador and other places.“ Rebekah Hayden, Rainforest Action Group, Ecuador 
“They may be far from public sight, but we have witnessed 10 significant mine waste failures in our province alone since 2008. Some of these failures have damaged waterways and fish habitat for many kilometres downstream. There’s no acceptable reason for this. Governments must act – now, not later – to end mine waste failures.” Coalition Québec Meilleure Mine, Canada 
“Regulatory capture is operative globally. Governments have ceased to defend workers, communities and the environment. Most important task is to keep a light shining on the mining companies, and their uses/abuses of their power. Most important strategy is to find trusted, critical voices about mining and expand them.” Judith Marshall, Associate CERLAC York University

In 5th grade I started my own club for Because I am a Girl which lasted 4 years; the club fundraised enough money to sponsor a young girl in Colombia. I realized I wanted to continue my involvement with non-profit charities and organizations. It wasn’t long after that I found out about Amnesty International. Every year my church hosted a large letter-writing campaign and everyone in the congregation would participate. Once I was old enough, I began to read the case summaries for the campaigns, and I was shocked. Even as an immigrant I had still grown up in the bubble of Canadian privilege. My parents had always been careful to mute the news broadcasts when they started speaking about heavy world issues. Once I broke that bubble of “a perfect world”, I pledged to learn more and educate myself. I realized that the cases Amnesty was petitioning for weren’t stand-alone cases of human rights abuses; they represented a tiny percentage of the hundreds of thousands of human rights abuses happening daily. They were the indicators of a pattern that held hands with corruption and replicated itself time and time again. For me this was a scary revelation. It was the sort of revelation which at first made a young girl like me feel small and powerless. It was the sort of revelation which turned into a sense of responsibility. I got in contact with the national organizers coordinator at Amnesty who was happy to take me under her wing and introduce me to the hopeful world of activism. 
Since my involvement with Amnesty I’ve been granted so many opportunities like attending the annual general meetings, regional meetings, letter writing events and so much more. One of the highlights was in 2019 when I was invited to AI Canada’s Human Rights College; a week-long intimate setting conference specifically for youth. I got to meet more young people like me with dreams as big as the ones on my shoulders. I learnt about the power of letter-writing, and why such traditional means of activism in a digital world are still so effective. I learnt about legality obstacles in human-rights cases, about government corruption cover-ups, OKA and so much more. 
 
With so much information in my head I was able to take it all back and apply it to the community and people that surrounded me. I didn’t need to go across the world to make a difference and that was a much-needed reassurance for the young restless activist in me. At my high school, RH King Academy, I hosted multiple letter-writing campaigns, petition-signings, documentary screenings and one large-scale Red Dress Awareness Campaign which got the attention of the whole school and a local newspaper. I was able to apply my activism toolkit outside of Amnesty campaigns to real issues affecting my generation including the cuts to education, and the environmentalist movement of “Friday’s for Future”. 
Since graduating from high school and moving to Ottawa, I’ve been able to expand my knowledge and community. Being in a city passionate about social justice has given me even more opportunities to attend large-scale rallies, protests, visit embassies and work with other young people to organize campaigns. As a Conflict Studies & Human Rights student I am now able to dedicate myself full-time to doing what I love most! I look forward to seeing where this journey takes me, and grateful for everything I’ve learnt along the way.

“The passing of the national security law is a painful moment for the people of Hong Kong and represents the greatest threat to human rights in the city’s recent history. From now on, China will have the power to impose its own laws on any criminal suspect it chooses. 
“The speed and secrecy with which China has pushed through this legislation intensifies the fear that Beijing has calculatingly created a weapon of repression to be used against government critics, including people who are merely expressing their views or protesting peacefully. 
“The fact that the Chinese authorities have now passed this law without the people of Hong Kong being able to see it tells you a lot about their intentions. Their aim is to govern Hong Kong through fear from this point forward. 
“China’s eagerness to pass this law quickly is also an ominous signal for the legislative elections coming up in Hong Kong in September, with a threat that the security law could be used against pro-democracy candidates. 
“In implementing this law, the Hong Kong authorities must now strictly and demonstrably adhere to their own human rights obligations, and it is down to the international community to hold them to account.  
“At this pivotal moment for Hong Kong, it is imperative that the national security law is not used to trample human rights and undermine the freedoms that distinguish the city from mainland China.” 
Background  
The national security law was passed today and is expected to be signed into law by Chinese President Xi Jinping, after which it will be listed under Annex III of the Basic Law – Hong Kong’s mini-constitution. 
Amnesty International has a range of human rights concerns about the law, under which all individuals, institutions and organizations in Hong Kong would be prohibited from “engaging in activities that endanger national security”. 
The so-called crimes of separatism (or “splittism”), subversion, terrorism and “collusion with foreign or overseas powers” to endanger national security will be banned under the law. These broad, vaguely defined offences are similar to those that feature in China’s own National Security Law, which has been used to crack down on dissent. 
The law would also authorize the Beijing central government and the Hong Kong government to set up a national security office in the city. In mainland China, such agencies systematically monitor, harass, intimidate and secretly detain human rights defenders and dissidents, with many indications of torture and other ill-treatment.  
Hong Kong and Chinese officials have claimed there is an urgent need for security laws to counter the threat of “terrorism” and violence in the city. However, the protesters taking to the streets over the past year have been overwhelmingly peaceful.  
This morning, Geneva time, Hong Kong’s Chief Executive Carrie Lam is slated to address the United Nations Human Rights Council. Last week, more than 50 UN human rights expert bodies mandated by the Council took the unprecedented step to jointly express concerns about the proposed national security legislation for Hong Kong and other actions taken by China.

Global pandemics impact different people and communities in different ways. Amnesty International has been clear with governments that human rights must be at the heart of the COVID-19 response. A human rights response to COVID-19 must include an intersectional approach which recognizes the specific impacts of the pandemic on LBGTQ2S people in Canada, and the need for specific actions to ensure that the pandemic response doesn’t lead to discrimination and further inequalities. Check out our blog on LGBTI rights and COVID-19, which includes a link to our public statment on protecting the human rights of LGBTI people during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Amnesty International is working to monitor human rights violations around the world related to the pandemic, including LGBTI people being specifically targeted by social distancing policies. As a member of Dignity Network Canada, Amnesty International is working to ensure that Canada’s international response to COVID-19, is responsive to the urgent needs of LGBTI communities. 
Follow us on Facebook and Twitter where we regularly post information about the pandemic and LGBTI rights. We will post Amnesty-specific news and actions on our webpage throughout Pride season.

Last August, I spent a week in British Columbia’s Cariboo region when I led a caravan of kids and adults from Vancouver’s lower mainland to the shores of Quesnel Lake in Secwepemc traditional territory. 
Over that August long weekend, we joined dozens of residents and their supporters to celebrate the community’s resilience over the five long years since the Mount Polley mine disaster of August 2014.  
It was incredibly special to share with the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake (CCQL) hundreds of beautiful solidarity messages from Amnesty activists telling them that despite the years that have passed since the disaster, they are not forgotten, that the rights of Indigenous peoples matter and that residents deserve justice for the disaster that affected their lives and altered the western basin of Quesnel Lake in ways we are only beginning to understand. 
This August holiday weekend will mark another grim anniversary. 
Both the United Nations Working Group on Business and Human Rights and the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination have called on Canada to hold those responsible for the disaster to account and provide residents and Indigenous peoples with health impact studies and remedy. 
Despite these important calls from international human rights experts and a recommendation from investigators that the Crown lay criminal charges against those responsible, Amnesty International is extremely disappointed to report that charges have not yet been laid. There is no statutory deadline for laying criminal charges in Canada which means that residents and Indigenous peoples harmed by the disaster have no way of knowing when justice will be served. Meanwhile, Imperial Metals, Mount Polley Mining Corporation’s (MPMC) parent company, continues to operate business as usual. 
Although the company wound down operations at the Mount Polley site near Likely, BC in 2019 citing low copper prices on the international market, in February 2020 the company announced that it would begin exploring a new deposit adjacent to the current site. Given the lack of remedy for the 2014 disaster, the announcement has raised red flags for Indigenous communities and settler residents and prompted a fresh wave of concern. 
Companies like MPMC have a responsibility to respect human rights wherever it operates and this includes participating in meaningful consultations with Indigenous peoples and respecting their right to self-determination. Amnesty International expects MPMC to comply with its responsibilities as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples to determine what forms of economic activity takes place within their traditional territories in accordance with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which British Columbia enshrined in legislation in November, 2019. 
In recognition of the enormous human rights and environmental gaps in BC’s mining regulations exposed  by the Mount Polley disaster, a coalition of 30 civil society and Indigenous organizations in issued a set of recommendations to the BC government that seek to strengthen the Province’s mining regulatory regime. 
It is time for British Columbia to adopt these recommendations and make it harder for companies to abuse human rights, pollute the environment, not pay their fair share, and walk away from their environmental and human rights responsibilities. The BC government must ensure that any approval of exploration or expansion permits sought by MPMC is subject to rigorous scrutiny in line with its obligations to protect human rights and the environment. 
In February 2020, MPMC filed a Notice of Appeal to the BC Environmental Appeal Board, seeking further amendments to its 2017 water discharge permit. The permit allows the company to discharge filtered mine waste into Quesnel Lake for a 5-year period, ending in 2022 and requires it to research alternative methods of water treatment and dispersal at the site. The company’s appeal notes that putting a time limit on water discharges into the lake was no longer reasonable or desirable, particularly in light of its expansion ambitions.  It is asking the Appeal Board to strike the time limit terms contained in the permit and to allow it to continue to send waste directly and indefinitely into Quesnel Lake. 
The CCQL and land defenders will not stand for it. In 2017, the CCQL launched an appeal of discharge permit, calling on the BC Environmental Appeal Board to withdraw the company’s discharge permit. They are waiting for a hearing date. You can read the report commissioned by a qualified expert to support their case. After exhausting all other avenues available, the CCQL believes an appeal to the Board is the last legal remedy available to prevent further damage to Quesnel Lake from the Mount Polley copper mine. 
For more on this story, please see our previous post that tells the story of the CCQL’s Christine McLean’s crusade to protect Quesnel Lake. And please stay tuned for information about the hearing date for the CCQL’s appeal which will take place in Victoria, BC in 2020. 
As the summer approaches, however, we should not despair. The British Columbia government recently revived a technical committee to review testing data obtained from Quesnel Lake. BC scientists say that public campaigns by groups like Amnesty International and others have helped bring the government back to the table and this shows that BC is concerned about what is happening to Quesnel Lake. 
By continuing to support the CCQL, Indigenous water defenders speaking up in defense of Yuct Ne Senxiymetkwe (the Greatest of Lakes, also known as Quesnel Lake) and the right to self-determination, as well as scientists dedicating their lives to studying the effects of the disaster on the lake, we can help them obtain the justice and remedy they so richly deserve. 
Its not too late to sign our online action, write a letter, or send a tweet! 
To keep informed of the CCQL’s appeal hearing dates, please visit the CCQL blog and consider donating to their legal fund. 
For members keen to learn more from scientists studying the effects of climate change, forest fires and the Mount Polley mine disaster on Quesnel Lake, please check out the Quesnel River Research Centre website and look for an announcement about their public open house on Saturday, October 3, 2020. 
To mark World Water Day this year, we asked Amnesty members to call on the BC government to pull the water discharge pipes from Quesnel Lake and protect this pristine environment from further industrial pollution. Over 7100 e-actions so far have been taken and thousands more people engaged over social media. Your voice is making a difference! THANK YOU!

If that name is familiar to you, it’s because the prisoner of conscience and co-founder of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights was repeatedly targeted for his human rights work and peaceful criticism over the past two decades. Before his release from this latest four-year detention, Nabeel Rajab was repeatedly imprisoned and released in 2012, 2014, and 2015. 
Some of the activism for which he was persecuted include giving television interviews and tweeting about the killing of civilians in Yemen by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition and allegations of torture in Jaw prison. In addition to imprisonment, he endured nine months in solitary confinement. 
Responding to his release, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director Lynn Maalouf said:  
“It is a relief that Nabeel Rajab is finally reunited with his family who bravely continued their relentless public campaign for this day to come. While this is a moment to celebrate, it is impossible to forget that he has spent almost four years unjustly separated from them, or to forget the many other peaceful activists who remain behind bars in Bahrain. Nabeel’s release must now be accompanied by the quashing of his conviction and sentence and the dropping of any outstanding charges brought against him in relation to his expression of peaceful opinion. 
Bahrain’s authorities must also release all peaceful activists who remain detained solely for peacefully exercising their right to freedom of expression and other human rights. With fears around an outbreak of COVID-19 in prisons, they must urgently consider further measures to reduce the prison population and ensure the right to health of all detainees.”

“You held my hand. Promised me a revolution. How did you forget me? How?” These lyrics by Lebanese band Mashrou’ Leila echoed at a Cairo concert on a September evening in 2017. They are perhaps more devastatingly relevant today than they were three years ago.  
Sarah Hegazy, a queer feminist in the audience, probably felt a fleeting sense of freedom while watching a popular Arab band with an openly gay frontman sing to a packed audience in a conservative country, and she dared to raise the rainbow flag. Those brief moments of hope where she decided to unapologetically celebrate who she was, changed her life. And three years later, snatched it away too.   
“To my siblings – I tried to find redemption and failed, forgive me. To my friends – the experience [journey] was harsh and I am too weak to resist it, forgive me. To the world – you were cruel, to a great extent, but I forgive.” 
The handwritten note Sarah left behind when she died on 13 June 2020 speaks of the injustice and discrimination that she faced. But it also applies to deeper structural, patriarchal structures and violent attitudes that continue to affect women, queer women, and other LGBTI people around the world every single day.   
A week after the concert, Sarah was arrested along with about 30 other concert attendees and was sexually abused, tortured and arbitrarily detained for three months on charges of “membership in a illegal group” and “promoting the ideas of this group”. The prosecutor ordered Sarah’s detention for 15 days pending investigation related to “membership in an illegal group” and “promoting the ideas of this group” but did not name the group. He kept renewing her detention every 15 days until a judge ordered her release without charge on 2 January 2018. 
Sarah was forced to leave for Canada in exile shortly after her release on bail but continued to experience post-traumatic stress. How could she not? Those that had perpetuated the violence against her enjoyed complete impunity, while she was still haunted by the threats, violence, and abuse she had faced. A year after her arrest, she wrote from Canada about how she had suffered from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and severe anxiety and panic attacks. And had felt constantly fearful, isolated, and how she hadn’t been able to return to Egypt to mourn her mother’s death.  
And now we find ourselves – activists, LGBTI people, allies – many of us in isolation, all mourning the loss of someone we looked at as a beacon of hope, liberation, and love. Someone who had suffered at the hands of the same structures of power and patriarchy that are present in different parts of the world, impacting lives and violating the rights of marginalised groups every single day. Sarah’s death brings up collective but also individualised grief. At this time of great uncertainty, social distancing, and various stages of COVID-19 lockdown, there are understandable feelings of anger, frustration, and fear, which have only increased since Sarah’s passing. And without being able to mark this Pride month by gathering, marching, celebrating and affirming our identities, mourning Sarah’s loss and that of all the other LGBTI people and activists that have gone before and recently, we find ourselves understandably bereft.  
It is at this moment that we must remember the rainbow thread that connects LGBTI people across geographical, racial, ethnic, and other boundaries – offering solidarity, community, and hope. One of the greatest strengths of LGBTI movements across the world has been their ability to offer support, advice, solidarity, and in many thousands of cases, a sense of family to other LGBTI people when they feel abandoned or misunderstood by their biological ones. This sense of community is what many LGBTI people have relied on, and have been nurtured, grounded, and supported by to live their lives truthfully and authentically. It’s a sense of community that other groups are adopting in the COVID-19 response, where neighbourhoods, families, and communities are coming together to offer support, food supplies, and general help. 
But that support hasn’t necessarily been extended to LGTBI people as equally in these past few months since the pandemic hit. Many LGBTI people have found themselves in lockdown with people or family members who are hostile, or unaccepting of their sexualities or identities, and are facing mental health challenges as a result. Some might be in countries where same-sex conduct and diverse gender identities are criminalised, making them less able to report violence, harassment and abuse.  
To those friends, we want to express our utmost solidarity and remind them that they aren’t alone. Although the support and sense of community may not be as visible as before, it still exists. We join human rights and LGBTI rights organisations around the world in calling for governments to provide protection and reporting mechanisms for LGBTI people facing violence and harassment during lockdown. There are also a number of support and community groups that people can reach out to if they need mental health support. 
While there may not be physical manifestations of Pride this year, there are many online ones. Global Pride is a 24-hour digital pride celebration on 27 June featuring a stellar line up of performances, talks, discussions, and a coming-together of most of the world’s city Prides.  And on 28 June, Amnesty UK launches its own digital Pride platform with similarly entertaining, informative, affirming content sourced from partner organisations, which will run for a month. 
At this time of division, distance, and distress, we affirm our commitment to fighting for a world that not only accepts but celebrates sexual orientation and gender identity-based diversity. A world where Sarah Hegazy and others who have lost their lives to the struggle for LGBTI – or indeed, other – rights, could have lived and thrived. That world of compassion, equality and love is ours, and it can only be achieved if we continue to fight the forces of patriarchy, intolerance, and division together.  
Stay safe, remember that we are connected, and happy Pride (inside)!

The organization warned that existing inequalities have been entrenched by months of lockdown measures, exposing LGBTI people to terrifying levels of discrimination, stigma, hostility and violence.  
“This Pride weekend, LGBTI people, activists and allies around the world will show that even a global pandemic cannot stop them from demanding the rights which many governments continue to deny them,” said Nadia Rahman, Researcher and Policy Advisor in Amnesty International’s Gender, Sexuality and Identity Team. 
“While virtual celebrations are a moment of hope in difficult times, countless LGBTI people will be spending Pride trapped in hostile or dangerous lockdown situations where their sexualities or identities are not accepted.  
“There is an urgent need for governments to provide concrete, tailored support to LGBTI people in their countries. This includes ensuring equal access to medical services, removing barriers to employment and social security, and providing safe spaces for LGBTI people facing violence and harassment.” 
Attacked and excluded 
Some governments have used the pandemic as a justification to crack down on LGBTI people, pass measures that severely infringe on their rights or stigmatise them. For example in Uganda, 23 youth were arrested from a shelter for LGBTI people they lived in, on the pretext that they were guilty of “a negligent act likely to spread infection of disease,” as well as “disobedience of lawful orders.”  
In the Philippines, police forced three LGBTI people to perform humiliating acts as punishment for supposedly violating the curfew. The punishment was recorded on video and posted on social media.  
LGBTI people have been historically marginalized in the allocation of recourses, faced discrimination in access to health care, employment and housing, and have faced targeted criminalization laws, harassment, intimidation, arbitrary arrests, and killings by state and non-state actors. This crisis, and the individual government responses to it, have exacerbated these inequalities. 
For example in India, the stimulus package announced by the Union government failed to include transgender people, even though India’s transgender population mostly make ends meet as daily wage workers, and have been seriously impacted by the crisis. 
Sarah Hegazy 
Amnesty International highlighted the recent death of Sarah Hegazy, a queer Egyptian activist who had been arbitrarily detained and tortured by the Egyptian authorities, as a devastating example of the cost of state-backed discrimination.  
Sarah had been forced into exile to Canada about eighteen months before she took her own life, plunging LGBTI activists around the world into grief. She had written about the isolation of living in exile and her despair at the impunity enjoyed by the Egyptian authorities.  
“Sarah Hegazy was a beacon of hope, liberation, and love. As we mourn her death, we stand in solidarity with all those around the world who have faced similar injustice, discrimination and cruelty,” said Nadia Rahman.  
“While activists around the world will carry on Sarah’s legacy, we cannot do this alone. Governments have a responsibility to respect and protect LGBTI people. Their lived histories and equal rights within their societies must be protected, celebrated, and integrated with policies and laws preventing discrimination against them.” 
The pandemic has exposed the numerous ways in which LGBTI people are still excluded and discriminated against. At a time when we should be realigning all our laws and policies to ensure the most marginalized are safe and well, this cannot be tolerated.

With a sharp increase in settlement expansion underway, and persistent attacks on Palestinians and their properties by some Israeli settlers, it is more important than ever that companies do not further legitimize settlements by doing business in them. 
Amnesty International today submitted a petition to TripAdvisor’s CEO Stephen Kaufer, signed by more than 300,000 people from around the world, calling on the company to pull out of illegal settlements. The company has not responded to Amnesty International’s requests for comment. 
“Israeli settlements violate international law and amount to war crimes. Companies which operate in the settlements are contributing to human rights violations and tacitly supporting Israel’s policy of forcing Palestinians out of their homes and crushing their basic rights,” said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“It is shameful that TripAdvisor has failed to update its policies, even as Israel forges ahead with increasingly aggressive land grabs that will intensify the suffering of Palestinians. Trip Advisor must comply with its responsibility to respect human rights and refrain from contributing to war crimes.” 
In 2019 Amnesty International documented how digital tourism companies fuel and profit from war crimes and human rights violations against Palestinians by promoting attractions on illegally occupied land. 
Since 1967 tens of thousands of Palestinian properties have been demolished and whole communities forcibly displaced to make way for illegal settlements. Natural resources have been diverted and appropriated to settlements, which flourish while Palestinians communities face systematic and institutionalized human rights violations. 
International law is clear that establishing settlements in occupied territory is illegal and constitutes a war crime, and the international community has long opposed these violations. 
Earlier this year, the UN published a database listing more than 100 companies with business links to settlements, including TripAdvisor. Listed companies which continue their involvement in settlements are knowingly breaching their international obligations to “avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities and address such impacts when they occur”. 
Tourism industry driving violations 
Amnesty’s research shows that the tourism industry plays an important role in driving settlement expansion by drawing in visitors who boost their economies, and by legitimizing and normalizing the existence of settlements. TripAdvisor is the most visited online tourism website by foreign visitors to Israel, and it promotes at least 70 places to stay or things to do in Israeli settlements. 
Following the publication of Amnesty’s report in 2019, TripAdvisor said: 
“We understand that this issue is a sensitive matter with cultural and political implications.  The listing of a property or business on TripAdvisor does not represent our endorsement of that establishment.” 
Since then the company has not changed any of its policies and TripAdvisor’s website continues to carry listings which present what are, in effect, crime scenes, as exciting tourist destinations. For example, it lists a vineyard and an archaeological site in Susya in the southern Hebron hills, an ever-expanding settlement which has forced generations of Palestinians out of their homes and continues to cause human rights violations for the displaced community. It is a site which Palestinians are not allowed to enter – including those ex-residents of the village on whose ruins the site was constructed. 
“TripAdvisor’s response completely ignores the hard facts of international law, as well as the fact that its own listings pump money into the settlement economy,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“While tourists in Susya settlement enjoy wine and a swimming pool, Palestinians on the other side of a barbed wire fence live in makeshift shelters slated for demolition and struggle to find clean water. Tourism is sustaining this outrageous situation.” 
Amnesty campaigner punished 
Shortly after the release of Amnesty’s report, Israel placed Israel/OPT campaigner Laith Abu-Zeyad under a punitive travel ban. Laith, who lives in the West Bank, has been given no justification for the ban nor a meaningful opportunity to challenge it. Not only can he not travel abroad, he was barred from crossing into Jerusalem to visit his mother before she died, for undisclosed “security reasons”. There is every reason to believe the ban is a response to Laith’s human rights work and Amnesty’s documentation of violations by Israel. 
“Laith’s case shows the brutal reality of the Israeli occupation. TripAdvisor is contributing to a system which displaces, traps and traumatizes millions of Palestinians, and punishes those who speak out,” said Saleh Higazi. 
Deteriorating situation 
According to Peace Now, there has been a sharp increase in settlement expansion since the beginning of the year, and the release of US President Donald Trump’s so-called “deal of the century”. At the same time, violence perpetrated by settlers against Palestinians has continued throughout the OPT, including East Jerusalem, with Israeli authorities rarely intervening. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, since the release of the Trump deal there have been at least 250 incidents involving violence, intimidation or trespass carried out by Israeli settlers. 
The Israeli government soon plans to put in motion its proposed annexation of large swathes of the West Bank. The plan was set out in the Trump Administration’s so-called “peace deal” which was announced without Palestinian consultation and has been rejected by most of the international community. International law prohibits annexation of occupied territory in any circumstances. 
“Against this backdrop it is more important than ever that businesses update their policies and cease activities in the settlements, to make it clear that they do not support Israel’s flagrant violations of international law,” said Saleh Higazi. 
“By continuing to do business with settlements TripAdvisor is siding with the abusive policies of the Israeli government and the Trump administration, ignoring the suffering of Palestinians, and going against international law.”

But three months later, and even after government extended existing emergency income supports, many sex workers remain out of work and ineligible to receive emergency income supports, and all are working in precarious conditions. 
“Sex workers are one of the most marginalized groups of people in Canada,” said Jenn Clamen, National Coordinator of the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform. “Sex workers and other marginalized groups should be at the heart of the government’s pandemic response, but instead, continue to be ignored. Sex workers’ rights to health, safety, and dignity need to be protected in the context of a pandemic, so that they, too, can support themselves and their families.” 
Like millions of people across Canada, most sex workers abruptly lost their income because of COVID-19 lockdown measures across Canada. But unlike workers in other industries, sex workers have largely been unable to access emergency income supports because the criminalization of sex work isolates sex workers from formal income reporting mechanisms like filing taxes, and because many live and work in poverty and do not meet the income thresholds for emergency benefits. Others, still, will not engage with government institutions for fear of repercussions due to criminalization, stigma and discrimination.  
Over 125 human rights, women’s rights, LGBTI, health and sex workers’ rights organizations from across Canada endorsed a letter calling on the federal government to provide emergency income supports equivalent to the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) to sex workers during the pandemic. 
UNAIDS has called “on all countries to take immediate, critical action, grounded in human rights principles, to protect the health and rights of sex workers” such as by ensuring “access to national social protection schemes for sex workers, including income support schemes.” 
“Sex workers have been reaching out to the federal government since the pandemic began, calling for emergency income supports,” said Jackie Hansen of Amnesty International Canada. “It is shameful and unfeminist for the government of Canada to deny sex workers the supports available to other people in Canada. Denying income supports to sex workers increases poverty and the risk of experiencing violence. For Canada’s pandemic response to be grounded in human rights, the government must take urgent action, working in close partnership with sex workers and the organizations that serve them, to create low-barrier methods of getting emergency income supports to those who most need them.” 
The health, safety, and wellbeing of sex workers and their families has been profoundly impacted by the exclusion of sex workers from emergency income supports. A March report produced by organizations in Metro Vancouver including Aboriginal Front Door Society, Health Initiative for Men, PACE Society, WISH, and Living in Community indicated that almost 80% of respondants feared not having enough money to buy groceries in the next two weeks, and almost 30% feared not being able to pay rent. One sex worker noted “I am too scared to go to work because I have to deal with the public and direct contact with cash.” 
A separate report prepared in April by Butterly, an organization working with Asian and migrant sex workers across the country, revealed that Butterfly received more than 500 calls and text messages from sex workers worried about their health and safety, and their inability to pay for food and rent. It noted that Asian sex workers reported increased racism and targeted violence and were blamed for the pandemic. One sex worker reported that “people lost their jobs, and life is much tougher without any income. And not only that, our living expenses have increased too, we also have to spend money on masks, gloves, and disinfec­tants. My only request is that I hope the government to give income support to everyone regardless their immigration status, or whether they are receiving social assistance… I also hope that government would grant permanent residency status to people without status.” 
To respond to the crisis, sex worker rights organizations and advocacy groups across the country have raised money from within their communities to support each other to pay rent, and buy groceries, medication, and other necessities. Limited funding is available to some organizations working with sex workers through the federal government’s Community Emergency Response Fund and funding from the Ministry of Women and Gender Equality. However, such funds are limited and not a substitute for income replacements.  
In 2014, selling sex was made illegal in Canada for the first time; everything from selling sex in a public space, purchasing sex in all spaces, advertising, and working as a third party. Criminalization results in surveillance and police presence in the lives of people who are already overpoliced through racial and social profiling. As a result, many sex workers are isolated, do not have a bank account, may not file taxes, and are likely to be fearful of government and law enforcement because of the criminalized nature of sex work. Laws criminalizing sex work continue to be enforced across Canada during the pandemic. 
“The criminalization of sex work is a huge barrier to granting sex workers access to COVID-19 emergency income supports” says Clamen. “This government has the power to protect sex workers’ rights by decriminalizing sex work, or at the very least, putting a moratorium on the use of criminal laws that make it even more difficult for sex workers to gain supports and care in the context of a pandemic. Government claimed in the past to be interested in protecting sex workers but they have been nowhere in sight during this pandemic. Denying sex workers emergency income replacements demonstrates, yet again, that criminalizing sex work leads to the human rights of sex workers being violated.”

Honourable Mary Ng, MP
Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade
Global Affairs Canada
House of Commons
Ottawa, ON  K1A 1A0  

Dear Minister Ng, 
We are writing this Open Letter to you as the minister responsible for Export Development Canada (EDC) with regards to a May letter from EDC’s President and CEO Mairead Lavery. The EDC letter is a response to the more than 8,700 emails she received from Amnesty Canada supporters and others. The emails denounce the 2016 loan from EDC to Empresas Públicas de Medellín (EPM) for the construction of the Hidroituango dam on the Cauca River in Colombia.  
The emails ask why EDC approved the loan despite longstanding opposition from local communities, credible warnings of corruption and social and environmental harm, and ample evidence that the project would exacerbate human rights violations and armed conflict in the region. Ms. Lavery’s response fails to adequately answer this question. She merely states that EDC was “satisfied with the results” of its due diligence screenings.  
We forwarded Ms. Lavery’s letter to the Ríos Vivos Movement, an association of communities affected by the dam. Their spokesperson, Isabel Zuleta, met with EDC in 2019 to raise concerns about Canada’s unmet obligations and responsibilities arising from its financing of Hidroituango. Rios Vivos told us that they remain deeply concerned that EDC’s screenings did not heed the reports of independent experts or the serious issues raised by communities in the region. “The question remains,” Rios Vivos asks, “what good is a study of potential risks if it does not identify the vulnerability of the communities and the territory?”  
We share Rios Vivos’s concern. And we are troubled that this is not an isolated case. Some twenty years ago, EDC financed the construction of another dam project in Colombia. The Urrá I Dam, on the Sinú River, also caused devastating and long-lasting harm, including the violation of Indigenous people’s rights. The Embera Katío people, whose territory the dam flooded, were not consulted, nor did they give their free, prior and informed consent for the project. But they were forced to suffer the project’s impacts on their right to life and health, and the violence that came with the dam. 
After Canadian parliamentarians heard compelling eyewitness testimony from Embera Katío leader Kimy Pernía Domicó in 1999, EDC promised changes  that would ensure that such damaging projects would no longer receive its support. Kimy was forcibly disappeared in 2001 and is presumed to have been killed. 
Once again, in 2016, EDC provided financing for another devastating hydro dam in Colombia.  
For decades, EDC’s response to scrutiny has been the promise of reform. Ms. Lavery makes this same promise. She claims EDC has undergone “significant change” regarding its due diligence screening, including a new human rights policy and “much more local community engagement.” Yet EDC has not provided details about how these reforms will be implemented or what weight EDC will ultimately give human rights in its decision-making. Furthermore, Ms. Lavery’s letter makes no reference to the Amnesty request that EDC adopt a standard practice of undertaking independent human rights impact assessments using UN benchmarks, and commit to international standards of meaningful consultation and the free, prior and informed consent of affected Indigenous peoples. Silence on this vital point is extremely worrying.  
EDC’s letter also fails to address the call for remediation. The Hidroituango dam has impacted tens of thousands of people who depend on the Cauca River to earn their living. Hundreds of families were forcibly evicted to make way for the project. Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes in 2018, after one of the dam’s tunnels collapsed. Moreover, in recent years at least six members of Ríos Vivos have been killed, amidst scores of threats and attacks. While EDC acknowledges the need for ongoing due diligence after a transaction is signed, the agency has not assumed its responsibility to remedy the adverse impacts that its financing produced.  
We reiterate the call that EDC advocate publicly for the rights and safety of the people adversely affected by Hidroituango, in communication with them and in accordance with their wishes. EDC should leverage its relationship with EPM and governments in Colombia to reinforce the demands of community leaders who are at risk for speaking out about ongoing impacts and human rights violations. 
EDC is an agent of the Government of Canada and acts on its behalf. The government must step in to ensure that EDC makes the appropriate reparations to people harmed by Hidroituango. The government must also urgently reform EDC’s governing legislation so that that the agency no longer supports such damaging projects and to put in place meaningful accountability mechanisms, as per our submission to the 2018 review of the Export Development Act.  
We wholeheartedly agree with Ms. Lavery that the work of human rights defenders and community activists is essential. To prevent the kind of human rights harms associated with projects like Urrá I and Hidroituango, these people’s input must inform EDC decision-making. 
Together with Ríos Vivos, we await your response.

Everyone is...","A human rights response to COVID-19 must include an intersectional approach which recognizes the specific impacts of the pandemic on LGBTI people, and the need for specific actions to ensure that the pandemic response doesn’t lead to discrimination and further inequalities. 
Everyone is impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. But we aren’t all impacted in the same ways or to the same extent. Multiple and intersecting identities including gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, disability, age, family status, employment status, and immigration status, all shape how a person experiences the pandemic. 
LGBTI people face significant discrimination which leads to barriers to accessing healthcare services; high rates of homelessness, poverty, and social isolation; and high rates of harassment and violence. The pandemic has further exacerbated these inequalities. 
According to Egale Canada, before the pandemic, 27% of transgender patients have been refused care in Canada. Since the pandemic began, in Canada and around the world, access to gender affirming care and sexual and reproductive health services has been drastically reduced or redirected to the COVID-19 response. Some people may not be able to access medication. Sexual and reproductive health services must be declared essential services so that access isn’t limited during the pandemic. 
Chosen family and support networks are critical for LGBTI people around the world. With mandatory social distancing measures in place in much of the world, LGBTI people may be cut off from support groups and social services, including those providing access to food, medicine, and peer support. Some civil society organizations serving LGBTI communities have seen their work increase as they support community members and pivot to contribute to the pandemic response. Many fear financial insecurity due to decreased donations, cancelled grants, and the inability to hold fundraising events because of social distancing guidelines. 
In some countries, including Panama and Peru, social distancing guidelines call for men and women to have separate days when they are allowed to leave their homes to buy groceries and run other errands. The guidelines don’t account for non-binary people, or transgender people whose identification documents may not correspond with their gender identity, leading to harassment by authorities and the general public. 
LGBTI people are more likely to experience poverty and homelessness. Less than 50% of transgender people in Canada are employed full-time and 25-45% of the homeless youth population in Canada identifies as LGBTI. According to Egale Canada, an estimated half of LGBTI households have faced lay-offs or reduced employment hours because of the pandemic, compared to 39% of households in Canada overall. 
Some governments are using far reaching emergency powers to criminalize LGBTI people. In late March, 23 people living at a shelter for LGBTI people in Kampala, Uganda, were arrested for violating social distancing guidelines, despite there not being guidelines on how many people could gather in private homes or shelters. In Hungary, parliament passed new legislation during the pandemic, which prohibits transgender people from legally changing their gender identity. This sort of state overreach is why Amnesty International signed a joint public statement from 301 organizations, academics, and others calling on Canada to adopt robust oversight measures to help ensure that the pandemic response does not further rights violations, including violations of the rights of LGBTI people. 
A pandemic is not an excuse to violate human rights. Amnesty International has called on governments to ensure that human rights are at the core of the pandemic response and recovery plans. The pandemic is an opportunity to re-envision what the COVID-19 world should look like – and that must be a world where the rights of LGBTI people are respected, protected, and upheld.

For many people, the quarantine is the first time their in lives that they have had their movement restricted. But for four years now I haven’t been able to walk to the store in my neighbourhood alone because if I do I fear they will kill me. I can’t go to the countryside or go out to have fun, because that would mean risking my life. 
For the social leaders living under threat in Colombia, this has been our reality for years. Because of our dedication to defending the lives of all people, we cannot enjoy our own. We are locked inside, moving from house to house to hide and only going out for basic necessities. However, in the current context, being at home 24 hours a day is a death sentence because the gunmen know where to find us. We are now an even easier target for those who want to silence us. 
There has been no reduction in the systematic violence we face, despite the pandemic. More than 100 social leaders and human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia so far in 2020, at least 28 of them since the 25 March decree imposing a mandatory quarantine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  
In the past few years, I have been the target of death threats, constant surveillance and raids. I have been photographed in the street and last year I had to leave the country for a while when a plot to kill me came to light. I believe the violence I experience is linked to my work defending the territory and collective rights of the Afro-descendent communities of Buenaventura and the complaints I have made at local, national and international levels about the negative impact of the expansion of the port in the city. 
A few months before the pandemic, I had to leave the place where I was living because we realized I was being watched and my safety was at risk. As a result, I’ve had to stay in a city that is not my own during quarantine. Being in a place where I don’t know anyone creates uncertainty and a great deal of anxiety. I don’t feel at ease; I’m still very concerned about my situation and that of other social leaders who are also very vulnerable in their territories. 
Our enemies are still killing us and it’s not difficult for them during the pandemic because we are all at home, complying with the mandatory quarantine which means nobody can move. But it seems that the people who want to silence us are moving around without any problem. We are seeing a pattern whereby illegal armed groups come to social leaders’ homes and kill them in front of their families. In some cases, they kill their relatives as well.  
In addition, communities have begun to see armed groups handing out leaflets to threaten people, saying that they’re killing those who do not comply with the quarantine or who allegedly have COVID-19. They’re accusing social leaders of not complying with the quarantine in order to divert attention from the real political motive for the killings. It’s as if they now have a public health reason for killing us. In March, for example, the leader Yina Paola Sánchez Rodríguez reported that armed groups had declared her a military target for allegedly infecting members of her community in the municipality of Montelíbano, Córdoba. The leader, who insisted she was in perfect health, had to flee the territory because of the threats.  
Unfortunately, being a social leader has become one of the most dangerous jobs in Colombia today. This situation not only endangers our lives, but also the democratic and participatory system in the country because we play an important role in the exercise of governance and promoting and defending the right to participate, as well as in promoting constitutional rights and defending human rights.  
But instead of recognizing the importance of our work and seeing an opportunity for collaboration, the government has turned its back on us and keeps us under surveillance, as if we were a threat to the system, and treats us like criminals. We have no connection with armed groups, but they try to link us to them, creating judicial “false positives”. The only weapon we use is our voice and our desire to contribute to the realization of the collective aspirations of our communities. We’re only defending our rights and we’re deeply concerned that in Colombia our work is treated as if it were a crime. 
The government must take urgent and decisive measures to guarantee our security and carry out a campaign of non-stigmatization of the work of social leaders. People must realize that every time they buy food in a supermarket, they are directly benefiting from our struggle. It is members of ethnic minority communities who are being killed to protect the collective rights to land and territory, but all the people of Colombia enjoy the fruits of our territories, thanks to our blood. 
We cannot carry on drowning in an ocean of impunity. Every day brings new threats and attacks and the risks we face intensify. The protection measures implemented by the state don’t mitigate the dangers and the authorities don’t solve cases or follow up our complaints properly. It seems that the people who commit these crimes that violate our rights to life and to freedom of expression, participation and organization are untouchable, both in Buenaventura and in other strategic territories in the country.  
The Colombian authorities also have an obligation to guarantee our access to justice. They must establish who is behind the violence we face and their connection to the political role that social leaders play. Who is disturbed or who might be harmed by the work we do to defend our territories and human rights? Who benefits from our deaths?

Sanaa Seif was taken to the office in Cairo of the Supreme State Security Prosecution, a branch of the Public Prosecution specialized in investigating national security threats. Family and supporters gathered outside the office subsequently learnt that prosecutors had questioned her over the charges of “disseminating false news”, “inciting terrorist crimes” and “misuse of social media.” 
Sanaa Seif’s brother, activist Alaa Abdel Fatah, has been in arbitrary detention since September 2019. On 22 June, Sanaa Seif, her mother and sister were waiting outside the Tora Prison Complex to receive a letter from him when they were beaten and robbed by a group of women armed with sticks, in full view of security forces.  
“Sanaa Seif and her family have suffered years of harassment and intimidation for their human rights activism, but the events of the past two days mark another new low. The fact that Sanaa Seif was taken from right outside the Public Prosecutor’s office shows just how brazen the Egyptian security forces have become,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The Public Prosecutor now has a choice: either to uphold the law and investigate the attacks against Sanaa Seif and her family, including the role of the security forces in yesterday’s assault, or to be complicit with the security forces in targeting Sanaa Seif and her family simply for questioning her brother’s arbitrary detention and inquiring about his health amid a pandemic.” 
“Sanaa Seif’s arrest took place only one day after she, her sister and mother were assaulted by several women in front of the Tora Prison Complex while members of security forces stood by. We call on the Egyptian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Sanaa Seif and end their relentless harassment of her family. We also repeat our call on them to immediately and unconditionally release Alaa Abdel Fattah and, in the meantime, ensure that he is able to communicate with his family.” 
Background 
On 22 June, Sanaa Seif was waiting outside the Tora Prison Complex in Cairo to receive a letter from her arbitrarily detained brother, Alaa Abdel Fattah. Her mother, Laila Soueif, and sister, Mona Seif, were with her. A group of women approached the family and beat them with sticks, tore their clothes, dragged them onto the ground and stole some of their belongings. One policeman reportedly pushed Laila Soueif towards the assailants, while another ordered the assailants to “take them outside [the waiting area]”. The assault left visible marks on the women’s bodies according to photos that Amnesty International has examined.

0,USA: End unlawful police violence against Black Lives Matter protests,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/usa-end-unlawful-police-violence-against-black-lives-matter-protests/,"Amnesty International identifies and maps out police violence nationwide since 26 May Almost 500 videos and photographs of incidents analyzed 125 incidents in 40 states highlight where police used force on peaceful protesters, journalists and bystanders New campaign calls for wide-ranging police...","Police forces across the USA committed widespread and egregious human rights violations against people protesting the unlawful killings of Black people and calling for police reform, Amnesty International said today, as it launched an interactive map of incidents of police violence and a new campaign calling for systemic changes in policing. 
Amnesty International has documented 125 separate examples of police violence against protesters in 40 states and the District of Columbia between 26 May and 5 June 2020, a period when hundreds of thousands of people in the USA and other countries protested against racism and police violence and to demand that Black lives matter. The analysis shows that law enforcement officers violated human rights daily out on the streets instead of fulfilling their obligations to respect and facilitate the right of people to peacefully protest. 
This unlawful use of force included beatings, misuse of tear gas and pepper spray, and the inappropriate firing of less-lethal projectiles, such as sponge rounds and rubber bullets. Those abuses were committed by a range of security forces from state and local police departments, federal agencies, and the National Guard. 
“The analysis is clear: when activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in cities and towns across the USA to peacefully demand an end to systemic racism and police violence, they were overwhelmingly met with a militarized response and more police violence,” said Brian Castner, Senior Crisis Advisor on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. 
“The time for applying band-aids and making excuses for a few ‘bad apples’ has passed. What’s needed now is systemic, root-and-branch reform of US policing that brings an end to the scourge of police use of excessive force and extrajudicial executions of Black people. Communities should not live in fear of being harmed by the very officers that have sworn an oath to protect them. Officers responsible for excessive force and unlawful killings must always be held accountable.” 
Open source investigation into US protests 
To evaluate these incidents, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab gathered almost 500 videos and photographs of protests from social media platforms. 
This digital content was then verified, geolocated, and analyzed by investigators with expertise in weapons, police tactics, and international and US laws governing the use of force. 
In some cases, researchers were also able to interview victims and confirm police conduct with local police departments.   
Police violence in dozens of states 
As the map shows, Amnesty International’s analysis reveals a dizzying array of violations by police forces across the country, including in 80% of US states. 
On 30 May, a joint patrol of Minneapolis police and Minnesota National Guard personnel unlawfully shot US-manufactured 37/40mm impact projectiles at people peacefully standing on the front porches of their homes. After encountering the people recording with their smartphones, the forces ordered them to “get inside” and then yelled “light them up” before firing. 
On 1 June, security personnel from a variety of federal agencies, including National Park Police and the Bureau of Prisons, as well as DC National Guard personnel, committed a range of human rights violations against protesters in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC. They used riot shields to shove protesters and media workers, misused a variety of crowd control agents, and tossed US-manufactured Stinger Ball grenades, which contain pepper spray and explode in a concussive “flash-bang” effect, throwing rubber pellets indiscriminately in all directions. The attack, which preceded a photo op by President Trump in front of a nearby church, was widely reported on by media, including a lengthy Washington Post video timeline for which Amnesty International contributed the weapons and tactical analysis. 
Also on 1 June, in the Center City area of Philadelphia, state and city police used large amounts of tear gas and pepper spray to remove dozens of peaceful protesters from the Vine Street Expressway. One affected protester, Lizzie Horne, a rabbinical student, told Amnesty International: 
“Out of the blue, they started breezing pepper spray into the crowd. There was one officer on the median who was spraying as well. Then they started with tear gas. Someone who was right in the front – who had a tear gas canister hit his head – started running back. And we were trying to help him, flushing his eyes and then he just fainted and started having a seizure. He came to pretty quickly. As we were finally lifting him up and start getting him out of the way, they started launching more tear gas; that’s when people started to get really scared. They started gassing in a kettle formation – we were against a big fence that people had to jump over, up a steep hill. The fence was maybe six feet tall. People started putting their hands up – but the cops wouldn’t let up. It was can after can after can. We were encapsulated in gas. We were drooling and coughing uncontrollably. 
“Then the cops came from the other side of the fence and started gassing from that direction. After that, the police started coming up the hill and … they were hitting and tackling people. They were dragging people down the hill and forcing them down on their knees, lining them up kneeling on the median on the highway with their hands in zip ties, and pulling down their masks and spraying and gassing them again.” 
The violations were not limited to the largest cities. Local police inappropriately used tear gas against peaceful protesters in Louisville, Kentucky; Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Albuquerque, New Mexico, among other towns and cities. And in Fort Wayne, Indiana on 30 May, a local journalist lost his eye when police shot him in the face with a tear gas grenade. 
Legal analysis of use of force 
Excessive use of force against peaceful protesters violates both the US Constitution and international human rights law. Law enforcement agencies at all levels have a responsibility to respect, protect, and facilitate peaceful assemblies. 
While the majority of the protesters have been peaceful, some protesters have used violence. In many cases, however, rather than respond to individual violations, security forces have used disproportionate and indiscriminate force against entire demonstrations. 
Security forces can only resort to use of force at public assemblies when it is absolutely necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective, in response to serious violence threatening the lives or rights of others. Even then, authorities must strictly distinguish between peaceful demonstrators or bystanders, and any individual who is actively engaged in violence. The violent acts of an individual never justify the disproportionate use of force against peaceful protesters generally, and force is only justified until the immediate threat of violence toward others is contained. 
Any restrictions of public assemblies – including use of force against demonstrators – must not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, political ideology, or other social group. 
Police reform urgently needed 
In an Executive Order issued on 16 June, President Trump called for incentives to limit the use of chokeholds of the kind that killed George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, as well as a national database on allegations of excessive force by police. 
Some state and city police forces have also rolled out partial reforms locally since the protests began, such as suspending the use of some crowd control weapons like tear gas. In Minneapolis, a majority of the City Council pledged to disband the police force and replace it with more effective public safety institutions. 
Amnesty International is demanding real and lasting reforms to US policing across the board, including to: 
“Real, systemic and lasting police reform is needed at all levels to ensure that people across the country feel safe to walk the streets and express their opinions freely and peacefully without facing a real threat of harm from the very officers that are supposed to protect them. This is a Constitutional right that is mirrored in international human rights law; to deny this right with physical violence, tear gas and pepper spray is a hallmark of repression,” said Brian Griffey, USA Researcher/Advisor at Amnesty International.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Sixties Scoop Network launches innovative mapping project for 60s Scoop survivors  
(Ottawa/Unceded Algonquin Territory –  June 22 2020) This morning, the Sixties Scoop Network (formerly the National Indigenous Survivors of Child Welfare Network) launched a ground-breaking interactive map to visualize the displacement of Sixties Scoop survivors and share their stories.  
The Sixties Scoop Network is launching In our own Words: Mapping the Sixties Scoop Diaspora in collaboration with Dr. Raven Sinclair, a University of Regina professor who initiated the Pe-kīwēwin project to uncover the history behind the policies that lead to a disproportionate number of Indigenous children in care. The project will support survivors in finding and reconnecting with family members and accessing services and support resources. 
“Before today, there was nothing in place for 60s Scoop survivors to share their stories, visualize their geographic displacements, and reconnect with family members,” said Colleen Hele-Cardinal, a 60s Scoop survivor and creator of In our own Words. “It’s striking to see where the survivors were born and where they were relocated to – some were taken thousands of kilometres away from home to Europe, the US and overseas” 
The mapping project is voluntary, survivor-led and participatory. Survivors are invited to directly input their own information into the online mapping system and share any information they wish.  They will be able to add short videos, pictures and a short narrative about themselves. If survivors are looking to locate family members, they have the option of uploading a picture, file, short video or details on their family members. Participants will have the option of removing any of their identifying visual data from the platform at any time. However, anonymous statistical data, including the province or territory of child welfare removal; First Nations, Metis, Inuit identity; will be publicly available. The Sixties Scoop Network will have access to the platform’s data and 60s Scoop survivors will have access to their own information. 
The mapping project – international in scope – will be a powerful tool for survivors to find family, connect with one another, and have their voices heard on their own terms. The data it generates will provide researchers and Indigenous communities with an unprecedented data visualization of how Canada’s colonial child welfare system displaced more than 22,500 Indigenous children from the 1950s to the 1990s.

On Tuesday 23 June, the UK Supreme Court will hear an appeal into the case “Okpabi and others (Appellants) v Royal Dutch Shell Plc and another (Respondents).”  The communities represent over 40,000 Nigerians from the Niger Delta and argue that they have been badly affected by oil spills from oil pipelines owned and operated by Shell.  The devastating effect on the ecology of the Niger Delta and its citizens has been well documented and in 2011, a United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) report recommended an urgent clean-up, but to date, no clean-up has taken place. 
The communities have taken their case to the English courts on the basis that Royal Dutch Shell (RDS), which is headquartered in London, is legally responsible for the environmental failures of the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), a subsidiary of RDS. The court proceedings to date have focused on the question of whether RDS can be sued in the English courts for damage caused by its Nigerian subsidiary.  The UK Supreme Court clarified the law in this area in April 2019, in a case in which Vedanta Resources Plc was held to be liable for the acts, including pollution and release of toxic emissions from its Zambian subsidiary, the Konkola Copper Mine. 
The communities’ case was originally heard in the UK High Court in November, 2016 with The High Court ruling in January, 2017 that RDS was not responsible for the pollution as it is a holding company which did not exercise any control over SPDC. That decision was appealed and the UK Court of Appeal held by majority in February, 2018 that there was insufficient evidence of “operational control” by RDS to hold it liable.  This case has now been appealed to the UK Supreme Court.

In 2011 the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) released a report documenting the devastating impact of the oil industry in Ogoniland, and set out urgent recommendations for clean-up. But the new investigation highlights that “emergency measures” proposed by UNEP have not been properly implemented and that the billion-dollar clean-up project launched by the Nigerian government in 2016 has been ineffective.  
Over five decades, oil and gas extraction have caused large-scale, continued contamination of the water and soil in Ogoni communities. The continued and systematic failure of oil companies and government to clean up have left hundreds of thousands of Ogoni people facing serious health risks, struggling to access safe drinking water, and unable to earn a living. 
Numerous conflicts of interest around Shell have been revealed involving the management of the clean-up agency, HYPREP, and the Nigerian government. 
Godwin Ojo, Environmental Rights Action/Friends of the Earth Nigeria said: 
“After nine years of promises without proper action and decades of pollution, the people of Ogoniland are not only sick of dirty drinking water, oil-contaminated fish and toxic fumes. They are sick of waiting for justice, they are dying by the day. The Nigerian government should acknowledge this project has been a failure and reinvigorate HYPREP with technical skills and strategic thinking, fully involving the community.” 
Colin Roche, Friends of the Earth Europe said: 
“Nine years on, there is still no clean-up, no ‘emergency’ health and water measures, no transparency and no accountability. Without urgent action there will be no justice. While oil companies like Shell spend millions greenwashing their image, tens of thousands of people continue to suffer from their pollution and negligence. European governments like the UK, the Netherlands, France and Italy must act to support a truly effective clean-up and ensure these companies are held accountable for the devastating pollution of the Niger Delta.” 
Osai Ojigho, Amnesty International Nigeria, said:
 
“The discovery of oil in Ogoniland has brought huge suffering for its people. Over many years we have documented how Shell has failed to clean up contamination from spills and it’s a scandal that this has not yet happened. The pollution is leading to serious human rights impacts – on people’s health and ability to access food and clean water. Shell must not get away with this – we will continue to fight until every last trace of oil is removed from Ogoniland.”
 
 Key findings of the report include: 
The organizations demand a rapid clean-up and in particular 
that the Nigerian government: 
	that Shell:
	1. provides proper compensation to all communities affected by failed or delayed clean-ups of oil spills
	2. decommissions all aging and damaged pipelines
	3. commits to funding the clean-up of Ogoniland and the rest of the Niger Delta until completed 
that European governments home to oil companies operating in the Niger Delta: 
This year, Shell is facing a series of European court battles over its business in Nigeria.

A group of girls who had been forced to leave school when they became pregnant, Freetown, Sierra Leone, 2016 
In late December, West Africa’s regional court ruled against a ban on pregnant girls  attending school in Sierra Leone. In 2019 Amnesty International joined a legal case against the ban, which has resulted in thousands of pregnant teenage girls being excluded from school. In December the court ordered the Sierra Leonian government to immediately revoke the policy. It was a landmark moment in the fight against discrimination in education. 
  
 
Palestinian motorists pass an Israeli fighter jet external fuel tank in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza strip, on 1 August 2014 
Also in December, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced that a preliminary examination had concluded that war crimes have been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), opening the way for an investigation. The decision is a historic step towards justice in Israel and the OPT, after decades of war crimes and other crimes under international law. Amnesty has produced a large body of work on the 2014 war in Gaza, including an investigative piece, Black Friday and a research tool called the Gaza Platform. Our work focused on violations by both Israel and Palestinian armed groups, including a report on summary executions by Hamas.  
  
In January the Bangladeshi government announced its intention to offer schooling and training opportunities to Rohingya refugee children. The decision came two and a half years after the Rohingya were forced to flee a campaign of ethnic cleansing  in Myanmar. It represented a major win for Amnesty International and other human rights organizations, which have been campaigning for education for the nearly half a million Rohingya children in Bangladesh’s refugee camps. 
 
“This is an important and very positive commitment by the Bangladeshi government, allowing children to access schooling and chase their dreams for the future. They have lost two academic years already and cannot afford to lose any more time outside a classroom,” said Saad Hammadi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner. 
  
 
The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR released a long-awaited report listing more than 100 companies with links to the illegal Israeli settlements in the West bank. The report lists several digital tourism companies including Airbnb, TripAdvisor, Expedia and Booking.com, which Amnesty International’s research has found are driving tourism to settlements and contributing to their existence and expansion. 
“Settling civilians in occupied territories violates international humanitarian law and amounts to a war crime. Naming the businesses which profit in the context of this illegal situation sends a clear message from the international community that settlements must never be normalized. These companies are profiting from and contributing to systematic violations against Palestinians,” said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International’s Middle East Deputy Director. 
  
In Argentina, newly inaugurated Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez made good on his commitment to take steps to legalize abortion, and said he would introduce a bill to this end. This follows years of campaigning by women’s rights advocates including Amnesty International. 
 
Mariela Belski, Executive Director of Amnesty International Argentina, said: “Congress must now listen to the demands of tens of thousands of women who have fought to have control over what they do with their bodies. It´s time for Argentina to join the list of countries that legalize abortion and say ADIÓS to clandestine abortion.” 
Spain announced a bill to define rape as sex without consent, in line with international human rights norms. The legal change followed some high-profile gang rape cases in which the justice system failed victims. These included the so-called ‘La Manada’ (wolf pack) case which sparked widespread protests and triggered a commitment from the government to reform legislation. The bill includes other measures to prevent and respond to sexual violence and is pending before Parliament. Amnesty has been calling on European countries to define sex as rape without consent, including through the Let’s Talk About Yes campaign. 
Only 9 out of 31 European countries in the European Economic Area and Switzerland analysed by Amnesty International define rape as sex without consent. Beyond the legal change, the proposed bill includes other long waited measures to prevent and respond to sexual violence in Spain. 
  
 
Also in March, Iranian spiritual teacher Mohammad Ali Taheri was reunited with his family in Canada. He had been arrested in May 2011 in Iran and sentenced to death for establishing the spiritual group Erfan-e Halgheh. Following a major outcry and global appeals by Amnesty International, his death sentence and conviction were quashed and he was eventually released in 2019, after which he fled the country. After arriving in Canada he wrote a Facebook post thanking Amnesty members for their tireless campaigning. 
In Lebanon, a new consultation offered an opportunity to better protect the rights of migrant workers. The national consultation on reform of the kafala system, which ties the legal residency of the worker to their contract with their employer, was organized by the International Labour Organization in collaboration with Lebanon’s Ministry of Labour. It started a much-needed conversation on measures that are needed to ensure improved working conditions for migrant workers. Amnesty International campaigns for the abolition of the kafala system in countries throughout the Middle East. 
In Uganda, the Constitutional Court nullified parts of a law which gave police excessive powers to  prohibit public gatherings and protests. It was a glimmer of hope for the country’s embattled political opposition, human rights defenders and activists. 
  
 
Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quangzhang was reunited with his family after four and a half years in prison. He was targeted for his work exposing corruption and human rights violations, and Amnesty has campaigned for his release since he was first sentenced.  
There was a glimpse of progress in Saudi Arabia when authorities announced plans to stop using the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime. The death penalty will be replaced with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. However juveniles sentenced under the frequently misused counter-terror law can still be executed. Amnesty International continues to call on Saudi Arabia to totally abolish the death penalty in all circumstances. 
  
 
Component from a Small Glide Munition at the site of a US air strike on three farmers outside Darusalaam village in Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region, 12 November 2017 
The US Africa Command (AFRICOM) published its first ever quarterly report into allegations of civilian casualties from US air strikes in Somalia, including two incidents covered in an Amnesty investigation. Following the  release of the report several US Congresspeople took action to hold the Pentagon/AFRICOM accountable. The report comes after we campaigned for over a year for increased transparency from AFRICOM, including in a ground-breaking report, The Hidden US War in Somalia which helped to prompt the US’s first-ever admission of civilian casualties in Somalia. 
Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa, said: “This is a welcome, though long overdue, step towards providing truth and accountability for the victims of US air strikes and their families in Somalia and beyond. It’s shocking that it has taken more than a decade of AFRICOM’s secret air war in Somalia for this to happen. 
  
 
Solidarity messages for Nazanin Zaghari Ratcliffe, outside the Iranian Embassy, London. Nazanin has been held in Iran since 3 April 2016 
Iran temporarily freed British charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from prison in response to the COVID-19 crisis. Nazanin was arrested at Imam Khomeini airport in Tehran in April 2016 as she was about to board a plane back to the UK following a family holiday. After 45 days in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer, Nazanin was subjected to a deeply unfair trial and sentenced to five years in prison for “membership of an illegal group” in connection with her charity work. 
Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said: 
“There should be no question of Nazanin ever being sent back to Evin Prison. There are numerous reports of COVID-19 in Iranian jails, with detainees pleading for basic things like soap to help combat the disease.” 
In Germany a historic trial took place in the case of two former Syrian government security officials charged with crimes against humanity including torture and rape. The trial was the first of its kind, and a big step towards justice for the tens of thousands of people unlawfully detained, tortured and killed in Syrian government prisons and detention centres. 
  
In early May a French court acquitted a farmer who was prosecuted for helping asylum seekers. In 2017 Cédric Herrou was convicted of facilitating the irregular circulation, stay and entry of refugees and migrants at the French-Italian border. Cedric’s case was emblematic of how acts of solidarity have become criminalized across Europe.  After his acquittal Amnesty Researcher Rym Khadraoui said: 
“This is not only a victory for justice but also for common sense. Cédric Herrou did nothing wrong, just acted in solidarity with people abandoned in dire conditions by European states. The significance of today’s decision will be felt far beyond this courtroom.” 
Also in May, an investigation by Amnesty’s Security Lab protected more than a million people in Qatar from having their personal details exposed. Amnesty uncovered serious flaws in the contact tracing app which Qatar has rolled out to track COVID-19, and which authorities have made it mandatory for everyone in the country to download. The flaws would have allowed cyber attackers to access highly sensitive information, putting people at risk of malicious attacks. The Qatari authorities quickly corrected the flaw after we alerted them. 
While Qatar made changes which appear to fix the issue, Amnesty has been unable to fully verify whether they have. And even now, Qatar’s app, like many being introduced, remains highly problematic due to its lack of privacy safeguards. 
 
The Japanese beer company Kirin announced an independent review of its business ties to the Myanmar military company MEHL – prompted in large part by Amnesty’s 2018 investigation into their subsidiary Myanmar Brewery’s donations to the Tatmadaw. Amnesty found that a subsidiary of the multinational brewing giant Kirin made payments to Myanmar’s military and authorities at the height of an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya population in late 2017. 
In correspondence with Kirin, Amnesty raised concerns in May 2020 about the brewer’s business ties to a Myanmar military company, MEHL, asking how the brewer ensures that any proceeds from its  joint-venture businesses with MEHL are not being used by the Myanmar army. 
In a statement, Kirin said it takes its responsibilities in Myanmar seriously, and will take necessary action to ensure its business activities in the region adhere to the highest standards. 
In Bahrain, human rights activist Nabeel Rajab was released from prison on a non-custodial sentence in Bahrain. 
A court agreed to pass an alternative to the jail term he received, according to one of his lawyers, Mohamed Al Jishi. He will serve a non-custodial sentence for the remaining three years of his initial sentence. 
While the terms of the sentence are not yet clear, they could include, as per Law Number (18) of 2017, alternative sanctions such as house arrest, exclusion orders, or restraining orders. 
Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director, said: “It is a relief that Nabeel Rajab is finally reunited with his family, who bravely continued their relentless public campaign for this day to come. 
“While this is a moment to celebrate, it is impossible to forget that he has spent almost four years unjustly separated from them, or to forget the many other peaceful activists who remain behind bars in Bahrain. 
“Nabeel’s release must now be accompanied by the quashing of his conviction and sentence, the dropping of any outstanding charges brought against him in relation to his expression of peaceful opinion, and an end to the injustice he has been put through. 
 “Instead of releasing him on a non-custodial sentence, the authorities must quash all sentences brought against him and ensure his access to remedy for the violations he has suffered during this time.”

Lorry driver Malik Yılmaz 
Corona virus is devastating lives worldwide, whether because of the illness itself or the social and economic impact of lockdowns and other government measures. Everywhere, the poorest are being hit hardest. In Turkey, the authorities are making the situation worse by using the pandemic as an excuse to further stifle the right to freedom of expression. They are hounding social media users, journalists, doctors and others, and invoking legal provisions that criminalize dissent, in efforts to silence their critics. 
Crackdown on social media 
Around 54 million people use social media in Turkey, nearly two-thirds of the population. The country ranks seventh on the list of active Twitter users (13.6 million people) and tops the list for legal requests by the state to remove content. 
Under the guise of combating ‘fake news’, ‘incitement’ or ‘spreading fear and panic’, the Turkish authorities are using criminal law provisions to target people who are discussing the pandemic online. Between 11 March, when the first positive case of the infection was declared, and 21 May, the Cyber Crimes Unit of the Interior Ministry alleged that 1,105 social media users had made propaganda for a terrorist organization, including by ‘sharing provocative Corona virus posts’. Of these, 510 were reportedly detained for questioning. In April, Amnesty International made a freedom of information request to the Ministries of Interior and Justice for further details of these COVID-19 related detentions, investigations and prosecutions. The request remained unanswered at the time of publishing. 
 
 
When lorry driver Malik Yılmaz shared a TikTok video on 28 March with his 30 followers, he didn’t think his comments would go viral or that he would end up in police detention. In the video, he expressed his frustration with the ‘stay home’ message: 
How would you suggest I do that? I am not retired or a civil servant, I am not rich. I am a worker, a lorry driver. If I don’t work, I don’t eat. I can’t pay my bills. Not being able to pay the bills is worse than death… But this virus won’t kill me, what will kill me is your system.  
Lorry driver Malik Yılmaz 
His alleged crime was ‘inciting the public to break the law’. He was questioned three times, given a foreign travel ban and must now sign in at a police station weekly. As a result, he lost his job and fears he will be prosecuted under Article 217 of the penal code, punishable by up to two years’ imprisonment. He remains defiant. ‘I stand by what I said in the video… because it was true’.  
Media repression 
Turkey has more journalists and media workers in prison than any other country. Longstanding media repression intensified after the 2016 attempted coup, with newspapers shut down and scores of journalists convicted under overly broad anti-terrorism laws. Now, the authorities are again targeting journalists. In the last three weeks of March alone, at least 12 journalists were detained by police for their reporting of the pandemic. 
 
On 18 March, Güngör Arslan heard that his colleague, İsmet Ciğit, editor of Kocaeli Ses – a local newspaper in the western province of Kocaeli – had been arrested after an article on the newspaper’s website reported two coronavirus deaths in a local hospital. Arslan rushed to the police station to explain that as the editor of the website, he was responsible. Ciğit was released, Arslan was detained instead. After being questioned by the state prosecutor, he was also released. Speaking to Amnesty International a few weeks later, he said: 
“[The state prosecutor] said to me “don’t write these articles”.’ He literally said that to me… I have no idea whether this will turn into a prosecution, but it was certainly intimidating.” Güngör Arslan 
 
On 30 March, police questioned Diyarbakır-based journalist and human rights defender, Nurcan Baysal, about 10 of her social media posts, eight of which related to COVID-19, as well as two articles about the situation in Diyarbakır during the pandemic. She had to give a second statement the next day regarding accusations that she had ‘incited the public to enmity and hatred’, a crime under Article 216 punishable by one to three years in prison. In April, she was again summoned for questioning, this time over a 2016 tweet about Sur district. Since January 2018, Baysal has been detained three times and armed police have raided her house twice. 
“In this country, I feel increasingly that we are writing on water. On the one hand, you feel the responsibility of being the voice of the voiceless; on the other, you see your writings change nothing; they only bring prosecution, detention, insult, threats, criminalisation is the cherry on top. (…) But there is (..) still solidarity, there is the responsibility of historical record, there is my ruined country, the children of Sur, there are still stars in the sky.”  Nurcan Baysal 
Former Halk TV editor-in-chief Hakan Aygün was remanded in prison on 4 April after he implicitly criticized President Erdoğan (he did not name him) for sharing a bank account number for public donations to help deal with the pandemic. In four posts, Aygün compared IBAN (the International Bank Account Number shared by the President) with ‘iman’ (‘faith’ in Turkish), suggesting that those who claim to have faith are actually all about money. Aygün was charged with ‘inciting the public to enmity and hatred’ and ‘insulting the religious beliefs of a section of society’, both punishable by imprisonment. He was released on 6 May at the first hearing. His prosecution continues. 
Doctors targeted 
The Turkish Medical Association (TTB) is accustomed to being in the authorities’ line of fire. In January 2018, for instance, 11 members of its national council were detained for calling for Turkey’s military operation in Afrin to end. Since the start of the pandemic. the authorities have targeted individual doctors and the TTB for challenging and criticising government health policies. 
Police have twice summoned psychiatrist Dr Özgür Deniz Değer, TTB Chair in Van, eastern Turkey, since the pandemic began. On 24 March, he was questioned about ‘threats to create fear and panic among the people’, a crime under Article 213 punishable by two to four years in prison. This related to an interview with the Mesopotamia News Agency in which he discussed the risks of COVID-19 spreading in prison and criticized the Health Ministry for not working with medical associations and not taking seriously the threat posed by the virus. On 4 May, Dr Değer was questioned about a tweet, which tagged the Minister of Health and the Ministry, about the deaths of health workers that were not identified as coronavirus-related. He said: 
“Neither the interview, nor the tweet contains anything that could be remotely described as “threat to create fear and panic among the people”. Nevertheless, I am now more careful… There is self-censorship. ”  Dr Özgür Deniz Değer, Chair of the Turkish Medical Association 
Dr Ömer Melik, Chair of the Urfa Medical Association, was first summoned in early April. ‘The police asked me, “Why are you sharing numbers on your Twitter account? Who gives you the numbers? I told them, “the practitioners who are dealing with the pandemic”.’ Dr Melik added, ‘apparently, we were spreading fear and panic. I asked the police officer “please show me how these posts are doing that!” 
 
Subsequently, the medical association’s Twitter account raised concerns about the lack of personal protective equipment, highlighted the deaths of health workers, and shared a video about the situation in Urfa prisons. Dr Osman Yüksekyayla, general secretary of the medical association, and Dr Melik were detained and questioned on 27 April about dozens of these social media posts. They were released on bail, banned from foreign travel and required to sign in at a police station monthly. Dr Melik said: 
“They told us “you can’t share these things”. We asked why. They said, “there is a government circular that states that only the Ministry can share information about the Corona-virus pandemic”. We asked to see the circular but were not shown anything.” 
Another way is possible and necessary    
The spread of the deadly Corona-virus in Turkey is of indisputable public interest, making it crucial that people can exchange information and express dissent without fear of punishment. However, instead of respecting the right to freedom of expression, the government is cracking down on any criticism and imposing its message as the only one that can be heard. The wave of detentions in the early days of the pandemic taking hold in Turkey sent a very powerful message: the state would not allow questioning and open discussion of its strategy, leading to fear and self-censorship. 
But the social media users, journalists, doctors and others who express different views are not undermining the fight against the virus. They are strengthening it. Indeed, it is through information-sharing, scrutiny of public decisions and open discussion that the pandemic can best be tackled – and lives saved.

The United Nations General Assembly voted yesterday to decide whether Canada should have a seat on the Security Council. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is lobbying hard to regain that seat, a loss seen by many as a rebuke of former Prime Minister Harper’s lacklustre performance on international human rights.   
But according to an open letter signed by a large coalition of leaders and progressive voices within Canada last month, the Trudeau government doesn’t deserve the seat. As Chief of West Moberly First Nations, I added my name to that list. Here’s why. 
The Site C dam will flood over 100 kilometres of the Peace River and its tributaries in northeast British Columbia, destroying vast swaths of prime farmland and fish and wildlife habitat. It will desecrate ancestral burial sites and sacred places. It will poison bull trout with methylmercury making them unsafe to eat, and frustrate the recovery of endangered caribou. Combined with two previous dams, Site C will rip the last remaining stretch of the Peace River from the heart of our traditional territory. And, as regulators and independent experts agree, the power isn’t even needed. 
It’s a clear violation of our rights under Treaty 8, which protects our right to hunt, fish and trap and guarantees “no forced interference” with our traditional model of life. 
The project was first approved in 2014 under the Harper government despite opposition from the impacted First Nations. After Mr. Trudeau took office in 2015, promising that no relationship was more important than the one with Indigenous peoples, we proposed that he suspend Harper’s approvals until our treaty rights case could be decided. 
What was his response? Federal lawyers were sent to fight us in the courtroom, disclaiming any responsibility for upholding the Treaty. Trudeau’s government then handed out a suite of new fisheries, navigation, and transportation permits allowing bulldozers to rumble forward while we endured massive expense and delays trying to wind our way through the courts. 
But this betrayal didn’t soften the Prime Minister’s rhetoric. In September 2017, Mr. Trudeau used his first speech to the UN General Assembly to make new promises about his commitment to human rights and dealings with Indigenous peoples, saying “the world expects Canada to strictly adhere to international human rights standards”, and pledging his government would uphold the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
He knew then, just as he knows now, that the central requirement of the UN Declaration is to secure the “free, prior, and informed consent” of Indigenous peoples. What he might not have known, was that the UN might actually expect him to do just that. 
The UN’s top anti-racism body, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has denounced the Prime Minister’s handling of Site C in unequivocal terms, decrying the “irreversible damage due to flooding of their [Treaty 8] lands, leading to the elimination of plants, medicines, wildlife, sacred lands and gravesites.” It has called on Canada to suspend construction at Site C on three separate occasions: in August 2017, again in December 2018, and a third time in January of his year. 
Our people have suffered too much at the hands of colonial governments to be impressed by the bold talk of future valour. Truth lies in action, and the bulldozers haven’t slowed down after Mr. Trudeau took the seat of power. So don’t expect Mr. Trudeau’s bid for a seat on the UN Security Council to fare any better than his predecessor’s. Site C has shown that while Trudeau’s antiracist rhetoric is second to none, his government’s record on Indigenous human rights hasn’t progressed at all.

Amnesty International is calling on Egyptian authorities to release Yasser Albaz immediately, as the organization considers his ongoing detention to be arbitrary based on information received from his family, including the absence of formal charges and judicial oversight of pre-trial detention.  
“Yasser Albaz’s arbitrary detention is particularly concerning due to his ongoing health concerns, including symptoms of COVID-19, that have been reported by the family. This adds another urgent reason for him to be released without further delay. As well, these symptoms should be assessed immediately, and he should be provided with the appropriate medical care,” said Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International. “The absence of regular consular visits place Mr. Albaz’s wellbeing in jeopardy, and Canada must take all steps to ensure that he remains healthy and continue to work to secure his release and return to his family,” he added. 
Amnesty International has expressed concern about the spread of COVID-19 in Egyptian prisons and considers inmates to be particularly vulnerable due to unsanitary living conditions, the impossibility of physical distancing and inadequate healthcare.

Despite this loss, Canada can and must still advance its global goals through its Feminist Foreign Policy. 
Canada must play a constructive global role through continuing to support efforts to advance gender equality and the rights of women, girls and gender-diverse people across all areas of its foreign policy.  
Canada must work to implement its Security Council campaign pledge to ‘make gender inequality history.’ This will involve significant new investments in supporting women peacebuilders and human rights defenders, strengthening women’s participation in peace negotiations and addressing sexual violence in conflict. “The security of women and girls is a key indicator of state security,” said Beth Woroniuk of the Equality Fund. “In its campaign, Canada made promises to advance the rights of women and girls. Carrying through on these promises will involve investments and courage to challenge international voices opposed to women’s rights.” 
The UN Security Council’s work too often centres around an outdated definition of security that focuses on military interventions. But as the world grapples with multiple crises—COVID-19, climate change, extreme inequality, and systemic racism—it is clear that militarized solutions are not the way to address these challenges, making it more important than ever to update the definition of security within and outside of the Security Council. The UN must reassess what makes us secure, and Canada, with its commitment to gender equality and its Feminist Foreign Policy, is well positioned to champion the redefining of security within the broader UN system.  “We cannot have peace and security without equality. We need solutions that are adapted to the crises we are collectively facing,” said Jackie Hansen of Amnesty International Canada. “It is time to move beyond simplistic notions of military security to broader concepts of human security centred on human rights and gender equality, and Canada didn’t need a seat on the Security Council to champion this work.” 
To be a credible voice on the international stage, Canada must model domestically what it wants to see adopted internationally. This means urgently acting to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people in Canada, and more broadly, addressing systemic racism in Canada. It also means applying Canada’s Feminist Foreign Policy consistently in all aspects of Canada’s international engagement including diplomacy, trade, defense, and international development assistance. “In the past, Canada has come under fire for its contradictory stance of continuing arms exports to Saudi Arabia despite its commitments under the Arms Trade Treaty, and for supporting Canadian-based mining companies, many of which are implicated in gross human rights violations,” said Diana Sarosi of Oxfam Canada. “A feminist approach to foreign policy requires the application of feminist and human rights principles at all times.”  
The rights of women and LGBTI people are under threat around the world, with a number of countries further criminalizing abortion and LGBTI rights, and growing attacks on women and LGBTI human rights defenders. “We need Canada to give voice and visibility to those who have been marginalized in traditional security spaces, and Canada can do this without being on the Security Council,” said Hansen. “Canada can use its role in multilateral fora to ensure that people from the Global South, women, LGBTI people, and human rights defenders are front and center. Discussions about how to create a more equal, secure, and sustainable world cannot solely be the domain of white men.” 
Canada also needs to increase its international assistance funding, which has been lagging far behind its competitors for the Security Council seat. Norway commits 1% of GNI annually and Ireland pledged to reach 0.7% of GNI, but Canada merely commits 0.28% of GNI. “Feminist commitments require the backing of resources,” said Woroniuk. “There are concerns that the few global resources dedicated to advancing gender equality will be diverted to other post-COVID recovery initiatives. Canada’s leadership is required to ensure that this does not happen.” 
Canada has outlined its feminist foreign policy goals in four policies: the Feminist International Assistance Policy; the National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security; the Strong, Secure and Engaged Defense Policy; and the Inclusive Trade Agenda. In February 2020, Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced the government will commence consultations with civil society organizations to develop a white paper before the end of 2020 outlining Canada’s Feminist Foreign Policy.  “Canada needs a comprehensive Feminist Foreign Policy to enable the government to measure its effectiveness and success, and for civil society to hold the government accountable to its commitments,” said Sarosi.

Amnesty’s Security Lab reviewed contact tracing apps from Europe, Middle East and North Africa, including a detailed technical analysis of 11 apps in Algeria, Bahrain, France, Iceland, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Norway, Qatar, Tunisia and United Arab Emirates, some of which ranged from bad to dangerous for human rights. Bahrain’s ‘BeAware Bahrain’, Kuwait’s ‘Shlonik’ and Norway’s ‘Smittestopp’ apps stood out as among the most alarming mass surveillance tools assessed by Amnesty, with all three actively carrying out live or near-live tracking of users’ locations by frequently uploading GPS coordinates to a central server. 
On Monday, the Norwegian government announced it would press pause on using its contact tracing app. The decision came just hours before Amnesty International published its analysis and after the organization shared its findings with the Norwegian authorities and the country’s data protection agency on 2 June. Amnesty International also met with the head of development for the ‘Smittestopp’ app on 10 June. 
“Bahrain, Kuwait and Norway have run roughshod over people’s privacy, with highly invasive surveillance tools which go far beyond what is justified in efforts to tackle COVID-19,” said Claudio Guarnieri, Head of Amnesty International’s Security Lab. 
“The Norwegian app was highly invasive and the decision to go back to the drawing board is the right one. We urge the Bahraini and Kuwaiti governments to also immediately halt the use of such intrusive apps in their current form. They are essentially broadcasting the locations of users to a government database in real time – this is unlikely to be necessary and proportionate in the context of a public health response. Technology can play a useful role in contact tracing to contain COVID-19, but privacy must not be another casualty as governments rush to roll out apps.” 
Mass Surveillance Tools 
Contact tracing apps in Bahrain, Kuwait and Norway follow an invasive centralized approach, posing a great threat to privacy. These systems capture location data through GPS and upload this to a central database, tracking the movements of users in real-time. Qatar’s “EHTERAZ” app is capable of optionally activating live location tracking of all users or of specific individuals (at the time of writing it remains turned off). 
Authorities in all these countries can easily link this sensitive personal information to an individual, as Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait require users to register with a national ID number, while Norway requires registration with a valid phone number. 
Other apps assessed by the Security Lab such as Tunisia’s “E7mi”, also follow a centralized model, but instead of recording GPS coordinates, they use Bluetooth proximity scanning to monitor contact between users in real time. Qatar’s “EHTERAZ” records and uploads Bluetooth contact between users’ devices, along with the GPS coordinates of the encounter. 
A major security vulnerability was identified in Qatar’s EHTERAZ app, which exposed sensitive personal details of more than one million people. This was especially concerning as the app was made mandatory to use on 22 May. The vulnerability was fixed after Amnesty alerted the authorities to the discovery at the end of May. The security flaw would have allowed cyber attackers to access highly sensitive personal information, including the name, national ID, health status and designated confinement location of users. 
Tracing apps from countries such as France, Iceland and United Arab Emirates use a centralized model, but information on contact between devices is uploaded only when users voluntarily decide to report themselves as symptomatic or at the request of the health authorities. Such voluntary and consensual uploads at least reduce the risk of mass surveillance, as data is not automatically uploaded. The centralized model of France’s contact-tracing app combined with the lack of transparency over how data is stored raises questions as to whether the users’ information could be deanonymized. 
“Governments across the world need to press pause on rolling out flawed or excessively intrusive contact tracing apps that fail to protect human rights. If contact tracing apps are to play an effective part in combating COVID-19 people need to have confidence their privacy will be protected,” said Claudio Guarnieri. 
New forms of surveillance  
Bahrain’s app was even linked to a national television show called “Are You at Home?”, which offered prizes to individuals who stayed at home during Ramadan. Using contact details gathered through the app, 10 phone numbers were randomly selected every day using a computer programme, and those numbers were called live on air to check if the app users were at home. Those who were won a prize. Inclusion in the television programme draw was initially mandatory until Bahrain’s Information and eGovernment Authority added an option to its BeAware Bahrain app allowing users to ‘opt out’ of participating in the television competition. The Bahraini authorities have also published online sensitive personal information of suspected COVID-19 cases, including an individual’s health status, nationality, age, gender and travel history. 
Both the Bahraini and Kuwaiti apps can pair with a Bluetooth bracelet which is used to make sure the user remains in the vicinity of the phone, in order to enforce quarantine measures. The Kuwait app regularly checks the distance between the Bluetooth bracelet and the device, uploading location data every 10 minutes to a central server. 
Location data and additional diagnostic information from the Bluetooth bracelet linked to the BeAware Bahrain app is frequently sent to a central server. It is mandatory for all individuals registered for home quarantine to wear the bracelet and those who do not can face legal penalties under the Public Health Law No. 34 (2018), including imprisonment for at least 3 months and/or a fine of between BD1,000 and BD10,000 (approximately US$2,700, and US$27,000 respectively). 
Privacy and human rights by design 
Contact tracing is an important component of effective pandemic response, and contact tracing apps have the potential to support this objective. However, in order to be human rights compliant, contact tracing apps must, among other things, build in privacy and data protection by design, meaning any data collected must be the minimum amount necessary, and securely stored. All data collection must be restricted to controlling the spread of COVID-19 and should not be used for any other purpose – including law enforcement, national security or immigration control. It must also not be made available to any third party or for commercial use. Any individual decision to download and use contact tracing apps must also be entirely voluntary. Any data collected must remain anonymous, including when combined with other data sets. 
“Governments rolling out centralized contact tracing apps with real-time location tracking need to go back to the drawing board. There are better options available that balance the need to trace the spread of the disease without hoovering up sensitive personal information of millions of people,” said Claudio Guarnieri.

Summary of Contact Tracing Apps Analyzed by Amnesty’s Security Lab 
Amnesty International’s research into COVID-19 apps found that apps tend to fall into three categories. Firstly, those that are not in fact doing digital contact tracing but rather allow users to voluntarily record and check their symptoms (e.g. Lebanon and Vietnam). 
Secondly, apps which use a much less invasive decentralized model of Bluetooth contact tracing like that developed by Google and Apple. Under this model, data is stored on people’s phones, rather than on a centralized database. This includes countries such as Austria, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland. Amnesty International did not undertake a technical review of any apps that follow this model as they tend to be less concerning from a privacy perspective and are still in the process of being rolled out. 
The third, and most serious for human rights are contact tracing apps, which are centralized, meaning they log data captured via the phone’s Bluetooth sensor or via GPS (or both) and upload this data to a centralized government database, and in some cases are mandatory. Amnesty International wrote to authorities in Bahrain, Kuwait and Norway before publication to notify them of the privacy and security vulnerabilities related to the apps. On 2 June, Amnesty International shared its findings with the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the country’s data protection agency. Amnesty International also met with the head of development for the ‘Smittestopp’ app on 10 June. 
Other problematic contact tracing apps around the world 
Amnesty International focused particularly on apps in Europe, Middle East and North Africa. Research by NGOs and media organizations shows there are other apps and digital platforms in other regions which present serious human rights risks, including in China, Ethiopia and Guatemala.

Dear Prime Minister Trudeau and Ministers Chagger and Blair, 
We write this Open Letter, on behalf of 400,000 supporters of Amnesty International across Canada, to urge your government to advance transformative change addressing anti-Black racism in Canada, including but not limited to the systemic anti-Black racism in policing and justice systems. We write to the three of you collectively because of the clear responsibility you each carry by virtue of your roles within government to act immediately to address this entrenched crisis. 
The realities and concerns about anti-Black racism in Canada are not in any way new or recent. Far from it, systemic anti-Black racism long predates Canadian confederation and has been a stark and disgraceful reality in this country throughout the 153 years since. In recent weeks, demands for action – led by community organizers, educators, health-workers, writers, lawyers, academics, journalists, politicians and other leaders and activists in the Black community across Canada – have become particularly visible and urgent. A failure by your government, and governments at all levels in the country, to respond with concrete and meaningful action to address this grave and longstanding human rights crisis would be tantamount to complacency.  
Recent demonstrations, rallies and vigils in Canada have been sparked by outrage around the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers. The focus of protesters has broadened to the realities of anti-Black racism and associated police violence in this country. Demonstrations have also highlighted the racism and police violence that Indigenous peoples across the country face on a daily basis.  These protests do not reflect a tangential concern that what happens in the United States, happens in Canada too. Rather it is a fundamental concern that this happens in Canada, has been happening for far too long, and it must end, full stop. 
Canadians have heard many expressions of dismay, regret and even outrage from politicians and police officials in recent days. Many leaders have taken a knee during protests or as part of moments of silence extending to 8 minutes and 46 seconds, reflective of the length of time it took police to kill George Floyd.  It is not always clear what motivates these public displays by leaders. Prime Minister, you have made frequent recent public comments acknowledging that anti-Black racism is an unacceptable reality in Canada, and there was considerable media coverage when you took a knee during the protest in Ottawa on June 5th. However, with images of your brownface and blackface photos still fresh for Canadians, these gestures risk appearing to be empty when not accompanied by announcements of concrete change that will truly begin to tackle anti-Black racism in the country. That, of course, is what truly matters. 
It is particularly crucial because many political and policing leaders in the country continue to deny that systemic racism is a reality and a serious human rights crisis in Canada. There have been particularly troubling indications of this from RCMP leaders.  Deputy Commissioner Curtis Zablocki, the RCMP’s commanding officer for Alberta, has asserted that, “I don’t believe that racism is systemic through Canadian policing. I don’t believe it’s systemic through policing in Alberta.”[1]  RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki has stated that she does not consider it to be a concern for the RCMP, noting, “I have to admit, I really struggle with the term ‘systemic racism. I have heard about five or 10 different definitions on TV. I think that if systemic racism is meaning that racism is entrenched in our policies and procedures, I would say that we don’t have systemic racism.”[2]  Commissioner Lucki and Deputy Commissioner Zablocki both subsequently backtracked and acknowledged systemic racism within the RCMP, after considerable political and public pressure following a series of recent incidents and revelations of Indigenous people being beaten, injured, shot and killed by RCMP officers.[3] 
The shameful reality is that there is already ample evidence that anti-Black racism and systemic racism exist in Canada, and countless indications of the immediate steps that can and must be taken to address it.  These come from United Nations reviews by such bodies as the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.  The Working Group, following an extensive visit to Canada in 2016, decried the “structural racism that lies at the core of many Canadian institutions and the systemic anti-Black racism that continues to have a negative impact on the human rights situation of [Black people in Canada]”, noting in particular that “there is clear evidence that racial profiling is endemic in the strategies and practices used by law enforcement.”[4]  
In fact, the list of recommendations from UN reviews and comprehensive reports by independent bodies and experts in Canada in recent years is disgracefully long. These reviews and reports document the extent and the consequences of anti-Black racism in the country, particularly in connection with the law enforcement and justice systems, and include the Ontario Human Rights Commission,[5] Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission,[6] Independent Review of Street Checks,[7] and an independent report commissioned by the City of Montreal Police Service.[8]  
The list is disgraceful not only because of its length but because of the consistent failure to move forward in implementing the important recommendations that have been put in front of governments and police agencies in Canada.  That is what must change, and the change must start now. Amnesty International urges you to move immediately on these three fronts: 
First, we call on you to fulfill your 2019 election promise[9] to strengthen Building a Foundation for Change: Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy 2019-2022,[10] including by doubling the funding to support the strategy. Minister Chagger, you have been mandated by the Prime Minister to “develop policies that tackle systemic discrimination and unconscious bias in our country, including anti-Black racism; expand and advance Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy and ensure community-based projects are prioritized and meet the goals and outcomes of the Strategy; and to establish an Anti-Racism Secretariat.”[11] These tangible and crucially important steps of doubling funding, establishing the Secretariat and strengthening the strategy have not advanced.[12] There can be no further delay. 
Second, it is time for an ambitious initiative to absolutely ban any and all practices of carding, street checks and racial profiling carried out by police forces in Canada.  The Independent Street Checks Review, which comprehensively examined this issue over the course of 18 months, was clear: “no police officer should arbitrarily or randomly stop individuals to request their identifying information.”[13] In its recent review of Canada, the UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent has explicitly urged that “the practice of carding, or street checks, and all other forms of racial profiling be discontinued and that the practice of racial profiling be investigated and the perpetrators sanctioned.”[14] It is a practice that fosters, encourages and enables racism.  It violates Canada’s international human rights obligation to actively prohibit and prevent discrimination. It must end.  
Too often the excuse provided with respect to advancing police reforms of any nature in Canada is that it is complicated because of competing jurisdictions and would require decisions at not only the federal level, but also provincial, territorial and municipal governments across the country. That may indeed pose a challenge, but it cannot in any way justify inaction.  Prime Minister Trudeau and Minister Blair, your government can begin by expressly prohibiting carding, street checks and racial profiling by policing and law enforcement agencies under federal jurisdiction, including the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency. Going further, the federal government can play a lead role in working with other governments in the country to develop national standards to be applied with respect to all policing and law enforcement agencies across Canada. 
Minister Blair, we would be remiss not to underscore the considerable responsibility you bear to demonstrate genuine personal commitment to these particular reforms. Your decision to continue with the practice of carding while you served as Chief of Police for the City of Toronto, contrary to previous policy reforms initiated by the Toronto Police Services Board, means that you have come to your current position as Minister of Public Safety with a controversial legacy of anti-Black racism, having adopted a policy that has been widely discredited as racist by UN bodies and numerous independent reviews and studies. This understandably makes it difficult for many Canadians to have trust and confidence that you will champion policies that will demonstrably tackle anti-Black racism. The actions you take at this time, including acknowledgement of the harm caused by your previous decisions, will therefore be subject to heightened scrutiny by the Black community, and by human rights and civil liberties groups, including Amnesty International. 
Third, much more is of course required. This is not a time for tweaks and a piecemeal reform process, it is time for fundamental change.  Such change includes wholesale transformation of policing in the country to address the systemic anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism that has long been at its core.  Calls for that type of reform agenda have gathered considerable attention and momentum in recent weeks, in both the United States and Canada, and include proposals to: 
Prime Minister Trudeau, Minister Chagger and Minister Blair, now is the time to advance this agenda of change. We call on you to engage in broad and time-bound consultations about community-led proposals that reimagine and propose new, transformative approaches to upholding public safety and setting and apportioning police budgets in ways that end racism and uphold human rights.  We look forward to hearing in very short order of the steps you will be taking.

“The Chinese government goes to great lengths to ensure that no one in China commemorates or even mentions those killed on 3-4 June 1989. By complying with Beijing’s request to end meetings on the Tiananmen crackdown, Zoom risks contributing to this assault of freedom of expression. 
“Zoom has said it will take steps to ensure users ‘outside mainland China’ are not targeted by such interventions in the future, but in so doing it seemingly turns a blind eye to the repression of users on the mainland. 
“Tech firms such as Zoom must put principles before profit and defend internet freedom, rather than bowing to repressive governments’ demands to stifle it. 
“Zoom must respect human rights throughout all its business operations and not become a tool in China’s powerful censorship system.” 
Background 
In a statement released on Friday, Zoom revealed that it had suspended the accounts of human rights activists at the request of the Chinese government and suggested it will block any further meetings that Beijing says are “illegal”. It also admitted that it ended three out of four meetings on the Tiananmen crackdown. 
The account of Zhou Fengsuo, a Chinese activist based in the US, was shut down days after he hosted a memorial for the Tiananmen crackdown. 
Activist Wang Dan, who held a Zoom event on 3 June to commemorate the anniversary of the 4 June Tiananmen crackdown, had his account shut down twice. 
And activist Lee Cheuk-Yan, who organizes a yearly Tiananmen vigil, also saw his account terminated. 
The accounts have since been reinstated after Zoom acknowledged it had made a mistake and that its response “should not have impacted users outside of mainland China”.   
Corporate responsibility to respect human rights exists independently of, and over and above, compliance with national laws and regulations.

— “Report of the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent on its Mission to Canada”, August 2017  
George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died during an attempted arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on May 25, when a police officer forcibly pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, during which time he was unable to breathe. The number of Black people in the USA who have been killed, profiled, harassed or otherwise targeted by law enforcement including police, security guards and by private citizens continues to grow at a staggering rate. Further, the number of Black women, transgender, and gender non-conforming people who die from racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic violence is an alarming cause for concern. Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade are the latest on this often-omitted list.  
All four officers involved in George Floyd’s death have now been arrested, but justice is far from guaranteed due to a 99% impunity rate in the USA. Ongoing mass demonstrations across the USA have been met with police repression and thousands of arrests.  
Just two days after the death of George Floyd, Regis Korchinski-Paquet, who is Black and Indigenous, plummeted to her death on May 27 in Toronto from the 24th floor of her apartment building after municipal police officers entered the residence. Her family had reportedly been made to wait in the hallway outside the apartment. Serious concerns have been raised and questions asked, including by her family, about the circumstances surrounding her death. Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) – the province’s police watchdog – is investigating the case.   
There have been repeated concerns raised over the years about the mandate, independence and effectiveness of the SIU. In his March 2017 Report on the Independent Police Oversight Review, Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch made 129 recommendations for improving police oversight in Ontario, many of which are directed at the SIU. The bulk of those recommendations remain unimplemented.   
Such incidents are not rare: in April, 26-year-old D’Andre Campbell was shot in his home by Peel police officers. In 2018, The Ontario Human Rights Commission interim report on anti-Black racism in policing stated that Black people in Toronto are up to 20 times more likely to be shot dead by police than white people.   
The United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent has raised alarms about systemic racism within Canada’s justice system, including specific concerns on how police practices such as carding disproportionately impacts Black people. Those concerns are also documented in numerous other reports, including from the Ontario Human Rights Commission and Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission. Amnesty International has called on governments and police forces across Canada to end carding, street checks and racial profiling. 
But in the face of this reality, on June 3, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was dismissive of concerns that anti-Black racism is a serious problem here, noting: “Thank God that we’re different than the United States and we don’t have the systemic, deep roots [of racism] they have had for years.”  When faced with criticism in the legislature, Premier Ford subsequently acknowledged systemic racism in Ontario and across Canada. His comments nonetheless represent the all too frequent denial of anti-Black racism in Canada which we have heard repeated by numerous politicians and public figures over the past two weeks.   
Amnesty International unequivocally supports frontline groups and activists in communities across the country who work courageously and tirelessly to expose that systemic racism and demand justice for the growing number of Black people who have been wrongly arrested, mistreated or killed by police in towns and cities in all parts of Canada.

Not just in the US: Amnesty International Canada strongly condemns anti-Black racism Ending anti-Black racism: Sympathy and outrage are not enough   
In response to the death of George Floyd in the USA, Prime Minister Trudeau said:   
“We can’t pretend that racism doesn’t exist in Canada. Anti-black racism is real. Unconscious bias is real. Systemic discrimination is real. And they happen here, in Canada.”  
In response to the recent wave of protests and outrage across Canada, Prime Minister Trudeau and members of his government have made repeated comments highlighting concerns about anti-Black racism in Canada, including in connection with policing. However, this has not been matched by concrete action to advance the meaningful change that is so urgently required.  
Write to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Diversity and Inclusion Bardish Chagger urging them to live up to their 2019 election promise to strengthen and double the funding for “Building a Foundation for Change: Canada’s Anti-Racism Strategy” such that it more substantially addresses concerns with the justice system and anti-Black racism. 
Write to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Minister of Public Safety Bill Blair, urging them to institute an absolute ban at federal level on practices of carding, street checks and racial profiling by police and law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP and the Canada Border Services Agency.  Further call on them to engage with their provincial and territorial counterparts towards the goal of having such bans extend to all police and law enforcement agencies in the country.  
In writing to Minister Blair, note that he carries a particular responsibility to take meaningful action to address anti-Black racism in policing and will be watched closely in how he responds, given that he was the Toronto police chief during the G20 summit in June 2010 which saw the police violate civil rights, detain people illegally, and use excessive force, and he supported carding while police Chief and oversaw the adoption of a new policy on the practice that did not incorporate  most of the restrictions on carding that had originally been requested by the Toronto Police Services Board.   
Encourage Prime Minister Trudeau and Minister Blair to show leadership in initiating comprehensive reform of policing in Canada, to address concerns about racism. That reform agenda should refrain from additional funding for law enforcement, consider significant reductions in spending on policing, curtail militarization of police forces, discontinue programs that put police in schools, ban the use of facial recognition technology by police for mass surveillance, address the intersectionality that exists in policing Black women and Black trans individuals, comprehensively overhaul police oversight, and end all other harmful and racist policies and practices.  
Encourage the Prime Minister and Minister Blair to engage in broad consultations about community-led efforts that reimagine and propose new, transformative approaches to how to uphold public safety and set and apportion police budgets.

The operation culminated in the arrest of firefighter Maxwell Simões Corrêa, who is accused of hiding the weapons used in the assassination and being the close accomplice of Ronnie Lessa who fired the shots. Simões Corrêa’s arrest is an important step towards getting to the bottom of this crime and we hope it helps clear up the main questions that remain unanswered: who ordered Marielle’s killing and why? 
Marielle Franco was killed in an ambush that had been thoroughly planned over a number of months. The investigations of the Civil Police and Public Prosecution Service of Rio de Janeiro State identified two people suspected of carrying out the criminal act, Elcio de Queiroz and Ronnie Lessa, who are currently facing criminal proceedings. It was also discovered that other people were indirectly involved in the act, concealing weapons and obstructing the investigations.  
Amnesty International has been closely following the case since the outset. In the first months, we undertook campaigning actions on the 14th of every month, putting pressure on the authorities and mobilizing people around the defence of human rights. We held a series of meetings about the case with the authorities, including State Governor Wilson Witzel and the Attorney-General for Justice of the Rio de Janeiro Public Prosecution Service, José Eduardo Gussem, which were also attended by relatives of the murdered councillor. On the first anniversary of the killing, we submitted a petition with 780,000 signatures to the authorities, demanding that the case be solved, thanks to national and international mobilization. With the high visibility and public pressure that Amnesty International has generated around the case, both nationally and internationally, we believe we have contributed to ensuring the progress of the investigations. 
While the detention of the two killers and people linked to them is an important step in asserting the right to truth and justice of the families of Marielle and Anderson, it does not solve the case or guarantee greater safety for other human rights defenders working in Brazil. Indeed, Brazil is one of the most dangerous countries for human rights defenders and has one of the highest homicide rates in the world for human rights defenders. Human rights defenders are people who, like Marielle Franco, fight for a more just world where life and liberty are protected, and those are human rights that need to be respected. Moreover, all those involved in the investigations must be kept safe, particularly the families of the victims, as well as witnesses and investigators. Therefore, it is extremely important to find out who masterminded the killing and what their motivations were.  
Each day that people linked to the shootings remain unpunished represents a threat to Marielle’s legacy and puts the work and lives of countless other human rights defenders in Brazil at risk. 
We want to renew our public demand for the crime to be solved, for all those responsible for the murders of Marielle and Anderson to be brought to justice and for this case to be given the highest priority by the competent authorities. The solving of this brutal crime is of particular relevance and interest to Brazilian society and the international community. We at Amnesty International will continue insisting that there is a transparent, independent and impartial investigation that answers the questions: who killed Marielle and why? 
All those involved in this crime, whether physically or intellectually, must be brought to justice through a fair trial, in line with international standards. And, although the promptness of due process has been compromised, as two years have already passed since the crime, it is vitally important that the government and authorities make a public commitment to do everything in their power to solve the case.

0,Toxic trade in tear gas fuels police abuses globally,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/toxic-trade-in-tear-gas-fuels-police-abuses-globally/,"Amnesty International launches interactive website documenting security forces’ misuse of tear gas New analysis of almost 80 events in 22 countries and territories Launch comes as tear gas is again being used in mass quantities in Hong Kong, Paris and cities across the USA The shadowy and poorly...","The shadowy and poorly regulated global trade of tear gas is fuelling police human rights violations against peaceful protesters on a global scale, Amnesty International said today as it launched a new resource analyzing the misuse of the riot control agent around the world. 
Tear Gas: An investigation is the organization’s interactive, multimedia site looking into what tear gas is, how it is used and documenting scores of cases of its misuse by security forces worldwide, often resulting in severe injuries or death. 
The site is especially relevant today. It comes on the anniversary of the Hong Kong Police Force beginning its months-long barrage of tear gas against peaceful demonstrations – which has recently been renewed – and as police forces in dozens of cities around the USA have been bombarding protesters with tear gas. 
“Security forces often lead us to believe tear gas is a ‘safe’ way to disperse violent crowds, avoiding having to resort to more harmful weaponry. But our analysis proves that police forces are misusing it on a massive scale,” said Sam Dubberley, Head of the Evidence Lab on Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Programme. 
“We documented police forces using tear gas in ways that it was never intended to be used, often in large quantities against largely peaceful protesters or by firing projectiles directly at people, causing injuries and deaths.” 
Open source investigation  
Over the past year, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab has been researching tear gas misuse around the world, primarily through videos posted to social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. 
Using open source investigation methods, the organization verified close to 500 videos and highlighted almost 80 events in 22 countries and territories where tear gas has been misused, confirming the location, date, and validity. The analysis was carried out by Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps – a network of students at six universities on four continents trained in sourcing and verifying content from social media. 
Alongside interviews with protesters themselves, this analysis exposes a disturbing global trend of widespread, unlawful use of tear gas.  
The site includes a video done in collaboration with SITU Research, which analyzes the performance characteristics of tear gas, explains the inner workings of the munitions and shows how their misuse can maim and kill. 
Types of misuse 
Tear gas has been fired through the windshield of a passenger car, inside a school bus, at a funeral procession, inside hospitals, residential buildings, metros, shopping malls, and – strangely – in virtually empty streets. 
Security forces have also fired canisters directly at individuals, leading to fatalities; and from trucks, jeeps and drones whizzing by at high speeds. Those on the receiving end have included climate protesters, high school students, medical staff, journalists, migrants and human rights defenders, such as members of the Bring Back Our Girls movement in Nigeria. 
One video clip shows how police in the US city of Philadelphia on 1 June 2020 fired repeated volleys of tear gas at dozens of protesters trapped on a steep highway embankment with no safe escape route. 
Doctors in Omdurman, outside Sudan’s capital Khartoum, told Amnesty International that security forces and troops raided a hospital emergency room last year, filling it with noxious gas, further injuring 10 patients. One doctor said: “The soldiers fired tear gas and live ammunition inside the hospital, then some came to the emergency room and fired four tear gas canisters; thank God only one exploded.” A tear gas canister was thrown under the bed of a 70-year-old man who was a cardiac arrest patient. He died 10 minutes later. 
A video from Venezuela shows a tear gas canister punching a hole in a makeshift wooden shield a protester used to defend himself from police use of the weapon in Caracas. A close miss: just a few centimetres off and it could have caused a life-threatening injury. 
Amnesty International documented police abusing tear gas in multiple ways: 
The site includes video interviews with a range of external analysts – from an emergency physician to experts in policing, and business and human rights – about why tear gas is so harmful when used incorrectly. 
Amnesty International joins the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture in equating the use of tear gas in certain situations as amounting to torture or other ill-treatment. 
Poorly regulated trade  
Despite its widespread misuse, there are no agreed international regulations on the trade in tear gas and other riot control agents. Few states provide public information on the quantity and destination of tear gas exports, hampering independent oversight. 
Amnesty International and the Omega Research Foundation have campaigned for over two decades for greater controls on the production, use and trade in tear gas and other less lethal weapons. As a result, the UN and regional bodies such as the EU and the Council of Europe have recognized the need to regulate the export of less lethal weapons. 
Following high level diplomatic advocacy by the 60 plus states of the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade, supported by Amnesty International and Omega, the UN is now exploring potential development of international trade controls on less lethal weapons and other goods to prevent their use in torture, other ill-treatment and the death penalty. Amnesty International and Omega are now pressing for such measures to include tear gas and other riot control agents. 
“Part of the problem with tear gas is simply that some police forces misunderstand how and when it can be used lawfully, while others choose to ignore such guidance and some have weaponized it,” said Patrick Wilcken, Researcher, Arms Control, Security & Human Rights. 
“But part of the solution also needs to be greater scrutiny of the poorly regulated global trade in tear gas and other riot control agents. Tear gas should be covered by the international controls on less lethal weapons and restraints, currently being discussed at the UN.”

“Black people throughout our communities already experience disproportionate abuses of privacy and basic rights, and surveillance only exacerbates the potential for abuses”, said Michael Kleinman, the director of Amnesty International USA’s Silicon Valley Initiative. “We are seeing these violations play out daily as police departments across the United States use facial recognition technology to identify protestors. 
“Just the mere threat of surveillance creates a chilling effect on people that would otherwise exercise their right to protest. Instead of violating human rights daily out on the streets, law enforcement officers should be supporting people’s right to protest these killings and join communities in necessary dialogue. 
“The ability to be part of an anonymous crowd is what allows many people to participate in peaceful protests and to feel safe. Instead of using these technologies to heighten people’s fears, law enforcement should fulfill their obligations to respect and facilitate the right of people to peacefully protest.” 
Research has consistently found that facial recognition technology systems process some faces more accurately than others, depending on key characteristics including skin color, ethnicity and gender, creating inequities in both surveilling and policing. Just as concerning, facial recognition technology has seen a huge uptake in recent years – particularly in the realm of law enforcement. 
Amnesty International is calling for a total ban on the use, development, production, and sale, of facial recognition technology for mass surveillance purposes by the police and other government agencies in the United States, and also calling for a ban on exports of the technology systems to other countries.

CANADA MUST PUT AN END TO SAUDI ARMS EXPORTS   
A broad coalition of civil society organizations, human rights organizations, labour organizations and concerned individuals are calling for the Canadian government to end arms transfers to Saudi Arabia. A vigil will be held on 11 June 2020 in London, Ontario, outside of General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada beginning at 1 pm, alongside demonstrations that will take place in cities across Canada and virtually.  
Canada became a state party to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) in September 2019. That same year, despite announcing a moratorium on new arms export permits to Saudi Arabia, Canada exported more than $2.8 billion worth of weapons to the Kingdom, representing approximately 75% of all non-US destined arms exports from Canada. In April 2020, Canada expressed full support for the United Nations Secretary General’s appeal for an immediate global ceasefire in all parts of the world, but later that month lifted its moratorium on new export permits to Saudi Arabia.   
“The incompatibility of continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia with domestic and international arms control regulations has become impossible to deny,” said Cesar Jaramillo of Project Ploughshares. “Given continued arms sales to Saudi Arabia, Canada risks finding itself in non-compliance with the Arms Trade Treaty in its first year of being bound by this treaty. Each day that Canada continues arms exports to Saudi Arabia, its arms control and humanitarian credentials continue to crumble.”  
Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Yemen continues to deteriorate with disproportionate impacts on women and girls.   
“The stakes are particularly high in Yemen, where years of conflict and war – including deliberate strikes on clinics and hospitals – have caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The threat posed by COVID-19 in these circumstances is horrifying. Now more than ever, Yemen needs peace,” said Christine Martin of Oxfam Canada. “The arming and equipping of a regime that systematically oppresses women, and that plays a central role in the war in Yemen and the militarisation of the region, is fundamentally incompatible with the Trudeau government’s pursuit of a ‘feminist foreign policy’ and undermines its efforts as a global gender champion,” adds Allison Pytlak of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom.  
The cross-country demonstrations on Thursday aim to illustrate socially productive alternatives to the export of weapons to Saudi Arabia. “Everyone has a right to decent work. The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated how war industries – including those which produce arms – have been able to shift production quickly to socially beneficial uses, including ventilators and personal protective equipment,” said Simon Black of Labour Against the Arms Trade. “We call for public investment in a rapid transition to peaceful green jobs that protects workers and their communities.”

Since the start of the pandemic, we have been warning about the lack of adequate measures by the federal government to tackle the crisis. We do not consider concealing data and facts an appropriate response to get through this difficult time. 
In May, Amnesty International Brazil, together with 35 other rights organizations and social movements, launched the Our Lives Matter campaign. The objective of the campaign is for the Brazilian authorities to provide adequate and inclusive responses to address the COVID-19 pandemic without leaving vulnerable segments of the population behind. 
The campaign’s recommendations include the duty of the Ministry of Health and the state and municipal health departments to guarantee the proper recording of data on cases of flu-like illness and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In addition, the health authorities must guarantee the recording of death certificates, including information about race/colour, ethnicity, gender and gender identity, address and/or the community to which people who die from COVID-19 belong. The campaign also underlines the duty of those health authorities to record the place where each infected person was attended, specifying whether it was a public or private facility and the occupation of the person treated, in order to document and highlight inequalities in access to healthcare and enable the development of strategies to guarantee equity of access. 
  
On the subject of the analysis and dissemination of the data, the campaign notes that the health authorities must ensure that the figures contain disaggregated data to enable scrutiny by the various monitoring organizations, civil society and social movements. The compilation, analysis and publication of those data, as well as transparency in the handling of information, are fundamental for proposing and planning emergency policies, such as the construction of field hospitals, redeployment of staff and equipment to the most vulnerable regions, lockdown and social distancing measures, and the gradual easing of those measures. 
The Brazilian authorities have a duty to be transparent in the publication of pandemic-related data, which are in the public interest. The ruling of Federal Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Moraes considers that full publication of those data is required pursuant to Article 37 of the Brazilian Constitution, which states that: “The direct or indirect public administration of any of the Branches of the Union, States, Federal District and Municipalities shall obey the principles of legality, impersonality, morality, publicity and efficiency…” 
The vulnerable population groups for which we demand a response to COVID-19 are: favela residents, women, indigenous people, LGBTQI, especially trans people, quilombolas, migrants and refugees, homeless people, detainees, older people, children and adolescents in those various groups, the black population, and informal and self-employed workers.

“Allowing the Rohingya to disembark was a humane step in upholding their human rights. Boats carrying people in distress must always be allowed to land safely. They must not be pushed away, threatened or intimidated.  
“It is terrible that a woman’s body was found on board – it’s clear this boat was adrift and failing to find a safe shore until then. For one person, this rescue came too late. 
“Authorities must also respect the refugees’ right to health amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The Malaysian government has been detaining migrants and refugees in immigration detention centres that have seen outbreaks of COVID-19. We are concerned that this latest group of refugees will also be moved to these centres, placing them at a high risk of contracting the virus and keeping the pandemic alive. 
“We urge the authorities to provide refugees with their immediate humanitarian needs such as food, water, shelter and healthcare. They must also ensure that adequate preventative measures against COVID-19 are in place while in quarantine and afterwards. 
“Refugees should not be criminalized, detained or otherwise punished solely for their method of arrival in the country. Malaysian authorities should release refugees and migrants from detention centres so as to curb the spread of COVID-19, and ensure their needs are adequately met.” 
Background 
On 8 June, a task force comprising the Armed Forces, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) and the police intercepted a boat along the coast of Langkawi. Based on humanitarian grounds, the National Security Council allowed the boat to dock at the Teluk Ewa Jetty. All 269 refugees on board were subsequently detained at the Kem Bina Negara Wawasan in Langkawi. Authorities said that the body of a deceased woman was found on board. 
In May, the government conducted at least three large-scale raids against undocumented migrants and refugees, rounding up hundreds of individuals including young children in downtown Kuala Lumpur, Selayang and PJ Old Town. 
On 4 June Health Ministry director-general Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah announced that 270 new cases of COVID-19 were detected at the Bukit Jalil Immigration Detention Depot, making it the largest daily spike since the beginning of the pandemic. This followed a trend of COVID-19 clusters emerging from other detention centres in Putrajaya, Semenyih, and Sepang.

As Amnesty International highlights in a new interactive project, Building Immunity in Community, different communities face different threats and challenges and they are developing effective solutions based on the needs of the people and the resources at hand. Many communities need better healthcare equipment and services, many have concerns about over-crowded housing, and other people are checking in with elders, sharing food and traditional medicines, and creating emergency plans.  
“No two communities are the same – and Indigenous communities know what’s best for themselves,” said Ana Collins, Indigenous Rights Advisor with Amnesty International Canada. “Culture, governance, location, and history all shape how a community experiences this pandemic, but there are some shared concerns as well as solutions.”  
For example, in the Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory in Ontario, chief and council declared a state of emergency in the territory in early March, declaring that the community did not have adequate resources to slow the spread of the virus and that existing healthcare infrastructure would not be able to handle potentially large numbers of people in need of hospitalization. Community members were asked to self-isolate and remain within the territory.  
In Tsuut’ina Nation in Alberta, the community’s emergency response team has enforced a curfew and developed clear communications through social media and text messages to keep members informed and aware of COVID-19 symptoms and safe health practices. The community has not decided to close its borders as others have done.  
Ana Collins further noted that “in a time of crisis and pandemic, recognition of and respect for the sovereignty of an Indigenous nation is paramount to ensuring the well-being of a people. The ability of Indigenous peoples to be culturally well is reliant on the freedom they have to make decisions for the community, as a community.”  
“Human rights are an important part of an effective public health strategy and Indigenous rights are a holistic body of rights and responsibilities that build connections between people.”  
Amnesty International is inviting the public to explore the map, watch the short videos, read the histories, and background information, and hear directly from people who know their needs and communities best.

Over these past 10 days, the names, the pain, the images and the violence associated with anti-Black racism in the United States have been absolutely searing. The pain and violence of racism that Black communities across the country have endured for generations.  Many activists and commentators are pointing to a glimmer of hope and possibility that the resulting waves of anger, outrage, courage and protest can and will unleash the fundamental change that is so necessary. 
And it must. Change that is truly transformative. Change that addresses anti-Black racism in all its aspects, not only when it comes to the police but reaches far beyond. Change that dismantles the systems of oppressive white supremacy that are the source of this racism and have been its toxic fuel for centuries. Change that will endure. 
Amnesty International’s US section has been actively researching, advocating and campaigning with respect to deadly force, police accountability, racism, and gun violence in the United States for several years.  From Canada, we add our voices to the call for meaningful justice and accountability for the killing of George Floyd, and others whose names we know and those we do not, and for wider law reforms to address rampant racist police violence in the US, including for Congress to adopt the Police Exercising Absolute Care with Everyone (PEACE) Act. 
>> Take action and join us in demanding justice for George Floyd 
By no means is the ugly and disgraceful reality of anti-Black racism limited to the United States, including the deadly manifestations of that racism by police.  Entrenched racism against Black communities is a human rights crisis in societies and countries around the world, very much including Canada.  Suggestions made over the past week by various current and former Canadian politicians and other public figures, insisting that it is not a concern here, have rightly been roundly rejected.  
The dismal record is clear and irrefutable, including from comprehensive reports in recent years from the Ontario Human Rights Commission, Ontario’s Independent Street Checks Review, the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission, the City of Montreal Police Service and numerous United Nations human rights experts and committees.  Amnesty International has supported and reiterated the calls made by grassroots organizations working to confront anti-Black racism across Canada for the recommendations from these reports and reviews to be fully implemented, notably the call for an absolute ban on police carding and racial profiling. 
At the same time, there are of course far too many repeated reminders that anti-Indigenous racism permeates Canadian society, most certainly including the country’s policing and justice systems.  That was once again documented, with numerous associated Calls to Justice, in last year’s final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.  And it has been catalogued, with numerous, comprehensive and urgent recommendations for reform, in countless other national and provincial commissions, public inquiries and other reviews going back decades.  Recommendations that have been consistently shelved and left to gather dust. 
These grave concerns about anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism in policing in Canada do not abate in the slightest.  Just in the course of the 10 days since George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, Canadians have faced the deaths of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a Black and Indigenous woman who plummeted to her death from the 24th floor of a Toronto apartment building in the midst of an encounter with police, and Chantel Moore, an Indigenous woman who was shot and killed by police in Edmundston, New Brunswick.  Video of an Inuk man in the Nunavut community of Kinngait being struck and forcefully knocked down by the open door of an RCMP vehicle as it speedily drives at him has rightfully sparked outrage.  
And there have been reminders of many other recent deaths of Black people at the hand of police forces across Canada as well, including D’Andre Campbell, a Black man fatally shot by Peel Police in Brampton, Ontario in April. Investigations are pending in all of these cases. 
At rallies and marches, in media interviews and online discussions, activists and groups from the Black community nationwide are drawing these crucial connections and parallels between Canada and the United States.  Amnesty International Canada echoes and lifts up that fundamental concern.  That is why, in reacting to the police killing of George Floyd, we stressed that, 
“Anti-Black racism in policing is by no means limited to the United States. It crosses borders around the world, including here in Canada. Amnesty International unequivocally supports frontline groups and activists in communities across the country who work courageously and tirelessly to expose that racism and demand justice for the growing number of Black people who have been wrongly arrested, mistreated or killed by police in towns and cities in all parts of Canada. We continue to call on all governments in Canada to address these grave concerns as a top priority, including by enacting absolute bans on police carding and racial profiling and to ensure disaggregated data on arrests, shootings and killings is kept and made publicly available annually through police board reports.” 
We urge you to take action, today, to push for justice for George Floyd and support the call for urgent reforms to address police accountability, deadly force, racism and gun violence in the United States. 
We encourage you to learn from and provide active support to groups working to counter anti-Black racism in your own community. 
And we will have further resources over the coming days and weeks for specific campaigning and solidarity actions you can take to help pursue justice and to  address anti-Black racism, in policing here in Canada

From what we know, Idris Khattak was driving home from a trip to Islamabad when four men stopped his car. They put a black hood over his head and took him away to a secret place. The men were not wearing uniforms but Amnesty International thinks they work for the government.  
Amnesty also thinks that Idris Khattak was forced to disappear as punishment for reporting on human rights violations. In fact, Idris Khattak has worked with Amnesty International to inform us about the violations of basic rights that he was seeing. 
Idris Khattak’s daughters worry about the health of their father. He is probably not getting the medication he needs regularly for diabetes. Every day is painful for them because they don’t know where he is. 
Sadly, disappearances like this are common in Pakistan.  
Well, that’s not right. People shouldn’t just be captured and taken away without any explanation.  
It’s not right that family members are left to wonder where their loved ones are.  
It’s not right that the missing people are in extreme danger since their captors keep them out of sight.  
And it’s not right that powerful people can make people disappear just to keep them silent.

Prime Minister of Canada 
80 Wellington Street

June 3, 2020 
Dear Prime Minister, 
We are writing this Open Letter, on behalf of Amnesty International’s supporters across Canada and also reflective of the concerns of the entire global movement of Amnesty International, to urge you to take a much stronger position of unequivocal opposition to Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to annex a large part of the West Bank, land that is part of Occupied Palestinian Territory.   
Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to finalize this in the coming weeks. Such a step would violate the UN Charter, jus cogens norms of international law, and international humanitarian legal obligations. It would certainly stand as well to deepen and exacerbate decades of severe and entrenched human rights violations against Palestinians living in the West Bank. It is urgent and vital for Canada to express firm, explicit and public condemnation of this move. 
Notably a range of other governments, United Nations experts, including Canadian law professor and UN Special Rapporteur for human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Michael Lynk, and numerous international, Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations have all forcefully and clearly expressed opposition to Prime Minister Netanyahu’s intended annexation, highlighting the many ways it would directly violate as well as undermine numerous international legal obligations and set back the search for peace in the region.   
We have also taken note of media coverage of a letter to you from a group of 58 eminent former Canadian cabinet ministers, ambassadors to Israel, diplomats and government officials, raising considerable alarm about Prime Minister Netanyahu’s plan and calling on your government to register its opposition.  Their advice, based on their vast expertise and experience, should be given very high consideration.   
It is disappointing that up until this time, with the prospect of annexation drawing closer, clear Canadian opposition has not yet been forthcoming. We have noted the reiteration of Canada’s “commitment to international law and the rules-based international order” in your statement on May 18 welcoming the formation of a new government in Israel through an agreement reached between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Alternate Prime Minister Gantz.  
We have also seen that you referred to “Canada’s commitment to a two-state solution resulting from negotiations between the parties” in your discussions with these two leaders on May 18 and 19.   
While some commentators have taken these statements possibly to be reflective of an implicit indication that Canada would be opposed to any annexation, it is far from explicit and clear. 
This is not a time for subtlety, ambiguity or nuance.  This initiative to annex West Bank lands was given a boost by President Trump’s self-described “deal of the century” peace proposal announced in January, 2020. Amnesty International has made it clear that the Trump Administration’s plan would serve only to worsen human rights violations and enshrine the entrenched impunity that has fueled decades of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other grave violations.   
The Canadian government should be pursuing all possible steps to address and bring an end to the human rights violations caused by decades of Israeli occupation and unlawful settlements in the West Bank. In fact international humanitarian law obliges us to do so. To maintain an ambiguous position with respect to this plan for annexation runs counter to those legal obligations and would be an abdication of the international human rights leadership required and expected of Canada at this time. We look forward to hearing of Canada’s firm, public opposition to West Bank annexation in the very near future.

“People who ‘insult’ China’s national anthem could now be jailed for up to three years. But today the Hong Kong authorities have again insulted the right to freedom of expression in their latest attempt to criminalize peaceful dissent. 
“People’s right to express their different feelings about national anthems and other state symbols is well protected by international human rights law. This law’s broad and subjective provisions leave it open to wide interpretation and abuse. 
“The passing of this odious bill is an ominous sign for the future of human rights in Hong Kong. With China’s ruthless national security law looming, the city’s rights and freedoms are under greater threat than ever before.” 
Background 
The national anthem law makes “insulting” or “misusing” the Chinese national anthem punishable by a fine of up to HK$50,000 (US$6,400) and a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment. 
Since 2015, there have been several incidents of Hong Kong football fans booing or turning their backs when the Chinese national anthem is played at games. Such behaviour will be a criminal offence when the law comes into force on 12 June. 
Under international human rights law, freedom of expression can protect ideas and speech that some may find offensive if they are not intended or likely to incite imminent violence. International human rights standards make clear that peaceful criticism of, or insult to, the nation or its symbols, even if offensive, does not constitute a threat to national security or justify prohibition on other grounds.

In response, rather than moving forward with a mechanism to provide income supports to sex workers, government responded in a subsequent meeting with advocates by suggesting that local organizations working with sex workers apply to the $350 million Emergency Community Support Fund announced in May by Minister of Families, Children, and Social Development Ahmed Hussen. Most sex worker rights groups and other grassroots organizations serving marginalized communities do not fit the stated criteria to apply for such funds because they are often not registered non-profits or charities, and are made up of the marginalized individuals who have been left out of the pandemic response. In addition, the Fund does not cover income replacements. 
Most recently, the United Way—one of the three organizations distributing grants through the Fund—updated their FAQ section to emphasize that “this funding is for front-line community services for COVID-19 relief. The funding cannot be used to provide income replacement for individuals. Agencies that meet our eligibility criteria and are providing services and supports to individuals who need income supports, such as undocumented people or sex workers, can certainly apply for funding to serve these communities through eligible activities related to food security, mental health support, etc.” 
While food security in the form of grocery cards is important, sex workers require income supports to cover other necessities like rent and medication. 
Three months into the pandemic response, Canada continues to fail its most marginalized community members by neglecting to uphold the rights of sex workers. With no end to the pandemic in sight, government must act with urgency to provide low-barrier and accessible emergency income supports or cash equivalents to sex workers via the community organizations that serve them. 
UNAIDS has called “on all countries to take immediate, critical action, grounded in human rights principles, to protect the health and rights of sex workers” such as by ensuring “access to national social protection schemes for sex workers, including income support schemes.” 
The government of Canada’s lack of action on this issue is shameful.

Thank you for your steadfast commitment to women’s rights and gender equality, including your prompt action to mobilize funding to address the gendered impacts of the pandemic. We write at this time to urge that—further to your mandate to ensure that GBA+ is conducted of all government decisions—you ensure that sex workers and other women and gender diverse people working in informal economies and criminalized contexts, are not left out of the COVID-19 response. 
Sex workers are one of the most marginalized groups in Canada. Since the start of the pandemic, many sex workers have stopped direct-contact sex work to comply with social distancing guidelines. Others are out of work with the closure of strip clubs and massage parlours. Some sex workers—including those most marginalized—are not able to stop working and face an increased risk of surveillance. Most sex workers abruptly lost all their income, but because of the precarious and criminalized nature of their work, many sex workers do not qualify for CERB or other emergency income supports. 
Internationally, UNAIDS released a public statement on April 8, 2020, highlighting the concern that “as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sex workers all over the world are experiencing hardship, a total loss of income and increased discrimination and harassment.” The statement noted that “when they are excluded from COVID-19 social protection responses, sex workers are faced with putting their safety, their health and their lives at increased risk just to survive.” UNAIDS “calls on all countries to take immediate, critical action, grounded in human rights principles, to protect the health and rights of sex workers” such as by ensuring “access to national social protection schemes for sex workers, including income support schemes.” 
Faced with this situation, many sex workers’ organizations across Canada have conducted community fundraisers, in most cases providing $100 stipends to sex workers. But $100 is insufficient for sex workers to cover the cost of housing, food, and other essential for their families. 
Sex workers are stigmatized and targeted by the public, law enforcement and government, and many workers legitimately fear discrimination and avoid contact with government and social services. More marginalized workers may not have bank accounts. The criminalization of sex work is a direct barrier for sex workers who cannot and do not want to risk interacting with government agencies. This means that any government efforts to include these marginalized communities in emergency income supports must rely on civil society organizations with strong community connections who are best placed to receive funds and directly channel them to those who need them, and can provide anonymity and safety. 
The Prime Minister said that “Only by protecting each other can we protect ourselves.” To protect each other, and to ensure that human rights are at the centre of Canada’s pandemic response, the federal government’s pandemic response must recognize the vulnerabilities of particular communities and be non-discriminatory. Canada must guarantee equal access to income supports for sex workers. 
Minister Monsef, we call on you to take action to comply with UNAIDS’ urgent recommendations. As immediate first steps that should include: 
Urgently allocating funding to civil society organizations working directly with sex workers, with flexible granting mechanisms allowing organizations to transmit funds using pre-paid debit cards and other low-barrier methods to the communities they serve; and 
Meeting with sex workers’ rights organizations to discuss their concerns and jointly develop response strategies. 
We very much welcomed your Ministry’s swift action in transferring funds to Women’s Shelters Canada, empowering that organization to direct funds directly to women’s shelters across the country. We are asking you to do the same to ensure that some of the most marginalized women and gender diverse people are afforded the same access to emergency income supports as other people out of work across Canada. 
We hope to hear back from you soon. The Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform, an alliance of 26 sex worker rights groups across Canada—the majority of which are run by and for people who sell or trade sex—is available to virtually meeting with you at your earliest convenience to further discuss this matter. For more information and to schedule a meeting please email Jenn Clamen, National Coordinator, at contact@sexworklawreform.com. We plan to release this Open Letter publicly on May 30, and look forward to being able to include updated information about the government’s response to these concerns by that time. 
Thank you very much for your urgent attention to this pressing human rights issue. We look forward to hearing further from you and your officials.

Le Canada doit protéger les droits des travailleuses du sexe pendant la COVID-19 en garantissant l’accès à un soutien financier d’urgence  

Le 22 mai, plus de 20 organisations de défense des droits des femmes et de l’égalité au Canada ont écrit une lettre conjointe au gouvernement fédéral, appelant à un soutien financier d’urgence à faible barrière pour les travailleuses du sexe, qui jusqu’à présent ont été exclues de la riposte à la pandémie au Canada. En réponse, plutôt que d’aller de l’avant avec un mécanisme pour fournir un soutien financier aux travailleuses du sexe, le gouvernement a répondu lors d’une réunion ultérieure avec des défenseurs en suggérant que les organisations locales travaillant avec les travailleuses du sexe appliquent au Fonds de soutien communautaire d’urgence de 350 millions de dollars annoncé en mai par le ministre de Familles, enfants et développement social Ahmed Hussen. La plupart des groupes de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe et d’autres organisations de base au service des communautés marginalisées ne répondent pas aux critères énoncés pour demander de tels fonds car ils ne sont souvent pas des organisations à but non lucratif ou caritatives enregistrées et sont constitués des individus marginalisés qui ont été exclus de la réponse à une pandémie. De plus, le Fonds ne couvre pas les remplacements de revenu.

Plus récemment, Centraide – l’une des trois organisations qui distribuent des subventions par le biais du Fonds – a mis à jour sa section FAQ pour souligner que «Ce financement est destiné aux services communautaires de première ligne pour l’aide liée à la COVID-19. Il ne peut être utilisé pour fournir un remplacement de revenu aux individus. Les organismes qui répondent à nos critères d’admissibilité et fournissent des services et un soutien aux personnes nécessitant une aide au revenu, comme les sans-papiers ou les travailleurs du sexe, peuvent assurément demander un financement pour servir ces communautés en menant des activités admissibles liées à la sécurité alimentaire, au soutien en santé mentale, etc. »

Bien que la sécurité alimentaire sous forme de cartes d’épicerie soit importante, les travailleuses du sexe ont besoin d’un soutien financier pour couvrir d’autres besoins tels que le loyer et les médicaments.

Trois mois après le début de la riposte à la pandémie, le Canada continue de faire échouer les membres de sa communauté les plus marginalisés en négligeant de faire respecter les droits des travailleuses du sexe. Sans fin de la pandémie en vue, le gouvernement doit agir de toute urgence pour fournir aux travailleuses du sexe des soutiens financiers d’urgence accessibles et à faible barrière ou des équivalents de trésorerie via les organismes communautaires qui les servent.

L’ONUSIDA a appelé «tous les pays à prendre des mesures critiques immédiates, fondées sur les principes des droits de l’homme, pour protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les professionnel(le)s du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus. »

 Le manque d’action du gouvernement du Canada sur cette question est honteux.

OBJET: Un revenu de soutien d’urgence pour les travailleuses du sexe est nécessaire de toute urgence


Cher ministre Monsef,

Merci de votre engagement indéfectible en faveur des droits des femmes et de l’égalité des sexes, y compris votre action rapide pour mobiliser des fonds pour faire face aux impacts spécifiques au genre durant la pandémie. Nous vous écrivons pour insister sur le fait que – conformément à votre mandat de veiller à ce que l’ACS + soit menée dans toutes les décisions du gouvernement – vous vous assurez que les travailleuses du sexe, les autres femmes et les personnes avec d’autres identités de genre travaillant dans des économies informelles et des contextes criminalisés ne sont pas exclus de la réponse à la COVID-19.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont l’un des groupes les plus marginalisés au Canada. Depuis le début de la pandémie, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ont cessé le travail du sexe par contact direct pour se conformer aux directives relatives à l’éloignement social. D’autres sont sans travail avec la fermeture des clubs de danse érotique et des salons de massage. Certaines travailleuses du sexe – y compris les plus marginalisées – ne sont pas en mesure d’arrêter de travailler et font face à un risque accru de surveillance. La plupart des travailleuses du sexe ont brusquement perdu tous leurs revenus, mais en raison de la nature précaire et criminalisée de leur travail, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ne sont pas éligibles au PCU ou à d’autres aides d’urgence au revenu.

À l’échelle internationale, l’ONUSIDA a publié une déclaration à la presse le 8 avril 2020, soulignant la préoccupation que «la pandémie de COVID-19 place les travailleuses du sexe du monde entier face à des épreuves, à une perte totale de revenus, ainsi qu’à une hausse de la discrimination et du harcèlement». La déclaration a noté que «lorsque ces personnes sont exclues des ripostes à la COVID-19 pour ce qui est de la protection sociale, elles se retrouvent confrontées au choix difficile de mettre leur sécurité, leur santé et leur vie en danger juste pour survivre». L’ONUSIDA «invite les pays à prendre des actions essentielles et immédiates dans le respect des droits humains afin de protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les travailleuses du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus».

Face à cette situation, de nombreuses organisations de travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada ont organisé des collectes de fonds communautaires, accordant dans la plupart des cas des allocations de $100 aux travailleuses du sexe. Mais $100 n’est pas suffisant pour que les travailleuses du sexe puissent couvrir les frais de logement, de nourriture et d’autres éléments essentiels pour leurs familles.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont stigmatisées et ciblées par le public, les forces de l’ordre et le gouvernement, et de nombreuses travailleuses craignent légitimement la discrimination et évitent tout contact avec le gouvernement et les services sociaux. Les travailleuses plus marginalisées peuvent ne pas avoir de compte bancaire. La criminalisation du travail du sexe est un obstacle direct pour les travailleuses du sexe qui ne peuvent pas et ne veulent pas risquer d’interagir avec les agences gouvernementales. Cela signifie que tous les efforts du gouvernement pour inclure ces communautés marginalisées dans le soutien du revenu d’urgence doivent s’appuyer sur des organisations de la société civile ayant de solides liens communautaires qui sont les mieux placées pour recevoir des fonds et les acheminer directement vers les personnes qui en ont besoin, et peuvent assurer l’anonymat et la sécurité.

Le Premier ministre a déclaré: «Pour nous protéger, il faut d’abord nous protéger les uns les autres.» Afin de se protéger mutuellement et de faire en sorte que les droits humains soient au cœur de la réponse du Canada en cas de pandémie, la réponse du gouvernement fédéral en cas de pandémie doit reconnaître les vulnérabilités de certaines communautés et être non discriminatoire. Le Canada doit garantir l’égalité d’accès au soutien du revenu pour les travailleuses du sexe.

Madame la Ministre Monsef, nous vous demandons de prendre des mesures pour vous conformer aux recommandations urgentes de l’ONUSIDA. Comme premières étapes immédiates qui devraient inclure:

d’allouer d’urgence des fonds aux organisations de la société civile travaillant directement avec les travailleuses du sexe, avec des mécanismes d’octroi flexibles permettant aux organisations de transmettre des fonds à l’aide de cartes de débit prépayées et d’autres méthodes à faible barrière aux communautés qu’elles servent; et
de rencontrer des organisations de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe pour discuter de leurs préoccupations et élaborer conjointement des stratégies de réponse.


Nous nous félicitons vivement de la rapidité avec laquelle votre ministère a transféré des fonds à Refuge pour femmes Canada, ce qui a permis à cette organisation d’affecter des fonds directement aux refuges pour femmes à travers le pays. Nous vous demandons de faire de même pour garantir que certaines des femmes les plus marginalisées et des personnes avec d’autres identités de genre aient le même accès aux soutiens au revenu d’urgence que les autres sans emploi à travers le Canada.

Nous espérons avoir de vos nouvelles bientôt. L’Alliance canadienne pour la réforme des lois sur le travail du sexe, une alliance de 26 groupes de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada – dont la majorité est dirigée par et pour des personnes qui vendent ou échangent des relations sexuelles – est disponible pour vous rencontrer virtuellement le plus tôt possible pour discuter plus en détail cette question. Pour plus d’informations et pour planifier une réunion, veuillez envoyer un courriel à Jenn Clamen, coordonnatrice nationale, à contact@sexworklawreform.com. Nous prévoyons de publier cette lettre ouverte le 30 mai et nous espérons pouvoir inclure d’ici là des informations actualisées sur la réponse du gouvernement à ces préoccupations.

Bien que la sécurité alimentaire sous forme de cartes d’épicerie soit importante, les travailleuses du sexe ont besoin d’un soutien financier pour couvrir d’autres besoins tels que le loyer et les médicaments. 

Trois mois après le début de la riposte à la pandémie, le Canada continue de faire échouer les membres de sa communauté les plus marginalisés en négligeant de faire respecter les droits des travailleuses du sexe. Sans fin de la pandémie en vue, le gouvernement doit agir de toute urgence pour fournir aux travailleuses du sexe des soutiens financiers d’urgence accessibles et à faible barrière ou des équivalents de trésorerie via les organismes communautaires qui les servent.

L’ONUSIDA a appelé «tous les pays à prendre des mesures critiques immédiates, fondées sur les principes des droits de l’homme, pour protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les professionnel(le)s du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus. »

 Le manque d’action du gouvernement du Canada sur cette question est honteux.

OBJET: Un revenu de soutien d’urgence pour les travailleuses du sexe est nécessaire de toute urgence


Cher ministre Monsef,

Merci de votre engagement indéfectible en faveur des droits des femmes et de l’égalité des sexes, y compris votre action rapide pour mobiliser des fonds pour faire face aux impacts spécifiques au genre durant la pandémie. Nous vous écrivons pour insister sur le fait que – conformément à votre mandat de veiller à ce que l’ACS + soit menée dans toutes les décisions du gouvernement – vous vous assurez que les travailleuses du sexe, les autres femmes et les personnes avec d’autres identités de genre travaillant dans des économies informelles et des contextes criminalisés ne sont pas exclus de la réponse à la COVID-19.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont l’un des groupes les plus marginalisés au Canada. Depuis le début de la pandémie, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ont cessé le travail du sexe par contact direct pour se conformer aux directives relatives à l’éloignement social. D’autres sont sans travail avec la fermeture des clubs de danse érotique et des salons de massage. Certaines travailleuses du sexe – y compris les plus marginalisées – ne sont pas en mesure d’arrêter de travailler et font face à un risque accru de surveillance. La plupart des travailleuses du sexe ont brusquement perdu tous leurs revenus, mais en raison de la nature précaire et criminalisée de leur travail, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ne sont pas éligibles au PCU ou à d’autres aides d’urgence au revenu.

À l’échelle internationale, l’ONUSIDA a publié une déclaration à la presse le 8 avril 2020, soulignant la préoccupation que «la pandémie de COVID-19 place les travailleuses du sexe du monde entier face à des épreuves, à une perte totale de revenus, ainsi qu’à une hausse de la discrimination et du harcèlement». La déclaration a noté que «lorsque ces personnes sont exclues des ripostes à la COVID-19 pour ce qui est de la protection sociale, elles se retrouvent confrontées au choix difficile de mettre leur sécurité, leur santé et leur vie en danger juste pour survivre». L’ONUSIDA «invite les pays à prendre des actions essentielles et immédiates dans le respect des droits humains afin de protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les travailleuses du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus».

Face à cette situation, de nombreuses organisations de travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada ont organisé des collectes de fonds communautaires, accordant dans la plupart des cas des allocations de $100 aux travailleuses du sexe. Mais $100 n’est pas suffisant pour que les travailleuses du sexe puissent couvrir les frais de logement, de nourriture et d’autres éléments essentiels pour leurs familles.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont stigmatisées et ciblées par le public, les forces de l’ordre et le gouvernement, et de nombreuses travailleuses craignent légitimement la discrimination et évitent tout contact avec le gouvernement et les services sociaux. Les travailleuses plus marginalisées peuvent ne pas avoir de compte bancaire. La criminalisation du travail du sexe est un obstacle direct pour les travailleuses du sexe qui ne peuvent pas et ne veulent pas risquer d’interagir avec les agences gouvernementales. Cela signifie que tous les efforts du gouvernement pour inclure ces communautés marginalisées dans le soutien du revenu d’urgence doivent s’appuyer sur des organisations de la société civile ayant de solides liens communautaires qui sont les mieux placées pour recevoir des fonds et les acheminer directement vers les personnes qui en ont besoin, et peuvent assurer l’anonymat et la sécurité.

Le Premier ministre a déclaré: «Pour nous protéger, il faut d’abord nous protéger les uns les autres.» Afin de se protéger mutuellement et de faire en sorte que les droits humains soient au cœur de la réponse du Canada en cas de pandémie, la réponse du gouvernement fédéral en cas de pandémie doit reconnaître les vulnérabilités de certaines communautés et être non discriminatoire. Le Canada doit garantir l’égalité d’accès au soutien du revenu pour les travailleuses du sexe.

Madame la Ministre Monsef, nous vous demandons de prendre des mesures pour vous conformer aux recommandations urgentes de l’ONUSIDA. Comme premières étapes immédiates qui devraient inclure:

d’allouer d’urgence des fonds aux organisations de la société civile travaillant directement avec les travailleuses du sexe, avec des mécanismes d’octroi flexibles permettant aux organisations de transmettre des fonds à l’aide de cartes de débit prépayées et d’autres méthodes à faible barrière aux communautés qu’elles servent; et
de rencontrer des organisations de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe pour discuter de leurs préoccupations et élaborer conjointement des stratégies de réponse.


Nous nous félicitons vivement de la rapidité avec laquelle votre ministère a transféré des fonds à Refuge pour femmes Canada, ce qui a permis à cette organisation d’affecter des fonds directement aux refuges pour femmes à travers le pays. Nous vous demandons de faire de même pour garantir que certaines des femmes les plus marginalisées et des personnes avec d’autres identités de genre aient le même accès aux soutiens au revenu d’urgence que les autres sans emploi à travers le Canada.

Nous espérons avoir de vos nouvelles bientôt. L’Alliance canadienne pour la réforme des lois sur le travail du sexe, une alliance de 26 groupes de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada – dont la majorité est dirigée par et pour des personnes qui vendent ou échangent des relations sexuelles – est disponible pour vous rencontrer virtuellement le plus tôt possible pour discuter plus en détail cette question.

À l’échelle internationale, l’ONUSIDA a publié une déclaration à la presse le 8 avril 2020, soulignant la préoccupation que «la pandémie de COVID-19 place les travailleuses du sexe du monde entier face à des épreuves, à une perte totale de revenus, ainsi qu’à une hausse de la discrimination et du harcèlement». La déclaration a noté que «lorsque ces personnes sont exclues des ripostes à la COVID-19 pour ce qui est de la protection sociale, elles se retrouvent confrontées au choix difficile de mettre leur sécurité, leur santé et leur vie en danger juste pour survivre». L’ONUSIDA «invite les pays à prendre des actions essentielles et immédiates dans le respect des droits humains afin de protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les travailleuses du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus».

Face à cette situation, de nombreuses organisations de travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada ont organisé des collectes de fonds communautaires, accordant dans la plupart des cas des allocations de $100 aux travailleuses du sexe. Mais $100 n’est pas suffisant pour que les travailleuses du sexe puissent couvrir les frais de logement, de nourriture et d’autres éléments essentiels pour leurs familles.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont stigmatisées et ciblées par le public, les forces de l’ordre et le gouvernement, et de nombreuses travailleuses craignent légitimement la discrimination et évitent tout contact avec le gouvernement et les services sociaux. Les travailleuses plus marginalisées peuvent ne pas avoir de compte bancaire. La criminalisation du travail du sexe est un obstacle direct pour les travailleuses du sexe qui ne peuvent pas et ne veulent pas risquer d’interagir avec les agences gouvernementales. Cela signifie que tous les efforts du gouvernement pour inclure ces communautés marginalisées dans le soutien du revenu d’urgence doivent s’appuyer sur des organisations de la société civile ayant de solides liens communautaires qui sont les mieux placées pour recevoir des fonds et les acheminer directement vers les personnes qui en ont besoin, et peuvent assurer l’anonymat et la sécurité.

Le Premier ministre a déclaré: «Pour nous protéger, il faut d’abord nous protéger les uns les autres.» Afin de se protéger mutuellement et de faire en sorte que les droits humains soient au cœur de la réponse du Canada en cas de pandémie, la réponse du gouvernement fédéral en cas de pandémie doit reconnaître les vulnérabilités de certaines communautés et être non discriminatoire. Le Canada doit garantir l’égalité d’accès au soutien du revenu pour les travailleuses du sexe.

Madame la Ministre Monsef, nous vous demandons de prendre des mesures pour vous conformer aux recommandations urgentes de l’ONUSIDA. Comme premières étapes immédiates qui devraient inclure:

d’allouer d’urgence des fonds aux organisations de la société civile travaillant directement avec les travailleuses du sexe, avec des mécanismes d’octroi flexibles permettant aux organisations de transmettre des fonds à l’aide de cartes de débit prépayées et d’autres méthodes à faible barrière aux communautés qu’elles servent; et
de rencontrer des organisations de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe pour discuter de leurs préoccupations et élaborer conjointement des stratégies de réponse.


Nous nous félicitons vivement de la rapidité avec laquelle votre ministère a transféré des fonds à Refuge pour femmes Canada, ce qui a permis à cette organisation d’affecter des fonds directement aux refuges pour femmes à travers le pays. Nous vous demandons de faire de même pour garantir que certaines des femmes les plus marginalisées et des personnes avec d’autres identités de genre aient le même accès aux soutiens au revenu d’urgence que les autres sans emploi à travers le Canada.

Nous espérons avoir de vos nouvelles bientôt. L’Alliance canadienne pour la réforme des lois sur le travail du sexe, une alliance de 26 groupes de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada – dont la majorité est dirigée par et pour des personnes qui vendent ou échangent des relations sexuelles – est disponible pour vous rencontrer virtuellement le plus tôt possible pour discuter plus en détail cette question. Pour plus d’informations et pour planifier une réunion, veuillez envoyer un courriel à Jenn Clamen, coordonnatrice nationale, à contact@sexworklawreform.com. Nous prévoyons de publier cette lettre ouverte le 30 mai et nous espérons pouvoir inclure d’ici là des informations actualisées sur la réponse du gouvernement à ces préoccupations.

OBJET: Un revenu de soutien d’urgence pour les travailleuses du sexe est nécessaire de toute urgence


Cher ministre Monsef,

Merci de votre engagement indéfectible en faveur des droits des femmes et de l’égalité des sexes, y compris votre action rapide pour mobiliser des fonds pour faire face aux impacts spécifiques au genre durant la pandémie. Nous vous écrivons pour insister sur le fait que – conformément à votre mandat de veiller à ce que l’ACS + soit menée dans toutes les décisions du gouvernement – vous vous assurez que les travailleuses du sexe, les autres femmes et les personnes avec d’autres identités de genre travaillant dans des économies informelles et des contextes criminalisés ne sont pas exclus de la réponse à la COVID-19.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont l’un des groupes les plus marginalisés au Canada. Depuis le début de la pandémie, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ont cessé le travail du sexe par contact direct pour se conformer aux directives relatives à l’éloignement social. D’autres sont sans travail avec la fermeture des clubs de danse érotique et des salons de massage. Certaines travailleuses du sexe – y compris les plus marginalisées – ne sont pas en mesure d’arrêter de travailler et font face à un risque accru de surveillance. La plupart des travailleuses du sexe ont brusquement perdu tous leurs revenus, mais en raison de la nature précaire et criminalisée de leur travail, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ne sont pas éligibles au PCU ou à d’autres aides d’urgence au revenu.

Certaines travailleuses du sexe – y compris les plus marginalisées – ne sont pas en mesure d’arrêter de travailler et font face à un risque accru de surveillance. La plupart des travailleuses du sexe ont brusquement perdu tous leurs revenus, mais en raison de la nature précaire et criminalisée de leur travail, de nombreuses travailleuses du sexe ne sont pas éligibles au PCU ou à d’autres aides d’urgence au revenu.

À l’échelle internationale, l’ONUSIDA a publié une déclaration à la presse le 8 avril 2020, soulignant la préoccupation que «la pandémie de COVID-19 place les travailleuses du sexe du monde entier face à des épreuves, à une perte totale de revenus, ainsi qu’à une hausse de la discrimination et du harcèlement». La déclaration a noté que «lorsque ces personnes sont exclues des ripostes à la COVID-19 pour ce qui est de la protection sociale, elles se retrouvent confrontées au choix difficile de mettre leur sécurité, leur santé et leur vie en danger juste pour survivre». L’ONUSIDA «invite les pays à prendre des actions essentielles et immédiates dans le respect des droits humains afin de protéger la santé et les droits des travailleuses du sexe», notamment en garantissant «L’accès aux programmes nationaux de protection sociale pour les travailleuses du sexe, y compris aux plans d’aide liés à la perte de revenus».

Face à cette situation, de nombreuses organisations de travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada ont organisé des collectes de fonds communautaires, accordant dans la plupart des cas des allocations de $100 aux travailleuses du sexe. Mais $100 n’est pas suffisant pour que les travailleuses du sexe puissent couvrir les frais de logement, de nourriture et d’autres éléments essentiels pour leurs familles.

Les travailleuses du sexe sont stigmatisées et ciblées par le public, les forces de l’ordre et le gouvernement, et de nombreuses travailleuses craignent légitimement la discrimination et évitent tout contact avec le gouvernement et les services sociaux. Les travailleuses plus marginalisées peuvent ne pas avoir de compte bancaire. La criminalisation du travail du sexe est un obstacle direct pour les travailleuses du sexe qui ne peuvent pas et ne veulent pas risquer d’interagir avec les agences gouvernementales. Cela signifie que tous les efforts du gouvernement pour inclure ces communautés marginalisées dans le soutien du revenu d’urgence doivent s’appuyer sur des organisations de la société civile ayant de solides liens communautaires qui sont les mieux placées pour recevoir des fonds et les acheminer directement vers les personnes qui en ont besoin, et peuvent assurer l’anonymat et la sécurité.

Le Premier ministre a déclaré: «Pour nous protéger, il faut d’abord nous protéger les uns les autres.» Afin de se protéger mutuellement et de faire en sorte que les droits humains soient au cœur de la réponse du Canada en cas de pandémie, la réponse du gouvernement fédéral en cas de pandémie doit reconnaître les vulnérabilités de certaines communautés et être non discriminatoire. Le Canada doit garantir l’égalité d’accès au soutien du revenu pour les travailleuses du sexe.

Madame la Ministre Monsef, nous vous demandons de prendre des mesures pour vous conformer aux recommandations urgentes de l’ONUSIDA. Comme premières étapes immédiates qui devraient inclure:

d’allouer d’urgence des fonds aux organisations de la société civile travaillant directement avec les travailleuses du sexe, avec des mécanismes d’octroi flexibles permettant aux organisations de transmettre des fonds à l’aide de cartes de débit prépayées et d’autres méthodes à faible barrière aux communautés qu’elles servent; et
de rencontrer des organisations de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe pour discuter de leurs préoccupations et élaborer conjointement des stratégies de réponse.


Nous nous félicitons vivement de la rapidité avec laquelle votre ministère a transféré des fonds à Refuge pour femmes Canada, ce qui a permis à cette organisation d’affecter des fonds directement aux refuges pour femmes à travers le pays. Nous vous demandons de faire de même pour garantir que certaines des femmes les plus marginalisées et des personnes avec d’autres identités de genre aient le même accès aux soutiens au revenu d’urgence que les autres sans emploi à travers le Canada.

Nous espérons avoir de vos nouvelles bientôt. L’Alliance canadienne pour la réforme des lois sur le travail du sexe, une alliance de 26 groupes de défense des droits des travailleuses du sexe à travers le Canada – dont la majorité est dirigée par et pour des personnes qui vendent ou échangent des relations sexuelles – est disponible pour vous rencontrer virtuellement le plus tôt possible pour discuter plus en détail cette question. Pour plus d’informations et pour planifier une réunion, veuillez envoyer un courriel à Jenn Clamen, coordonnatrice nationale, à contact@sexworklawreform.com. Nous prévoyons de publier cette lettre ouverte le 30 mai et nous espérons pouvoir inclure d’ici là des informations actualisées sur la réponse du gouvernement à ces préoccupations.

Kate is...","Sex workers around the world have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and governments are not doing enough to protect them.  
On International Sex Workers’ Day we spoke to Kate McGrew, an artist, activist and sex worker living in Ireland, about what lockdown has been like. Kate is the Director of SWAI (Sex Workers’ Alliance Ireland), which has set up a hardship fund to support sex workers during the pandemic. She is also a co-convener of ICRSE (International Committee on the Rights of Sex Workers in Europe).   
What are Ireland’s laws around sex work? 
In 2017 Ireland introduced a law which criminalised the purchase of sex. Legislation which criminalises the buyer rather than the seller is sometimes called the “Nordic Model”. There are other laws in Ireland containing provisions which put sex workers at risk; for example, it is illegal to work in pairs or in groups.   
What challenges have sex workers in Ireland faced during the pandemic? 
The lockdown and physical distancing measures mean we can’t do sex work in person, which has left many people without any income. Most sex workers are already excluded from social protection which means they can’t access the COVID-19 emergency grant established by the Irish government.  
There is no safety net for us. Nothing to help us cover basic needs, support our families, or help with rent. The authorities communicated that people working in the informal economy, including those with irregular immigration status, would be able to access the emergency grant.  But sex workers I have spoken to in SWAI have encountered multiple barriers when trying to access it.  
What kinds of barriers do sex workers face? 
To access the emergency grant you need to be registered as self-employed or at least have a social security number, which excludes many sex workers straight away. 
Some people were granted the support and then told to return it because they weren’t paying taxes. Others were asked to prove the sources of their lost income, but most of the time people don’t want to disclose the fact they are sex workers. This is due to the stigma, and because they are fearful of criminal and immigration repercussions.  
What are potential immigration repercussions? 
A great number of sex workers in Ireland are undocumented migrants. The government announced a “firewall” between immigration enforcement and social protection services to allow people to access the emergency grant, but we have heard that this hasn’t always been the case. 
Undocumented migrant sex workers have more fears now. Unfortunately this means they try not to come to anyone’s attention – even if they need to access healthcare or social services.  
The harassment and stigma against sex workers are huge, and with COVID-19 we feel more scrutinised than ever.  
Can sex workers work virtually? 
Virtual work is not an option for many sex workers. Many women who normally work in the streets simply do not have the technology, they don’t have smartphones. Or they live with other people and don’t have the privacy. Others don’t feel safe working online in case their images are made public.  
The financial burden means sex workers are forced to take risks. Some sex workers have had to go back to living with abusive ex-partners for example, as a result of not being able to pay rent or having been threatened with eviction. 
Some have to consider working even if it’s not safe. There is also a lot of pressure from clients – some sex workers are telling us that clients are pressurising them to work or lose their business after the pandemic.  
What are the solutions sex workers propose – in times of the pandemic and also in its aftermath?  
Firstly, we need real access to emergency payments, so no one has to work when it’s not safe. 
But this situation has highlighted the fact that even a global pandemic cannot end demand for sex work. I hope this will allow people to see more clearly the danger that criminalising any aspect of sex work puts us in, and how many risks we must take in order to survive.  
We need to look at how we can protect sex workers, starting with repealing the section of the 2017 Sexual Offences Act that criminalised the purchase of sex and the increased penalties for workers working in pairs or groups. 
The more it is recognised that sex workers exist, the easier it will be to dismantle disinformation and harmful stereotypes about us.  
Overall, the authorities need to provide viable alternatives for people who work on the margins and end up engaging in sex work. But they also need to accept that some people will choose to do sex work over other work, or it is the only option to earn a living in their personal circumstances.   
Has anything positive come out of the pandemic? 
The response to SWAI’s hardship fund has been incredible. The number of people who have contributed to the crowdfund, including sex workers and allies, has been wonderful. It’s been sex workers helping each other. I performed the other day together with other sex worker comedians in one of the virtual fundraising events for the hardship fund, it was so sweet and we will continue to do things like that.   
But also, this pandemic gives us an opportunity to highlight some of the issues I’ve talked about.  People need to understand that our means of survival is work. We are not saying you have to like it but it is a lifeline for people so let’s make it as safe as possible.   
We need to work out ways to ensure that people who never want to do sex work don’t end up doing it,by focussing on structural inequalities and providing viable income alternatives. But we also need to keep the people who do as safe as possible, and protect them from exploitation.   
Background 
SWAI provides non-judgemental support, information and referral to sex workers in Ireland, on issues such as their rights, access to healthcare and immigration law, as well as challenges the stigma and discrimination sex workers often face. ICRSE unites sex worker-led organisations and their allies throughout Europe and Central Asia.  
ICRSE members have been monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on sex workers and appealing to states to comply with their human rights obligations and include sex workers in measures aiming to support and protect people during the pandemic and as lockdowns are eased.

This troubling move poses extremely dangerous implications for the people of Hong Kong, said several human rights defenders and federal politicians in a press conference today. 
Last week, the Canadian government released a joint statement – along with the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia – condemning the new legislation. Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English branch, said “it is now vital to deepen and expand on this joint declaration of concern, through consistent and forceful diplomacy with China, with other governments around the world, and in all available multilateral fora.”   
“As we prepare to mark the somber 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, more governments must be pressed to join in urging China to relent from taking this deeply troubling step,” Neve said. “For Canada, this needs to be part of an overall coordinated approach taking account of the many areas of human rights concern in our relationship with China, including unjust imprisonment and death sentences against at least six Canadian citizens. The Canadian government must work across all aspects of our relationship with China, including trade and investment, and more recent challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.” 
On Thursday, China’s National People’s Congress approved legislation targeting “separatism, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference.” It would also allow central government agencies responsible for national security to operate in Hong Kong, posing a clear threat to human rights in the city. 
With this new legislation looming, human rights groups in Canada say there is a mounting crisis in Hong Kong, with implications for Canada’s relationship with China, an increasingly urgent situation for refugees and immigrants and a pressing need for strong multilateral action.  
Avvy Go, Clinic Director at the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, said, “As the erosion of fundamental human rights in Hong Kong continues, the Canadian government should consider accepting more immigrants and refugees from that city, given the strong ties between Canada and Hong Kong.” 
Last year, millions of people took to the streets in protest of a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. Hong Kong police responded with batons, tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets and water cannons. In recent days, thousands of people have protested the national anthem bill, which would criminalize “insulting” or “misusing” the Chinese national anthem. Many of those demonstrators faced arrest or police pepper pellets, a sign that another summer of repression is looming in Hong Kong. 
“We have already seen the heavy-handed tactics that Hong Kong police have wielded against demonstrators,” said France Isabelle-Langlois, Directrice générale, Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “This new legislation gives Chinese authorities the green light to further clamp down and silence dissent in the city. Canada must urge more governments to join in its call urging China to back down from this dangerous national security law. If something isn’t done, we fear this will mark the beginning to the end of Hong Kong as we know it.”

“The violence that can no longer be ignored is the violence committed against Black lives by the police. The real disgrace is the anti-Black racism of the Trump administration.The President swore an oath to the nation to protect all of its people – not just those he deems worthy.  
“The time for justice has passed for George Floyd, his children, and his loved ones. The possibility for justice was taken away the day that he was killed. All that remains is accountability – and accountability has been absent from an administration that continues to fan the flames of hate.  
“People are angry. People are exhausted. They have a right to take to the streets and peacefully protest – everyone has that right. The rights of the many to take to the streets and demand justice and comprehensive police reform cannot be trampled upon, for any reason. No longer can police be allowed to run rampant and terrorize our communities. Law enforcement exists to work for the people – but it only seems to work for some. Black lives matter. Trans Black lives matter. Black immigrant lives matter. Black asylum-seeker lives matter. Sending in the military to respond to a peaceful revolution has been the only action this administration has taken. What’s been absent is a legitimate attempt to change a system that does not work for Black people, but directly oppresses them.  
“The U.S. system of policing is broken and needs systemic reform to root out racism and radically change its approach to law enforcement and human rights. Amnesty International USA is calling for a number of reforms, including passage of the PEACE Act to limit the use of deadly force, which should only ever be used as a last resort. When real reforms take place, only then will it send a message to Black people that their  lives matter and our Black communities can live in safety, justice and freedom.”

These children make up more than 50 percent of the Rohingya refugees. In June 2019, Amnesty International organized the “When I Grow Up” art camp with 160 Rohingya children from the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. This was themed around their aspirations for the future and what careers they wished to pursue. The children’s works of art were then produced in a book and an exhibition in Dhaka, which brought together the Government of Bangladesh, donor agencies, representatives of the foreign missions in Bangladesh and the UN agencies. The art camp and the subsequent exhibition – both titled “When I Grow Up” – were the start to an ongoing campaign aimed at encouraging access to education for Rohingya children. 
Over the course of Refugee Week (starting June 15, 2020) and leading up to World Refugee Day on June 20, you can check out the artwork made by the children on Amnesty International Canada’s Instagram page. Follow along every day this week as we post the stories shared from the art camp. 
Reflecting on this project, youth volunteers and members of AIC(ES)’s National Youth Action and Advisory Committee have shared how they connect to the individual pieces of art created by some of the children during the camp. Here are their thoughts: 
 
Currently, there are over 3.8 billion people who lack access to healthcare. Health care is a ‘basic human right, as essential as food and shelter’. One’s health and wellbeing are fundamental indicators of their quality of life. The reasons why these rights are withheld from the many are great. An absence of affordable and accessible education for health professionals in areas that need them most create both a lack of health care providers and care prices accessible to few. Despite this, the dreams of boys and girls, very much like Mohammad, to push back against the system and to become doctors or nurses keep the candle burning.  It is their dreams of a better future for themselves and their communities that bring light to the darkness. 
Noble and caring, doctors have played a significant role in both my life and the lives of my loved ones. They have helped us when we were ill and healed us when we were hurt. They have always acted as important supports in our lives. Looking back now, I realize that healing is not an easy profession. It can be a prickly path. It is not what it is far too often fantasized to be. It is not simply handing out prescriptions, observing symptoms, or giving IVs. It is far more than that. It is the long nights, the desperate hope for the sun to rise the next day for all under your care, and the moments of grief over loss. It is the future contributions of doctors that must be recognized- the hopes and dreams of those, like Mohammad, who are willing to take the step to dedicate themselves to this profession.  Doctors will become ever-more important in society, given the unprecedented growth in world population and the continual cuts in governmental education and healthcare budgets. The world needs doctors. It needs more people like Mohammed who will meet that desperate demand.  – Aidan Sander 
 
Fashion: an expression of individuality. Deemed superficial and unimportant by many in our society, personal fashion gives every passing stranger a glimpse into your multifaceted life. Due to the western centralization of trends and fast-fashion, it has become rare to find originality and true passion for the fundamentals of fashion: originality, expression, and change. The fashion and trends of an era defines it, allowing it to make its mark in the history of our humanity. However, the legacy must be created by one brave soul like Nur who dares to pursue their often downplayed dreams. It takes one child who is bold enough to entirely express themselves in their work- creating permanent change in their society.  
As a girl who grew up putting on fashion shows for her family with clothes designed from old t-shirts and towels, fashion holds a special place in my heart. Being extremely shy in my early years, clothing gave me an outlet to put my personality on display. Constantly making new clothes designed uniquely for my loved ones, I was able to display my affection and understanding for those around me. Having grown up, I still find myself feeling the most confident in clothing that represents me, rather than feeling the pressure to succumb to norms. My heart goes out to Nur, and every child who aims to revolutionize their community in their own, innovative way. These are often the same children who are told to be more practical, resulting in complete suppression of the creative drive that every society needs. Being a tailor- on a big or small scale- is a highly overlooked profession. It is the product of this profession that allows every individual to display themselves as they please. Without children like Nur, being brave enough to act upon the need for change, our society would never progress. – Anjali Choudhary  
 
Ayatullah’s story really spoke to me. I cannot imagine the pain of losing parents or siblings, and I am very fortunate to have both of my parents still alive today as well as my sister. I admire Ayatullah for his passion and commitment. What strikes me about Ayatullah’s story is that he wants to be a weatherman because he does not want anyone to go through what he has gone through. When I was younger, I got diagnosed with PTSD before I was 7 years old and struggled with it throughout the majority of my childhood. Effects still come through today and make up the person that I am. When I was going through the diagnosis process and seeking help, I had one therapist who really helped me and made sure that I did not get pushed through and lost in the system. Her name was Stacey. 
Even though I have successfully blocked out many years of my childhood as a result of my PTSD, I did not forget. I will never forget or discredit the impact that Stacey had and continues to have on my life to this day, even though I have stopped treatment over 10 years ago. Many of the specialists and therapists I saw as a child worried that I would not be able to leave home, form healthy relationships, or be able to stand out on my own one day. However, here I am. Stacey believed in me and worked tirelessly with me to ensure that I had a prosperous future ahead of me because she believed in me. 
As a result of this, throughout high school, when I was trying to decide what I wanted to be when I grew up, I knew that I wanted to do something to help young people, like young Cassandra. I knew that I could have ended up a very different person who was not afforded the skills to be able to be out on my own, forming healthy relationships, and being able to cope with post-PTSD side effects and chain reactions. I always felt supported and empowered as a result of Stacey’s guidance, kindness, and skills. Therefore, I decided I wanted to get into social work in order to be there for people like my younger self. Now, I am in my fourth year of Honours Professional Social Work with a minor in Human Rights and Equity Studies. Like Ayatullah, I want to help others, not in weather, but to ensure that they feel supported and empowered throughout their journey. Thank you for sharing your story, Ayatullah. – Cass DeFreitas 
 
Freedom of movement is a universal human right that I believe that Yeasir represents through his drawing and quotation of wanting to fly over to Malaysia in order to be reunited with his father. My heart goes out to the many children around the world who are limited in their ability to be able to travel and be with loved ones, and my emotions of frustration are inevitable when thinking about the fact that humanitarian crises often result in family separation in the first place. Conflict has the ability to force people to flee their countries of origin and make it so that it is very difficult to return, thus making it even more difficult to reunite as a family if separated in different countries. When one is relocated to another country, mobility becomes extremely limited in such a way that it impedes on the agency of individuals. When my mother was a child, the Lebanese Civil War resulted in her and her relatives becoming displaced to different places around the world. Much like how Yeasir’s father is in Malaysia while he is in Bangladesh, my mother was in Canada while some of her loved ones were in Germany or Lebanon. Oftentimes, financial and safety restraints make it inaccessible for refugees to have freedom to get outside of their current circumstances. Being so young, I can only imagine how much Yaesir yearns to be able to visit his father in a place he might imagine to better than where he is now. 
Yeasir’s picture and message remind me of how much I have taken mobility and family in general for granted. I know how much it meant for me growing up being able to travel every summer to visit my relatives in Ottawa, and I cannot imagine it being any different. This past summer, my mother was reunited with her uncle for the first time in close to 40 years. It was a beautiful moment to experience, and I wish that for everyone. I want to be a part of a movement that fights for a future where children do not have to live in conditions where they are forcibly separated from their family members and unable to have the right to move around. I want a future where children like Yeasir do not have to draw themselves on a plane, but instead, just exist in a way that feels right and have all human rights honoured. – Fatima Beydoun 
 
Ullah, a 10 year old boy from Burma, has a dream of becoming a driver in the future. Ulah took four days to get to Bangladesh from Burma, and he now lives in Lambasia in Kutupalong Camp. I lived in three different countries myself, I know how hard it is to move to a different environment. Reflecting my own experiences, I cannot imagine how hard it was for him to go through such a hard time at his age. But I believe that his dream of becoming a driver can be a support for him to go through hardships. One of the things that helped me get through tough times was the motivation I get from my goal or a dream. When you have a goal or a dream to aspire to, you feel motivated to overcome challenges that you are facing and to step forward. It is not easy to take a step toward dreams sometimes, especially in some places around the world. Here in Canada, children have access to education and there are many opportunities for them to explore and pursue their goal or dream. But, in some places, children do not have access to an adequate education nor get opportunity to pursue their goal. As he grows up into a young adult and to adult, I think the societies’ norm, expectations, role, and social institutions will have a huge impact on his life.  
I was 15 years old when I came to Canada, and this transition had a positive impact on my life, by giving me an opportunity to have access to high quality education and life as well as it broadened my opportunity for future careers. I think this is because Canada has well developed social institutions of government and education that ensures everyone has access to a certain quality of life. But in some places like Burma or Bangladesh, I believe that children’s opportunity and access to resources are limited by society. For Ulah, he will need to get a licence to be a driver. Drivers licence is fairly accessible and easy to get in Canada, but it could be much harder for him. Education provides not only the academic bases such as the ability to read and write, but also to teach a variety of skills to grow up as a person and to survive. I believe those skills both academic and social are essential to not only raise one’s life quality, but to start making changes and to improve life for the future generations. Through learning about Ulah and living children around the world, I could learn how precious the environment and opportunities are that I have. I hope Ulah and other children from Burma will be able to get a better opportunity to have quality life and opportunity for their future, and children who do not have education will be reduced. – Azumi Koga 
 
As each year passes, global migration continues to increase at rates that outpace the growth of the world’s population itself. This migration takes many forms including international immigration and forced displacement, but the commonality among them typically involves leaving a place that is home in an effort to build a new one. When I was very young my parents immigrated to Canada from Pakistan. Although it’s been about 16 years since I’ve been back, and I can happily say Canada is “where I am from”, I still consider Pakistan home – it’s a place that resonates deeply in terms of family, culture, language, etc. This is why I was very touched when I read Sabuku’s quote, because for me I recognized a yearning to return to a place that is irreversibly a profound part of who you are.  
Of course my experience and Sabuku’s are extremely different. I cannot begin to imagine the experience of an eight year old caught in the Rohingya crisis, trying to navigate life in a new environment after seeking refuge. Unfortunately the reality is that there are thousands of children like Sabuku currently in Bangladesh, and they are most susceptible to the risks and challenges associated with forced migration. I only hope that the Bangladeshi government will ensure that these children receive the education and social services that they need in order to have the health and standard of living that all human beings are entitled to. – Maha Asad 
 
Right now, there are 131 million girls who are out of school. There are many reasons why so many girls are out of school – lack of safety to travel to and from school, devaluation based on harmful gender norms, lack of access to menstrual hygiene products or lack of access to affordable education. All these factors trap millions of young girls in the cycle of poverty and keeps generation after generation of girls out of school. But all it takes is one girl with a dream to break that cycle – one girl like Bristy. One girl who not only dares to dream of a better future for herself, but for the futures of all students to come.  
Growing up, teachers had a profound impact on me. Everything from how I learned to handle successes and failures, to developing a strong sense of self-esteem, to learning to believe in myself – some of my teachers have been instrumental in not only my academic growth, but my personal growth as well. Having grown up, I now realize how difficult teaching really is. It is more than just following a curriculum or grading papers – it is about providing meaningful support to each of your students day after day, year after year. It takes people with a special kind of heart to be a teacher, because it is not an easy job.  
We owe it to all the young people of the world, including Bristy, to recognize the power of teachers and aspiring teachers around the world. Right now, we live in an era of rampant education cuts and constraints – cuts to funding, cuts to free or accessible public school, cuts to accommodation and aides for neurodiverse children, rising tuition and student debt, and demonization of teachers in mainstream political discourse. Current and future teachers like Bristy have the power to make a positive impact on hundreds, thousands, even millions of children to break cycles of abuse and poverty. – Roshni Khemraj (Bristy, Age 12)

On March 21st, the federal government decided to shut the door to people seeking refugee protection who are entering from the US, for 30 days. The government said the decision was based on the COVID-19 crisis and that it needed to take this step to limit cross-border travel to only essential travel. 
Canada’s decision to shut the border to refugee claimants puts those individuals in danger, is out of step with public health measures designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, and runs counter to our international legal obligations.

0,Amnesty International Canada calls UN list of companies to stop operating in Israeli settlements,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/amnesty-international-canada-calls-un-list-of-companies-to-stop-operating-in-israeli-settlements/,"In February, the UN Human Rights Council released a long-awaited list of 112 companies actively involved in business activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.

The list of 112 companies contained within the report refers to a wide range of sectors including construction, food, banks, retail and transport. Most are headquartered in Israel with more than a dozen headquartered internationally. 
“The publication of this list is a timely reminder that settlements are illegal and must never be normalized. Listed businesses have no excuse; to continue their involvement in Israeli settlements is to knowingly breach their international obligations,” said Saleh Higazi, Amnesty International’s Middle East Deputy director. 
The Human Rights Council has stated that business activities in the Occupied Territories contribute to and propagate ongoing systematic human rights violations there. 
This is done by promoting the development and expansion of illegal settlements and construction of the wall through the supply and provision of: 
Furthermore, these businesses profit from the settlement enterprise through the use of: 
Meanwhile, the Palestinian population is subject to gross human rights violations and the negative impact of: 
Several of the companies listed in the UNHRC report are travel-related websites, which offer accommodations and vacation getaways in settlement properties. 
Amnesty International’s “Destination: Occupation” campaign focuses on four of these companies: Airbnb, Tripadvisor, Expedia and Booking.com. The report uncovers how digital tourism companies contribute to – and profit from – violations of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In direct contradiction with their own corporate standards, they normalize the illegal settlements and contribute to gross human rights violations by doing business in the OPT. 
In 2019, Airbnb sparked international outrage after it reversed its decision to remove around 200 properties rented by Israeli settlers in the illegally-occupied West Bank from its website. 
“These companies are promoting tourist attractions which are linked to war crimes. This welcome move by the OHCHR must increase pressure on tourism companies to stop listing attractions on stolen land,” said Saleh Higazi. 
The Canadian government’s 2019 adoption of Bill C-85 implies that Canada not only accepts the illegal construction of settlement homes and infrastructure on Palestinian land, but is actively contributing to Israeli and international businesses in settlements. 
Through the adoption of Bill C85, the Canadian government enables the unlawful appropriation of Palestinian resources, including land, water and minerals, to produce goods that are exported and sold for private profit. In doing so, it fails to meet its obligation under international law not to recognize as lawful an illegal situation. Canada must take immediate action to stop the financial support and expansion of settlements and ban settlement goods from entering its markets. 
In 2019, UN Special Rapporteur Michael Lynk and Amnesty International Canada’s Secretary General, Alex Neve, had this to say: 
“The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement […] provides encouragement to the economic growth of the settlements by allowing their goods and services to enter Canada tariff-free. 
Treating the Israeli settlements as part of Israel, and extending the benefits of our open market to settlements’ goods and services, entangles Canada in the serious violations of both international human rights and humanitarian law that are part and parcel of the Israeli occupation. 
With its eyes wide open, the Canadian government is extending economic benefits and political cover to an illegal enterprise at a time when these settlements are undermining the chances for peace and generating systematic human rights violations.” 
Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies are required to “avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities and address such impacts when they occur.” 
Amnesty International is thereby calling for both the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to work in collaboration with other stakeholders to ensure that the list of companies is regularly updated and predictably financed, with clear reporting time frames, to allow for continued scrutiny of businesses linked to human rights violations in the OPT. Furthermore, we call on these companies to comply with their international responsibilities and stop doing business in the settlements. 
Amnesty Canada continues to call upon the government of Canada to ensure that the federal government accepts and complies with its binding obligations under international law and Canadian law by taking all necessary steps to halt the financial support and assistance provided to the illegal Israeli settlements by prohibiting all settlement goods and services from entering the Canadian market.

“COVID-19 must not be used as an excuse to stifle freedom of expression. Hong Kong authorities should help facilitate a socially distanced Tiananmen vigil rather than outright banning it. On June Fourth, of all days, people in Hong Kong must be allowed to peacefully exercise their rights to freedom of expression and assembly. 
“In recent weeks we have seen the Hong Kong police repeatedly clamp down on peaceful protests with arbitrary mass arrests and excessive force – including the use of tear gas and pepper pellets. By deeming this important memorial event ‘illegal’, the police have again needlessly exacerbated rising tensions when thousands of people simply want to light a candle for those who lost their lives during the horrific events of 4 June, 1989. 
“With this ban, and a disastrous national security law looming, it is not clear if Hong Kong’s Tiananmen vigil will ever be allowed to take place again.”  
Background 
On the evening of 3–4 June, 1989 in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, hundreds – possibly thousands – of people were killed when troops opened fire on students and workers who had been peacefully calling for political and economic reforms as well as an end to corruption. No one knows the exact number of fatalities since the Chinese authorities have stifled and censored discussion of the crackdown for the past three decades. 
Every year on 4 June since 1990, tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of people have joined a candlelit vigil in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park to remember those killed and call on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and take accountability for the fatalities. 
On Monday, police banned Thursday’s planned event on public health grounds. Hong Kong’s ban on gatherings of more than eight people due to COVID-19 was recently extended until Friday, 5 June. The city has had a total of 10 locally transmitted cases of the virus in the past six weeks. 
Protests have reignited in Hong Kong in recent weeks in response to a Beijing-imposed framework for a national security law for the city and another locally proposed law that would criminalize ridicule of China’s national anthem. 
Last Wednesday, police indiscriminately fired pepper pellets to disperse a protest, while more than 300 people were arbitrarily arrested in a heavy-handed police operation. 
Last month, the Macau government also banned the city’s annual Tiananmen photo exhibition despite no social distancing measures being in place.

The number of Black people in the US who have been killed, profiled, harassed or otherwise targeted by law enforcement including police, security guards and by private citizens continues to grow at a staggering rate. Further, the number of Black women, transgender, and gender non-conforming people who die from racist, sexist, and transphobic violence is an alarming cause for concern. Breonna Taylor and Tony McDade are the latest on this often-omitted list. 
“The intersections of race, gender, and sexuality play a key role in who is remembered, who is not, and whose deaths spark widespread outrage,” said Daniella Barreto, Digital Activism Coordinator with Amnesty International Canada. “Any Black person murdered is a tragedy that warrants action.” 
The utter failure of justice and accountability for past killings has clearly created a climate of full-scale impunity fueled by toxic levels of anti-Black racism such that large numbers of police and private citizens feel free to threaten, attack, shoot and kill Black people without consequence. 
Amnesty International joins the call for a firm and decisive response to the killing of George Floyd that will break through that impunity. The news of the arrest of Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin is an important step. To ensure that this case will be handled with complete impartiality, an Independent Prosecutor should now be appointed. 
“Anti-Black racism in policing is by no means limited to the United States. It crosses borders around the world, including here in Canada,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English branch. “Amnesty International unequivocally supports frontline groups and activists in communities across the country who work courageously and tirelessly to expose that racism and demand justice for the growing number of Black people who have been wrongly arrested, mistreated or killed by police in towns and cities in all parts of Canada. We continue to call on all governments in Canada to address these grave concerns as a top priority, including by enacting absolute bans on police carding and racial profiling and to ensure disaggregated data on arrests, shootings and killings is kept and made publicly available annually through police board reports.” 
These incidents are not rare in Canada. Twenty-six-year-old D’Andre Campbell was shot in his home by Peel police officers in April this year. Amnesty International is closely watching developments with respect to the tragic death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet in Toronto on May 27. Ms. Korchinski-Paquet, who is Black and Indigenous, plummeted to her death from the 24th floor of her apartment building after Toronto police officers entered the residence. Her family had reportedly been made to wait in the hallway outside the apartment. Serious concerns have been raised and questions asked, including by her family, about the circumstances surrounding her death. Ontario’s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) – the province’s police watchdog – is investigating the case. 
“The SIU investigation will take time. Meanwhile there is an urgent need for more information now, especially given the serious questions raised as to whether police may in any way have played a part in Regis Korchinski-Paquet’s tragic death,” said Neve. “Toronto police must take steps that will build confidence for her family that those concerns are front and centre at this time and will be addressed on the basis of meaningful and independent reviews, assessment or advice in the coming days. Too often concerns about anti-Black racism in policing in Canada have been ignored or have been examined through investigations and reviews that have dragged on interminably. Justice delayed is not justice, it only deepens injustice.”     
Amnesty International has also previously highlighted how the Canadian justice system is fraught with racism that disproportionately impacts Black people and communities across the country, including the police practice of carding. Amnesty International maintains its call for a permanent and effective ban on carding, as it’s a form of systemic police discrimination that violates several human rights.

Governments must take action to ensure their basic rights and safety are never put at such horrendous risk again.”Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
As the crisis in Ontario and Quebec’s long-term care homes dominates the new headlines this week, the need to listen to, support and protect health care workers in all sectors has never been more urgent. 
More than half of the people in the world who have tested positive for COVID-19 live in the Americas. Several countries in the region are entering their deadliest phases in the coming weeks. Health and social care infrastructures are weak in several countries. Some governments, already marked by repressive measures, are further restricting rights and freedoms, and even denying the pandemic or its diverse impact on communities. 
There are more than 9 million health care workers in the region, including  medical and nursing staff, cleaning staff in hospitals and care homes, medical and security transport, and  others working  to  assist  people  affected  by  the  COVID-19. At least 70% of this workforce are women. 
Those on the front line of the response – particularly the most vulnerable people – not only work in unsafe conditions with insufficient protective equipment, but also risk reprisals from authorities or employers if they raise their voices. Some have face stigmatization, physical attacks, death threats and even denial of services such as use of public transport. People with lower wages and precarious employment are among the least protected. 
The protection of health workers, by both states and companies, is crucial to ensuring the health of the more than one billion people who live in the Americas. Deemed “essential workers”, too often their rights are sidelined. 
Amnesty International is calling on governments to guarantee workers ́ rights to health and safety, to express their opinions without being silenced, and to not suffer harassment or discrimination.

They help run women’s shelters and sexual assault crisis centres and drop-in centres. They call out discrimination and work to overturn unjust structures, systems, and policies. All incredibly valuable work that’s needed now more than ever during a global pandemic, right? 
But too many women human rights defenders around the world remain in prison, jailed for peacefully promoting women’s rights, and at increased risk as COVID-19 spreads through prisons in some countries. Too many activists and journalists are being threatened for their reporting on COVID-19. And too many women human rights defenders who are socially distancing at home are being targeted for harassment and violence because those who want to harm them now where they can find them at all times—home. 
Now more than ever we need to ramp up our activism in solidarity with women human rights defenders around the world. Below are a few actions you can take now. We will add more actions in the coming weeks and months. 
May 15 is an anniversary we don’t want to have to mark. It’s the two year anniversary of the arrest of Loujain al-Hathloul, an incredible women human rights defender from Saudi Arabia who was arrested a month before women in the kingdom were allowed to drive. What was one of the key things Loujain long advocated for? The right to drive. Loujain and other women human rights defenders have been charged, jailed, tortured, and some still remain in prison, just for advocating for justice and equality for women in Saudi Arabia. On top of that, there are now fears that COVID-19 could quickly spread through Saudi prisons. 
Learn more and sign the e-action calling for the release of the women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia! 
 
On Friday, May 15 (and throughout the weekend), join the global Twitter storm flooding Saudi authorities with messages calling for all the women human rights defenders to be released, and for charges against them to be dropped.

We are incredibly concerned about the safety and health of women human rights defenders jailed in Iran, most of them in the notorious Evin prison, because of an outbreak of COVID-19. These activists should not be in prison in the first place, and they definitely shouldn’t be there—and without access to proper hygiene supplies, sanitation, and medication—in the midst of a pandemic. 
We will continue to post urgent actions related to women human rights defenders who are at heightened risk during the pandemic.

While you’re social distancing at home, why not check out some documentaries to support content by women, trans and non-binary people, and to deepen your learning. 
The Women Making Movies virtual film festival has been extended to the end of May, meaning you can access some amazing feminist documentaries for free! Go to this webpage and the festival access code is strong-wave20. Be sure to check out “I am the Revolution” – a great film about incredible women human rights defenders advocating for gender equality in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. 
If you have access to Netflix search under “feminist” or “women” and a range of documentaries, shows, and movies appear including “Period. End of Sentence,” “Miss Representation,” and “Standing Tall.” As you check out the selection of documentaries on Netflix give some thought to whose voices are represented in the films, whose are missing, which films perpetuate a saviour narrative, and which films are by and for women and promote diversity and empowerment?

0,Take Action for Rios Vivos and other Colombian Defenders as Killings Increase,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/take-action-for-rios-vivos-and-other-colombian-defenders-as-killings-increase/,"Since March 14, some 9,000 activists and supporters of Amnesty Canada sent email messages to Export Development Canada’s CEO and Canada’s International Trade Minister demanding remedy for the harm caused by a disastrous big dam project that Canada helped finance in Colombia.

This action was developed in coordination with Rios Vivos (Spanish for Living Rivers), a coalition whose members have been threatened and attacked – with six leaders killed – as they continue to speak out against the impacts of the dam on the environment vital to their health and livelihoods.  
 
“How heartening it is to learn that there has been so much action in Canada,” said Rios Vivos spokesperson Isabel Zuleta, pictured above giving a presentation during last November’s visit to Canada. “I will share your activism with our members so they can take strength from it in these hard times.” 
We will be following up with Canadian authorities regarding their response and will report back as soon as possible. 
New Campaign Priority 
Right now, we are seeking to increase pressure on the Colombian government because of concerns that measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are being used as a pretext to weaken or withdraw protection for threatened human rights defenders like Isabel Zuleta and the communities she works with.  
“Things are very bad around here,” Isabel Zuleta told us. “With this pandemic, the risk increases. Today we face the terrifying situation in which the virus is being used to justify attacks on defenders. I am very concerned because there are so many armed groups and paramilitaries in our territories.” 
Before the pandemic, Colombia was already one of the world’s most deadly countries to speak up for rights and challenge the powerful. Now the situation is even more dangerous. Since authorities ordered people to stay at home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, threatened defenders have been unable to move from one location to another in search of safety. Attackers know where to find their targets. As well, some protective measures previously offered by the National Protection Unit have been reduced.   
   
At least 14 human rights defenders have been killed during the COVID-19 quarantine. They include women’s rights and community activist Carlota Isabel Salinas Péres (above left) of the Organización Femenina Popular, a grassroots organization that Amnesty Canada activists have worked with for years, and Marco Rivadeneira (above right), a defender of Putumayo’s campesino farmer communities. 
On April 6, El Espectador reported that a judge had recognized the dangers faced by ten threatened human rights defenders pictured below – Isabel Zuleta is second from the left in the top row – as well as their communities, and ordered the government to ensure the protection of their lives.  It is vital that this order is implemented and that other defenders at risk are also protected from harm. 
 
Sign the online urgent action ‘Colombia: Protect Human Rights Defenders’ here. Then share and encourage others to sign the action too.  
Colombian authorities use Twitter and are mindful of their international reputation. Tweet a message of concern, tagging the Minister of the Interior and the National Protection Unit as in the sample message below.

Amazon employees fired for speaking out about conditions on warehouse floors....,"Workers’ concerns ignored at Canadian meat packing plants and hundreds made sick. Amazon employees fired for speaking out about conditions on warehouse floors. Energy workers expected to continue working despite outbreaks at mine sites and an inability to physically distance. Construction workers unable to wash their hands on the job because there is no running water. Mining considered an essential service that employs workers from across the country while small communities struggle to keep away visitors. These are some of the dire stories being shared across Canada as the pandemic reveals the impact of business decisions on workers and communities. While the situation varies from community to community, and some companies have taken steps to suspend operations in order to protect workers and communities, there is growing concern that not all companies are truly respecting human rights through this crisis. 
Amnesty International and 30 other international organisations are calling on governments, corporations and investors to ensure a human rights consistent response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The groups stress that decisions to operate ‘business as usual’ during the pandemic without fully safe-guarding human rights and ensuring accountability for corporate human rights abuses puts people’s health and well-being at further risk. The need for economic continuity and respect for human rights are not trade-offs, even in times of crisis. Amnesty International joins our international partners in calling on business to: 
All governments have a duty to protect against business-related human rights and environmental abuses and this obligation doesn’t vanish in times of crisis. Governments must make sure that their responses to the pandemic are aligned with their obligations under international law to respect, protect and uphold human rights. 
Yet Amnesty International has received alarming reports of attacks on human rights defenders in lock-down at home, environmental safeguards being relaxed, and companies pressing ahead with expansion or exploration plans despite the impossibility of complying with public consultation requirements. In Colombia, human rights defenders report a serious virus outbreak at a construction camp for a hydro-dam funded by Export Development Canada. 
In many countries around the world, tensions between Canadian mining operators, workers and community members already run high, and the COVID-19 pandemic is further exposing the cracks in Canada’s already tarnished “Canada Brand” of global extractives investment. 
Ongoing oil, gas, mining and construction operations – deemed essential services in many countries – expose workers who live and carry out their duties in cramped quarters to the virus.  The lack of health and safety equipment, like protective masks or hand-washing facilities, and the inability to carry out safe physical distancing while working puts these workers at risk, especially those with underlying health conditions. Further, lack of adequate health services at remote mine sites mean that workers who fall ill must rely on clinics or regional hospitals which may be poorly equipped to deal with very sick patients. In countries with severe lock-down restrictions, access to necessities is limited and people may not be able to buy the food and medicines they need for family members who fall ill.   
Communities at home and abroad where Canadian companies operate have had to deal with COVID-19 in different ways: in some communities, residents have blockaded mine sites to protest continuing operations and the ongoing use of fly-in, fly-out workers; in other communities, Indigenous leaders have called on companies to stop exacerbating community tensions caused by handing out donations of food; and yet in other regions, companies have kept local workers off the job-site, ostensibly to protect the health of local families, while allowing fly-in, fly-out workers to continue to travel into the area for their shifts. News of outbreaks associated with particular oil, gas and mining operations have residents living near those sites and in the workers’ home communities on edge. 
Oil, gas and mining companies claim that economic recovery will depend on aggressively restarting their operations and in some cases, allowing them to expand existing operations, increase capacity, and bypass compliance measures. Some are actively lobbying governments to suspend or limit the application of environmental regulations and this could result in violations of economic, social, cultural and environmental rights.  
While legislation in countries where Canadian mining, oil and gas companies operate is often minimal at best or poorly enforced, some companies are seeking to further weaken those obligations in order to create more favourable conditions for their expansion ambitions. It is questionable whether governments will be able to enforce public consultations or consent-seeking requirements during lock-downs, nor physical distancing measures, and yet companies continue to seek exploration and expansion permits. Yet even where national human rights standards have been lifted, the international responsibilities of companies to respect human rights remains. It exists independently of States’ willingness to fulfill their own human rights obligations. 
Amnesty is concerned that the pandemic and measures to address it, such as curfews and restrictions on movement, pose a particular risk to human rights defenders, and in particular those who raise concerns about forestry, energy, mining or agricultural projects. These land, territory and environmental defenders face tremendous risks for the work they do and must often move locations frequently in order to protect their lives. However, under pandemic measures, they may not be able to travel as freely, exposing them to serious threats to their lives or other attacks. Since countries began locking down citizens in order to prevent the spread of the virus, defenders report threats, attacks and even killings are still occurring. 
Yet human rights defenders are key in finding and implementing responses to the pandemic and ensuring that measures are put in place to protect them. They also play a crucial role in identifying risks linked to businesses’ activities and products, which puts them into conflict with powerful corporate actors. Amnesty calls on businesses to refrain from interfering with the work of human rights defenders and from taking part in or condoning any activities that could put human rights defenders at further risk. Governments must take proactive steps to ensure human rights defenders are protected from threats and attacks at all times. During the pandemic, governments must acknowledge that sheltering in place makes defenders more vulnerable to harm and dedicate resources to addressing the increased risks they face both domestically and abroad. 
Governments and corporations must acknowledge that societies cannot thrive when people are exploited. As long as profit is valued over individual and collective rights and healthy ecosystems, human rights are at risk. Now is the time to rebuild our social structures to protect human rights and dignity, the self-determination of Indigenous peoples, hold companies accountable for human rights and environmental harms, and ensure that governments are free from corporate influence. COVID-19 cannot be used to allow companies to take advantage of the crisis to maximize profit at the expense of human rights.

“No person should ever wake up wondering if that day will be the day that a police officer ends their life, yet people of color, particularly black people, across the country live with that painful and traumatic reality. The actions of this Minneapolis police officer have terrorized people who have already lost so much. 
“We are incensed that nearly six years after Eric Garner uttered ‘I can’t breathe’ as he was killed by the New York Police Department, police officers still don’t seem to have learned to listen to a person’s call for help. This man’s life mattered. And so did the lives of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor and too many more. Police are supposed to protect life, and that principle has been ignored by police officers who have denied black people their humanity. The police must be held accountable for this use of deadly force, that may also violate the department’s own policy.” 
Amnesty International USA is glad to see the Federal Bureau of Investigation is already involved in this case and calls for a prompt, thorough, and transparent investigation, and for the family of the victim be kept up to date as the investigation ensues. Further, Amnesty International USA is urging Congress to work to pass the PEACE Act to limit the use of deadly force, which should only ever be used as a last resort.

“Today’s excessive and indiscriminate use of force by the police to disperse protesters once again exposes the authorities’ utter disregard for human rights on the streets of Hong Kong. Mass arrests in entirely peaceful assemblies show that the Hong Kong government is targeting anyone exercising their right to freedom of expression. 
“As rights in Hong Kong come under ever increasing threat, the national anthem bill is another attempt to make peaceful dissent a crime in the city. Under this vaguely worded and repressive law, people in Hong Kong could face up to three years in prison if they are deemed to have ‘insulted’ or ‘misused’ China’s national anthem. 
“Hongkongers are right to be alarmed by this bill and perfectly entitled to peacefully protest against it. At a time when Hong Kong’s freedoms face being severely undermined by a national security law forced on it by China, the national anthem bill is yet another grave threat to freedom of expression in the city. 
“And with protests against both these laws set to continue in the coming weeks and beyond, the heavy-handed police response so far is a worrying indication that Hong Kong is set to face another summer of repression.” 
Background 
Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Hong Kong today as lawmakers debated the national anthem bill, which would criminalize “insulting” or “misusing” the Chinese national anthem with a fine of up to HK$50,000 (US$6,400) and a maximum penalty of three years’ imprisonment. 
Since 2015, there have been several incidents of Hong Kong football fans booing or turning their backs when the Chinese national anthem is played at games. The new law would make such behaviour a criminal offence. 
Hundreds of people have been rounded up or detained so far on Wednesday, while social media footage showed police firing pepper pellets to disperse a protest in the Central district at lunchtime, despite the presence of numerous bystanders in the area. 
Protesters also denounced the national security law proposed by China’s National People’s Congress last week and set to be passed in Beijing tomorrow. The law cracks down on “separatism, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference” in Hong Kong.

There are no easy solutions to the COVID-19 crisis – but it’s clear what doesn’t work. This pandemic has elicited truly jaw-dropping responses from some governments, marked by opportunism, bizarre science and total contempt for human rights. 
Here’s a guide to how not to handle a pandemic – courtesy of some of the most powerful people in the world. 
In April, residents of an apartment block in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan returned from work to find that the front door of the building had been welded shut. It later emerged that a woman who lived in the building had been taken to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, but residents were given no information – some didn’t realize they were prisoners until the next morning. For the fourteen days that the building was sealed, they could not get anything from outside, except for packages which police officers checked. Eventually, the door was opened after a social media outcry. People have reportedly been locked in their homes in several other parts of Kazakhstan, as well as in neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. 
Authorities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, made physical distancing even more difficult when they demolished dozens of homes belonging to day labourers, rendering at least 1,000 people homeless amid the pandemic. Most of those whose homes were destroyed had recently lost their jobs due to shutdowns, and the demolitions made a bad situation worse. They are now sheltering under tarpaulins or plastic sheeting – forced to huddle together in heavy rain. 
Chinese medical professionals who tried to sound the alarm in the early days of the crisis were harshly punished. In late December, Dr Li Wenliang, who worked in Wuhan Central Hospital, sent a warning to fellow medics in a private chat. He was detained, accused of “spreading false rumours” and forced to sign a document saying he had disturbed public order. Tragically, Dr Li died of COVID-19 in February. 
Nicaragua’s President Daniel Ortega has made a point of ignoring warnings and guidance by international bodies about COVID-19, even encouraging people to attend religious celebrations and outdoor events. On 14 March, the government organized a march to show solidarity with people affected by the virus, calling it “Love in the Time of COVID-19”. 
Thousands of people took to the streets without taking any physical distancing measures. Ortega’s support for this type of mass gathering is especially surprising given that his government has been preventing and suppressing any form of social protest for the past two years – often with lethal force. 
At a press conference in April, US President Trump suggested that doctors should look into whether injecting disinfectant inside the body would kill the virus, and also proposed irradiating patients’ bodies with UV light. 
Belarusian President Lukashenko, who has introduced no physical distancing measures in the country, has said that trips to the sauna, working the fields, and drinking vodka would cure people of the virus. 
Brazil’s President Bolsanaro has dismissed the virus as “a bit of a cold” and joined in with protests against lockdown measures. 
On 27 March, the Kenyan government introduced a dusk-to-dawn curfew. According to Human Rights Watch, at least six people were killed by the police for breaking the curfew in the first ten days alone. 
In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had ordered police to shoot “dead” people protesting or questioning quarantine measu Open fire on panicked prisoners 
Poor conditions and overcrowding in Iranian prisons led people in detention to protest in April. Instead of trying to improve conditions, the authorities responded with deadly force. In several prisons, live ammunition and tear gas were used to suppress protests, killing around 35 prisoners and injuring hundreds of others, according to credible sources. In at least one prison, security forces beat those taking part in the protest action, possibly leading to the death of an inmate. 
Food and water supplies are running out in some refugee camps, and government responses are not helping. For example, on 20 April Bosnian authorities cut off water supplies to Vucjak camp in a bid to force inhabitants to move to a new site.  
Rukban refugee camp on the Jordan/Syria border is home to about 10,000 people, mostly displaced by the Syrian conflict. Conditions are appalling in the camp, where there is only one basic medical centre with no doctors and just a few nurses. In March, Jordan announced it would not allow relief aid to pass through its territory to deliver assistance and medical equipment to the camp, citing COVID-19 concerns. 
Governments around the world have censored and blocked crucial information about the virus. 
In Venezuela, journalist Darvinson Rojas spent 12 days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country – he was charged with ‘advocacy of hatred’.  
In Egypt, security forces arrested a journalist for questioning official statistics on his personal Facebook page. He was held at an undisclosed location with no contact with the outside world for nearly a month, before being brought in front of prosecutors to face accusations of “spreading false news” and “joining a terrorist organization”. 
And in Bangladesh, at least 20 journalists have been intimidated, assaulted or harassed by members of the ruling party, and in some cases arrested, for reporting pilferage, corruption and lack of accountability in relief distribution during lockdown.

A Guide for Europe: Protecting the rights of women and girls in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath provides governments with a roadmap for taking necessary measures to protect the rights of women and girls, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, especially those experiencing intersecting and persistent forms of discrimination. 
“During this health crisis and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, women’s and girls’ rights must be respected and guaranteed,” said Viviana Waisman, President & CEO of Women’s Link Worldwide. 
“These guidelines give us the framework to demand that European states comply with their obligations and maintain their commitment to the rights and lives of women and girls during this crisis and beyond.” 
Domestic and sexual violence 
Even before the COVID-19 crisis, one in five women suffered violence from their partner at home in Europe. Lockdowns and isolation measures to contain the spread of the virus have exposed women and girls to increased risks of domestic abuse at the hands of their partners or other family members, and often cut them off from the much-needed support. 
Some European countries have taken measures to support women and girls at risk of domestic violence, but the pandemic has exposed the existing shortcomings of the responses in place, which in turn are limiting the capacity to react to the overwhelming needs during the crisis. 
Data shows that reports of violence against women, and particularly domestic violence, have increased alarmingly in several countries. According to recent data by the World Health Organization, emergency calls have risen by up to 60 percent compared with last year in many European countries. In some countries, the authorities point to a decrease in domestic violence incident reports, which may indicate limited reporting options for women living under the same roof as their abuser. 
For those affected by gender-based violence, including sexual violence, high levels of impunity and barriers to access to justice, have been one of the greatest challenges in the region even in pre-COVID-19 times. It is crucial that while taking appropriate public health measures, states must also live up to their international obligations to ensure due diligence in the investigation and prosecution of all gender-based violence cases, both during lockdowns and after restrictions are lifted. 
Sexual and reproductive rights 
Whilst some countries have enacted specific measures to ensure safe and timely access to essential sexual and reproductive health services, products and information during the pandemic, many have not. Some countries appear to be using the restrictions as an opportunity to further undermine or restrict access to sexual and reproductive rights. 
Hospitals and clinics have reduced sexual and reproductive health services to a bare minimum, or closed them altogether due to staff shortages and reassignments, among other reasons. In many places, accessing normal clinical services has become extremely difficult. 
“European governments must not exacerbate the harm caused to women by the COVID-19 crisis by failing to guarantee access to essential sexual and reproductive healthcare,” said Caroline Hickson, Regional Director of IPPF European Network. 
“Restricting essential services is putting the lives, health and wellbeing of hundreds of thousands of women at risk. Countries that put care first have taken steps to protect the safety and freedom of women and girls. It can be done; there is no excuse to let women and girls down.” 
Post-COVID-19 
All this is happening against the backdrop of grim economic prospects for millions of women and girls in Europe, post-COVID-19.  The aftermath of the health crisis is expected to gravely impact women’s livelihoods, particularly those working in the care or informal sector and those who are already experiencing marginalisation. Women and girls’ needs and rights must be placed at the centre of the responses to COVID-19 and beyond. 
Women who face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, such as Roma, migrant or asylum-seeking women, sex workers, women with disabilities, trans women and others in situations of marginalisation, face an increased risk of being targeted by state agents and suffering harms including racial profiling. It is crucial that states ensure increased police powers do not affect these women disproportionately. 
“Europe will not be the same after COVID-19. The pandemic is an unprecedented crisis with grave human rights consequences for women and girls. Paradoxically, this dark time gives us an opportunity to do more to overcome discrimination and inequality,” said Marie Struthers, Europe Regional Director, Amnesty International. 
“We call on states to hear women’s voices and make the post-COVID-19 Europe a better place for all women and girls.” 
The three organisations are urging the European governments to do everything in their power to ensure that human rights of women and girls are upheld and that they are not left behind.

Shocking footage of Rohingya women, men and children being rescued off rickety boats after dangerous sea voyages is still being broadcast around the world. 
According to reports, more boats – carrying hundreds more Rohingya people – are still stranded at sea and in urgent need of rescue. These vessels have nowhere to land, as countries ignore international obligations to allow safe disembarkation, using COVID-19 restrictions as a pretext. 
These policies raise the risk of repeating the dangerous mistakes of 2015, when the break-up of trafficking networks left thousands of Rohingya stranded in Southeast Asian waters, with likely hundreds losing their lives. 
Here, Amnesty International explains why the Rohingya are still risking everything to flee crowded refugee camps in Bangladesh and apartheid conditions in Myanmar. 
We also explain how countries in the region can help, and why the Rohingya shouldn’t be sent back to Myanmar. 
Who are the Rohingya people? 
The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority in Myanmar. Until recently, more than a million of them lived mostly in Rakhine State, in the west of the country near the border with Bangladesh. 
Virtually all of them have had their citizenship revoked and have no reasonable claim to citizenship in any other country. Myanmar insists that there is no such group in the country, instead claiming that they are “illegal immigrants” from Bangladesh. Its refusal to recognize them as citizens renders the majority of them stateless.  
Their lack of citizenship has had a number of deeply negative impacts on their lives, and has allowed the authorities in Myanmar to severely restrict their freedom of movement, effectively segregating them from the rest of society. As a result, they struggle to access healthcare, schools and jobs. This systematic discrimination amounts to apartheid, a crime against humanity under international law. 
How have so many Rohingya ended up in Bangladesh as refugees? 
Since August 2017, more than 740,000 Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State after the military unleashed a brutal campaign of violence against them. 
During this campaign, launched in response to coordinated attacks on security posts by an armed group called the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on 25 August 2017, security forces killed thousands of Rohingya people, raped women and girls, hauled men and boys off to detention sites where they were tortured, and burned hundreds of homes and villages to the ground in what were clearly crimes against humanity. 
A UN fact-finding mission has concluded these crimes may also constitute genocide. In the years after the campaign, Rohingya have continued to flee across the border in smaller numbers escaping persecution and increased armed conflict in Rakhine state. In October 2018 a representative of the fact-finding mission said “it is an ongoing genocide” in Myanmar. 
While the crisis in Rakhine State since August 2017 is unprecedented in the scale of displacement, it’s not the first time the Rohingya have been subject to violent expulsion from their homes, villages and country at the hands of the Myanmar state. In the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee to Bangladesh after major military crackdowns which were accompanied by wide-ranging human rights violations. 
More recently, in 2016 – in what many saw as a prelude to the 2017 violence – almost 90,000 Rohingya were forced to flee to Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces responded to attacks on police posts by ARSA. The campaign of violence targeted the community as a whole. At the time, Amnesty International concluded that these actions may have amounted to crimes against humanity. 
Today, estimates place the number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh at nearly 1 million. 
Why are Rohingya still fleeing by boat? 
Living in apartheid conditions in Myanmar and constrained by lack of livelihood opportunities in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, the Rohingya have made attempts to reach Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and other countries. Lacking visas, travel documents and subject to strict restrictions on movement that make overland connections nearly impossible, boats are often the only option. 
While the Bangladeshi government has generously hosted refugees, it has not given the vast majority refugee status – leaving them without legal status on either side of the border. Bangladesh is not a state party to the 1951 UN Convention related to the Status of Refugees or its 1967 Protocol. 
In Bangladesh, Rohingya are squeezed into threadbare shelters, mostly made of flimsy tarpaulin and bamboo. During the upcoming monsoon season due in June, many homes could be badly damaged as in previous years. Cox’s Bazar, where most of the Rohingya refugees are located, is prone to both landslides and flash floods. A cyclone during this period would make the situation even worse. The camps are extremely congested, with a density of 40,000 people per square kilometre. The area where most of the Rohingya refugees have taken shelter is large enough to count as Bangladesh’s fourth largest city, with nearly a million people, including the local host community. 
Bangladesh authorities have imposed sweeping internet shutdowns on the refugee camps, leaving the community increasingly isolated and unable to access crucial information on how to protect themselves in the pandemic, even as COVID-19 threatens to kill many people in the cramped quarters of the camps after the first case was detected there this month. 
How can we help Rohingya people stranded at sea? 
South and Southeast Asian governments must immediately launch search and rescue operations for Rohingya stranded at sea, bringing food, medicine and allowing safe disembarkation. Authorities must not forcibly push boats back. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic should not be an excuse to block Rohingya from landing safely and seeking asylum. 
Authorities should ensure the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, has full and unimpeded access to those who arrive by boat. No Rohingya should have to go through any more distress than what they have already been through, with the exception of their time required in quarantine and medical treatment that are administered by the humanitarian agencies. 
The Governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar must also uphold their commitment that Rohingya refugees will only return safely, voluntarily and with dignity. Both governments must ensure that refugees in Bangladesh are able to make free and informed choices about returning to Myanmar, based on access to full and impartial information about conditions in Rakhine State and the support to remain in Bangladesh if they choose to do so. 
Both governments must also ensure that Rohingya are consulted and included in all decisions affecting their futures. At the moment, Rohingya refugees do not have a seat at the table, and decisions about their future are being made without their knowledge and therefore obviously without their consent. 
Earlier this month, Rohingya people rescued by Bangladesh authorities were taken to Bhashan Char, a remote island off the coast near where many of the Rohingya refugee camps are located. Authorities have said that they are being kept there in quarantine. There are many concerns about the facilities on Bhashan Char – including the island’s ability to sustain devastating cyclones, a regular threat in Bangladesh. More importantly, a technical assessment of the island by the United Nations remains pending to determine habitability there. It is imperative that Rohingya are not kept in the island against their will. 
Authorities should also allow the free flow of information in both the crowded camps in Bangladesh and in parts of Myanmar’s northern Rakhine and southern Chin States where the internet is currently blocked, so that Rohingya are fully aware of measures to respond to the pandemic and how to protect themselves and their family members. 
Aside from internet access, measures specifically aimed at protecting older refugees need to be taken, as many do not have access to smartphones. In addition, there is an urgent need for access to clean water, soap and help with social distancing measures for all refugees to fully ensure the right to health during the pandemic. 
The international community must also do much more to support Bangladesh and share the responsibility and financial burden of hosting almost a million refugees at a time when its economy is already under strain from the pandemic-related global slowdown. Finally, Rohingya refugees are entitled to continue to seek asylum and states must keep borders open to refugees who continue to flee now or will do so in the future. 
Is it safe for Rohingya people to return to Myanmar? 
Rohingya people are at risk of serious human rights violations in Myanmar. International law – in particular the principle of non-refoulement – forbids states from returning people to a place where their lives or freedoms would be at serious risk. 
Indeed, the UN has repeatedly stated that conditions in Myanmar are not conducive to returns. Conditions in Myanmar have deteriorated further after fighting between the Arakan Army – a separate armed group calling for more autonomy for ethnic Rakhine Buddhists – and the Myanmar military escalated in January 2019. 
The Rohingya have an inalienable human right to return to and reside in Myanmar – it is their home, and if they choose to, they must be allowed to return. But governments must not organize returns unless they are safe, voluntary, sustainable and dignified.  
As part of this, the entrenched system of discrimination and segregation that made the Rohingya flee in the first place has to be dismantled. Safe and dignified returns mean guaranteeing that once back, they can enjoy equal rights and citizenship and that widespread and systematic human rights violations – including crimes under international law – will stop. 
Safe and dignified returns also require those responsible for the horrific abuses against the Rohingya to be held to account. As it stands, almost all perpetrators remain at large and continue to evade justice, while maintaining positions of power that enable them to perpetrate more violations. The Rohingya cannot be left living in fear of a fresh wave of violence that will, if they survive, drive them across the border yet again. 
In January 2020, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordered Myanmar to take “provisional measures” to prevent genocidal acts against the Rohingya community after the Gambia filed a case accusing Myanmar of breaching its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The Myanmar authorities have done very little to comply with the order so far. 
However, the Court has no jurisdiction to try individuals accused of abuses against the Rohingya and against other minorities in Rakhine, Kachin and northern Shan states. Therefore, the UN Security Council must refer the situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court (ICC).

“China routinely abuses its own national security framework as a pretext to target human rights activists and stamp out all forms of dissent. This dangerous proposed law sends the clearest message yet that it is eager to do the same in Hong Kong, and as soon as possible. 
“The Hong Kong government has progressively embraced the mainland’s vague and all-encompassing definition of ‘national security’ to restrict freedom of association, expression and the right to peaceful assembly. This attempt to bulldoze through repressive security regulations poses a quasi-existential threat to the rule of law in Hong Kong and is an ominous moment for human rights in the city. 
“Past national security-related legislation in China has almost always involved a serious reduction of fair trial rights, in some cases essentially circumventing normal criminal procedures entirely. Being charged with a national security crime can mean incommunicado and secret detention, without access to lawyers or families. 
“Beijing claims this law is designed to bring ‘stability’ to Hong Kong, but the past year of protests have shown that repressive laws will not slow unrest, but fuel it. The people of Hong Kong must not have their rights and freedoms taken away in the name of exaggerated security concerns.” 
Background 
China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) is expected to endorse a decision regarding the “establishment and strengthening” of national security measures in Hong Kong during its annual plenary session, which started on Thursday. 
The decision would authorize the NPC Standing Committee to adopt legislation targeting “separatism, subversion of state power, terrorism and foreign interference”. It would also allow central government agencies responsible for national security to operate in Hong Kong. 
The decision calls upon the Hong Kong government to establish and strengthen national security mechanisms and institutions, including law enforcement. It would require Hong Kong’s Chief Executive to report periodically to the central government on the performance of the duties of “preserving national security and spreading national security education and lawfully prohibiting conduct endangering national security”. 
The proposed decision requires the Hong Kong government to quickly finish enacting national security legislation as required under Article 23 of its mini-constitution, the Basic Law. An attempt to enact Article 23 legislation in 2003 was shelved after half a million people took to the streets in protest. 
The legislation proposed by the decision would be listed under Annex III of the Basic Law after being promulgated by the NPC Standing Committee, meaning it could become law without scrutiny by Hong Kong’s Legislative Council – effectively bypassing local lawmakers. 
In 2015, China passed a national security law that gave the authorities sweeping powers to crack down on and suppress human rights, covering areas including politics, culture, finance and the internet. 
Amnesty International’s 2019 report, Beijing’s Red Line in Hong Kong, set out how the Chinese authorities have used their broad definition of “national security” to target journalists, activists and critics in the city.

I instantly wanted to get involved, I’ve always been motivated to help others and to do my part to make the world a better place but I didn’t know how to affect that change on my own. I started looking into Amnesty after that and signed up to receive their Urgent Actions and began participating in their campaigns online. 
It is when I got to university when I really got more involved. My school had an Amnesty International Club and it was the first extracurricular I ever signed up for and I would be heavily involved in it for the next four years. In my first year I joined the executive committee as the Events Coordinator, my first big task for Amnesty was to help plan our Genocide Awareness Month. The first campaign I really worked on for this group was for the Indigenous Peoples of Colombia who were at risk of genocide. I started a correspondence with the Colombian government in 2014 to put protective measures in place for Indigenous Rights Activist, Juan Pablo Gutiérrez who was being threatened for his work. Seeing how Amnesty’s letter writing campaigns, can have success really motivated me to continue this work and to be involved as possible. From then on I have been heavily involved with Amnesty’s participating the CNCA’s campaign ‘Open for Justice’. 
 
In my third year of university and as President for our Amnesty Chapter, I organized an event on Indigenous Land Defenders in Latin America with a letter writing action to our MP, Mark Gerretsen to petition him to table a Private Members Bill based on the Open for Justice Campaign. We had around twenty-thirty letters that we went sent to Mr. Gerretsen and he took notice of our work. He asked to meet with me to discuss the campaign and how he could help. Myself and another member of our group prepared a report for him on the Campaign, the model legislation, and what we hoped he’d do. After our meeting he agreed to table the Bill for us, which was an incredible feeling. I had another experience where I got to see Amnesty’s work have an impact and again it motivated me to do more. In the weeks following this meeting, we found out the government actually had plans to create a Bill to enact an Extractive Sector Ombudsperson. Which has since been created (although not with the exact powers we want, so we’re still working on this campaign!) 
After I left university, I wanted to make sure I could still be involved with Amnesty and I joined the Business and Human Rights + Indigenous Rights Team here in Toronto, after about a year with this team I became the Chair and I joined the National Organizers Program. Being in both teams have allowed me to connect with many like minded activists who motivate me everyday to continue fighting for human rights! I have gained more skills and learned more about the topics I am most passionate about. I am really proud of my BHR+IR Team, in the past year we have worked on many successful campaigns, one of our members created a letter to send out to MPs during our last federal election to ensure that the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples would be a priority and would get implemented after the election. This letter ended up becoming a national letter writing initiative for Amnesty International Canada. We are still working on this campaign and I hope that we see some positive progress with it soon. 
I feel so lucky to be a part of the National Organizers Program. I have been able to work alongside so many inspiring youth leaders in activism and it has made my work better. I am in awe of my peers in this program and all the wonderful initiatives and events they’ve put on in their communities. 
 
Being a part of Amnesty International has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, I am doing work that I can be proud of, and getting to meet incredible individuals that I am now lucky to call my friends. I am excited for my future with Amnesty and to see what comes next!

Gender-based violence rose by almost 30% in some parts of the world in the first weeks of lockdown. An estimated 47 million women around the world may not be able to access modern contraceptives as health care systems divert resources to treating COVID-19 patients. 
These are a few examples, highlighted in a new briefing released today, of how women, girls and gender-diverse people face unique challenges in the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A Feminist Action Agenda for Canada’s Global Response to COVID-19 – produced by Oxfam Canada, Amnesty International, the Nobel Women’s Initiative, Inter Pares, Action Canada for Sexual and Health Rights, and the Equality Fund – states that Canada is well-placed to take a leadership role in ensuring that women’s rights and gender justice are at the heart of the global COVID-19 response. 
“Not only does the pandemic have the potential to further widen the gap between rich and poor,” said Diana Sarosi, Oxfam Canada’s Director of Policy and Campaigns, “it could seriously undermine the progress that has been made over the past decades to advance gender justice. We cannot let that happen. Too much is at stake.” 
The Feminist Action Agenda makes several recommendations on how the government of Canada can employ a gender equality lens in its actions to combat the pandemic. They include: 
Further, the Feminist Action Agenda outlines five S-words as principles for Canada’s response to COVID-19: 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned COVID-19 is deepening existing inequalities and having “devastating social and economic consequences for women and girls.” Gender inequality holds back progress on governance, human rights, peace, economic performance, food security, health, well-being, environmental protection and social progress. The security and stability of our countries is linked to the status of women, transgender and non-binary people. This is why women’s rights and gender justice must be at the heart of the global response to COVID-19.

The provincial government has said that Northern Manitoba remains closed to non-essential travel to halt the spread of COVID-19. However, the province deemed construction of the Keeyask dam as an essential service. The four First Nations—Tataskweyak Cree Nation, Fox Lake Cree Nation, War Lake First Nation, and York Factory Cree Nation—have partnered with Manitoba Hydro to build and operate the dam but, despite legal obligations, Manitoba Hydro has not worked collaboratively to obtain consent to this most recent decision to expand operations and is ignoring requests by the four partner First Nations to limit work at the dam site because of public health concerns. 
Amnesty International is calling on Manitoba Hydro to respect the rights of First Nations in northern Manitoba by complying with their request to restrict access to the Keeyask project. In particular, they must respect the recommendation from the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, an organization representing First Nations in northern Manitoba, “that the Keeyask project enact the “Care and Maintenance Mode,” which would require 250 workers and reduce the transmission of COVID-19 into Northern Manitoba.” Amnesty International is firmly in solidarity with First Nations who are peacefully exercising their rights to self-determination and territorial defense. 
On May 15, Tataskweyak Cree Nation and Fox Lake Cree Nation, in traditional Cree territory, closed access roads to the Keeyask dam site to prevent the arrival of the new shift of workers and ensure the safety and wellbeing of community members. On Monday, May 18, Manitoba Hydro obtained an injunction against the First Nations, and community members and leaders upholding their responsibility to protect their territories and people according to their laws and protocols. 
“Every effort must be made to contain the spread of COVID-19,” said Ana Collins, Indigenous Rights Campaign Advisor with Amnesty International Canada. “Indigenous communities in northern Manitoba are rightfully occupying and defending lands to which they still hold inherent title. Yet federal and provincial governments continue to rely upon repudiated papal doctrines of discovery and terra nullius to claim (as in the Haida decision) “assumed Crown sovereignty.” 
“Therefore, arguments around the use of “crown lands” and justification for development projects in those lands are fallacies,” said Collins. “Without question, these communities have an inherent responsibility and right to control access into their territories to protect their communities from COVID-19 and prevent unsustainable pressure on healthcare systems in rural and remote areas. Governments should be applauding and actively supporting these efforts, not ignoring the concerns of First Nations and criminalizing community elders and leaders.” 
Last month, the Coalition for the Human Rights of Indigenous Peoples, of which Amnesty International is a member, issued a statement calling for the rights of Indigenous peoples to be protected during the pandemic. It stated that: “In light of the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, and the particular threat that it poses to vulnerable communities with inadequate access to health care, housing, water and other essential services, it is imperative that federal, provincial and territorial governments respect the right of Indigenous peoples to set conditions of entry into their territories. Indigenous communities must be able to restrict access of industry workers, tourists, cottagers, and others. Where Indigenous communities have required suspension of certain activities in their territories, this must be respected.” 
This is not the first time that Manitoba Hydro has violated the rights of First Nations. Decades of Manitoba Hydro operations in the north of the province are associated with harms to the land, water, and animals, as well as profound adverse impacts on the health, safety, and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. The impacts include a heightened risk that Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people will experience violence.

“Canada has an obligation to intervene in favour of its nationals abroad, particularly if there are reasonable grounds to believe that their non-derogable human rights have been violated,” said the experts. 
“Within this context, special care must be taken for children, particularly if their parents are dead,” the experts emphasized. 
“With the COVID-19 pandemic in play, and thus in a time of new vulnerabilities for children, the return of this orphaned child to Canada and reunion with her family/relatives is even more urgent.”  
After her parents – suspected of affiliation with ISIL – were reportedly killed in a 2019 airstrike, she was taken to Al-Hol camp, which houses an estimated 70,000 people, including more than 40,000 children. 
“Living conditions of children in Al-Hol camp are inhumane. Deprived of liberty, lacking of basic care, of sufficient food, of shelter from the elements, of safe water, of adequate sanitation, of medical care and of education, they are exposed to harassment, violence and exploitation,” the experts said. “All of these realities pose extreme harm to her.” 
“Children like her should be regarded primarily as victims and treated as such. Their best interest should be the primary concern in all actions affecting them. They should not be punished because of the presumed behaviour or affiliation of their parents,” they added. 
The human rights experts reminded the Canadian government that children enjoy special protection in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. “The child finds herself in a situation that fails to comply with the most basic standards of humanity. She is in a situation unfit for children and urgently in need of adequate care and protection,” said the experts. 
Canada has “primary responsibility” for ensuring that she is treated with humanity and respect of her dignity and human rights. The child has relatives in Canada who have already gone to extreme lengths to bring her back from Syria, the Canadian government should consolidate and deepen its efforts to enable her safe return. 
“Partnerships can be optimised and assistance obtained from other State partners and non-State actors which have direct control over territory, to extract individuals from camps, including Al-Hol. Canada’s practical challenges, including lack of consular representation on site, should not obstruct her return.” 
“Returning children is a humanitarian and human rights imperative,” the UN experts concluded. 
The Government of Canada has been in contact with the experts on the aforementioned issues.

Our volunteers have had to think outside the box to continue the essential work of human rights activism from their homes rather than in the usual community-based events and as excellently put by Nazila Nik, AI Canada Iran Country Coordinator, it is the nature of the work that must keep us inspired. She writes: 
It is difficult to keep focused and motivated for most of us during these unprecedented times. I cannot even imagine how harder it is for prisoners of conscience, unjustly behind bars at the first place, confined in a dirty place under the rules of authorities devoid of compassion and without any regard for human rights. Their families, worried to death, must feel even more hopeless than before. The least we still can do is to show them that they are not alone or forgotten. We can use the ways still available to us and online solidarity/advocacy events is one of them. 
So whether it is online Amnesty group meetings or larger solidarity engagement actions, activists across the country are showing that we are not letting up on human rights activism and rather instead, will continue to inspire those to get involved in solidarity and take action. Here are some more examples of what they’ve been up to: 
Letter Writing campaign for #RiosVivos communities in Colombia  
The AI Canada National Youth Organizers gathered online to write letters in support of the #RiosVivos communities in Colombia.  With 19 participants and 26 letters written, the group was able to put together some fantastic solidarity messages shared online. 
“The Indigenous communities of Rios Vivos fighting for their land and water matter, their voices matter and need to be heard and listened to. During this time of physical distancing, I think it’s more important than ever to show our solidarity with communities fighting to protect their human rights. Taking part in the online letter-writing event for Rios Vivos showed that no matter what is happening in the world our strength comes from bringing our voices together.”

First virtual Nowruz event 
Amnesty members and supporters gathered for our first virtual Nowruz event and wrote over 60 solidarity cards for human rights defenders in prison in Iran. They were joined by members from our sister AI USA section. 
“I took part in the first virtual Nowruz event organized by the AI Toronto Iran Team as it is solidarity actions that can help prisoners of conscience keep up their spirits. Physical and psychological abuse is employed by prison staff to strip them of dignity, intimidate them and make them terrified and broken. Solidarity messages sent by activists boost the morale of the prisoners of conscience, remind them that their cause matters and they are not forgotten. A former Iranian prisoner of conscience Kamiar Alaei on many occasions mentioned how he and his brother were cheered up by the Nowruz messages that they received while on a medical furlough at home.”

Earth Day challenge 
AI Canada Youth Organizers created a fun and easy to use engagement tool, for those over Instagram. Participants asked to not only provide their responses, but to also tag their friends to try the challenge next, who later passed it along to their networks, and so on and so forth. This was a great way to stay connected with one another, whilst also being part of a larger, important discussion in time for this year’s Earth Day. 
I participated in these actions because I realize that even though I don’t have a huge social media following, I do have a few hundred. If you multiply those few hundred by every participant then in no time at all we have the potential of reaching out to so, so many people. The world needs reassurance and the Earth Day or Mother’s Day Challenges I took part in were some of the ways to remind ourselves, and the people who are affected, that Amnesty still stands strong.

Mothers of the Disappeared in Mexico solidarity action  
Historically on May 10th, activists flood the streets in solidarity with mothers belonging to the Movement for our Disappeared in Mexico. Instead, this year, we flooded the internet! Many of our members took part on May 10th Instagram Solidarity Challenge and Virtual Rally in order to amplify the voices and calls for action. 
“Activism to me is showing up in solidarity using any means possible. I participated in Amnesty’s action for the disappeared in Mexico because mothers could not storm the streets for their children this year and we had a chance to make sure they were not deprived of a day of power and community. If online is the only place we can support and recognize each other’s fight for rights, then that is where we should be right now.”

There are weeks where decades happen. These are those weeks. 
COVID-19 has shaken the whole world. Established orthodoxies have disappeared overnight. Weeks ago, who would have thought that staying away from aging parents would convey kindness? That governments would release prisoners with the intention of keeping us safe? That the United States, once the world’s hegemon, would run out of face masks? That the Financial Times would call for wealth redistribution? That a new vaccine would be needed for us to safely leave home, attend school, work, and live freely? Our ways of living have changed overnight, and the rules of our societies and economies are being rewritten. 
As the weeks pass and new waves of infections loom, there is no easy route out of this. COVID-19 is the ultimate wicked problem—a term coined by California-based academics Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in 1973 to describe a problem which defies description and is apparently insurmountable. COVID-19 is complex and global, sparking almost unprecedented disruption. 
We are deeply aware of our vulnerability. We stay home, stay physically distanced from each other, and yet, thanks to the internet and social media, the global scale of events is omnipresent. This virus does not respect borders and has crippled global supply chains. Everyone is at its mercy. The myth of mastery of our individual fates gives way to the realization that we live in a world even more interconnected than we had ever imagined. 
The pandemic has laid bare that each of us is only as safe as the poorest among us. This has always been true in some way, but now we can see it clearly and unambiguously. While the wealthiest can always take steps to shield themselves, the spread of a deadly virus shows that extreme poverty and inequality is ultimately a threat to all. 
The spread of the pandemic has tested even the strongest public health systems in wealthy countries to their limits. The stress put on such systems has dominated headlines in the west, but this focus overlooks that gross inequality has left many developing countries massively under-resourced to address COVID-19 and protect the most vulnerable from its effects. And in such a crisis, the most ill-prepared and underfunded healthcare system globally is our weakest link: if COVID-19 persists anywhere, nobody is safe. 
With the unthinkable happening around us, we are thrust into a rare moment where we all have a direct stake in creating a more equitable world. The framework of national interest now seems grossly inadequate. Nothing less than a vision encompassing all of humanity will meet the challenge of this moment. 
Times of crisis often lead to transformational change—for better or for worse. Looking at how past policy choices have made COVID-19 a wicked problem can help us envision more equal, sustainable, and resilient societies. Solidarity forged now could catalyze systemic change for the better. 
COVID-19 necessitates urgent collective action. But like all wicked problems, the pandemic raises major dilemmas for governments. In most countries, testing is limited, giving us a partial understanding of COVID-19’s overall prevalence. Because it is a new virus, assumptions behind the scientific models continue to shift as new information emerges. A vaccine offers the only definitive solution. Testing, isolating, and tracing contacts require significant resources—and potentially uncomfortable encroachment on individual autonomy and privacy—while lockdowns can have major socio-economic consequences. Response options are limited by past policy and budget decisions. 
Response options are limited by past policy and budget decisions  
The pandemic raises big questions about our human rights too. Worldwide, governments have moved to protect the right to health by putting exceptional restrictions on a range of rights, including the right to movement, association, public assembly, work, and family life through quarantines, travel bans, and school and work closures. International law outlines state obligations, but balancing different rights to ensure restrictions are both necessary and proportionate will vary by context. Analyzing these trade-offs requires interdisciplinary approaches steeped in public health, ethics, human rights law, and economic policy. 
These policy responses make it imperative that citizens be vigilant to ensure that their governments do not use the crisis as an excuse and a means to consolidate power. Surveillance technology can help governments track COVID-19’s spread, and several countries have already or may soon develop new tools to this end—even going as far as asking tech companies to loosen privacy protections. Yet as this crisis deepens, considerations of individual privacy are becoming an afterthought. Although human rights standards require that technologies are used in a way that is time-bound and proportionate, they will surely remain with us long after their original purpose has passed, as political leaders rarely like to surrender newly acquired powers. We are at real risk of giving up even the illusion of privacy, a right already denied in many countries, such as China, where internet access is controlled by an authoritarian state. 
This pandemic places all of us at risk regardless of privilege. But though swept along by the same current, we are in very different boats. 
Singapore offers a cautionary tale. The city-state was initially praised for its successful control of the pandemic but saw a surge in cases among migrant workers from South Asia living in densely packed accommodations. Suddenly, the statistics did not look so good. 
The impact of inequality on poor people’s rights is now visible to those shielded by social segregation  
As with most public health issues, poor people are vastly more exposed to this virus than the wealthy. For example, regular hand washing can help prevent transmission, but in informal settlements many simply cannot afford this. In a city such as Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, only 50 percent of people have piped water. Those without it pay ten to twenty-five times more for water, up to a third of their income. Physical distancing can also reduce COVID-19’s spread and the strain on healthcare systems. But this is impossible in situations where large, most often poor, families live in crowded conditions. Staying home hits the poorest hardest, widening inequality. Informal workers, people on zero hours contracts (under which employers are not required to provide minimum hours), or those who are laid off, lose hours or cannot work because of public transport bans, lockdowns, or curfews are rarely compensated for lost income. 
Unless governments mitigate the economic impact on the most marginalized, there is a real likelihood of increasing social unrest among desperate people. People who feel they must fight for their families’ survival may take to the streets, which in turn creates new infection risks. 
COVID-19 epitomizes human insecurity. The impact of inequality on poor people’s rights is now visible to those shielded by social segregation. Countries with less poverty, a stronger welfare state, and more resources to mitigate the virus’s economic impact simply have far more options. Several wealthier countries, including the U.K., have launched huge economic stimulus programs to protect jobs and businesses—although millions of the most marginalized are still missing out. 
But national-level resilience will only go so far in meeting global challenges. We can only be resilient and stable in the face of our era’s wicked problems if we rebuild all our societies and economies in more equal and sustainable ways. 
Countries with a severe shortage of intensive care beds can barely manage any COVID-19 curve and must control the virus or risk mass deaths. Many African countries, drawing on their extensive experience managing infectious diseases, have taken proactive measures to prevent COVID-19’s spread. But if prevention fails, countries with fragile healthcare systems will suffer disproportionately. South Sudan, for example, has four ventilators for around 11 million people. In some developing countries, senior government officials have until now routinely traveled abroad for medical treatment, insulating them from dire public facilities. With borders and airports closed and healthcare systems overseas stretched to the limit, that is no longer possible. If the virus escalates, there will probably not be enough resources even for senior officials and their families. 
Inequality between countries impacts developing countries’ ability to deliver the right to health. As Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed wrote in the Financial Times, for many African countries, debt repayments are often greater than their annual health budgets. This is not the only factor. Many developing states suffer from a range of structural problems, including a large informal sector and limited tax base, prioritization of other spending, including defense, and theft of state resources, which impede their adequate investment in accessible and affordable healthcare. In this pandemic, healthcare in one country directly impacts health in another. 
Governments must awaken to the idea that health is wealth. They must invest more resources into public health and ensure equal access to medical care for people everywhere, underwriting stable, inclusive societies and robust economies. This requires addressing structural inequity between countries, so that developing countries can service their publics, not their debts. 
Faced with this pandemic, nothing less than a humanity-wide vision is sufficient. 
Though physically apart, we are more connected than ever before, our fates inextricably linked. “Social distancing” is being reimagined as “spacious solidarity,” a generous gesture to protect others. As the virus grows exponentially, mutual aid has snowballed too. People are supporting each other in different ways to ease loneliness. Though borne out of catastrophe, such solidarity inspires hope, showing what we can do when we come together. 
As the world seemingly spins out of control, people are reimagining societies and economies. Empathy and connections fostered during this crisis can be a catalyst for change. Indeed, change is already happening, from Spain announcing plans for a universal basic income scheme to Amsterdam embracing Doughnut Economics—a vision of holistic, citizen-led environmentally friendly city planning. Time will tell how successful these changes prove to be, but we must call on political leaders to bring people on the margins to the center of their responses. We must repudiate the hollowness of leaders floundering with empty gestures in the face of this wicked problem, and those who see our suffering as a chance to extend their personal power. 
Empty nationalist rhetoric offers nothing—no country can save itself in isolation  
To lift us from this crisis, solidarity must extend beyond borders. Empty nationalist rhetoric offers nothing—no country can save itself in isolation. We need to support the weakest healthcare systems in the world. We need to pool resources to maximize our chances of developing a vaccine, and to ensure that pharmaceutical companies pledge not to exploit the crisis through valuable patents, so it can be made available to all at no cost. 
Above all, this is a time to recognize that in a world of gross inequality, nobody is safe. The pandemic should be a wake-up call for us all. The illusion of security in splendid isolation is just that: an illusion. While there will be no return to yesterday’s “normality,” habits of the past will return to us like muscle memory after a time of convalescence. Now is the time to be specific and propositional about the changes we need to see. That means putting away self-interested short-termism and starting to think about the good of humanity as a whole. 
COVID-19 leaves us grieving. But out of that grief we can choose to make something different. The greatest gift we could give ourselves is to build a more equal world, future-proofed against the wicked problems of tomorrow.

0,Americas: States are failing to adequately protect rights of health workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/americas-states-are-failing-to-adequately-protect-rights-of-health-workers-on-the-frontlines-of-the-covid-19-pandemic/,"As government representatives meet at the World Health Organization’s annual assembly to make crucial decisions regarding the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amnesty International released a report today on the dire state of the rights of health workers in the Americas. The...","As government representatives meet at the World Health Organization’s annual assembly to make crucial decisions regarding the international response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amnesty International released a report today on the dire state of the rights of health workers in the Americas. The report urges countries in the region to prioritize and protect health workers’ rights during and beyond the pandemic and calls on the United States to take swift and decisive action to guarantee continued funding to the WHO. 
The cost of curing: Health workers’ rights in the Americas during COVID-19 and beyond documents how those on the frontlines of the pandemic are often working in unsafe conditions with insufficient protective equipment and risk reprisals from authorities or employers if they speak out, while some have even suffered death threats and physical attacks. The report also calls on governments to ensure safe working conditions for cleaners and other support staff who are at risk due to their work in healthcare facilities and nursing homes. 
“In these difficult times we owe a great debt of gratitude to the hospital and nursing home cleaners, doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, hospital janitors and epidemiologists for their tireless work to keep us safe. But saying thank you is not enough. Governments must take action to ensure their basic rights and safety are never put at such horrendous risk again,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The Americas is home to about half the people in the world who have tested positive for COVID-19, with more than 2 million confirmed cases. As Latin America suffers its deadliest weeks yet, it is vital that all countries come together to ensure health financing is not undermined at this crucial time. This pandemic has no borders and the United States must support a global solution by joining other countries in funding the World Health Organization to ensure its technical and expert capacity is deployed where most needed.” 
Out of 21 in-depth interviews conducted by Amnesty International with health workers in United States, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Dominican Republic, Colombia and Paraguay, only two told Amnesty International that they felt they had adequate or almost adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The rest raised concerns about the lack of adequate PPE. They also raised concerns regarding sick leave, rest breaks and inadequate mental health support at work. 
WHO guidelines on rationing PPE outline that cleaners and housekeepers should have more PPE than many other hospital staff members, including doctors and nurses who may not have direct contact with COVID-19 patients. Yet Amnesty International found that cleaners were often poorly paid with precarious social security benefits and some worked for companies who did not ensure they have adequate PPE. One doctor from Honduras told Amnesty International he saw cleaners in his hospital using their bare hands to clean areas that had been exposed to patients with COVID-19.   
A 70-year-old cleaner who earned just over $5USD a day working for a private company at a state hospital in Mexico City told Amnesty International that, when he asked if he could stop cleaning areas that house dozens of COVID-19 patients, since he did not have any PPE and was at particular risk because of his age, his employer agreed but docked his pay by 16%. 
Multiple health workers expressed their fear of reprisals for denouncing unsafe working conditions, and some of those that Amnesty International spoke with had been fired from their jobs for speaking up as whistle blowers or had faced disciplinary proceedings at work. Tainika Somerville, a certified nursing assistant at a nursing home owned by a private company in Chicago, was fired after she filmed a Facebook live stream denouncing lack of PPE at her workplace. Workers at nursing homes are at particular risk, with media in the United States and Canada reporting that they are epicentres of COVID-19-related deaths. 
Workers in Nicaragua are at particular risk because the government has repeatedly understated the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The Civilian Observatory on COVID-19 in Nicaragua told Amnesty International that health workers have not only been fired for using PPE at work, but at times have had their protection equipment violently stripped from them. Although Nicaragua’s vice president announced on 28 April that PPE could be used and social distancing would begin, the government of Daniel Ortega continues to downplay the pandemic, despite an increase in cases. The Pan American Health Organization has warned of inadequate health measures in Nicaragua, while the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has raised concerns regarding unfair dismissals of health workers who have spoken out in the country.   
Restrictions of freedom of expression have also impacted the right to health and people’s access to health-related information. In Venezuela, where authorities have jailed journalists for publishing information about the pandemic, official data at the time of writing reports only 541 people infected with COVID-19 and only 10 deaths, which seems to have been under reported. 
“It’s impossible to protect the health of over one billion people living in the Americas if governments insist on silencing the whistle-blowers, journalists and health workers who courageously raise their voices to denounce unsafe working conditions and rightly demand an adequate and accountable response to the pandemic,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Health workers have also suffered stigmatization, physical attacks, death threats and denial of use of public transport in countries such as Colombia and Mexico, and even public stoning in Bolivia. While some governments have responded to such attacks with prompt statements and awareness-raising actions to publicly support the role of health workers, other leaders have taken actions to undermine them. 
In mid-April, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, vetoed two decrees that would have strengthened the safety of health workers at work, just days after he accused human rights organizations of working “to make sure more people die.” The president’s statement disregarded the fact that the WHO specifically indicates that “violations or lack of attention to human rights can have serious health consequences.”

In the view of the civil society coalition, the government’s analysis is unsatisfactory and demonstrates a weak commitment to Canada’s obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).  They also expressed concern that the Final Report contains an insufficiently robust analysis with regards to the undermining of peace and security, international humanitarian and international human rights law, gender-based violence, the “substantial risk” test and diversion. 
As part of its commitments under the ATT, Canada is required to assess weapons exports in order to determine if there is a risk that they could be used to commit or facilitate serious violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) or international human rights law, and is prohibited from exporting where there is a “substantial risk” that such exports would undermine peace and security. 
In the report, the government clarifies its operating definition of what constitutes a “substantial risk”. Unfortunately, the government analysis seeks evidence of repetitive misuse of exported weapons, rather than evidence of risk of misuse. “This approach, which waits for violations to take place before they are considered as part of the risk analysis, undermines the ATT’s purpose of reducing human suffering through prevention,” said Cesar Jaramillo, executive director of Project Ploughshares. 
Despite a substantial record affirming that Saudi Arabia has committed serious violations of IHL in Yemen, and its abysmal human rights record domestically, GAC has concluded that the types of weapons that Canada exports are not cause for concern. Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada, said “it seems that the Government of Canada will not be satisfied that a substantial risk exists until there is proof that Canadian-made Light Armoured Vehicles or sniper rifles are directly and repeatedly used in the commission of international human rights or international humanitarian law violations. Canada is taking a narrow, cynical approach that is inconsistent with the ATT’s purpose.” 
Another troubling affirmation of the Final Report is that it “found no credible evidence linking Canadian-made military goods or technology to gender-based violence by KSA personnel in relation to the conflict in Yemen and no evidence of repeated use of such equipment for such acts”. Anne Duhamel, Director of Policy and Campaigns at Oxfam Quebec comments: “It is troubling to note that the government ignored documented evidence of armoured vehicles used to attack a maternity hospital in Hodeidah in a conflict where rape and other GBV are rife. Yet GAC made no apparent effort in the Report to determine the risk of Saudi forces engaging in similar acts.” 
She added, “if Canada wants to be consistent with its forthcoming Feminist Foreign Aid Policy and its Feminist Foreign Policy, it must ensure that GBV is systematically and thoroughly considered in its arms export assessments.” 
The report states that “overall, Canadian exports of military goods and technology to [Kingdom of Saudi Arabia] contribute to regional peace and security”. Rideau Institute President Peggy Mason commented: “This astounding conclusion stands in direct contradiction to the findings of the August – September 2019 UN Eminent Expert Report on Yemen that ‘the continued supply of weapons to parties involved in Yemen perpetuates the conflict and the suffering of the population.’ The observation of the UN Expert Group is a statement of the blindingly obvious to anyone even cursorily following the horrific Yemeni conflict. It also makes absolutely clear that all military exports to all parties to the conflict are the problem, not some exports to some parties.” Mason added “The government of Canada cannot have it both ways – signing up countries in support of the UN Secretary-General’s call for a global ceasefire during the pandemic, while at the same time impeding that goal by continuing to arm one side of the deadly Yemeni conflict.”

It takes a team effort and collaboration between different experts to collate, corroborate and confirm evidence of war crimes. This blogpost takes us through the steps that allow us to integrate different forms of evidence into the research and use new methodologies for the first time. 
The report documents 18 cases of attacks on schools and medical facilities. Documenting each of these requires a variety of research techniques.  Here, we focus on one attack: on al-Shami hospital in Ariha, a town in central Idlib, between 10.30pm and 11pm on 29 January 2020. The hospital is on a “deconfliction” list the UN previously shared with Russian, Turkish and US-led Coalition forces in Syria to highlight which sites must not be attacked. By bringing together different research methodologies we were able to conclude that Russian government forces launched a series of three air strikes targeting the hospital and striking residential buildings in the immediate vicinity. 
Never omit the interviews, but corroboration is key 
The research is based primarily on interviews that Amnesty researchers conducted with witnesses. In the case of al-Shami hospital, we were able to speak to three people who were at the hospital at the time of the strikes, including a doctor who told us that, during the attack: “I felt so helpless. My friend and colleague dying, children and women screaming outside … We were all paralysed.” He told us that it took the civil defence two days to remove the bodies from underneath the rubble of one of the flattened buildings in Ariha. 
The role of the Evidence Lab here is to corroborate such interviews. This means checking that the open source information and any other data that we can find matches up to the interviews, to check whether there are discrepancies between the information on the ground, videos posted to the internet, satellite imagery of the site of the attack, and other separate on-the-ground witnesses. In this case, corroborating the last of these deployed a new methodology for us: combing a collection of flight-spotter observations in Syria.  
Using the Digital Verification Corps to source and verify videos 
As a first step, we engaged the Digital Verification Corps, Amnesty‘s global network of student volunteers whom we have trained in digital verification techniques. In this instance, we received help from a group of five experienced volunteers from one of our partner organizations – the Human Rights Center at University of California, Berkeley. The team at Berkeley took a list of schools and hospitals that our interviews told us had been attacked and when, and conducted online inquiries to discover content that appeared relevant to this attack. They sourced videos and photographs posted online – in particular on Facebook and Twitter.  
One challenge with the air strikes on al-Shami hospital was that they happened at night. Because it was not possible to use chronolocation techniques such as shadow analysis, it was important to use reverse image searches to ensure that content found online by the DVC was not from a previous event, and to confirm when it was uploaded to the internet in local time. A range of content showed the immediate aftermath of the strike, rescue efforts the following morning, and, finally, the clean-up. One of the first videos found, relating to the immediate aftermath of the air strike, was uploaded to the internet at 00:10 local time on 30 January, corresponding to soon after the eyewitness testimony of when the event happened. A check showed that this video had not appeared online before this date.  
 
Content collated by the DVC on the al-Shami strike during analysis and verification 
When the team had collated the videos that appeared to be of the strike in question, the next job was to verify their location. This required matching elements of the videos to the geographical features of satellite imagery – one of the most important parts of verification. To use this evidence, we had to know the timeframe was right, as was the location the videos were filmed in.  
 
Geolocation of videos showing the aftermath of the 29 January 2020 strike on al-Shami hospital, Ariha 
Satellite imagery to confirm time and place  
With the hospital geolocated (using the DVC’s analysis of open-source video and photos), the next step was to turn to satellite imagery to verify if there was evidence of damage around al-Shami hospital. We sourced different types of satellite imagery. First, high-resolution satellite imagery was used to visually confirm and align ground photos of the damage in the area. Comparing images from 19 December 2019 and 3 February 2020 we could see the extent of the damage in the densely built area.   
 
The slider above shows before and after satellite imagery of the bombing of the al-Shami hospital area 
Second, we needed to confirm, as closely as possible, when the strike happened. Testimonies said the attack happened on 29 January 2020, which the verified videos confirmed. We were able to also use other sources to narrow down the timeframe in which the damage was visible in satellite imagery. Planet 3-metre satellite imagery was able to show change in the area between 27 January and 2 February 2020, increasing our confidence that we had the correct time and place of events.  
Flight spotters for final verification  
On this project we deployed a completely novel methodology. For the first time in our work on the Syrian conflict, we obtained a compilation of several thousand flight observations from individuals on the ground near Idlib. Only two government’s militaries are conducting air strikes around Idlib and Aleppo—the air forces of Syria and Russia—and after years of attacks, these flight spotters are experienced in distinguishing older aircraft – such as Syrian YAK-130s and Su-22s – from new Russian models, like Su-30s and Su-35s. When documenting an aircraft, they note its location, the exact time and date, the type of aircraft, and the general direction it is flying. With dates and strike locations at hand, not only were we able to identify the aircraft that conducted attacks for events in the report, but sometimes also track aircraft taking off from military airports, moving to the strike location, and then returning to base.  
In this case, the strike on al-Shami hospital occurred at night. This itself is a big clue as to who was responsible, as night attacks are almost exclusively conducted by the Russians in this theatre of war. Flying and dropping munitions using night vision goggles is a difficult task requiring sophisticated equipment and significant training, and only a handful of the world’s air forces can do it accurately. In this case, the spotters had documented multiple sightings of Russian, and only Russian, aircraft in the area of the strike, between 10:22pm and 11:10pm on 29 January 2020, corresponding to the time of the bombing.   
The key to all of this research is corroboration through collaboration. By bringing together different elements of research, Amnesty was able to build a body of evidence to show that, in the case of al-Shami Hospital, the Russian air force had violated international humanitarian law. The strike was part of a pattern of support for the Syrian forces’ crimes against humanity against the civilian population.   
On 10 July, UN Security Council Resolution 2504, which authorizes cross-border aid into north-west Syria, expires. The Syrian government and its allies are seeking to end this arrangement and replace it with aid channelled through Damascus. UN officials have already called Idlib a humanitarian “horror story.” The horror will only get worse unless the UN Security Council renews this cross-border aid mechanism.

On 15 May 2018, a number of prominent Saudi women’s human rights activists were arrested. They had been peacefully advocating for years for the right of women in the kingdom to drive, as well as broader reforms related to the repressive male guardianship system. 
In the days and weeks that followed, more of their fellow peaceful activists were detained as part of the Saudi authorities’ crackdown and smear campaign. 
“It is heartbreaking that two years have now passed with these brave women still behind bars, especially as during this time Saudi women have been enjoying some of the newfound rights they had fought so hard for,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“In prison, many suffered mental and physical anguish – including torture, sexual abuse and solitary confinement. Scores of others, though released, still face trial based on charges relating to their peaceful activism. 
“It is time the Saudi Arabian leadership stopped using the judiciary as a Damocles sword hanging above activists’ heads. Saudi Arabia’s ‘reform drive’ cannot be considered credible as long as these women and other peaceful activists are still being targeted for their work.” 
Amnesty International is calling on Saudi Arabia to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience and human rights defenders solely detained in connection with their peaceful exercise of their freedom of expression, association and assembly. 
Background 
Currently, 13 women’s rights activists remain on trial facing prosecution for their human rights activism. Of the 13, five remain in detention: Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani. 
While the eight other activists have been temporarily released, they all continue to face trial and many remain at risk of being sentenced to prison under anti-cybercrime legislation for their human rights work. 
Those eight are: Iman al-Nafjan, Aziza al-Yousef, Amal al-Harbi, Dr Ruqayyah al-Mharib, Shadan al-Anezi, Dr. Abir Namankni, Dr Hatoon al-Fassi, and an anonymous activist. 
At least 10 activists have endured a range of human rights violations while in prison, including torture, sexual abuse and other forms of ill-treatment. For the first three months of their detention, the women were held incommunicado with no access to family or lawyers. Several have also been subjected to lengthy spells in solitary confinement.

The organization said that lockdowns and movement restrictions have exacerbated dire living conditions, leaving millions of people at risk of starvation and illness. 
The organization is calling for concerted global action to ensure hundreds of thousands of people on the move are provided with adequate access to food, water, sanitation and healthcare to ensure their survival as countries prepare to come out of lockdown. 
“It is impossible to properly contain this virus when so many people worldwide are living in desperately overcrowded, unsanitary camps and detention centres. At a time when we need compassion and cooperation more than ever some governments have instead doubled down on discrimination and abuse – preventing deliveries of food and water, locking people up, or sending them back to war and persecution,” said Iain Byrne, Head of Amnesty International’s Refugee and Migrant Rights team. 
“In many camps death by starvation is now reported to be a bigger threat than the virus itself. This is an appalling abdication of the collective responsibility to protect refugees and migrants, and we are urging states to take immediate action to prevent this becoming a human rights catastrophe.” 
Many governments have taken actions driven by discrimination and xenophobia, which needlessly place refugees at risk of starvation and disease. 
For example,  water supplies were deliberately cut off by local authorities in Bosnia’s Vucjuk camp to force the relocation of the camp’s inhabitants.  Many refugees live in precarious economic situations, and lockdowns and curfews are making it harder than ever to earn a living. In Jordan’s Zaatari camp, lockdowns prevent people from working at all—meaning no food or income to pay for even basic necessities. In April, residents of makeshift camps in France’s Calais settlements were not receiving adequate deliveries of food and water due to lockdowns, and restrictions on movement made it impossible for them to shop for themselves, even if they had money to do so. 
Many governments have continued to unnecessarily detain people seeking asylum, putting them at risk of contracting the virus. There aren’t enough tests and protective equipment for staff and people being detained, potentially igniting a powder keg of illness and fatalities. People held in immigration detention in Australia have been begging to be released because they are frightened that staff who have not been issued with PPE will unknowingly bring the virus in. 
Other governments have violated international law by forcing people back to danger under the pretext of containing COVID-19. 
Fuelled by an existing anti-migrant and opportunistic agenda, the US turned back 10,000 people within two hours of their arrival on US soil between 20 March and 8 April. Similarly, Malaysia turned back a boat of Rohingya people seeking safety; although Bangladesh eventually allowed the boat to land, at least 30 people had reportedly died when their vessel drifted at sea for two months. Presently, there are reports that several hundred people urgently need search and rescue assistance. 
Forcing people back to countries where they are reasonably expected to face persecution, torture or other cruel or degrading treatment amounts to refoulement which is illegal under international law. There are no circumstances where the principle of non-refoulement does not apply. 
Amnesty International is calling on governments to: 
Uphold the right to seek asylum and the principle of non-refoulement. 
“Governments keep saying we are all in this together. This means nothing unless they step up to protect the millions of people worldwide who are experiencing this pandemic far from their homes and loved ones,” said Iain Byrne. 
“Any government which allows refugees to die of starvation or thirst during lockdowns has failed dismally at tackling this crisis.”

Not all women, girls, and gender diverse people are experiencing the pandemic in the same way. Women with disabilities, refugee and migrant women, Indigenous and minority women, LBTI women, women experiencing discrimination based on work and women living in poverty face heightened risks of discrimination, violence, and other rights violations. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights! 
Read on to learn more! 
 
We are being told to stay home, but home is not a safe place for everyone. With rising unemployment and pandemic-related anxiety, rates of gender-based violence are on the rise in Canada and around the world. At least nine women and girls were murdered this April in Canada. In early April, Vancouver’s Battered Women’s Support Services reported a 300% increase in calls over a three-week period. In other communities, calls to women’s shelters have decreased, with shelters worried that women are unable to safely contact them. Similar patterns have been reported around the world. 
Everyone has the right to live free from violence. Gender-based violence survivors must have access to police protection and justice, as well as to shelters, helplines, and other vital services and support. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights! 
 
The pandemic is stretching healthcare systems around the world to their breaking point, making it harder to access abortion and contraception. Some countries, including Nepal and South Africa, have reduced or suspended access to these essential services. Even where services remain open, travel restrictions, social distancing measures, job losses, and shortages of medicines are creating new barriers to access. 
Sexual and reproductive health information and services, including safe abortion, post-abortion care, prenatal care, contraception, and menstrual products must be available to all. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights! 
 
Many sex workers have stopped direct-contact sex work to comply with social distancing guidelines. Others are out of work with the closure of strip clubs and massage parlours. Some of the most marginalized sex workers are not able to stop working and face an increased risk of surveillance. Most sex workers abruptly lost all their income, but because of the precarious and criminalized nature of their work, sex workers do not qualify for emergency income supports. 
Responses to the pandemic must not discriminate. States must guarantee equal access to income supports for women, girls and gender diverse people in the informal economy. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights! 
Some states are using the pandemic as an excuse to shrink the space for civil society to safely advocate for human rights. Poland, which already restricts abortion, has introduced legislation to further restrict abortion access, while people are unable to engage in mass protests against the proposed legislation due to social distancing policies. Carlota Isabel Salinas Péres of the Organización Femenina Popular, a grassroots organization in Colombia, was murdered while complying with stay-at-home orders; her attackers therefore knew where to find her. And in Iran, there are cases of COVID-19 in prisons, raising fears that jailed women human rights defenders are at particular risk of contracting the virus because they are unable to take the same social distancing and hygiene measures as those outside of prison to protect themselves. 
Prisoners of conscience, including jailed women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia and Iran, should not be in prison in the first place, and should be immediately and unconditionally released. The rights of women human rights defenders, including protection and access to justice, must be protected, respected, and upheld. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights! 
This is nowhere near an exhaustive list of the many rights being violated during the pandemic. But it is a list of a few of the women’s rights issues that are top of mind for Amnesty International right now. Human rights—and notably, the rights of women, girls, and gender diverse people—must be at the centre of all government responses to the pandemic. A pandemic is not an excuse to violate women’s rights!

Prime Minister of Canada 
80 Wellington Street 
Ottawa, Ontario 
K1A 0A2 
  
13 May 2020 
Dear Prime Minister Trudeau, 
Re: Demonstrating Global Leadership on Refugees and Migrants in light of COVID-19 
We write this Open Letter to you, amidst the unprecedented challenges governments everywhere face in responding to the COVID-19 crisis, to express our firm conviction that Canada can, and must, provide much needed global leadership when it comes to providing meaningful human rights protection for migrants and refugees around the world. We write as Canadians, permanent residents and refugees living in Canada who have had opportunities to serve in roles or positions internationally in which we have engaged substantially in concerns about refugee protection globally. We have witnessed and appreciated the value of Canadian leadership in the past and stress how urgently needed it is at this time. 
As you are aware, countries around the world are closing their borders to contain the spread of COVID-19: according to recent information from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 167 countries have fully or partially closed their borders, with at least 57 of those making no exceptions for people seeking refugee protection. As such, the options for people fleeing persecution are perhaps more constrained than they have ever been since the creation of the post-war refugee protection system. Hundreds of Rohingya refugees have recently been allowed to enter Bangladesh – but not before many lives were senselessly lost at sea, and many others remain stranded and abandoned. Almost 200 Syrian refugees were recently stranded at sea, trying to gain entry to Cyprus. 
Closer to home, the US has all but ended territorial refugee protection: acting under a purported Title 42 U.S.C. 265 authority, the US has already expelled thousands of migrants, either to the “country of last transit or home country.” Alarmingly, the policy contains no exemption for unaccompanied children. Moreover, the US will only refer intercepted migrants for refugee protection hearings where an affirmative, spontaneous and “reasonably believable” claim of torture is advanced. This falls well short of what is required by international law. 
These restrictive policies do not only imperil the right to seek refugee protection, they directly endanger the health of migrants and host communities alike. Physical distancing is impossible in densely populated camps or overfilled boats, handwashing is hard where basic amenities like soap and water are scarce or unavailable, and “shelter in place” orders presume a place in which to shelter. 
Your government has made meaningful, public statements about Canada’s commitment to upholding the rights of migrants and refugees during this crisis.  We recall the clear pronouncements that Minster Freeland has made about Canada’s international legal obligations concerning non-refoulement. We appreciate Minister Champagne and Minister Gould’s statement that Canada will “work to ensure that vulnerable and marginalized communities, including refugees, internally displaced people and migrants…are not victimized under the cover of public health.” Indeed, in the early days of the pandemic’s spread around the world, you took the meaningful step of appointing Bob Rae as Canada’s Special Envoy on Humanitarian and Refugee Issues. 
However, Prime Minister, we believe that Canada’s approach – especially with regard to refugees entering from the US – must be improved so that we may truly and consistently demonstrate the international leadership that is so urgently required.  In light of the many ways that refugee protection in the US falls far short of crucial international legal obligations, it is important for Canada to open its borders to those who are unable to find protection and have their rights upheld there. Your government’s decision of 21 April 2020 to ease some of the restrictions at ports of entry along the US border is a first step, but there are many claimants who remain excluded from the essential right to seek refugee protection in Canada. Moreover, the lack of transparency about the measures through which Canada is ensuring that the rights of claimants directed back to the US will be protected is cause for concern, and raises questions about how your government can be confident that Canada is meeting its non-refoulement obligations.  
Prime Minister, we urge that your government review the current policy and practice with a view to rendering Canada fully compliant with its international legal obligations and the specific guidance that the UNHCR has provided to states with respect to the COVID-19 context. Anything less will undermine the credibility of Canada’s exhortation that all governments should respect the rights of refugees in their COVID-19 responses and beyond, particularly as it relates to countries that face much greater challenges with far fewer resources.  
If your government were to lift the current restrictions, allow refugee claimants to cross into Canada to seek protection and implement the same measures which are applicable to other essential cross-border travel (namely, quarantine and testing as appropriate) you would set the example that is so urgently needed on the world stage. You would make it clear that there should be no choice between protecting refugees and protecting public health; the two can and must go hand in hand. 
It is difficult for us to imagine other travel which is as “essential” as leaving home in search of Canada’s protection.  That legal obligation and moral value should guide and determine Canadian policy at this critical time.

The Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China, a coalition of Canada-based civil society organizations with a specific focus on the place of human rights in Canada’s foreign policy with China, released the report today. The Coalition is calling on Canadian officials to urgently address these deeply worrying incidents, some of which have involved cyberbullying, death threats, racist insults, and aggressive counter-protests organized in response to pro-democracy demonstrations. Many of these cases are clearly linked, either directly or indirectly, to Chinese state actors. 
Further, the report highlights a new trend of such incidents taking place on university campuses and secondary schools across Canada. 
“This deeply worrying trend is clearly part of a longstanding and systematic campaign to silence public debate on serious human rights concerns in China which increasingly extends far beyond China’s borders,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English Branch. “Canadian officials – including the federal government, intelligence agencies and many law enforcement bodies – have been aware of these issues for many years but have failed to pursue effective action. It’s time for a coordinated government approach to protect the rights of those raising awareness in Canada of serious human rights issues in China.” 
In 2017, Amnesty International Canada, in coordination with other members of the Canadian Coalition on Human Rights in China, published an earlier report to draw attention to an organized and sustained campaign of intimidation and harassment aimed at activists working on China-related human rights issues in Canada. 
In this updated and expanded report, the Coalition is recommending that Canadian authorities: 
“So far, the responses from Canadian officials have been piecemeal, at best,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Directrice generale of Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “A number of individuals who have faced harassment and intimidation tell us they no longer bother reporting  incidents of this nature to Canadian authorities – either because they think it will not help, or they fear it will make it worse, particularly for loved ones in China, if the Chinese government were to find out. This puts an unacceptable chilling effect on free expression and other fundamental freedoms in Canada.”

In her official statement, ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensoudaa confirms that pursuant to Articling 53(1) of the Statute, there is a “reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation into the Situation in Palestine”. In rendering her conclusion, Prosecutor Bensouda outlines the following position: 
Given the unique and special circumstances surrounding this case, the Prosecutor deemed it necessary and appropriate to rely on Article 19(3) of the Statute. This means that the Prosecutor has requested a ruling on the scope of the territorial jurisdiction that the ICC may have on this issue. The main reason for deeming this referral necessary relies on the highly contested territorial disputes involved in this case. As such, the territorial ruling was requested from Pre-Trial Chamber I. 
Pre-Trial Chamber I is expected to make a decision on this matter in due course. 
Amnesty International Canada has called for the federal government to support the position taken by the Prosecutor with respect to the motion that has been brought regarding territorial scope, namely that she does have jurisdiction to pursue an investigation regarding the commission of war crimes in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza. More generally we have called on Canada to refrain from taking any position that would oppose the work of the ICC Prosecutor. 
An investigation by the ICC could change the minds of Israeli political and military leaders with regard to the occupation of the Palestinian territories and result in “a decisive and positive impact on breaking the conflict’s logjam where resolutions, peace conferences and diplomatic statements have failed” stated an open letter by Alex Neve, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada’s English branch, and Michael Lynk, the United Nations special rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967. 
In December 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a letter to Prime Minister Trudeau criticizing Bensouda’s decision. Netanyahu charged that the ICC lacked jurisdiction, and that an investigation by the ICC would only serve to delegitimize the state of Israel and to perpetuate the conflict. 
Amnesty International Canada urged Prime Minister Trudeau and Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne to support the motion filed by the ICC prosecutor. This would permit Prosecutor Bensouda to exercise territorial jurisdiction over war crimes allegedly committed by Israel in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. The alleged acts include shootings, firing of rockets, the building of illegal settlements, demolitions of homes and many other violations of human rights. 
Unfortunately the federal government has indicated its support for the position taken by the Israeli government. Canada has submitted a letter to the ICC reiterating its position on Palestine’s status. According to an article published by The Canadian Jewish News (CJN), Canada conveyed to the ICC by way of a letter that it does not recognize a Palestinian state and that the ICC has therefore no jurisdiction to hear this matter. 
Amnesty strongly opposes the federal government’s position. 
The advancement of the complaints respecting war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory to a full investigation stage at the ICC offers a crucial opportunity to break the cycle of impunity for war crimes and paves the way for the many thousands who have suffered as a result of these crimes to finally achieve long overdue access to truth, justice and reparations. The ICC is one of the only international forums where Israeli authorities may be held meaningfully accountable for grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. 
In December 2019, Canada voted in support of Palestinian self-determination at the UN General Assembly. This resolution recognizes both the strong international consensus on this issue as well as the importance of international law as the indispensable framework for a just and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians. By sending a letter to the ICC at the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Canada undermines the strong message that was sent with that vote. Furthermore, Canada effectively fails to uphold the integrity and independence of an ICC investigation. 
Canada is a party to the Rome Statute. As a party to the Statute and a globally recognized champion of the ICC since its establishment, Canada must respect the Court’s process and the independence of the Prosecutor, notwithstanding political pressure from allies. 
Canada was the first country to domestically implement the obligations under the Rome Statute, by enacting the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act. As a leader in human rights, Amnesty Canada urges the federal government to re-evaluate its position regarding Israel and the ICC. The ICC is an independent court of last resort with the jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute the most serious crimes under international law. Canada must keep political considerations to the side. 
Amnesty International urges Canada to reconsider its position. In doing so, Canada would reconfirm its regard for the importance of vital international legal standards, notably in the areas of international human rights, international humanitarian law and international criminal law.

0,Syria: UN must not cut vital aid lifeline to north-west amid Russian and Syrian war crimes,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/syria-un-must-not-cut-vital-aid-lifeline-to-north-west-amid-russian-and-syrian-war-crimes/,Detailed investigation into 18 air and ground attacks on schools and hospitals Russia and Syria deliberately hit hospitals on UN ‘do not target’ list Strong evidence of Russia’s direct involvement in unlawful air strikes The UN Security Council must not cut a vital aid lifeline for civilians...,"The UN Security Council must not cut a vital aid lifeline for civilians in the context of war crimes and crimes against humanity in north-west Syria, Amnesty International urged today, as a resolution allowing humanitarian assistance to reach Idlib across Syria’s borders is set to expire in the coming weeks. 
A new Amnesty International report, ‘Nowhere is safe for us’: Unlawful attacks and mass displacement in north-west Syria, details 18 cases – the majority in January and February 2020 – where Syrian and/or Russian government forces targeted medical facilities and schools in Idlib, western Aleppo and north-western Hama governorates. 
As a result, before the 5 March ceasefire almost 1 million people in Idlib – many of whom had been displaced repeatedly – were forced to flee again and languished in dire conditions in recent months. 
“Even by the standards of Syria’s calamitous nine-year crisis, the displacement and humanitarian emergency sparked by the latest onslaught on Idlib has been unprecedented. The UN Security Council must not cut the vital lifeline of cross-border humanitarian aid while thousands of lives hang in the balance,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Director. 
“The latest offensive continued an abhorrent pattern of widespread and systematic attacks aimed at terrorizing the civilian population. Meanwhile, Russia has continued to provide invaluable military support – including by directly carrying out unlawful air strikes – despite evidence that it is facilitating the Syrian military’s commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.” 
Extensive evidence corroborates witness accounts 
Amnesty International interviewed 74 people for the report, including internally displaced people, teachers, doctors and humanitarian workers. Witness accounts were corroborated by videos and photographs as well as expert analysis of satellite imagery, reports by flight spotters on the ground and intercepted Russian and Syrian air force flight communications. 
These audio recordings of transmissions from the cockpits of warplanes provide strong evidence of the Russian military’s involvement in at least one unlawful attack that put a hospital out of service. 
Attacks on hospitals 
According to the Idlib Health Directorate, Syrian or Russian attacks damaged or destroyed 10 medical facilities in Idlib and Aleppo between December 2019 and February 2020, killing nine medical and other staff. Dozens of other medical facilities had to close altogether. 
Amnesty International documented attacks resulting in the closure of five hospitals in areas under armed opposition group control. 
A doctor who survived one of these attacks – three Russian air strikes that hit the vicinity of al-Shami hospital in Ariha on 29 January 2020 – told Amnesty International that the strikes flattened at least two residential buildings around the hospital, killing 11 civilians including one of his colleagues, and injuring more than 30 others. 
“I felt so helpless. My friend and colleague dying, children and women screaming outside,” he said, adding that “it took the civil defence two days to remove the bodies” from the rubble. 
Based on corroborating witness statements and other credible information, particularly observations by flight spotters, Amnesty International concluded this unlawful attack was carried out by Russian forces. 
Attacks on schools 
According to the Hurras Network (Syrian Child Protection Network), a Syrian NGO, 28 schools were hit by air and ground attacks in January and February 2020. Ten schools were targeted on a single day alone – 25 February – killing nine civilians. 
Amnesty International investigated attacks on six schools in this period, which included the Syrian forces’ use of air-dropped barrel bombs and ground-fired cluster munitions against two schools on 28 January and 25 February, respectively. 
A teacher told Amnesty International: 
“A [cluster munition] bomblet exploded close to my feet, blowing the flesh off… The pain was unbearable. I felt heat as if my feet were burning. Two students were walking in front of me. One died instantly and the other one, miraculously, survived. I am sure it was a cluster munition because I heard several explosions. I know the sound of a cluster munition attack very well. You hear a series of small explosions. As if the sky were raining shrapnel instead of water.” 
Amnesty International identified the remnant as a surface-fired, 220mm 9M27K cargo rocket, manufactured in Russia and transferred to the Syrian army. It contains 9N210 or 9N235 cluster munitions, which are prohibited under international law. 
Civilians targeted deliberately 
The incidents documented in the report exemplify how Syrian and Russian forces continue to deliberately target civilians and civilian objects. These are serious violations of international humanitarian law, which requires warring parties to distinguish between military targets and fighters, and civilian objects and civilians, and to direct their attacks only at the former. They are also war crimes and those who order or commit such acts are criminally liable. In addition to the immunity from attack deriving from their status as civilian objects or civilians, hospitals and other medical facilities, health workers and children are also subject to special protections during armed conflict. 
Additionally, many of the medical facilities targeted were on a “deconfliction” list the UN previously shared with Russian, Turkish and US-led Coalition forces in Syria to highlight which sites must not be attacked. 
Staggering displacement and dire conditions  
The latest onslaught on Idlib forced close to a million people – more than 80% of them women and children – to flee towards areas close to the Turkish border between December 2019 and March 2020. 
A woman who has three children and whose family was displaced twice in the past eight months told Amnesty International: “My daughter, who’s in first grade, is always afraid… She asked me [after we were displaced]: ‘Why doesn’t God kill us?… Nowhere is safe for us.’” 
Cornered in an ever-shrinking space, these civilians continue to suffer intolerable living conditions amid a massively overstretched humanitarian response. Timely and sustained aid is needed more than ever. 
Vital aid lifeline under threat  
In July 2014, the UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution authorizing cross-border aid into north-west Syria and other parts of the country held by armed opposition groups, without requiring the consent of the Syrian government. The resolution has been repeatedly extended since then – although with extreme difficulty in recent years and a reduction of scope in January 2020. It is due to expire on 10 July. 
Syria and its allies are seeking to end this arrangement and channel aid through Damascus instead, which would make it very difficult for the UN and its humanitarian partners to deliver timely and sustained aid. The government has regularly sought to restrict aid operations through bureaucratic requirements. It has also “blacklisted” and persecuted aid workers associated with opposition-held areas. Armed groups like Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham have also hampered humanitarian organizations from doing their jobs effectively.   
“UN officials have already called Idlib a humanitarian ‘horror story’ – this will only worsen unless the Security Council sees beyond political ploys and sustains the precious lifeline of cross-border humanitarian aid,” said Heba Morayef.

Disappearances in Mexico continue to increase to record numbers. According to the latest figures, more than 61,600 people have been reported missing. Behind that staggering statistic are human beings robbed of all that matters, and family after family tortured by not knowing what happened, where their loved ones were taken and if they are still alive, in need of rescue. 
It is thanks to the tireless, caring efforts of families of the disappeared in Mexico – who came together to support each other, formed networks, and then a national movement – that there have been some signs of hope. Legislation, a National Search System and specialized investigators, amongst other advances – none would have been possible without the dedication and bravery of the families, especially the mothers.  
Every year on May 10, Mother’s Day in Mexico, thousands of mothers march all over to country to make visible the faces of their disappeared loved ones and to demand action to find them. The cries of the mothers fill the streets: “Vivos se los llevaron, vivos los queremos. Alive they were taken away, alive we want them back.” In Canada, we have organized marches and public events outside the Mexican Embassy to make visible our concern and echo the rightful demands of the mothers of the disappeared. 
This year, because of the extraordinary situation we are all living, marches and public events will not be possible in Mexico or in Canada. That is why we invite you join us online and help us create the biggest ever virtual demonstration. 
[Note: for those of you who do not use social media, please read on for a letter writing action that is also a powerful and important way to show your support!] 
 
Sign our updated e-action >>>  
If you signed a similar action last year, please do so again, because the demands are new ones and the target is too (as requested by the Movement for Our Disappeared in Mexico).  
This year, amidst stay-at-home orders, mothers belonging to the Movement for our Disappeared in Mexico have asked supporters inside and outside Mexico to flood social media with images and words of support for their cause. This virtual march aims to amplify the voices and calls of the mothers of the disappeared. 
Here’s how you can ‘march’ in solidarity with the mothers: 
Use the hashtags #CorazonesEnMarcha (Marching with our Hearts) and #CanadaMexicoSolidarity to enable us to gather your social media messages on our display page that we will share with the Movement of Mothers of the Disappeared. These hashtags, along with #VivosLesQueremos (We want them alive), also enable people in Mexico who may not speak English to understand your solidarity and to retweet your message for maximum impact. 
1. Create a personal message on a handwritten sign or on a mouth mask. Mouth masks are a powerful symbol because they are used by mothers and other relatives when they search places where they suspect bodies have been dumped. Those searches are led by the families in the absence of searches by the authorities. Please do not buy a medical mask for this action.  
2. Take a photo of yourself holding your sign or wearing your mask.  
3. Tweet your photo or post it on Instagram, along with your call from Canada for action. Be sure to tag the authorities in Mexico so that they see your message and use the hashtags #CorazonesEnMarcha and #CanadaMexicoSolidarity on both Twitter and Intsagram. Alternatively, you can pick one of the images here, here, here and here to tweet your concern, again using the hashtags #CorazonesEn Marcha and #CanadaMexicoSolidarity and tagging the authorities.  
The hashtags and handles are  found in the samples below:

“Authorities must drop the alarming investigation against Tashny Sukumaran immediately. Journalists who report on human rights abuses related to the pandemic should be able to carry out their work without fear of persecution. During a pandemic, authorities should have more important priorities than prosecuting reporters for articles they don’t like.” 
“The Malaysian government has repeatedly used laws including the Penal Code and the Communications and Multimedia Act to curb criticism of the government since the start of the pandemic. Amnesty International Malaysia has long criticised the use of these laws, which are open to arbitrary use by the authorities, to silence journalists, government critics, and human rights defenders. These provisions must go,” Bhardwaj said. 
“Amnesty International Malaysia reiterates that the mass arrest of migrant workers and refugees solely for migration-related reasons is completely unjustifiable, especially in a health emergency. The authorities must urgently release those detained and ensure the protection of their basic rights, including their right to health,” concluded Bhardwaj. 
Background 
On 1 May hundreds of Immigration Department officers and personnel carried out multiple raids on migrants within residences in Kuala Lumpur, currently under an Enhanced Movement Control Order in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. They were aided by members of the police, armed forces, Health Ministry and the Civil Defence Force (APM). 
Tashny Sukumaran reported on the raids, and is being investigated under Section 504 of the Penal code which defines the offence of intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, and Section 233 of the Communications and Multimedia Act which defines the offence of improper use of network facilities in order to harass another person. She has been summoned to Royal Malaysian Police Headquarters in Bukit Aman for questioning on Wednesday, 6 May.

Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK Director, said: 
“We’re extremely concerned that the Government may be planning to route private data through a central database, opening the door to pervasive state surveillance and privacy infringement, with potentially discriminatory effects. 
“Ministers should instead be examining decentralized, privacy-preserving models such as those many European governments are pursuing. 
“In these extraordinary times, contract tracing apps and other technology could potentially be useful tools in responding to COVID-19, but our privacy and rights must not become another casualty of the virus. 
“Contract tracing apps must always be voluntary and without incentives or penalties.” 
Public lack confidence in Government’s response 
Last week, Amnesty released data showing a lack of public confidence in how the Government is responding to the crisis. Amnesty’s poll revealed that more than three-quarters (78%) of the UK public felt the Government had not been fully transparent in its communications in respect of the crisis. Amnesty has been campaigning for the Government to ensure that the most vulnerable people in society are adequately protected during the coronavirus pandemic – a petition to the Government has now reached almost 25,000 signatures.

“As this devastating virus sweeps across the globe, prisons are at risk of becoming dangerous hotspots for COVID-19. It is more important than ever that states take urgent measures to protect all those who are behind bars, including by releasing all individuals who are held simply for peacefully exercising their rights,” said Sauro Scarpelli, Deputy Campaigns Director at Amnesty International. 
“Prisoners of conscience have not committed a crime, and yet they continue to be arbitrarily detained in conditions that are now becoming increasingly perilous. The overcrowding and lack of sanitation in many prisons around the world make it impossible for detainees to take preventive steps against the disease, such as physical distancing and regular hand washing. Their unjustified detention is putting them at heightened risk.” 
Amnesty International is actively campaigning for the release of some 150 individuals it has designated prisoners of conscience – individuals who are detained in various parts of the world solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. While Amnesty is working on 150 cases, there are likely thousands more.  
The emblematic cases Amnesty is campaigning for include Rubén González, a Venezuelan trade unionist who was arbitrarily arrested on 29 November 2018 after peacefully protesting and advocating for labour rights for workers at a state-owned mining company. He was accused of attacking a military officer and sentenced to five years and nine months. 
Rubén was tried, convicted and sentenced by a military court, denying his right to a fair trial. There was no reliable evidence against him and his detention and trial were clearly politically motivated. He is already in poor health suffering from renal failure and hypertension, which puts him at higher risk of COVID-19. 
Iranian human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh is also a prisoner of conscience. Arrested on 13 June 2018, she was sentenced to 38 years and six months in prison and 148 lashes after two grossly unfair trials. The charges against her relate to her opposition to forced veiling laws, including “inciting corruption and prostitution” and “openly committing a sinful act…by appearing in public without a hijab”; as well as her activism against the death penalty. 
Some of the legitimate activities that the authorities cited as “evidence” against her include: removing her headscarf during prison visits; giving media interviews about the violent arrest and detention of women protesting forced hijab; and belonging to human rights groups such the Campaign for Step by Step Abolition of the Death Penalty. 
Emir-Usein Kuku is a Crimean Tatar who investigated and denounced human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, taking place under the Russian Federation’s ongoing occupation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. 
He has been in prison, separated from his wife and children, since February 2016. On 12 November, a Russian military court found him and his five co-defendants (Muslim Aliev, Vadim Siruk, Enver Bekirov, Arsen Dzhepparov and Refat Alimov) guilty on trumped-up terror-related charges. After a protracted and unfair trial, they have been given prison sentences of between seven and 19 years. Amnesty International considers all six to be prisoners of conscience. 
“The unjustified detention of anyone in the midst of a global pandemic is cruel and gravely irresponsible,” said Sauro Scarpelli. “Human rights for all must be put at the core of the COVID-19 response and remain at the centre of our efforts to build a just and tolerant future, where all individuals can freely and peacefully express their opinions in the post COVID-19 world.” 
Background 
Amnesty International is campaigning on behalf of around 150 prisoners of conscience. The exact number varies from time to time due to release, death or the fact that some individual cases are representative of a larger group of people – as in the case of Emir-Usein Kuku above. 
In addition to freeing prisoners of conscience, Amnesty International is calling on governments to take steps to curb the spread of the pandemic, including by decongesting prisons. The authorities should also review cases of people in pre-trial detention as well as children, and consider the early, temporary or conditional release of people at particular risk, such as older people and those with underlying medical conditions. 
The organization is also urging governments to provide a standard of healthcare for people that remain in prison that meets each person’s individual needs, similar to what is available in the community, and that ensures the maximum possible protection against the spread of COVID-19. For more information see https://www.amnesty.org/en/get-involved/covid-19/ 
Since it was founded in 1961, Amnesty International has campaigned for thousands of prisoners of conscience – people who have been arbitrarily detained because of their conscientiously held beliefs or because of their identity.

The organization warned that censorship of vital information related to the pandemic has become a global phenomenon and urged governments to prioritise public health over their own egos. 
Ahead of World Press Freedom Day, Amnesty International is highlighting cases where authorities may have put the right to health at risk by cracking down on freedom of expression and access to information. 
“There is no hope of containing this virus if people can’t access accurate information. It is truly alarming to see how many governments are more interested in protecting their own reputations than in saving lives,” said Ashfaq Khalfan, Amnesty International’s Director of Law and Policy. 
“From the earliest days of this pandemic, when Chinese authorities censored media reports and punished whistle blowers, journalists around the world have been risking their lives, freedom and jobs to share potentially lifesaving information with the public.” 
Dangerous censorship 
A core feature of the right to health is the right to access timely and accurate information. In the case of COVID-19, this means everybody has a right to access all available information about the nature and spread of the virus, as well as the measures they can take to protect themselves. But governments around the world have arrested and detained journalists and other media workers for sharing exactly this kind of essential information. 
On 12 April, the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta published an article by journalist Elena Milashina, in which she criticized the Chechen authorities’ response to the pandemic. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said people who pass on the infection are “worse than terrorists” and “should be killed”, comments which Milashina warned had led people to conceal their symptoms out of fear. In response, Kadyrov posted an Instagram video in which he threatened Milashina, appealing to the Russian government and Federal Security Service (FSB) to “stop those non-humans who are writing and provoking our people.” 
In Niger, journalist Mamane Kaka Touda was arrested on 5 March after posting on social media about a suspected case of COVID-19 infection in Niamey Reference Hospital. He was charged with “disseminating data tending to disturb public order”. 
In Egypt, security forces arrested Atef Hasballah, the editor-in-chief of AlkararPress newspaper, on 18 March, and subjected him to enforced disappearance for nearly a month, following a post on his Facebook page in which he challenging the official statistics on COVID-19 cases. 
In Venezuela, journalist Darvinson Rojas spent 12 days in detention after reporting on the spread of the virus in the country and was pushed by authorities to reveal his sources. He was charged with ‘advocacy of hatred’ and ‘instigation to commit crimes’ and released on bail pending a criminal investigation. Serious shortages in basic health services and medicines have adversely affected people’s ability to access adequate health care in recent years in Venezuela, and even prior to COVID-19, no epidemiological data had been published by authorities since 2017. 
In Turkey, İsmet Çiğit and Güngör Aslan, senior staff at local news website SES Kocaeli, were detained on 18 March following the publication of an article about two COVID-related deaths in the local hospital. They were both released after being questioned about their sources (which were from the hospital) and felt pressured to stop their reporting on the issue. 
In India, journalists reporting on the COVID-19 situation have been summoned to police stations and forced to explain their stories, including Peerzada Ashiq, a senior journalist with The Hindu in Kashmir, and Siddharth Varadarajan, editor of The Wire in Uttar Pradesh. Many others have been arrested such as Zubair Ahmed, a freelance journalist in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andrew Sam Raja Pandian, the founder of the web portal SimpliCity in Tamil Nadu and Rahul Kulkarni, an ABP Majha reporter in Maharashtra, who was later released on bail. Meanwhile, internet restrictions in the Jammu & Kashmir region continue despite the rising number of COVID-19 cases.  
Journalists have been prosecuted for reporting on COVID-19 in many other countries including Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Serbia, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Uganda, Rwanda, Somalia, Tunisia and Palestine. 
Meanwhile journalists who report on human rights abuses related to the pandemic, such as police abuses or poor prison conditions, have been harassed, intimidated, attacked and prosecuted. 
For example, in Kenya police were filmed assaulting journalists who were trying to record police beating a crowd of people queuing to board a ferry before curfew. In Bangladesh, four journalists were assaulted by local politicians affiliated with the ruling party, in separate incidents between 31 March and 1 April, for exposing relief misappropriation on Facebook Live. 
‘Fake news’ 
In addition to targeting journalists and other media workers, many countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Russia, Uzbekistan, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tanzania and several Gulf states, have used the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to introduce new laws against disseminating “fake news”. In most cases, it is at the authorities’ discretion to define what constitutes false news or misinformation, and these laws act as a stark warning against free discussion of the situation. 
In Hungary for example, Viktor Orban’s government has amended the country’s Criminal Code, introducing new provisions that threaten journalists with prison sentences of up to five years for “spreading false information” or communicating facts in a way that impede ‘successful protection’ against the virus. Journalists have reported being harassed, threatened and smeared for scrutinizing the government’s response to the outbreak.  
In Bosnia, a doctor was criminally charged with “misinformation” and creating “fear and panic” and could be fined up to €1500, after she posted on social media about the lack of ventilators and other equipment in a local hospital. 
“In the midst of a global pandemic authorities should have more important priorities than trawling Facebook for posts they don’t like. They must ensure that information about COVID-19 and the measures that are being taken to respond to it can circulate freely. Individuals are entitled to comment on, scrutinize and criticize such measures without fear of reprisals,” said Ashfaq Khalfan. 
In Myanmar authorities have warned that anyone who spreads “fake news” about COVID-19 could be prosecuted, while a Ministry of Health official said they would file criminal charges against anyone who speaks out about the lack of Personal Protective Equipment at hospitals. 
Debate should be encouraged 
On 20 April, Tanzanian authorities suspended the licence of the Mwananchi online newspaper after it posted a photo of President John Pombe Magufuli out shopping surrounded by a crowd of people, eliciting debate about the need for implementing physical distancing. 
“The suspension of Mwananchi is a clear illustration of the dangers censorship could pose to public health. Debate about containment measures should be encouraged, not silenced,” said Ashfaq Khalfan. 
“We all have a right to know about crucial issues that can affect our health, like equipment shortages, as well as to access reliable statistics which may contradict the official government line.” 
International human rights law prohibits criminalizing false expression, and this is an ineffective way to protect public health. States should instead step up their efforts to ensure that they disseminate reliable, accessible, evidence-based and trustworthy information.

Doctors, nurses, nursing assistants, cleaners in hospitals and nursing homes, medical transportation and security staff, who are working to support those affected by COVID-19, are putting their health and safety at risk. These people, while providing a herculean effort, must not be considered “superhuman”. During this pandemic, it is crucial to respect their human rights. Every person working on the frontline in health services deserves the protection of their rights to health and safety at work, freedom from harassment and discrimination, and their rights to speak up without being silenced. 
Instead, Amnesty International has received multiple reports of harassment and disciplinary measures against workers who have spoken out about their poor working conditions, including insufficient care and protection equipment in the United States, Nicaragua, Honduras, Venezuela, Mexico, among other countries. Workers who have voiced concerns have been met with reduced wages, bullying and discrimination in the workplace or in some cases, termination of employment. These workers are defenders of the right to health in the face of this pandemic and must be ensured the freedom to express themselves, blow the whistle, and demand their rights without fear of reprisals. 
Amnesty International is also alarmed to receive reports of the harassment, stigmatization and attacks against health workers face throughout the region. Denial of transport, community-based shaming, physical attacks, and even death threats against health sector workers by individuals and communities, are completely unacceptable. Amnesty International calls on all governments to publicly condemn any attempts to silence, discriminate or attack health workers, and investigate any reports of threats or physical abuse as well as hold perpetrators to account where necessary. 
Health systems in the Americas face multiple challenges in the face of the pandemic. Latin America and the Caribbean is one of the regions with the least spending on health (public and private) per capita, according to United Nations figures. The region is also beset by entrenched inequalities. In many cases, public health systems were already at a critical point and did not provide adequate care for all those who need it, prompting international organizations to raise alarms for humanitarian concerns about access to health care in several countries of the region. These concerns are exacerbated now. Amnesty International has received multiple reports from countries across the region of doctors, nurses and auxiliary staff attending to COVID-19 patients with inadequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE), or worse still, denied protection or even disciplined for using it. States in the Americas should conduct an urgent assessment of their ability to ensure that all health workers have access to adequate PPE, and immediately request assistance from the international community for where they see gaps or are unable to guarantee necessary protections. 
It is important to remember that all countries of the Americas countries are signatories, and nearly all state parties, to the International Covenant on Economic and Social Rights, a binding international human rights treaty which enshrines the right to safety at work in its Article 7 and the right to health in its Article 12. In addition, all countries of the region are members of the International Labour Organization (ILO), and in this respect have subscribed to a key series of core principles and commitments, and a number have ratified key ILO conventions that require them to protect the rights of all persons, including health workers, at work. 
Finally, in commemorating International Workers´ Day, Amnesty International reminds countries of the Americas that health and auxiliary workers’ rights must be protected. Countries should ensure that all people working on the front line of the pandemic have access to their rights to and at work and the right to social security. Without protection of the rights of workers, frontline workers and people in the Americas will be left at greater risk in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Brave health workers have been working in difficult conditions, providing health services in the fight against COVID-19. They face the risks of being exposed to the COVID-19 virus, stigmatization, separation from their families, mental health and other concerns. 
“Across Nigeria, health workers are facing extremely difficult and unsafe conditions of work, such as shortages of personal protective equipment, dilapidated and overstretched health facilities, unfair remuneration and harassment by security forces,” said Osai Ojigho Director Amnesty International Nigeria 
“Health workers have been describing the difficulties they face and the danger they confront to secure the health and lives of people in Nigeria. What the government must guarantee, is their protection. It is unacceptable that they continue to be put at risk.” 
On 23 April 2020, it was reported that forty health workers tested positive for COVID-19 in Nigeria. 
Amnesty International interviewed some health workers who raised concerns that health workers across Nigeria are working without adequate protections and in very difficult conditions. 
“In the government hospital where I work, there is no running water for health workers to wash their hands. Doctors and nurses have to fetch water in a bowl, which is not sanitary,” a health worker told Amnesty International. 
According to another health worker: “Surgical masks are not adequately available in the hospital where I work. Authorities contracted tailors to sew unsafe masks with local fabrics. Doctors and nurses had to protest before they were given N95 masks. These masks are not adequately available. We have to wash the masks for repeated usage. Health workers are in danger. We work under deplorable conditions.” 
Health workers are increasingly facing harassment from securities agents, despite having been granted exemption from the lockdown order, being essential workers. In April, doctors at the Federal Medical Centre, Asaba, Delta State, embarked on a strike over the harassment of health workers by security agents. 
A doctor in the Federal Capital Territory told Amnesty International that some patients are being turned away from some hospitals because health workers do not have adequate personal protective equipment. “When a health worker is provided with adequate personal protective equipment, we will not be scared of attending to any patient, regardless of the symptoms they exhibit, and lives would be saved.” 
Nigerian authorities must ensure that health workers are protected at this critical time. 
Health workers must be provided with all necessary personal protective equipment (such as masks, gloves, gowns, hand sanitizer, soap, water), fair remuneration, appropriate working hours with healthy breaks, accurate and accessible information on COVID-19, training, and psycho-social support. Health workers must be given all the support they need to effectively do their jobs. 
“Authorities must adopt appropriate measures and policies to protect health workers and minimize their risks of contracting Covid-19. For those who have been infected with COVID-19 following exposure in the workplace, the government must ensure access to adequate treatment and, where relevant, effective remedies and compensation,” said Osai Ojigho. 
Background 
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Nigeria on 27 February 2020 according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). As at 30 April 2020 by 6:00pm, Nigeria recorded 1728 cases across 34 states, including the Federal Capital Territory. The cases include 51 deaths.

“Today we collectively call on president Bukele to lead a public health strategy to protect the population and their rights in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government must immediately reverse those measures that, far from serving health purposes, have only led to multiple reports of alleged human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and excessive use of force,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The authorities have detained thousands of people and taken them to holding centres that often lack measures to ensure a minimum level of sanitation and physical separation. With this strategy, the government only increases the risk of contagion instead of protecting people from the virus. Moreover, the detention of people who go out in search of water, food or medicine disproportionately affects those living in poverty. El Salvador needs comprehensive solutions that address inequality and the causes that drive many people to go out to meet their basic needs.” 
“President Bukele’s comments have once again sounded alarm bells among the international community. His public messages that call for non-compliance with the rulings of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, encourage security forces to implement violent measures, and discredit human rights organizations are unacceptable. The government is on a very dangerous path that violates the rule of law and human rights.”

0,Thirty-Eight Rights Groups Call on BC’s Chief Coroner to Direct Immediate Public Inquest into Death in Corrections Custody,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/thirty-eight-rights-groups-call-on-bcs-chief-coroner-to-direct-immediate-public-inquest-into-death-in-corrections-custody/,"VANCOUVER, Coast Salish Territories – Today, 38 human rights, health, prisoner rights, and legal organizations are calling on BC’s Chief Coroner and BC’s Solicitor General to direct an immediate inquest into the tragic death of a man in Correctional Service Canada’s custody at Mission...","VANCOUVER, Coast Salish Territories – Today, 38 human rights, health, prisoner rights, and legal organizations are calling on BC’s Chief Coroner and BC’s Solicitor General to direct an immediate inquest into the tragic death of a man in Correctional Service Canada’s custody at Mission Institution. His death on April 15th is the first reported COVID-related death of a federal prisoner. 
In their letter, the 38 provincial and national organizations state, “Amidst a global pandemic, we cannot continue to sit back and watch people die in prison from the ticking time bomb of COVID-19 spreading through these institutions.” The organizations recognize that an inquest is absolutely in the public interest and is a minimum first step to ensure that similar deaths can be prevented. 
Section 18(3) of the Coroners Act specifies that the Chief Coroner may direct an inquest if the Chief Coroner has reason to believe that the public has an interest in being informed of the circumstances surrounding the death, or the death resulted from a dangerous practice and similar deaths could be prevented. Section 19(1) of the Coroners Act also stipulates that the Solicitor General may order an inquest if it is necessary or desirable in the public interest. 
In their letter to BC’s Chief Coroner and BC’s Solicitor General, the organizations write, “we call on you to direct an inquest to investigate the degree to which this person’s death resulted from the very real danger of prisons having inadequate health and safety measures to deal with the threat of COVID-19. It is imperative that no similar deaths occur and immediate steps are taken to prevent future deaths; incarcerated people should not be getting death sentences.” 
Mission Institution is the site of the largest COVID-19 outbreak at a federal institution in the country and the second largest outbreak in the province. A staggering total of 106 incarcerated men in Mission Institution have now tested positive for the virus. Outlining a series of institutional failures, including failing to implement COVID-19 transmission prevention measures and failing to provide hygiene supplies, the letter argues there is a strong reason to believe a connection exists between Mission Institution’s failure to provide necessary care and the resulting death due to COVID-19. 
The 38 organizations issuing the call for a full, public inquest include: Abolition Coalition, Amnesty International, Atira Women’s Resource Society, BC Assembly of First Nations, BC Association of Aboriginal Friendship Centres, BC Civil Liberties Association, BC First Nations Justice Council, BC Health Coalition, BC Poverty Reduction Coalition, Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives-BC, Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, Community Legal Assistance Society, First Nations Summit, Health Justice, Jail Accountability and Information Line, John Howard Society of Canada, Joint Effort, Law Union of British Columbia, PACE Society, Prisoners’ Legal Services, Union of BC Indian Chiefs, Vancouver Prison Justice Day Committee, and West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund. 
Media Statements:   
Aisha Weaver, Policy Director of BC Civil Liberties Association: “We all need to know what happened at Mission Institution and Correctional Service of Canada needs to be held accountable for what will likely be deemed a grossly mismanaged response to COVID-19. Delayed, piece-meal and reactive measures are too little too late. An immediate public inquest is critical to find out the circumstances surrounding this man’s horrific death and to prevent future deaths. Transparent comprehensive measures, based on public health guidelines, and releasing all releasable prisoners are necessary to protect the health of all incarcerated people.” 
Jen Metcalfe, Executive Director of Prisoners’ Legal Services, “A public Coroner’s inquest is necessary to reveal the broader circumstances that allowed such a tragic death and catastrophic outbreak to happen among this vulnerable population. Canada’s failure to implement public health advice on containing COVID-19 from the outset has put prisoners at risk.” 
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President, Union of BC Indian Chiefs: “A public inquest is essential and the bare minimum to try and find justice from this injustice. We challenge the Governments of BC and Canada to go further in fundamentally changing prison systems and their pandemic responses to prevent further deaths. Canadian prisons remain sites of colonial violence against over-represented Indigenous peoples, and the COVID-19 pandemic has been weaponized against those who are incarcerated.” 
Joint Effort: “By identifying the facts and conditions leading to the cause of death of this person in custody, necessary information will come to light for which Correctional Service Canada and all levels of government must be held accountable. CSC has failed to ensure the health and safety of every prisoner, and all levels of government need an immediate plan to reduce the number of people in prisons and jails, making sure that every prisoner has access to income assistance and social supports immediately upon release. Healthy communities flattening the curve of COVID-19 cannot ignore correctional facilities.” 
Ayendri Riddell, BC Health Coalition, “Prisoners are part of the public, and prison health is public health. The outbreak in Mission Institution is the second largest outbreak in our province. Our provincial and federal governments and Correctional Service of Canada are failing to adequately protect the health and well-being of people incarcerated in or working in prisons.”

His continued imprisonment only prolongs their suffering.” 
At the end of January 2019, a Chinese court found human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang guilty of “subverting state power” and handed him a prison sentence of four and a half years. Amnesty International described the verdict as a gross injustice. 
But on April 5, 2020, Wang Quanzhang was released and entered a 14-day quarantine. He was reunited with his family on April 27 in Beijing.

0,South Sudan: Evidence of violations and illicit concealment of arms must spur UN to renew arms embargo,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/south-sudan-evidence-of-violations-and-illicit-concealment-of-arms-must-spur-un-to-renew-arms-embargo/,"Amnesty International visited 12 military camps in South Sudan Site visits and satellite imagery reveal multiple forces violating arms embargo Child soldiers, illicit concealment and diversion of arms also documented The UN Security Council must renew and strengthen enforcement of the arms embargo...","The UN Security Council must renew and strengthen enforcement of the arms embargo on South Sudan, Amnesty International said today, exposing new evidence that multiple security forces are breaching it and concealing weapons amid a volatile security situation. Next month the Security Council is set to vote on a resolution that would renew the embargo, which currently expires on 31 May 2020. 
Earlier this year, the organization’s investigators gained access to 12 military training and cantonment sites across the country run by members of formerly opposed forces including the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), Sudan People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO) and South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA), as well as the so-called “Organized Forces” of the police, fire brigade, and wildlife service. 
Amnesty International discovered evidence of newly imported small arms and ammunition, illicit concealment of weapons, and diversion of armoured vehicles for military uses not approved under the arms transfer licenses. Government and former opposition forces’ reporting on security arrangements actively deceived Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)-supported monitors, showing an urgent need for meticulous, independent verification. 
“The African Union has dubbed 2020 the year to ‘silence the guns’ on the continent, which, as they have stated, includes taking measures to prevent UN arms embargo violations. Renewing the embargo on South Sudan is a crucial part of this effort. Weapons have been used to commit horrific human rights violations and war crimes throughout the conflict,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The UN arms embargo hasn’t been a panacea, but the situation would almost certainly be worse without it in place. The ceasefire continues to be broken sporadically, the implementation of critical security, governance and accountability arrangements are persistently delayed, and South Sudan – awash with small arms – is also facing the public health crisis posed by COVID-19. Now is not the time to let even more weapons flow into this volatile mix.” 
Evidence of UN arms embargo violations 
Most of the hundreds of rifles and other small arms that Amnesty International investigators observed in the hands of soldiers were acquired prior to the embargo the UN Security Council imposed on all of South Sudan in July 2018. However, several bodyguards for prominent generals from government and opposition forces alike, who would have first access to newly acquired weapons, carried models of Eastern European weapons never before documented in the country (see technical addendum for more details). Amnesty International therefore believes that these weapons were brought into South Sudan in violation of the arms embargo. 
Amnesty International has also acquired verified photographs of ammunition used by the National Security Service (NSS) at Luri, a highly secretive NSS base outside South Sudan’s capital, Juba. The images show Chinese cartridges manufactured in 2016, after China’s last acknowledged sale to South Sudan. Either these cartridges breached the arms embargo, were secretly sold beforehand, or were acquired from a third-party seller who would have broken the embargo or illicitly diverted the ammunition. 
Small arms imports are not the only likely violations. Sources have told Amnesty International that at the time the arms embargo was established, the South Sudan government’s fleet of Mi-24 attack helicopters was dysfunctional and grounded. Since then it has acquired spare parts to refurbish the helicopters, violating the arms embargo. 
Satellite imagery analysis by Amnesty International shows that several of the helicopters underwent significant maintenance at Luri and Juba International Airport in October 2018 and have been flown several times since. Two aircraft were missing twice from the ramp in Juba, on 4 March and 10 March 2019, and one was missing on 10 February 2020. There are many reasons the aircraft could have flown, but it is noteworthy that in March 2019, fighting took place against the National Salvation Front in Yei, in the southern part of the country. The Mi-24s are especially problematic in the context of South Sudan, where the heavy armed gunships have unfettered opportunity to strafe ground targets with rockets and machine guns and have been used in attacks that have unlawfully killed and injured civilians. 
“Just one of these attack helicopters costs USD $36 million, and parts and maintenance come at a premium, particularly when these components violate a UN arms embargo. Given the tremendous challenges facing South Sudan’s grossly under-funded health and social welfare systems – particularly in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic – priority must be given to protecting people’s health and livelihoods, rather than purchasing and importing arms. The embargo must remain, be strengthened and independent monitors based in South Sudan must be mandated to inspect exempted shipments,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Weapons hidden from monitors 
As part of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) signed in September 2018, government and opposition forces committed to moving troops to joint cantonment sites, turning in their weapons to independently monitored armouries, and beginning a training process to form unified forces as a step towards building a new military. 
However, Amnesty International investigators did not find this disarmament process occurring at any of the 12 sites visited. Some fighters did not bring their weapons to the cantonment sites, as a wariness of the peace process prompted SSPDF and opposition forces to retain their arms. In other cases, fighters arrived with weapons but then hid them away in their dwellings rather than turn them in. 
The only site that had a nominally established armoury was Gorom, where the special VIP protection force is being formed and trained. In a presentation to diplomats and independent ceasefire monitors, the brigadier general leading the training there said they had dedicated four shipping containers to store weapons. However, when Amnesty International researchers requested the containers be opened, they discovered they were all stuffed with bags of grain stacked to the ceiling, and only a handful of small arms were laid against the door of a single container. 
The government carefully orchestrates what monitors can see and blocks access to strategic sites, thereby effectively largely controlling what information is reported to IGAD. For example, in December 2018, when three ceasefire monitors and their driver attempted to gain entry to Luri, NSS officers arbitrarily detained them, blindfolding, handcuffing and physically assaulting them. The monitors were turned away after NSS agents stole their money and valuables. 
Child soldiers and other violations 
During the investigation, Amnesty International observed child soldiers present in at least two cantonment and training sites, within ranks of government and opposition forces, including the VIP protection force. UNICEF estimates there are 19,000 children used by armed forces and armed groups in South Sudan as of late July 2019. Only 53 have been released from barracks, bases and cantonment sites as at 7 February 2020. 
In February 2020, the government signed an action plan with the UN to end and prevent all grave violations against children. The SPLA-IO and SSOA endorsed the plan which will apply to the opposition forces as they unify with government forces. Two weeks after the signing of the action plan, on 26 February, 15 children associated with armed forces and armed groups were released, but more needs to be done to end the perpetration of violations against children affected by conflict and holding those responsible for it to account.  
Besides blatant UN arms embargo violations, the Government of South Sudan has also violated sales agreements for legally acquired weapons. In 2014, it purchased armoured vehicles from STREIT Group, a Canadian company with a major manufacturing plant in the United Arab Emirates that typically supplies African countries. At the time of the sale, the Government of South Sudan promised only to use the vehicles for policing. 
However, photographs obtained by Amnesty International show the vehicles being used in military operations against opposition forces, in violation of the sales agreement. And during its recent field investigation, Amnesty International researchers observed one STREIT Typhoon armoured vehicle in Western Equatoria State in the south-west of the country, a tense strategic area that saw persistent fighting from 2016 until 2019. This shows that the government continues its practice of illicit diversion. 
“Until forces in South Sudan stop illegally concealing weapons, and use the ones they have responsibly, the arms embargo must stay in place. The security situation in South Sudan is too fragile while basic international norms, such as the prohibition of the recruitment and use of child soldiers, continue to be violated. South Sudan must seriously tackle these problems and the UN Security Council must renew the arms embargo to stem the flow of weapons into the country,” said Deprose Muchena.

Long-time member Kim tells us how she is continuing her human rights activism, from home. 
Here is what she wrote: 
This weekend my kids and I created a virtual protest in front of a virtual legislature, with LEGO! My son dug deep in his LEGO collection, finding figures; my daughter used her talent for exceedingly TINY printing to make up the protest signs. I cut up cotton swabs for handles and glued them to the tiny signs. We printed an old photo of the Alberta legislature I had on the computer. This is a pretty basic kids’ diorama, but we had so much fun putting it together! My oldest was even helpful with looking around on the internet for good slogans to use! What an educational opportunity for discussion of human rights and using our voices of dissent for change! 
Together, we can make a difference for human rights, even when we’re apart during the COVID-19 crisis! Over the past few weeks of self-isolation, my local Amnesty group and I have been talking about ways to stay connected, and ways to continue our human rights advocacy. We may not be able to take our message to the streets, but we can still take ACTION!  
Sharing creative visuals and activities might not seem like activism, but they inspire us all to keep thinking about protecting and defending human rights. Taking action online can be very powerful! Keep signing online petitions and writing letters; hold governments accountable for their policies. 
During a crisis like COVID-19, governments sometimes implement measures without enough oversight or without end dates, so it’s important we stay vigilant! 
Everything’s cancelled, except our commitment to human rights!

“This first regular public report acknowledging AFRICOM’s role in civilian casualties is a welcome glimmer of transparency in more than a decade of deadly military operations that until now have been shrouded in secrecy. Now there must be accountability and reparation for the victims and their families – the US military has still neither contacted nor offered reparation to the families of any of the civilians it has admitted to killing. 
“There also needs to be an analysis of a wider range of strikes than those covered in this report, which leaves out dozens of strikes by only looking at the period after 1 February 2019. A year ago, following a ground-breaking Amnesty International report, AFRICOM pledged to review all of its operations in Somalia to assess whether it had misreported civilian casualties, but it has still not made the results public. 
“It’s a positive step for AFRICOM to give bereaved Somali families the opportunity to self-report civilian casualties via its website. However, this will not serve the vast majority of impacted civilians who live in remote areas where smartphones are banned and internet access is poor. Alternative means should be made available, including through establishing a mechanism in Mogadishu to allow clan elders or elected representatives to speak on behalf of civilians whose loved ones have been killed by US air strikes.” 
Background 
Today’s AFRICOM report reviews 91 air strikes it carried out in Somalia between 1 February 2019 and 31 March 2020. Out of 27 alleged civilian casualty incidents in that period – citing media reports as well as independent NGO reports from Amnesty International and others – the report “closes” 20 incidents and leaves seven open and under review. Among these are two covered in an Amnesty International investigation released earlier this month. 
Through gathering extensive testimonial evidence and expert analysis of images and video from strike sites, satellite imagery, and weapons identification, Amnesty International has investigated nine separate cases since 2017 where US air strikes have killed a total of 21 civilians and injured 11 more. Some of these involved to apparent violations of international humanitarian law. 
In contrast, AFRICOM has now admitted to a total of just four civilian deaths and three injuries in two incidents.

“While this represents a significant step for Saudi Arabia if implemented, the country’s continued use of the death penalty reached a shocking high last year with 184 recorded executions,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Regional Director. 
“The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment; no country should still be using it and Saudi Arabia’s record is particularly bad in this respect. Saudi Arabia must now establish an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty completely. 
“It should also not be forgotten that dozens of peaceful human rights activists remain detained following convictions in grossly unfair trials solely for campaigning for equality and justice in a vastly repressive environment.” 
The Saudi Arabian authorities yesterday announced that the country will no longer use the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime. The death penalty will be replaced with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. 
According to information obtained by Amnesty International, the Royal Decree excludes crimes under the counter-terror law. It is unclear what juvenile offenders would instead be sentenced to if tried under this law. Amnesty International has documented the Saudi Arabian authorities’ misuse of the counter-terror law, which has overly broad and vague definitions of “terrorism” and of a “terrorist crime,” and contains a number of provisions which criminalize peaceful expression of views. 
Saudi Arabia has for years flouted international law prohibiting the use of the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Amnesty International has long campaigned for the quashing of the death sentences of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon – three young men from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority who were all arrested while under the age of 18 and are at imminent risk of execution following grossly unfair trials before the Specialized Criminal Court. 
The authorities have yet to publish the Royal Decree containing the announcement publicly, and its implementing regulations remain unclear. To Amnesty International’s knowledge, families of those sentenced to death have not yet received any information about cases of their loved ones. 
Last week, Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court issued a directive for courts to end discretionary flogging punishments, and instead, replace them with jail time and/or fines. It is still unclear whether this applies to mandatory flogging punishments for other offences under Shari’a, including for alcohol use and sexual offences. 
Law on Juveniles 
Recent announcement follows the Law on Juveniles, issued in 2018, which prevented judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those under 15 years old. It did not stop them from using the death penalty in cases of those who are convicted of hadd crimes (those with fixed and severe punishments under Shari’a) or crimes punishable by qisas (retaliation), a category of crimes under Shari’a in which murder and bodily harm are punishable by the same harm, such as the death penalty for murder and infliction of the same injury for bodily harm. The law therefore fell short Saudi Arabia’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
The announcement, which is a step forward from the Law on Juveniles, must be followed by clearly implementing regulations which do not exclude any minors from the reform. 
Background 
In its annual Death Penalty report, Amnesty International revealed that Saudi Arabia executed a record number of people in 2019, despite an overall decline in executions worldwide. The Saudi authorities put 184 people to death last year, the highest number recorded using Amnesty International’s research logs citing Ministry of Interior figures since 2000.

Some claimants seeking to enter Canada have already been turned back to an uncertain fate in the US, potentially in violation of Canada’s international legal obligations under the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture. 
The federal government has introduced some positive exceptions to the general ban it introduced last month. People crossing at land ports of entry who were exempt under the Safe Third Country Agreement will now be permitted to make their claims in Canada, as will US citizens, stateless persons and minors regardless of how they arrive. However, Amnesty International maintains that the measure puts some refugee claimants in danger and is out of step with public health measures. 
“Although the government of Canada continues to insist that it takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously, there is no legal basis to support that claim,” said Marisa Berry Mendez, Tactical and Crisis Campaigner at Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “For weeks now, we have heard about an arrangement between the US and Canada, but the details have never been disclosed. There is a total lack of transparency about what happens to claimants who are denied entry at the border,” she added. 
The decision to renew the refugee ban comes on the heels of a worrying new policy adopted by the Trump administration. It allows for the expulsion of migrants, including possible refugee protection claimants, from the US without a hearing to the “country of last transit or home country.” Disturbingly, it contains no exemption for unaccompanied minors. It has already been used to expel thousands of migrants on the US southern border, including children, as well as a handful of migrants on the northern border. It is yet unclear whether refugee protection claimants who are refused entry into Canada at the US border could be swept up in the policy. 
Of the new US policy, Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, said the following: “this policy decision is only the latest salvo in Donald Trump’s ruthless campaign to systematically dismantle refugee protection in the US.  Is it acceptable for Canada to deny refugee protection claimants entry when they face the possibility of detention in inhumane conditions, or even summary expulsion from the US? We know there is a better way. These refugee protection claimants could easily be subject to quarantines and testing right here in Canada, as is the case for other cross border travellers who are allowed to enter Canada.” 
The renewed border measure, as outlined in the Order in Council, is valid until 21 May 2020.

April 27, 2020 
Dear Premier Horgan and Deputy Commissioner Strachan, 
Amnesty International is writing this Open Letter to share our concerns and urge the provincial government and the RCMP to take effective and decisive action in response to an attack carried out against the Tiny House Warriors camp on April 19, 2020. The Tiny House Warriors camp is located near Blue River, in unceded Secwepemc territory in the interior of British Columbia. Indigenous land and human rights defenders have maintained a full-time presence there since July 2018, to uphold collective sovereignty and jurisdiction in opposition to the ongoing expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and construction of associated work camps. 
At this time, we are writing to you jointly as we consider both the provincial government and the RCMP to have important responsibilities in responding to this incident so as to ensure that: 
Amnesty International has been able to conduct interviews with individuals familiar with the incident, including an eyewitness, and to review a range of publicly available materials.  
On April 19, at approximately 10:45 pm, Kanahus Manuel, a Secwepemc land defender, and a male Indigenous land defender who were in the Tiny House Warriors camp heard a noise suggestive of a disturbance outside. Three men and one woman had forcefully driven off-road vehicles through a number of large signs and banners that mark the camp’s entrance. 
The three men, who were demonstrably aggressive, tore down several red dresses set up at the camp as a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two Spirit people, before physically attacking the male Indigenous land defender. Kanahus Manuel had turned on the high beams of her truck to illuminate the attackers but feared for her safety and ran for cover to one of the larger tiny houses. One of the intruders got into her truck, where the keys were still in the ignition, and drove it at high speed into the house in which she had sought refuge. The impact shook the home substantially, causing Kanahus Manuel to fall and knocking numerous items onto the floor. She had been shining a light from the window to make it evident that she was inside. The intruder then drove the truck into a telephone pole.  
Throughout the attack, Kanahus Manuel and the intruders had verbal exchanges, some of which were recorded on her phone and included misogynistic and racist comments. The incident lasted about 25 minutes. As soon as the intruders left the camp Kanahus Manuel began contacting family, friends and allies for assistance.  
Amnesty International is very concerned about the violence, threats and property damage that occurred and more generally about the menacing nature of the attack. The impact of this attack is heightened given the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents of the Tiny House Warriors camp have been diligent about implementing physical-distancing and other measures in response to the virus and are very disturbed that the individuals who carried out this attack did so in total disregard of those protective restrictions. 
We are aware that there is an RCMP investigation underway. We urge and expect that those responsible for the investigation will consider the likelihood that this may be a hate crime. We are also aware of tensions that exist between the Tiny House Warriors and the RCMP due to past arrests of residents of the camp and their supporters. In this context, it will be important that the investigation proceed in a manner that builds the trust and confidence of the Tiny House Warriors and Secwepemc leadership.   
Tiny House Warriors land defenders and First Nations leadership have emphasized to Amnesty International that they remain very fearful about the possibility of further incidents of this nature. In such circumstances, governments have a responsibility to take steps to provide reasonable measures of effective protection that are requested by human rights defenders. We urge the government to discuss appropriate protection measures with the Tiny House Warriors community and with First Nations leadership. 
The urgency of a strong response to this incident is all the greater as it is part of an ongoing history of harassment, intimidation, attacks and virulent online threats against the Tiny House Warriors. More widely it reflects growing concerns about vilification, threats and attacks against human rights defenders in Canada, particularly women and Indigenous rights defenders, actively engaged in campaigns and awareness building with respect to Indigenous land rights and the climate impact of the oil and gas industry.  Amnesty International has, in fact, frequently reported that this pattern of attacks against human rights defenders is increasing throughout the Americas. 
Amnesty International wrote to you, Premier Horgan, alongside Prime Minister Trudeau and all other provincial and territorial Premiers, on March 5, 2020, drawing attention to the worsening pattern of threats and attacks against human rights defenders in Canada and urging that governments across the country take individual and collective steps to provide more visible support and protection to defenders. We also wrote to Premier Kenney on September 10, 2019, noting concerns that the tone and nature of various aspects of his government’s “fight back strategy” would expose human rights defenders to greater risks. Notably it is reported that individuals involved in this recent attack against the Tiny House Warriors camp may have been driving vehicles with Alberta license plates. 
Incidents of this sort cannot be allowed to proliferate, and the nature of the threats and violence most certainly cannot be allowed to build. The BC government’s obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, implemented provincially through the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, as well as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders are at stake. 
We urge the government of British Columbia and the RCMP to respond decisively to this incident in a manner that demonstrates full recognition of the important role played by Indigenous, land and environmental human rights defenders in the province and sends a strong message that attacks and threats against them will not be tolerated. 
Sincerely,

The death penalty will be replaced with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. 
If implemented, this will be a significant step towards respecting the rights to life, to security of person and to freedom from cruel treatment. Does it go far enough? Absolutely not. So Amnesty International is taking this moment to call on Saudi Arabia to take a big step: temporarily halt all executions while a roadmap to total abolition is created. 
In another positive move, Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court issued a directive in mid April for courts to end discretionary flogging punishments. Humane replacements could include jail time, fines or community service. It is still unclear whether this applies to mandatory flogging punishments for other offences under Shari’a law, including for alcohol use and sexual offences.

Social media is now a window into current events all across the world, and when everyone’s attention is on one topic, it is understandable that consumers might reach ‘information overload’. 
At Amnesty International we have extensive experience of dealing with traumatic stories and images – unfortunately this comes with the job of exposing human rights abuses. But experiencing these stories and images can cause what specialists call ‘vicarious trauma’, where we can feel real personal emotional responses to what we are viewing on our screens, even when it hasn’t directly happened to us. While vicarious trauma is a worst case scenario, it’s very normal for everyone to be feeling some emotional distress at the moment, and we need to be aware of that and take care of ourselves and others. 
If you are exposed to upsetting material your brain has the capacity to experience feelings of distress similar to those you would experience had you been there. Human brains are wired to try to protect us from anything that might be a threat to our safety, and when we see something shocking, our brains decide very quickly whether we are safe or whether we need to react. Chemicals like cortisol are released in the body to ready us for action. We sometimes call this response ‘fight, flight or freeze’. When experienced in everyday life, they can make us feel panicked, stressed, and unwell. 
Just as Amnesty understands the need to mitigate the impact of viewing distressing material, everyone needs to look after themselves in this digital age when they have been exposed to disturbing or upsetting content for long periods at a time. While it’s good to keep in mind that each person is different, and will find different coping mechanisms helpful, here are some suggestions that might work for you: 
It can be easy to dismiss signs that you are being affected by emotional distress but if you feel that your mood and behaviour are shifting because you’re consuming material which is making you worried, angry or stressed, give yourself the space you need to acknowledge this. Allow yourself time to process your experiences.   
There are lots of online resources which you might find helpful – here is just one with lots of advice on how to look after your mental wellbeing when you’re consuming a barrage of difficult material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yZrcCFpp2o 
Connect with people you trust and let them know how you’re feeling. The chances are many people will be feeling similar, and it may help to chat with a friend, colleague or family member so that you can share your fears and worries with them. 
This could be a great time to keep that resolution to yourself to stop taking your phone to bed – this has been reported as helping you sleep better. 
Another good tip is to try to make sure you’re getting enough sleep in general.  It’s easy to stay up late streaming your favourite series, but it can be really beneficial to try to keep to a regular sleep routine and get 8 hours of sleep a night. 
We all need to take a screen break from time to time as this is so important for our general wellbeing. But this doesn’t just mean a break from your inbox, it can also apply to the amount of time you are spending online reading the news in general. Instead of just reading short social media posts and the latest headlines, it could be beneficial to set aside some time to read one or two well-researched articles every week. 
You could also take some time out for meditation or other calming techniques such as these: 
Grounding is a technique that helps to get your mind and body working together in the here and now, and is useful when you’re feeling overwhelmed. 
You could start by trying any combination of the following: 
You can also try a technique called ‘attention switching’. This is not the same as trying to suppress a thought or emotion, but involves switching attention between alternatives. 
If you would like to try this, just bring to mind an image that makes you feel safe, connected or protected. Make it a conscious process as you switch between the image and the one you are struggling with. Talk to yourself as you switch! Remember this is not an exercise to block out your experience, but to help you exert control over it.  
Focusing on your breathing can help to calm and regulate your bodily reactions and give you a sense of being anchored. There are many simple breathing techniques which you can use to help yourself feel calmer. Here are just a few for you to try: 
To come out of the breathing space, notice once more the contact your body makes with the chair and your feet on the floor. Allow the light to begin to filter through your eyelids and gradually lift your eyelids to allow the outside world back in. 
One of the most important things we can do in these uncertain times is to remember that whenever the headlines make us feel helpless in the face of the current crisis, there are steps we can take to look after ourselves. If we all take some time to talk to others, give ourselves a break, and recognise when we are feeling overwhelmed, we will stay stronger and healthier. Now is the time to come together and ensure that our mental wellbeing remains strong during this global pandemic.

“We are devastated to learn of Dr Abdullah al-Hamid’s passing while he remained in detention for his peaceful activism. 
“Dr al-Hamid was a fearless champion for human rights in Saudi Arabia, who was determined to build a better world for all. Our thoughts are with his family and friends, who for the past eight years had been deprived of his presence as a result of the state’s inhumane repression. 
“As a prominent human rights campaigner, Dr al-Hamid’s important work continues to resonate throughout the region. He, and all other prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia, should never have been in jail in the first place. 
“We again call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those still imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.” 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid 
Dr al-Hamid, 69, was a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA). The organization – whose slogan is ‘Know your rights’ – was committed to promoting the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other international treaties and standards. 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid suffered from hypertension, and was told three months ago by a doctor that he needed to undergo heart surgery. He was threatened by prison authorities that if he told his family about his health condition, they would cut his communication with his family. Dr Abdullah al-Hamid had suffered a stroke on 9 April and remained in detention, despite being in a coma in the intensive care unit at al-Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh. 
As a human rights defender, writer and academic, he had written extensively on human rights and the independence of judiciary. He was a professor of contemporary literature at al-Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Riyadh before being dismissed for his activism. He is survived by his wife and eight children. 
Dr al-Hamid was prosecuted repeatedly for his peaceful work since 1993. In March 2012, he and Mohammad al-Qahtani, a fellow ACPRA founding member, were arrested and interrogated regarding their work with ACPRA and their peaceful activism. In March 2013, they were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively, on charges of “breaking allegiance to the ruler”, “questioning the integrity of officials”, “seeking to disrupt security and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations”, and “instigating international organizations against the Kingdom”.

Worker organizations report that hundreds of Amazon warehouse workers in the USA have already stayed home from work this week, citing concerns including a lack of health protection at warehouses. 
Amnesty International also called on the e-commerce giant to protect the rights of workers who speak out, amid allegations that staff have been fired after voicing safety concerns. 
“We stand in solidarity with Amazon workers who are speaking up for their rights. Amazon warehouse and delivery workers are risking their lives in the midst of a pandemic to deliver essential goods to all of us,” said Joe Westby, Researcher at Amnesty International. 
“Amazon is one of the world’s wealthiest companies and its profits are surging as a result of this crisis. It is repugnant that the company’s workforce feel their safety is not being taken seriously. Jeff Bezos needs to step up and address the legitimate and vital concerns raised by Amazon staff – profits should never be put above people. 
“It’s outrageous that Amazon is set to end its policy to give workers the option to take unlimited unpaid leave, which was just instituted in March. With reports of new COVID-19 cases emerging at warehouses in Indiana and New Jersey, employees face an impossible choice of potentially putting their health at serious risk by going to work or having to leave the company. 
“Allegations that staff have been fired for speaking out are deeply disturbing. No Amazon worker should face reprisals for speaking out about safety concerns. Amazon must ensure that workers can report concerns about health and safety risks without fear of retaliation.”  
Background 
Amnesty International wrote to the US-based company Amazon requesting information about what steps it is taking to ensure it respects labour rights during the COVID-19 crisis but did not receive a response. 
Companies have a responsibility to respect all human rights wherever they operate in the world, including protecting their workers and providing safe working conditions. They must adhere to health and safety standards and properly implement national health advice in order to minimise workplace exposure to the virus. 
Under international laws and standards, employers must put arrangements in place that allow workers to report on health and safety risks. Workers’ safety concerns must be listened to and addressed through social dialogue. There must not be retaliation against the workers for raising concerns or lodging a complaint related to health and safety. 
Workers are entitled to remove themselves from a work situation that can reasonably be considered as posing a serious risk to their health. Until adequate measures are adopted and an imminent danger to life and health is addressed, employers cannot oblige workers to work in such conditions. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world, people have increasingly turned to online commerce, and Amazon has experienced a surge of orders in most global markets. However, there have been strikes or walk-outs in France, Italy and in several locations in the USA over concerns about COVID-19 protocols and labour issues.
