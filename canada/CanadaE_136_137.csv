Truth and justice for the 43 also has far-reaching consequences across Mexico. 
The disappearance of the 43 students has come to symbolize a massive nationwide crisis. More than 40,000 people are now reported missing and the number continues to climb as authorities fail to investigate. 
If the high-profile case of the 43 is not solved, what hope is there for all the others – or for bringing disappearances to an end in Mexico?  
After four years of cover-up by the government of Enrique Peña Nieto, the election of President López Obrador in December 2018 brought hope. One of his first actions was to create a special federal commission to look into the disappearance of the 43 students, something their families and human rights organizations had requested. The Attorney General’s Office also created a Special Unit to investigate and prosecute the case.  
 
These actions are important. Yet concrete results have yet to be announced. Meanwhile, more people continue to be disappeared in Mexico.  
Calls for action from Canada carry weight in Mexico. The families of the 43 students have asked us to support them as they courageously seek the truth, justice and the return of their loved ones.  
 
  On a large piece of paper, draw a big, bold 43 and make it as eye-catching as possible. On the back of the piece of paper, write a short message as follows: 
    – Address your letter to President López Obrador 
    – Write a sentence to introduce yourself and make the message personal.  
    – Express your concern, making it clear that you have not forgotten the 43 disappeared students of Ayotzinapa 
   – Call on President López Obrador to ensure that all lines of enquiry are pursued, the full truth about what happened is made public and everyone responsible is brought to justice. 
   – Sign your name, and be sure to show that you are writing from Canada 
  Send your “43” to us so we can deliver as many of them as possible together to Mexico’s government for maximum impact.

Amid a global climate emergency, the importance of protecting biodiversity-rich land, forests and water has become ever more urgent. 
In Latin America, as elsewhere, Indigenous peoples are leading the way, together with other determined earth defenders. They are paying a heavy price to do so, increasingly with their lives. New research suggests it is battle that has become more lethal than some war zones. 
Amnesty Canada’s campaign to defend earth defenders under attack in Latin America needs your support!  
 
 
The women earth defenders of Mujeres Amazónicas face threats and attacks on them and their families as they seek to protect the world’s largest rainforest from damage by oil companies and other resource extraction. In November, an Amnesty delegation will accompany these courageous women as they press Ecuadoran authorities for action to protect their lives and rights. Already more than 130,000 Amnesty supporters from around the world have signed petitions in support of Mujeres Amazónicas. We need to increase that number for maximum impact. 
TAKE ACTION: Before November 1st, please sign the e-action here and collect signatures on our print petition here. You can find beautiful posters of the women earth defenders of Mujeres Amazónicas for a table display by scrolling to the bottom of our Earth Defenders web page here.  
 
Threats and attacks are escalating in the Central American country of Honduras. The beloved leader Berta Cáceres was killed to silence her voice of opposition to the damming of the Gualcarque River, whose running waters are vital to the rights and lives of Lenca Indigenous People. Now Rosalina Dominguez and other earth defenders in the Lenca community of Río Blanco, who continue the struggle that Berta led, are being threatened with death by men armed with guns and machetes. Their food crops were intentionally destroyed in July. The situation is extremely dangerous. 
TAKE ACTION: As soon as possible please sign the Online Urgent Action here and share it widely.  
 
The killing of Rarámuri Indigenous earth defender Julian Carrillo in the Sierra Tarahumara last October 24 devastated a community that had already seen other leaders killed as they sought to defend land, Indigenous rights and the forests so vital to their survival. Days before he was killed, Julian had spoken out against mining concessions that would impact the environment on which his people depend. Julian’s assassination is symptomatic of an increase in deadly violence against earth defenders in Mexico who confront the environmental impacts of irresponsible resource extraction.  Mexico must act to prevent more bloodshed and uphold human rights. 
TAKE ACTION: Watch for Amnesty Canada posts on social media around the anniversary of Julian’s killing and share them. Please sign this action and collect signatures on our print petition here.  
 
Colombia has experienced a massive wave of attacks on community leaders defending land and the environment since the signing of a peace agreement three years ago. Indigenous defenders continue to bear the brunt of the violence. In August, the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia declared an emergency situation, with 94 Indigenous leaders killed in the past nine months alone . 
In November, Amnesty Canada will co-sponsor a visit organized by our colleagues at Peace Brigades International of three environmental human rights defenders who will talk about their work to stop climate change, fracking, and protect water amid ongoing violence against them. Watch our website for details of the tour and events in selected cities across Canada.  
TAKE ACTION: Please collect signatures on this print petition calling for action to stop the killings so earth defenders can continue their vital work. 
 
Guatemala is suffering a dangerous backslide in protection of human rights. People who defend their land and the right to a healthy environment are once more targets of violence, especially when they speak out against the environmental impacts of mining projects proceeding without the free, prior and informed consent of affected Indigenous peoples. 
TAKE ACTION: Please respond to the Urgent Action here for Indigenous lawyer Quelvin Jiménez, who is at serious risk following new threats and attacks in response to his work to defend the rights of the Xinca Indigenous People from mining activity in the south of Guatemala.   
Do you have creative ideas for engaging and mobilizing other activists? Would you like to be an ambassador for this campaign in your school or community? We’d love to hear from you. Contact campaigner Kathy Price.

“While the formal withdrawal of this dangerous bill, at long last, is welcome, this announcement cannot change the fact that the Hong Kong authorities have chosen to suppress protests in a grossly unlawful way that has seriously damaged the people’s trust and sense of legitimacy of the government.  
“A thorough and independent investigation into unnecessary and excessive use of force by police at protests is now needed more than ever. We continue to call on all governments to suspend transfers of less lethal ‘crowd control’ equipment to Hong Kong until a full investigation is carried out and adequate safeguards are put in place. 
“The problems with the Extradition Bill were clear from the start, and the Hong Kong government should have withdrawn it months ago. Instead, it chose to meet protests with tear gas and rubber bullets, inflaming tensions and leading to months of unrest. Today’s announcement is a small step in the right direction, but it will take much more to show the world that the Hong Kong authorities are truly committed to upholding human rights, and send a clear message that people in Hong Kong can still enjoy these rights irrespective of their political beliefs.”

“Violence directed at police on Saturday is no excuse for officers to go on the rampage elsewhere. The horrifying scenes at Prince Edward metro station, which saw terrified bystanders caught up in the melee, fell far short of international policing standards.
“Video footage shows police stormed the train carriage and used batons to repeatedly beat people posing no threat whatsoever. Pepper spray was used in a carriage where people had no means to retreat, while medics were barred from entering the station. It is also alarming that a police officer appeared to aim a sponge grenade launcher at close range to those inside the train. Such unlawful police tactics continue to inflame rather than deescalate the situation.
“There are also serious questions surrounding the deployment of undercover officers among the protesters and whether they played any role in inciting violence.  Such officers should never act as agents provocateurs. It creates mistrust and suspicion, and sows divisions among people who have the right to assemble and associate. 
“For the first time, police used a blue dye in water cannons, which can result in large numbers of people, including bystanders and journalists, being indiscriminately marked. These tactics pose a real threat to the freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and the right to a fair trial. The police operation on Saturday only underscores the urgent need for an independent and proper investigation into the policing of the protests.”

0,Brazil: Authorities must investigate and prosecute those responsible for destruction of the Amazon,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/brazil-authorities-must-investigate-and-prosecute-those-responsible-destruction-amazon/,"Brazilian authorities must investigate and prosecute those responsible for starting illegal fires in the Amazon to prevent further destruction of the rainforest, Amnesty International said today as it launched an online campaign to pressure President Jair Bolsonaro and his government to step up...","Brazilian authorities must investigate and prosecute those responsible for starting illegal fires in the Amazon to prevent further destruction of the rainforest, Amnesty International said today as it launched an online campaign to pressure President Jair Bolsonaro and his government to step up protection of Indigenous territories and environmental reserves.
“The devastating fires in the Amazon are the symptom of a larger crisis of illegal deforestation and land seizures. On paper Brazil has strong laws to protect Indigenous territories and environmental reserves. Yet President Bolsonaro has actively undermined those protections, resulting in the devastation we see today,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International.
“While the President has now signed a decree temporarily banning fires for land clearance, this does not eliminate the potential for further fires because he has taken little action to deter or prevent the illegal deforestation and land seizures that drive them.
“The Brazilian authorities must immediately investigate and prosecute those responsible for these catastrophic fires, otherwise we will inevitably see them getting worse throughout the rest of President Bolsonaro’s time in office.”
On August 29 President Bolsonaro enacted a decree prohibiting land clearance fires for 60 days as part of the government’s response to the crisis. However, one official working for Brazil’s national environmental agency who spoke to Amnesty International on the condition of anonymity, told us he feared the decree will likely have limited effect because most of the recent fires were already prohibited by existing laws. 
According to representatives of non-governmental organizations and local officials, the people starting the fires are often individuals who are encouraged to occupy plots of land in Indigenous territories and environmental reserves by local farmers and politicians.
The conversion of forests into pasture in the Amazon often follows a pattern, whereby plots of land in the forest are identified and illegally seized, trees are cut down and cleared, then fires are lit (often repeatedly in the same area) before grass is planted and cattle eventually introduced.
Amnesty witnessed a fire raging in the Indigenous territory Manoki, in Mato Grosso state on 23 August. The burning area of the forest had been fenced off. Manoki leaders told Amnesty International that they expected the fire was intended to make pasture for grazing cattle.
Call for Brazil’s government to enforce and fund existing protections
“Sending in the military and ordering a short-term ban are only temporary fixes to a much larger problem. Beyond fighting the fires, Brazil needs to enforce its own laws, step up monitoring and patrols of illegal land seizures in protected areas and Indigenous territories, and investigate and hold those responsible for human rights abuses,” said Kumi Naidoo. 
Since April 2019 Amnesty International has visited four different Indigenous territories in Brazil’s Amazon: Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau in Rondônia state, Arara in Pará state, and Manoki in Mato Grosso state.
Experts and Indigenous people interviewed by Amnesty International expressed intense frustration at the lack of enforcement of Brazil’s laws to protect Indigenous territories and environmentally protected areas. They also told Amnesty International that government surveillance operations to monitor and prevent illegal land seizures and deforestation have been reduced because of budget constraints over recent months.
In the four Indigenous territories we visited, the rate of deforestation is almost 80 per cent higher than what it was over the same period in 2018. In some sites, Indigenous community leaders also reported receiving death threats for defending their traditional territories.
An official working for Brazil’s national environmental agency in Rondônia state, who spoke to Amnesty International on the condition of anonymity, explained “If we had had people to conduct inspections, the situation would have not reached this level”.
An indigenous Manoki man, who also spoke to Amnesty International on the condition of anonymity, told us “IBAMA has stopped coming. I don’t know why. We’ve prepared reports, marking the coordinates where illegal logging is taking place and sending them to IBAMA. But now they have stopped [coming]”.
Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) and its main environmental agency (IBAMA) face substantial budget cuts this year. According to government data, FUNAI’s expenses for the protection of Indigenous territories incurred this year until August 28th have fallen 10% over the same period in 2018. International media has reported that IBAMA’s overall budget has shrunk by 25%.
“This is both a human rights crisis and an environmental crisis,” said Kumi Naidoo. “Over the long term, strengthening the civilian authorities responsible for combatting deforestation and illegal land seizures is the only way forward.
“For the sake of the Amazon rainforest, the people who call it home, and the rest of the world that depend on it for our climate’s stability, Brazil must do more to combat illegal land seizures and deforestation.”

0,Does Canada’s new impact assessment legislation protect human rights?,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/womens-human-rights/blog-does-canadas-new-impact-assessment-legislation-protect-human-rights/,"This week, new legislation entered in force overhauling the federal government’s system to assess and approve large-scale resource development projects like mines and dams. How does the new legislation affect human rights? Under the old legislation (the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,...","This week, new legislation entered in force overhauling the federal government’s system to assess and approve large-scale resource development projects like mines and dams. How does the new legislation affect human rights? 
Under the old legislation (the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, or CEAA 2012), there was a list of types of projects that were subject to federal assessment in a process with few opportunities for public input. Harmful environmental impacts of individual projects were assessed, and decisions on whether or how the project would proceed were based on whether the project was likely to create significant adverse environmental impacts. However, an environmental assessment recommendation to halt or proceed with a project could be overturned by the federal cabinet, with little explanation or transparency, if the project was deemed to be in the public interest. This is exactly what happened when cabinet approved the Site C dam. 
Here’s the thing – resource development projects don’t just adversely affect the environment. They also have a significant impact on the human rights of people living in that environment. For example, there is ample evidence that large-scale resource development projects, particularly those dependent on large numbers of temporary workers, can have harmful impacts on women and girls, and on Indigenous women and girls in particular. The impacts range from increased exposure to risks of violence, to decreased access to strained social services. Amnesty International documented many of these impacts in a 2016 report titled “Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Gender, Indigenous Rights and Energy Development in Northeast British Columbia, Canada.” 
Under CEAA 2012, the government of Canada irresponsibly ignored these impacts. At a time when awareness of the human rights crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people was growing, Canada’s environmental assessment process failed to identify and mitigate resource sector-related risks to the safety and security of Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. By doing so, unacceptable risks to the lives of Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people were compounded. 
This is precisely why Amnesty International has long been calling for gender-based analysis to be included in the assessment process for resource development projects. This is why we were a witness before the Senate committee studying Bill C-69, and this is why we made written submissions to the House of Commons and Senate Committees reviewing the bill, and engaged in advocacy alongside partners in support of the legislation. 
Ultimately, this is why we welcomed Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act, which entered into force on August 28. 
The Impact Assessment Act creates an assessment framework that isn’t perfect, but it is much stronger than CEAA 2012. It calls for assessment of the positive and negative impacts of a project on both the environment and the people living near project sites and host communities. Critically, the Act mandates gender-based analysis in the assessment process, ensuring that future assessments will consider how social, economic, health, and environmental impacts may be different for people of different genders. Recognizing that the cumulative impacts of projects in a given region may be greater than the impact of individual project footprints, the Act does include a mechanism for regional cumulative impact assessments.

The Impact Assessment Act has great potential to make a significant positive impact on the human rights of people living in or near resource sector host communities. But, the devil is always in the details. Ministerial discretion to ignore the outcome of assessments, the limited number of projects subject to federal assessment, and unknowns about how meaningful and robust public participation in the assessment process will be once it is rolled out, could severely limit the impact of the legislation. 
Is our job as human rights advocates done now that the new Act has entered into force? No. In fact, in many ways it is just beginning.

Under the old legislation (the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act,...","This week, new legislation entered in force overhauling the federal government’s system to assess and approve large-scale resource development projects like mines and dams. How does the new legislation affect human rights? 
Under the old legislation (the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012, or CEAA 2012), there was a list of types of projects that were subject to federal assessment in a process with few opportunities for public input. Harmful environmental impacts of individual projects were assessed, and decisions on whether or how the project would proceed were based on whether the project was likely to create significant adverse environmental impacts. However, an environmental assessment recommendation to halt or proceed with a project could be overturned by the federal cabinet, with little explanation or transparency, if the project was deemed to be in the public interest. This is exactly what happened when cabinet approved the Site C dam. 
Here’s the thing – resource development projects don’t just adversely affect the environment. They also have a significant impact on the human rights of people living in that environment. For example, there is ample evidence that large-scale resource development projects, particularly those dependent on large numbers of temporary workers, can have harmful impacts on women and girls, and on Indigenous women and girls in particular. The impacts range from increased exposure to risks of violence, to decreased access to strained social services. Amnesty International documented many of these impacts in a 2016 report titled “Out of Sight, Out of Mind: Gender, Indigenous Rights and Energy Development in Northeast British Columbia, Canada.” 
Under CEAA 2012, the government of Canada irresponsibly ignored these impacts. At a time when awareness of the human rights crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people was growing, Canada’s environmental assessment process failed to identify and mitigate resource sector-related risks to the safety and security of Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit people. By doing so, unacceptable risks to the lives of Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people were compounded. 
This is precisely why Amnesty International has long been calling for gender-based analysis to be included in the assessment process for resource development projects. This is why we were a witness before the Senate committee studying Bill C-69, and this is why we made written submissions to the House of Commons and Senate Committees reviewing the bill, and engaged in advocacy alongside partners in support of the legislation. 
Ultimately, this is why we welcomed Bill C-69, the Impact Assessment Act, which entered into force on August 28. 
The Impact Assessment Act creates an assessment framework that isn’t perfect, but it is much stronger than CEAA 2012. It calls for assessment of the positive and negative impacts of a project on both the environment and the people living near project sites and host communities. Critically, the Act mandates gender-based analysis in the assessment process, ensuring that future assessments will consider how social, economic, health, and environmental impacts may be different for people of different genders. Recognizing that the cumulative impacts of projects in a given region may be greater than the impact of individual project footprints, the Act does include a mechanism for regional cumulative impact assessments.

“The ludicrous dawn swoops by police to arrest Agnes Chow and Joshua Wong are an outrageous assault on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 
“This past week, we have seen scare tactics straight out of Beijing’s playbook: pro-democracy protest organizers attacked by thugs, prominent activists arrested after being snatched from their homes and streets, and a major rally planned for Saturday banned.
“The authorities must end this concerted attack on the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly. It is vital that the authorities send a clear message that people in Hong Kong can still enjoy these rights irrespective of their political beliefs.” 
Background 
On Friday morning, police arrested Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow of pro-democracy party Demosisto. Police bundled Joshua Wong into an unmarked van as he walked to a metro station, according to Demosisto. He has been arrested on suspicion of inciting, organizing and taking part in an unlawful assembly, according to media reports.
Agnes Chow was arrested at her home for allegedly inciting and taking part in an unlawful assembly. The charges relate to a protest outside Hong Kong police headquarters on 21 June.
Andy Chan, convener of the Hong Kong National Party, was arrested on Thursday evening at Hong Kong Airport. He is being held on suspicion of rioting and assaulting a police officer. The Hong Kong government prohibited the operation of Hong Kong National Party in September 2018 “in the interests of national security” and public safety. 
On Thursday, Jimmy Sham, the organizer of the recent large-scale peaceful pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, was attacked by masked men wielding a baseball bat and a large knife.
Police have banned a major rally planned for Saturday, which marks the fifth anniversary of Beijing rejecting genuine universal suffrage for the election of Hong Kong’s leader. An appeal by protest organizers against the ban was rejected on Friday.

With the release of our new report, “I Don’t...","Whether we asked about the possibility of going home to Myanmar or the challenges of life in Bangladesh, every Rohingya – old or young – who our Amnesty International delegation interviewed in the refugee camps said the same thing: human rights. 
With the release of our new report, “I Don’t Know What My Future Will Be”, Rohingya Refugees in Bangladesh, Amnesty International is echoing that call and looking to the governments of Myanmar and Bangladesh, with strong backing and resources from the international community, to ensure that violations end, past abuses are addressed and that the human rights of Rohingya, on both sides of the border, are fully respected and upheld.  
It is a time for solidarity and for action.  There will be many opportunities for Amnesty International supporters to take action and demonstrate that solidarity over the coming weeks and months. 
When Amnesty International was in Bangladesh in February of this year, it had been 18 months since the outbreak of the most recent campaign by Myanmar security forces in Rohingya communities in Rakhine State, marked by mass atrocities, including killings, rape, destruction of villages and forced displacement.  The scale and cruelty of the abuses was staggering. A UN Fact-Finding Mission has concluded that it points to an intention to commit genocide on the part of the Myanmar military.  
As they have too many times in the past, Rohingya communities were uprooted and forced to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh. The numbers were unprecedented.  700,000 refugees arrived in Bangladesh during the last few months of 2017, bringing the total number of Rohingya sheltering in the country to around one million.  Bangladesh has rightly been commended for the welcome.  In today’s world there are, undoubtedly, many other countries that would have closed their border. 
Soyed Alom, a 60 year-old Rohingya refugee who lives in Cox’s Bazar 
At the same time, the Bangladeshi government has made it clear that they hope and expect refugees to return to Myanmar – where there has yet to be changes that would guarantee safety and equality for the Rohingya – in the very near future.  Asked what it would take to encourage him to go back, 60 year-old Soyed Alom put it simply, “when our rights are protected”.  That includes, as a baseline, being recognized as full citizens. 
Meanwhile, life in the refugee camps is difficult.  Much of that stems from how crowded the living conditions are.  Refugees are confined to a limited area in SE Bangladesh, where the environment was already fragile before the influx.  Shelters are exceptionally small, virtually on top of each other, and the building materials in many instances are not up to the elements when monsoon season hits.  But there has been reluctance to open up more land and to allow more permanent, sturdy homes, as the Bangladesh government worries that signifies refugees are there to stay. The toll of overcrowding and lack of privacy is clear, leading to stress, depression and health concerns. 
Perhaps no other issue, however, frames the consequences of Bangladesh’s determination to restrict rights in the camps as a means of discouraging refugees from staying, than the denial of education to Rohingya children and youth.  Around one-half of the refugee population are under the age of eighteen.  Yet they have no access to official, accredited schools, following a recognized curriculum.  Quite the contrary, the Bangladesh government has repeatedly refused to allow formal schools to be built in the camps and, earlier this year, barred the small number of Rohingya students who had managed to enroll in local Bangladeshi schools from continuing with their education.  Again the government’s fear is that setting up schools will encourage refugees to stay, rather than return soon to Myanmar. 
But access to education is not a bargaining chip; it is a human right, enshrined in numerous international human rights treaties.  It is also the source of hope, possibilities and a promising future for Rohingya children and youth.  Instead, young people in the refugee camps talked to us of despair.  
Bibi, a 15 year old Rohingya refugee who lives in Cox’s Bazar 
Fifteen year-old Bibi talked of her dream to become a doctor, because she want to help her society, country and people.  She asked, “education for all, why not for refugees?”  
Sixteen year-old Saeed said he, “begins every day hoping that it might be different than other days and something might change. But then it turns out to be like every day. There are no classes to attend and nothing to do.”  “How long can this go on”, he wondered. 
Meanwhile fear mounts every time that Bangladesh and Myanmar signal that they are ready to begin conducting so-called “voluntary” repatriation.  All those refugees who were summoned for repatriation earlier this month made it clear that they do not consider it safe and are not prepared to go home. 
Saeed, a 16 year old Rohingya refugee who lives in Cox’s Bazar 
Bangladesh is also looking at options for transferring refugees out of the Cox’s Bazar area and has invested considerable money, with apparent backing from the Chinese government, in developing a low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal, with plans to initially accommodate 100,000 refugees.  The island, Bhashan Char, is prone to flooding during monsoon season and would leave refugees isolated and essentially imprisoned offshore.  Most refugees Amnesty International interviewed made it clear that they would choose return to Myanmar over being forcibly transferred to Bhashan Char. 
Just last week in refugee camps across Bangladesh and in rallies and demonstrations around the world, Rohingya marked the second anniversary of the atrocities unleashed in Myanmar in August 2017.  It was abundantly clear that there has been virtually no progress in pursuing justice and accountability for the terrible crimes that were committed and that basic reforms to grant citizenship and ensure equal rights for Rohingya in Myanmar have gone nowhere. 
We cannot and will not relent in the campaign for justice, accountability and human rights in Myanmar. 
At the same time, it is abundantly clear that refugees in Bangladesh will not be able to return home anytime soon.  It is time to move beyond an emergency response phase focused only on the basic needs of refugees.  It is time for an approach that instead focuses on ensuring that the rights of Rohingya refugees – including education, healthcare, adequate housing, livelihoods and freedom of movement – are upheld and respected. 
Mohammed, a Rohingya refugee who lives in Cox’s Bazar 
When he was forced to stop attending computer classes at a local technical school earlier this year, Mohammed joined with a small group of friends in establishing a refugee rights group.  It was clear to him that his rights were being denied, “just because I am Rohingya and just because I am a refugee.”  
Join us, in solidarity with Mohammed, Bib, Saeed and Soyed, in pressing for the human rights of Rohingya refugees to be fully protected.  Their hope and dream of returning home remains strong. So must protection of their rights.

Two years after a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign forced around 700,000 Rohingya to flee Myanmar for Bangladesh, refugees are still trapped in unbearable conditions in overcrowded camps, Amnesty International said in a new briefing.
“I don’t know what my future will be”: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh warns that a ‘lost generation’ of Rohingya children are being systematically denied an education in Bangladesh, and documents the sense of hopelessness and uncertainty expressed by many teachers, parents and young people in the camps.
Amnesty International is calling on the Bangladeshi government to lift restrictions that limit the enjoyment of refugees’ rights. The organization also calls on the international community to support Bangladesh in pursuing longer-term solutions to help Rohingya refugees rebuild their lives.
“There is a very real danger of a lost generation of Rohingya refugee children. The Bangladesh government refuses to accept that Rohingya refugees may not be able to return to Myanmar for some time and places restrictions on their lives, including denying children the right to quality education. Even those who have lived in Bangladesh for decades still cannot send their children to school or move around freely,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director at Amnesty International.
“Many people we spoke to had spent nearly two years in makeshift shelters which offer no protection from monsoon floods or soaring temperatures. As well as the daily challenges created by the difficult conditions in the camps, people are being pushed to breaking point by the lack of opportunities and uncertainty about the future,” said Biraj Patnaik.
With the situation for Rohingya in Myanmar still dire, Amnesty International is calling on the Bangladesh government to look beyond emergency measures and develop a long-term response to respect and protect the rights of refugees.
Amnesty International researchers travelled to Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, between 11 and 24 February 2019 and spoke to 97 refugees in nine camps.
No school for Rohingya children
It is estimated that nearly half of the roughly one million Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh are under the age of eighteen. Most fled from Myanmar with their families in the aftermath of the wave of violent attacks against their villages that began in late August 2017, and have been in Bangladesh for around two years. Others were born in Bangladesh.
Opportunities for education in Bangladesh have always been extremely limited for Rohingya children, both with respect to the education facilities that have been allowed to operate in the camps and permission for registered Rohingya students to attend local Bangladeshi schools.
In January 2019, the Bangladeshi government issued a notice that secondary schools near Cox’s Bazar were to expel their Rohingya students, who were listed by name. Mohamed, living in Nayapara Camp, described his daughter’s devastation at this development.
“She enjoyed going to school and was learning so much. I encouraged her to keep studying. It is so important that daughters get the same opportunities for education as our sons do. And when they said the Rohingya children could not go to school any more she came home in tears.”     
The Bangladesh government maintains that offering comprehensive education would encourage refugees to remain in Bangladesh rather than return to Myanmar. Other than “child friendly spaces” and learning centres that offer playtime and early primary school lessons, education for Rohingya refugees in the camps or in local schools nearby is prohibited by the Bangladeshi government.
This is a stark violation of one of the most crucial of these children’s’ human rights – the right to education – and will have untold consequences for their futures. Young people in the camps described feeling hopeless about the future.
Saeed, a 17-year-old living in Bukhali Camp, said:
“I begin every day hoping that it might be different than other days and that something might change. But then it turns out to be like every day. There are no classes to attend and nothing to do. How long can this go on?”
‘Sometimes it feels like a small corner of hell’
While refugees said they were grateful to the Bangladesh government, host communities and international organizations for the support provided, their concerns about inadequate living conditions in the camps were evident and well-founded.
Because Rohingya are not allowed to work in Bangladesh, almost everyone Amnesty International interviewed was entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance for their daily survival. Yet, Amnesty International found that in the most basic aspects of humanitarian assistance – shelter, water, sanitation, health and food – the response in Bangladesh is falling short. Refugees spoke of challenges accessing clean drinking water, latrines, safe cooking facilities as well as the insufficient food diversity under the present food distribution system.
Kobir, living in Jamtoli Camp, said:
“It is of course good that we are safe. But there is so much emotional and psychological stress for us here. Sometimes it feels like a small corner of hell. Everywhere is dirty. Our houses are unbearably hot. The roofs leak. Our water pumps and toilets are right on top of where we eat and sleep. And we don’t even know what to do about burying our dead. We cannot go on living like this.”
Restricted lives
Some of these challenges are inevitable given the size of the camps and the time it will take to upgrade facilities. However, the Bangladesh government’s focus on encouraging returns to Myanmar or relocating refugees has led to short-sighted policies which keep people in limbo for years, under emergency humanitarian measures which are supposed to be temporary. For example, refugees remain consigned to temporary shelters that leak during the monsoon season, are too hot and provide limited ventilation, because of limitations the Bangladesh government has placed on the materials refugees can use to build homes.
Overcrowding is a major problem – with entire extended families often sharing a single room – and there are serious concerns about sanitation. Refugees reported that drinking water is frequently contaminated and pumps are hard to access.
Refugees also explained how restrictions on their freedom of movement have impeded their ability to seek health care outside the camps – only basic services are available in the camp. Some said they had been asked to pay bribes to obtain permission to leave the camps.
Plans for relocation to Bhashan Char
Current proposals to address the situation for Rohingya refugees, such as relocating up to 100,000 people to Bhashan Char, an uninhabited low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal, pose significant human rights risks and will likely leave refugees more isolated and vulnerable.
Bhashan Char is a 39 square kilometre silt island that has never been inhabited by people and is vulnerable to flooding and other extreme weather situations. The Bangladesh government has repeatedly announced plans to relocate up to 100,000 Rohingya refugees there in 2019.
One refugee in Kutupalong told Amnesty International, “There have never been humans who have lived there, so why would they send us there – because they think we are less human? We do not want to move anywhere else again until we can safely go home.”
“It is essential that any relocation should not isolate or segregate refugees or further restrict their rights,” said Biraj Patnaik.
“Proposals to relocate Rohingya to Bhashan Char pose serious human rights risks. The island is extremely vulnerable to climate change and is a three-hour boat ride from the mainland. Its isolation is likely to create further barriers to freedom of movement and access to education, health services and legal assistance.”  
A role for Canada
Canada’s role to-date in addressing the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh has been supportive of improving living conditions in the camps and to consider possible resettlement of refugees in Canada, but fuller action is now urgently required.
“The Canadian government has repeatedly stated that it is a priority to provide greater assistance to Bangladesh and has put in place programs and provided resources that will better protect the rights of Rohingya refugees in the country,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, who was part of the Amnesty International research delegation to the refugee camps in February 2019.
“This new Amnesty International advocacy paper highlights that Canada’s efforts to assist Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh must now shift to a longer-term view within a comprehensive human rights framework. Working with the Bangladesh government on an urgent basis to lift restrictions and ensure that Rohingya children and youth in the country’s refugee camps have access to quality and appropriate education is one obvious area where Canada could and should take a lead role.”
In his April 2018 report, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Special Envoy to Myanmar, Bob Rae, urged that Canada make a substantial and sustained commitment to responding to the needs of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Mr. Rae further recommended that “Canada and other countries should also explore avenues to allow the Rohingya to be eligible to apply for refugee status and resettlement, including in Canada.” In response, Canada’s May 2018 Strategy to Respond to the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh committed to “help improve the living conditions for Rohingya refugees in camps and settlements” as well as to “work toward building support for the resettlement of Rohingya refugees to Canada and other countries.” 
“It is also time to seriously take up Bob Rae’s call for Canada to initiate efforts to resettle Rohingya refugees and encourage other governments to follow that lead. A resettlement program that includes a focus on providing meaningful education opportunities for Rohingya youth would demonstrate a greater willingness to share the responsibility of protecting refugees while also helping address the deepening concerns about access to education for Rohingya refugees.”
Conclusion
Amnesty International highlighted the urgent need to develop longer term plans and strategies which are firmly embedded in human rights protection.
This must include allowing refugees freedom of movement, adequate housing, and access to health care and education. In addition, refugees must have opportunities to seek long term protection, in line with international law.
Amnesty International is also calling on the international donor community to genuinely share responsibility with Bangladesh. Governments must significantly increase and sustain financial and technical assistance to help respond to the needs of the Rohingya refugee population in the country.
“The Rohingya people have been systematically denied their human rights for generations. Now that many are, temporarily at least, safe from the killing and attacks which they fled, it’s high time their needs as human beings were taken seriously,” said Biraj Patnaik.
“The Bangladesh government and international community need to understand that Rohingya want more than just to survive. They must take measures to help this traumatized population live fulfilling, dignified lives where they have access to the same rights and opportunities as everyone else.”

“These reports that hundreds of internally displaced Iraqis are being loaded onto buses and taken to Hawija are extremely disturbing – much of the city is in ruins. Many of these people don’t have homes to go back to, and will struggle to access essential services such as health care and schooling and may not afford access to water and electricity. Until the government has established a framework to ensure their safe, voluntary return, the Iraqi government must refrain from sending anyone back. 
“These returns are clearly premature. In addition to the extensive destruction, lack of adequate infrastructure and services, there are other serious obstacles to consider. In recent years, families returning to their place of origin have been exposed to a catalogue of abuse including evictions, arrests, looting, sexual abuse, and discrimination. We also have evidence that displaced families, especially those with perceived ties to the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS), are routinely blocked from obtaining new or replacement identity cards. As a result, many – sometimes entire families – are missing vital civil status documents without which they can’t work or move freely.
“The Iraqi authorities have always assured Amnesty International that any returns they carry out are voluntary; this sudden change in policy is worrisome and is contrary to international human rights law and standards, as well as to international humanitarian law. We urge the authorities to immediately halt these forced returns.”

“We urge the Lebanese authorities to stop these deportations as a matter of urgency, and the Higher Defense Council to cancel its related decision.
“As long as independent monitoring bodies are not allowed access to Syria – including the UN Commission of Inquiry on Syria – in order to assess the security situation for the safe return of refugees, there is no way of determining whether returnees would be at real risk of serious human rights violations once back in Syria.
“Such access and monitoring mechanism inside Syria would be a first step in setting the process for returns. In the meantime, while risks upon return cannot be determined, any attempts to forcibly return refugees is a clear violation of Lebanon’s non-refoulement obligations.
“We reiterate our call to the international community to share the responsibility for refugees with host countries, including Lebanon, mainly by re-activating their resettlement programs and by using their leverage to call for access to independent monitors in Syria.”
Background
On 13 May 2019, the General Security Organization in Lebanon started implementing the decision taken by Higher Defense Council, an inter-ministerial body in charge of national defense policy and headed by the President of the Republic, to start deporting refugees who entered Lebanon “illegally” after the date of 24 April 2019. Between then and 9 August 2019, according to the General Security and Minister of Presidential Affairs data, communicated in an official correspondence with Amnesty International, 2,447 Syrians had been deported to Syria.
As of 31 July 2019 there were 926,717 Syrian refugees in Lebanon registered with UNHCR and 31,000 Palestinian refugees from Syria registered with the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). In addition, the Lebanese government claims that around 550,000 live in Lebanon unregistered.

Summit talks about the climate crisis and gender equality undermined by heavy-handed restrictions on protest movements who helped get these issues on the agenda
Spokespeople available on the ground  
The G7 meeting in Biarritz has been marred by an unjustifiable crackdown on freedom of assembly and movement, Amnesty International said today.
Authorities also prevented a number of peaceful protests organized around the Summit in cities and areas close to Biarritz, with only two demonstrations allowed to proceed.
“From the beginning of this G7 Summit in Biarritz, it was clear that the French authorities had a plan to restrict freedom of assembly and movement, with the announced presence of more than 13,000 police to man the area.” said Marco Perolini, Amnesty International’s France Researcher.
“It is scandalous that hundreds of people were kettled for hours for no reasons whatsoever and before even starting their peaceful protest.
“It is also sadly ironic to see that many points of the agenda for the G7, like the climate crisis and gender equality, were there because of the pressure exercised by the civil society, and that the French authorities felt they had to undermine this very same civil society’s right to peacefully demonstrate during these three days. It undermines all the talk at the summit.”
Restriction of freedom of assembly
Exceptional security measures have been put in place in cities such as Bayonne, about 8km from Biarritz, and the whole of Biarritz city itself, to prevent people from gathering to exercise their freedom of assembly.
On Saturday afternoon, authorities deployed hundreds of police officers to Bayonne and erected four-metre-high fences on all four bridges, completely dividing the city into two. Amnesty International’s observers were stopped and searched six times in about two hours in the area.
Authorities had issued an order establishing a security area covering the city centre where everyone could be subjected to stop and searches. A few hundred protesters, as well as journalists, observers and residents alike, were blocked for about five hours. The police only allowed them to leave late in the evening.
Police also kettled about 50 peaceful protesters who attempted to gather on a parking lot in Bidart, 8 km from Biarritz, on Sunday 25 August. This was well outside the security area within which heads of state were gathering. The organisation’s observers were also affected by the incident, which took over two hours, without the possibility to leave.
When Amnesty International’s staff showed a letter to the police detailing their observation mission, they were told that the exercise was with a view to conduct identity checks even though the delegates nor anyone else were asked to produce the necessary documentation.
Around 100 protesters arrested
Despite the fact that only very few violent incidents were observed during the three days, about 100 people were arrested between 23 and 25 August, with about 70 of them placed in pre-charge detention with some trials expected to start today. Among them, three women observers from the French Human Rights League were arrested and placed in pre-charge detention on 24 August, after detection of protection materials. They were finally released on Sunday 25 August.
This led the organizers of the G7 “counter-summit” to cancel several peaceful actions that had been planned on 25 August, following the heavy security measures and the arrest of one of their members on 24 August. The protesters could only organize a peaceful demonstration on Saturday 24 August in Hendaye, over 30 kilometres from the G7 summit in Biarritz.
“French authorities must stop treating the right to protest with contempt. Unless the protesters have been involved in violent acts, they must be freed immediately and unconditionally,” said Marco Perolini.
“Exercising one’s freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly is not a crime, but a fundamental human right.”

The Cameroonian authorities must leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of justice for two women and two children who were brutally murdered by the military, Amnesty International said today. Seven soldiers allegedly caught on video carrying out the killings are set to go on trial tomorrow.
When the video went viral in early July 2018, Cameroonian authorities initially dismissed it as “fake news”. But Amnesty International revealed credible evidence that the Cameroon military was responsible, and the authorities later announced that the seven soldiers depicted in the video had been arrested and would be prosecuted. The seven are due to appear on 27 August before a military court in the capital Yaoundé on charges of joint participation in murder, breach of regulations and conspiracy.
“This horrifying video shone a spotlight on the way civilians in Cameroon’s Far North have been ensnared in atrocities amid the fight against Boko Haram. Security forces who are supposed to be protecting people have instead carried out arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial executions,” said Samira Daoud, Amnesty International’s West and Central Africa Deputy Regional Director.
“The Cameroonian authorities must draw a line and ensure no army personnel responsible for atrocities will escape from prosecutions. Tomorrow’s trial is a first step towards justice and reparations for victims and their loved ones. Authorities must also ensure that all those reasonably suspected of crimes against civilians are brought to justice in fair trials before civilian courts.”
Amnesty International experts analyzed the video of soldiers shooting dead two women and their two children as soon as it went viral in July 2018. Relying on multiple strands of evidence – including expert analysis of the uniforms and weapons used, and linguistic and other contextual clues in speech that gave away the identities and ranks of the soldiers – within days the organization was able to begin to build a case to counter the official narrative. The evidence strongly suggested that Cameroonian soldiers were the ones extrajudicially executing civilians in the video.
Subsequent research by Amnesty International bore this out, and a community of open source investigators collaborating on the case pin-pointed the exact location near the town of Zelevet, and narrowed down the date to late March or early April 2015.  The case was immortalized by the September 2018 BBC Africa Eye documentary “Anatomy of a Killing”.
While playing an important role in defending people threatened by Boko Haram, the Cameroonian security forces’ response has too often been heavy-handed and rife with human rights violations. Amnesty International is calling on authorities to bring all those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in fair trials, before ordinary civilian courts and without recourse to death penalty.

The socio-economic conditions of many Zimbabweans have also declined over the past 12 months. The weak economy has seen fuel prices skyrocket and high inflation push the prices of basic commodities such as bread through the roof as well as eroding people’s salaries.
“What we have witnessed in Zimbabwe since President Emmerson Mnangagwa took power is a ruthless attack on human rights, with the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association increasingly restricted and criminalized,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Southern Africa.
“The authorities have shown blatant contempt for basic freedoms and they have demonstrated that there is no space for dissent in the so-called “new dispensation”. Time and again they have resorted to the same brutal tactics that were used by President Mnangagwa’s predecessor Robert Mugabe to clampdown on human rights.”
Crackdown on protests
Just last week, baton-wielding police mounted a vicious assault on peaceful protesters who gathered in Harare in anticipation of the “16 August” national protests against deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the country. Scores of people were left injured following the crackdown. On Thursday 15 August before the march, Zimbabwean police announced they were banning the protests through a press statement, saying the demonstrations would turn violent. After the aborted protest, about 128 activists were arrested and placed on remand. Other protests that were planned to take place in four other cities around the country were also banned and some activists arrested.
At the start of the year, Amnesty International documented at least 15 killings by police when nationwide protests erupted on 14 January, sparked by the announcement of fuel price hikes. The state carried out mass arrests which saw hundreds of people being arrested on charges including public violence. By the end of April, close to 400 people were convicted by the courts, with most of them through hastily conducted trials.
During the protests, the police used lethal and excessive force such as tear gas, batons, water cannons and live ammunition. They also launched a house-to-house hunt to track down and silence the organizers of the protest and other prominent civil society leaders and activists. Some of those arrested – including Evan Mawarire, a well-known local cleric and activist, and trade union leader Peter Mutasa – still face trumped-up treason charges in connection with the protests. The state has charged an unprecedented number of 22 people with subverting a constitutional government in relation to the protests.
The pursuit of those perceived to be linked to protest movements continued throughout the year. In May, seven human rights defenders were arrested at Robert Mugabe International Airport as they returned from a capacity-building workshop on non-violent protest tactics in the Maldives. The activists, Stabile Dewah, George Makoni, Tatenda Mombeyarara, Gamuchirai Mukura, Nyasha Mpahlo, Farirai Gumbonzvanda and Rita Nyamupinga were accused of “plotting to overthrow President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government”. They are yet to face trial.
Abductions and torture of human rights activists to silence them from freely expressing themselves continue. On 21 August, comedian Samantha Kureya was abducted by masked men from her house and tortured after publishing a skit on police brutality.
“In his first year in office, President Mnangagwa’s government has demonstrated little observance of human rights and adherence to the rule of law, continuing the trend that we saw under Robert Mugabe,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
“As he enters his second year in office, the president has the opportunity to start on a fresh slate by immediately taking steps to ensure that his government ends the escalating attacks on human rights and impunity for human rights violations. We urge him to build a Zimbabwe that has a culture of respect for the human rights of everyone.”
Background
President Emmerson Mnangagwa was sworn into office on 26 August 2018 following the election on 30 July 2018 that saw his ZANU-PF party claiming victory. The vote combined presidential, parliamentary and local government elections.

“For the 22nd day in a row, life has been derailed for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. The communication blockade and security clampdown, the alleged detention of political leaders and restrictions on media to report has created an information black hole in Jammu and Kashmir, a region which has witnessed serious human rights violations in the past. Depriving an entire population of their right to freedom of expression, opinion and movement for an indefinite period runs squarely counter to international norms and standards. Worse, it gives the Government of India a near-total control over the information coming out of the region,” said Aakar Patel, head of Amnesty International India.
In the aftermath of the unilateral revocation of Article 370 of the Indian Constitution that guaranteed special status to Jammu and Kashmir by the Government of India, authorities have allegedly detained many political leaders including former Jammu and Kashmir chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti; former bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal and Ravinder Sharma amongst others. No official information is available on the number of people detained, their access to lawyer or their family members, where they are being held and under what charges, if any. In its earlier reports and briefings, Amnesty International India had documented the use of administrative detention, where a person is held without a charge or trial, by the authorities in the region to curb political mobilisation. These detentions not only violate international law but clearly indicate the stifling of freedom of expression in the region.
Amnesty International India is also concerned about the wider human rights impact of the communication clampdown. While access to information to the people of Jammu and Kashmir remains hindered in times of crises, their access to emergency services, and other information and services, including healthcare and education also remains highly restricted. Further, the unlimited clampdown also hampers the government from circulating information to communities about the ongoing protests which could be vital for the safety and protection of the local population of Jammu and Kashmir. While Landline telephones were partially restored over 17-18 August, unsurprisingly, their redundancy and sketchy availability in the region has not helped in facilitating communication, with access remaining limited outside Srinagar.
The clampdown has also restricted journalists and activists from documenting and sharing information about the situation in the region, including allegations of human rights abuses. The local media websites of the region remain last updated on 5 August and print version of the newspapers have not been carrying editorial opinions. Besides hindering the public’s right to know, it also puts the lives of journalists at risk, increasing their chances of being harassed, arrested on politically motivated charges and prosecuted in connection with their work. On a broader level, this has led to the public sphere being largely drained of the opinions of the people from Jammu and Kashmir who are the direct and foremost beneficiaries of the constitutional changes brought in by the Government of India.
The UN Human Rights Council has called the Government of India to end this crackdown terming it as a “form of collective punishment” for the people of Jammu and Kashmir “inconsistent with the fundamental norms of necessity and proportionality”. The UN Special Rapporteurs and Working Groups have also raised their grave concerns about “allegations that the whereabouts of some of those detained is not known as well as the general heightened risk of enforced disappearances, which may proliferate against the backdrop of mass arrests and restricted access to the internet and other communications networks”.
Between 5 and 21 August, 152 people were admitted to Srinagar’s Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) and Shri Maharaj Hari Singh hospital with injuries from pellet shots and tear gas fire, according to data acquired by Reuters news agency. However, with the communication clampdown, the number of casualties remain difficult to ascertain.
“This turns the fear of human rights violations that may occur yet remain unreported into a reality which only stands to perpetuate impunity and diminish accountability in Jammu and Kashmir – a culture the Government of India continues to extend in spite of its promises of development and change,” said Aakar Patel.

0,Carding and anti-Black racism in Canada,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/carding-and-anti-black-racism-in-canada/,"It has long been recognized that the Canadian justice system is fraught with racism that disproportionately impacts Black people and communities across the country, resulting in racial profiling, harsher sentencing, mistreatment in prison, denial of services, and other injustices which can be...","It has long been recognized that the Canadian justice system is fraught with racism that disproportionately impacts Black people and communities across the country, resulting in racial profiling, harsher sentencing, mistreatment in prison, denial of services, and other injustices which can be compounded for people with intersecting identities (e.g. Black Muslims, Black LGBTQ2S folks, etc.)The way that racism is institutionalized in the justice system, as well as in broader society, is connected to Canada’s long, sordid legacy of perpetrating anti-Black racism throughout history with enslavement, exclusionary immigration, and more.  
One form of racial discrimination that has taken the spotlight in policy discourse and media in recent years, is the issue of carding — or police street checks — when police officers stop, question, and document individuals without any evidence that they have been involved in, or have any knowledge of, an offence. Bias and stereotyping play into the officers’ decisions of who to stop and why, which affects many racialized groups, but especially Black people. Carding can often be the first point of contact that can lead to further mistreatment, violence, and racism within other segments of the justice system as well as negative mental and physiological health outcomes.   
The stats on police racism are enraging, but not surprising. The Ontario Human Rights Commission interim report on anti-Black racism in policing states that Black people in Toronto are up to 20 times more likely to be shot dead by police than white people. If you’re Black in Halifax, you are six times more likely to be carded by police, compared to white counterparts. In Vancouver, a comprehensive third-party review of police data is currently underway, but statistics currently show thatin 2017, 5 per cent of street checks involved Black individuals, who make up only 1 per cent of the city’s population. Ottawa is no different, where Black drivers are stopped 2.3 times more than the dominant population. And despite sharing stats from just four cities, anti-Black racism in policing is undoubtedly present in all other regions of the country due to institutionalized racism where deliberate structures of oppression and white supremacy are deeply embedded within all levels of the justice system.   
Canada is on the radar of international human rights bodies for its neglect of dealing with racial discrimination in policing as well.  The United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent has raised alarms about systemic racism within Canada’s justice system, including specific concerns on how carding disproportionately impacts Black people. And, the 2018 United Nations Universal Periodic Review for Canada – which includes recommendations from 107 countries –highlighted discrimination against Black Canadians as an issue of concern.  
So what can be done to stop carding once and for all? Canadian Federal, Provincial and Territorial governments can take measures to ensure this racist practice is put to an end.  Legislating a ban of this nature isn’t easy. It requires cooperation across governments, commitment from police boards and unions, and true accountability. We need legislation with teeth and not just empty words as we’ve seen happen with Ontario’s 2017 supposed ban on carding, which unfortunately still lets police get away with racist street checks, with loopholes in the language and no clear monitoring or accountability in place, not to mention an uncooperative provincial government that seeks to hold back progress.   
We’re long overdue in joining this conversation to advocate for a true and effective solution. Racism in policing violates many rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including Article 3 on life, liberty and security of person, Article 7 on equal protection without discrimination before the law, Article 9 on arbitrary detention, arrest, or exile, Article 13 on freedom of movement, and the list goes on.  
To get involved in speaking up against carding and other forms of anti-Black racism in policing, you can ask your local political candidates what they are prepared to do to address anti-Black racism in your own community.

The conflict between the people Hong Kong and their government has become increasingly alarming to watch. While no one wants to imagine an ongoing human rights crisis, there is already cause for grave concern. Amnesty International has repeatedly documented police abuses against protesters, including unlawful use of tear gas and rubber bullets. As hundreds of thousands of protesters continue to flood the streets, the world watches and wonders if various frightening and violent scenarios are forthcoming. Might Hong Kong conduct mass arrests? Might China intervene and take repressive action? Will refugees begin to flee from Hong Kong?
If so, will Canada be ready to step up and offer safety? We very much need to prepare.

“The responsibility to stop the wildfires that have been raging in the Amazon rainforest for several weeks now lies squarely with President Bolsonaro and his government. They must change their disastrous policy of opening up the rainforest for destruction, which is what has paved the way for this current crisis.
“Earlier this year Amnesty International documented illegal land invasions and arson attacks near Indigenous territories in the Amazon, including Rondônia state where many of the fires are raging.
“Deforestation in the territories Amnesty visited has doubled this year compared to the same time period in 2018 because of illegal invaders who are felling trees, starting forest fires and attacking Indigenous communities living there.
“Despite this, President Bolsonaro has deliberately sought to weaken protections of the rainforest and undermine the rights of the one million Indigenous Peoples who live there. 
“Now that the city of São Paulo, thousands of kilometres away from the Amazon, has been shrouded in darkness from the resulting smoke plume, the President has tried to smear NGOs with the slander that they started the fires.
“Instead of spreading outrageous lies or denying the scale of deforestation taking place, we urge the President to take immediate action to halt the progress of these fires. This is essential to protect people’s right to a healthy environment, as well as their right to health given the impact on air quality over wide swathes of Brazil and neighbouring countries.
“And for the rest of the world wondering what they can do to protect the Amazon, campaigning for the protection of the human rights of Indigenous Peoples is key to preventing further deforestation.
“We must stand together behind the Indigenous communities and leaders across the Amazon region – from Brazil to Ecuador and beyond. For them the Amazon is more than the lungs of the world, it is their home.
