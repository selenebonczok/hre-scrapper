The position was first announced to great fanfare 15 months ago, but sat vacant until Calgary lawyer Sheri Meyerhoffer was appointed. Unfortunately, we have learned that the Ombudsperson’s mandate and powers are much weaker than promised. 
The most startling difference is that the Ombudsperson is not currently imbued with investigatory powers such as the ability to compel documents and testimony from parties to complaints. In order for the Ombudsperson to be effective and to prevent future human rights abuses in the context of Canadian extractives and garment projects, the office must have these powers. 
The government has ordered a review of the options for providing the Ombudsperson with these powers even though it has had 15 months since the post was first announced to do so. We don’t need more studies: we need a watchdog with teeth!  
It is urgent that we act now!  
Over the next 4 weeks, please join us in calling on Minister Carr to grant the Ombudsperson the powers she needs to independently investigate complaints, compel documents and testimony, and make recommendations designed to provide human rights abuse victims with the remedies they seek.

But urgent action is needed to ensure that this historic opportunity isn’t lost. 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada called the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples “the framework for reconciliation.” Last year, the House of Commons passed Bill C-262, a private members bill requiring the federal government to finally move ahead with the work of implementing the Declaration. 
Good news: On May 16, the Senate voted to move the Bill to Committee for study. This is the next step on the path to a final vote. Public support for the Declaration and Bill C-262 is clearly having an effect. Thank you to everyone who has sent emails or made phone calls!  
Unfortunately, however, passage of the Bill is still far from certain. Time is running out in this session of Parliament. And private members bills are particularly vulnerable to delaying tactics. If Bill C-262 isn’t passed by the Senate before this session of Parliament concludes, this crucial opportunity to advance the work of reconciliation will be lost. 
Fortunately, political will to adopt Bill C-262 has been demonstrated across party lines. In fact, after Bill C-262 was stalled in the Senate in April, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer joined in a unanimous motion urging the Senate to pass the Bill into law. We are urging Andrew Scheer to continue exercising his leadership to help ensure the Bill is brought to a final vote. 
 
This action will be updated frequently as the deadline for passing Bill C-262 draws nearer.

Yet, they face unprecedented attacks and killings in return. Indigenous people and racial minorities experience the greatest danger, while women defenders face gender-specific forms of aggression including sexual violence and threats against their children. 
It’s a terrifying situation, emblemized by the murder of Lenca Indigenous water defender, Berta Cáceres in Honduras. But the killing of Berta is no isolated case. The toll of earth defenders lost to deadly violence continues to grow in Honduras, Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and other countries in Latin America. It’s the most deadly region in the world to speak out about irresponsible logging, mining and dam projects that threaten the environment on which so many depend.  
Despite the danger, earth defenders and their communities throughout Latin America are not giving up. There is too much on the line. They continue to speak out in defence of environmental human rights and to seek solidarity in countries like ours. 
“When Canadians speak up from wherever you are, this is so important,” said Bertha Isabel, daughter of Berta Cáceres, when we spoke to her in Honduras.

When a disaster happens, the world watches to see how governments react and tend to the needs of people who were harmed. In the case of the Mount Polley mine disaster Canada’s ongoing reluctance to hold those responsible to account sends a devastating message that authorities aren’t willing to put people and the environment before profit. It signals that companies, like Imperial Metals, will be rewarded with new permits, tax breaks such as hydro rate deferrals, and permit amendments, regardless of whether they respect human rights, the rights of Indigenous peoples, or clean up their pollution.

We need the bravery to speak out, to support threatened communities, to build a society based on equality, compassion and unity.

We need the bravery to speak out, to support threatened communities, to build a society based on equality, compassion and unity. 
It’s been inspiring to see how many people have channelled their love and hope towards our grieving Muslim whānau these past weeks. New Zealanders have flatly rejected the Christchurch gunman’s hate-filled ideology. But as powerful as this national outpouring of solidarity has been, it’s not enough on its own. 
Christchurch did not happen in a vacuum. The atrocity was at least partly the result of a creeping normalisation of white supremacist ideology and the rise of openly Islamophobic world leaders, a devastating reminder that bigotry still simmers below the surface. If we’re serious about solidarity, we need to redouble our efforts to challenge racism and bigotry wherever we see them. Here are some steps you can take: 
Listen to people who experience racism 
Discrimination isn’t always obvious – it can be subtle and insidious, disguised as jokes or political opinions. Talking to people who’ve experienced racism is the best way to increase your understanding of the issue. Even if we can’t walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, we can certainly do more listening. The more we hear, the more our frame of reference shifts, so we can start noticing all those things that build up to make people feel excluded. 
Lean in to awkward conversations 
Responding to misguided opinions, whether they come from friends, relatives or strangers, can be a minefield. Calling someone out on their views is awkward at best and scary at worst. On the one hand, you want to say something, but doing so can lead to an argument, without actually convincing them of anything. 
But it is possible to change people’s minds, especially if you’re clever about communication. The Christchurch attacks have created an invitation for us to join conversations that are uncomfortable about race and religion that we’ve needed to have for a long time – join them. 
Keep your cool 
It’s hard to be polite when someone’s spouting offensive comments, but ask yourself what you can achieve by losing your temper. Embarrassing someone by lecturing them or making loud accusations is probably going to make them defensive and shut down the conversation. Keep your cool – this might mean taking a breather and speaking to them privately later. You’ll have more chance at persuading people if you talk about how their words make you feel. Saying, “what you said earlier really upset me” is more likely to have an impact than yelling at them. 
Talk about people, not numbers 
There’s a lot of misinformation behind racist opinions and it’s important to challenge these. But telling stories about real people is more likely to produce an empathetic response than reeling off facts and figures to make your point. If someone’s complaining about immigration, for example, don’t just bombard them with stats about global refugee numbers and quotas. Instead, ask them what they would do if they were in a dangerous or hopeless situation – wouldn’t they do anything they could to keep their family safe? Wouldn’t they try to go to country where they could live freely? 
Think about the language you use 
Language has the potential to dehumanise. For example, it’s common to hear talk of “migrants” and “refugees” as if all these millions of people were one undifferentiated mass. Collective nouns contribute towards stereotypes and obscure the personal stories that help people feel empathy. So instead of just saying “refugees”, talk about “people who have had to leave their homes”. Share stories you have heard about individuals and don’t define them by their status or religion. 
Talk about what you’re for, as well as what you’re against 
At Amnesty International we’re not just against racism – we’re for a society that respects and protects the human rights of everyone, that thrives on multiculturalism and is enriched by diverse communities. 
Research increasingly points to the fact that fear and pessimism activate a confirmation bias that increases…you guessed it, fear and pessimism. Conversely, hope and optimism trigger positive emotions and win over persuadable audiences. Many of the human rights wins of recent years have been based on campaigns that brilliantly communicated hopeful visions for the future rather than complaining about the status quo. Think of Ireland’s “Together for Yes”, or marriage equality campaigns in New Zealand and around the world that focused on love, freedom and family. 
Look at it this way: the story of Christchurch has two parts. The first is the horrific killing of 50 people who should have been safe here, by an attacker radicalised by white supremacism. The second is the overwhelmingly empathetic response from all kinds of New Zealanders, which has garnered international attention and praise. 
We have something to be inspired by in the wake of this tragedy, so try appealing to that empathy and speaking to people’s better selves. Remind them that this country can set a global example for how to respond to racist terror – but only if we all get on board. 
Humanity means people living freely and without fear. Humanity is our shared commitment to each other. Let’s stand with humanity.

Conversely, hope and optimism trigger positive emotions and win over persuadable audiences. Many of the human rights wins of recent years have been based on campaigns that brilliantly communicated hopeful visions for the future rather than complaining about the status quo. Think of Ireland’s “Together for Yes”, or marriage equality campaigns in New Zealand and around the world that focused on love, freedom and family. 
Look at it this way: the story of Christchurch has two parts. The first is the horrific killing of 50 people who should have been safe here, by an attacker radicalised by white supremacism. The second is the overwhelmingly empathetic response from all kinds of New Zealanders, which has garnered international attention and praise. 
We have something to be inspired by in the wake of this tragedy, so try appealing to that empathy and speaking to people’s better selves. Remind them that this country can set a global example for how to respond to racist terror – but only if we all get on board. 
Humanity means people living freely and without fear. Humanity is our shared commitment to each other. Let’s stand with humanity.

“Those arrested include Salah al-Haidar, the son of human rights activist Aziza Al-Yousef, who was temporarily released just a few days ago after more than 10 months of a terrible ordeal. Others include Abdullah al-Duhailan, a journalist, novelist and advocate for Palestinian rights and Fahad Abalkhail, who has supported the Women to Drive Campaign.
“In their continuing crackdown, it is no coincidence that the Saudi Arabian authorities are shamelessly targeting those citizens who are part and parcel of the society’s vibrant intellectual, artistic, activist landscape. By targeting them, they are signaling to their entire people that there will be zero tolerance of any form of criticism, let alone questioning, of the state’s authoritarian practices.
“We are deeply concerned for the well-being of those detained since yesterday. The Saudi Arabian government must reveal their whereabouts, ensure they are protected from torture and other ill-treatment, and allow them access to lawyers, as well as contact with their families.
“We call on the authorities to immediately disclose the charges brought against those detained, and if they are detained for their peaceful exercise of their right to freedom of expression, then they should be released immediately and unconditionally.”
Background
To date, there is no official information about the whereabouts of any of those swept in this latest crackdown, and reports of further arrests are still emerging on social media. Two of the detained individuals are dual US-Saudi citizens.
The seven people detained on Thursday are amongst a group of at least 13 Saudi Arabian writers and journalists who have been placed under travel ban since February 2019. Last month, Anas al-Mazrou, a lecturer at King Saud University was also detained after posing a question regarding the whereabouts of the detained women activists in a public panel at the Riyadh Book Fair. His whereabouts remain unknown.

Background
To date, there is no official information about the whereabouts of any of those swept in this latest crackdown, and reports of further arrests are still emerging on social media. Two of the detained individuals are dual US-Saudi citizens.
The seven people detained on Thursday are amongst a group of at least 13 Saudi Arabian writers and journalists who have been placed under travel ban since February 2019. Last month, Anas al-Mazrou, a lecturer at King Saud University was also detained after posing a question regarding the whereabouts of the detained women activists in a public panel at the Riyadh Book Fair. His whereabouts remain unknown.

The report, Building Hope, Addressing Injustice, is being released with less than six months to go before the 2019 federal election, against an international backdrop of conflict, strife, and continued rise of political agendas fueling hate and demonization; and amidst a domestic context of growing divisive political rhetoric about refugees, violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people, systemic discrimination against racialized communities, and failure to uphold the land rights of Indigenous peoples.
Building Hope, Addressing Injustice, notes several positive steps taken by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government to advance human rights nationally and internationally. These include supporting a legislative framework for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples domestically and showing global leadership with respect to jailed women human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia, the UN’s Global Compact on Refugees and the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar.
However, the report highlights deepening concern that Canada has failed to meet its international human rights obligations here at home. Despite several governments making welcome commitments towards reconciliation with First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples, there remains a wide gulf between these promises and the frequent violation of the rights of communities living on the frontlines of resource development.  Similarly, Amnesty expresses concerns over the federal government’s failure to live up to its promises to implement known solutions to violence against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons in advance of the forthcoming report of the National Inquiry, which will be delivered to government on April 30.
Also, for the first time this year, the Human Rights Agenda is drawing attention to Canada’s long history of anti-Black racism and violent discrimination in the criminal justice system, with a particular focus on concerns in Toronto, and is calling for a ban on racial profiling and random police street checks.
“The federal government has advanced commendable human rights positions globally and various governments in the country have pursued domestic reforms that strengthen rights protection. But it has become clear that progress has slowed, challenging files have bogged down, and once again politics too frequently take precedence over the country’s international human rights obligations,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English Branch. “The harsh reality is that Canada has been slow to act on violence against Indigenous women, including forced and coerced sterilization; is stalled on its commitment to establish an Ombudsperson for Canadian business overseas; and still refuses to end glaring human rights failings such as the continued construction of the Site C dam, the Safe Third Country Agreement and the sale of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia.”
In this year’s Human Rights Agenda, Amnesty International assesses progress with respect to 32 recommendations made to the federal government last year, in 2018. That Report Card highlights the federal government’s welcome support for Bill C-262, a private member’s bill to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples that is now before the Senate. Six recommendations are found to be well underway but incomplete and 14 others to be facing serious concerns or uncertainty. A troubling 11 recommendations are given a failing grade reflecting no notable progress.
This year, apart from the federal recommendations, Amnesty International is also making recommendations aimed at specific provincial governments, namely those in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, as well as others directed collectively to all provincial and territorial governments in the country. This is due to the fact that Amnesty has increasingly responded to a number of international human rights concerns that fall under provincial jurisdiction. It also recognizes that, at the end of the day, all levels of government are responsible for upholding Canada’s international human rights obligations.
In this year’s report, Amnesty International is offering 38 recommendations for action in six areas, including: 
Halting construction of the Site C dam, as per the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination’s recommendation. In fact, as of this agenda release, the federal and BC governments have less than one week to respond to the committee’s urgent deadline to stop building this destructive dam.
Implementing a ban on racial profiling that will include putting an immediate stop to all random police street checks.
Taking concrete steps towards a “progressive” trade agenda that upholds Canada’s human rights obligations, including consistent human rights impact assessments of trade deals.
Establishing the Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, as promised by the federal government over 14 months ago but now inexplicably delayed.
Addressing health and human rights concerns from the Mount Polley mine disaster in British Columbia and mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows First Nation in Ontario.
Taking concrete action to end the harmful practice of sterilizing Indigenous women without their consent.
Adopting recommendations to address concerns associated with policing the 2018 G7 Summit.
Withdrawing proposed legislation in Quebec regulating religious dress and symbols.
Ending genderbased violence, including by developing a National Action Plan and taking comprehensive action to address violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and two-spirit people.
Articulating a clear and comprehensive feminist foreign policy, something the federal government has touted, but not elaborated on.
Ensuring equal access to essential health care, regardless of immigration status.
Suspending the Canada-U.S. Safe Third Country Agreement. 
“As Canada vies for a coveted seat on the United Nations Security Council, the whole world will be watching our commitment to upholding our international human rights responsibilities,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnesty International Canada’s Francophone Branch. “That is why, with the federal election on the horizon, it is particularly important that Parliament passes crucial pieces of legislation which can help advance human rights protections in Canada before this session ends. Those include Bill C-262, the federal framework for implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Bill C-69, reforms to federal impact assessment legislation; Bill C-91, Indigenous languages legislation; and Bill C-92, the Indigenous child and family services bill.”
This election year, Amnesty International will be looking to all political parties and candidates to commit to the recommendations in this Human Rights Agenda as part of their electoral platforms.

Police fired tear gas into the newsroom after chasing reporter Lovejoy Mtongwiza to the website’s offices. The journalist had been taking photos and videos of the police forcing out street vendors in the Zimbabwean capital.
“Today’s attack on the 263 Chat offices was designed to send a chilling message to journalists and shows the lengths the Zimbabwean police are prepared to go to muzzle media freedom,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Southern Africa.
“The authorities must end the attack on the media and launch a prompt, thorough and effective investigation into this attack and ensure that all suspected perpetrators are identified and brought to justice.”
263 Chat is an online news site which reports on political, economic and social issues in Zimbabwe.
Reporter Lovejoy Mtongwiza was deployed to the city centre to take pictures of a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and Harare City Council operation to remove street vendors.
When a group of police and council officers pursued Mtongwiza, he ran away to his employer’s office. The police followed him and fired tear gas into the 263 Chat newsroom, where 14 other journalists were working. Officers also seized a mobile phone from one of the reporters.

Amnesty International testified alongside Alisa Lombard, a lawyer leading a class-action lawsuit representing women who allege they were forcibly or coercively sterilized; Sandeep Prasad from Action Canada for Sexual Health and Rights; and Karen Stote, a professor at Wilfrid Laurier University who has extensively studied the historic record on this issue in Canada.
“Forced and coerced sterilization is a form of violence, it’s a form of torture, it’s happening in Canada, and it is happening in other countries,” said Jacqueline Hansen, Amnesty International Canada’s Gender Rights Campaigner. “We know of cases in Peru, Mexico, and other countries where marginalized women—Indigenous women, women living with HIV, poor and rural women—have been sterilized without their free, full, and informed consent. We are advocating alongside Indigenous women’s organizations and other human rights organizations for strong and swift federal action to end this practice in Canada once and for all, and ensure justice for survivors.”
Amnesty International’s submission to the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights can be viewed in the attached document. Among its recommendations, Amnesty is urging the federal government to:
1. Appoint a special representative to meet with survivors and their families, to hear their requests for justice and reparations.
2. Meet with provinces, territories, health bodies, and civil society, including Indigenous women’s organizations, human rights organizations, and reproductive health associations.
3. Conduct a formal investigation into allegations of forced or coerced sterilizations in Canada, so as to better understand the scale and scope of this issue, taking a trauma-informed, survivor-centred approach, and with particular attention to cases involving Indigenous women and girls. As a first step, the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) should be tasked with compiling all relevant information about sterilization.
4. Clarify the process by which free, full, and informed consent must be obtained prior to any medical procedure, to ensure that women and healthcare providers across Canada are clear on the process for obtaining consent.
5. Support healthcare providers in promoting a full range of sexual and reproductive health information and services across Canada.
6. Apply existing criminal legislation on torture and aggravated assault as warranted for cases of forced or coerced sterilization.
7. Explore amending the Criminal Code to make forced and coerced sterilization a specific offense to increase its visibility and better support prosecution of cases of sterilization without consent.
8. Implement Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action 23 and 24 on increasing the number of Indigenous healthcare professionals and providing cultural competency training to all healthcare professionals.
9. Develop a comprehensive National Action Plan to prevent and address gender-based violence involving the federal government, provinces, territories, municipalities, and First Nations.
In October 2017, a class action lawsuit was filed in Saskatchewan representing two Indigenous women who report being sterilized without their consent. As of now, more than 100 more Indigenous women from Alberta, BC, Manitoba, and Ontario have come forward with similar allegations. Last December, the United Nations Committee Against Torture officially recognized that the forced or coerced sterilization of Indigenous women is a form of torture.

Time for change: Justice for rape survivors in the Nordic countries reveals that flawed legislation and widespread harmful myths and gender stereotypes have resulted in endemic impunity for rapists across the region.
“It is a paradox that Nordic countries, which have strong records of upholding gender equality, suffer shockingly high levels of rape,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Social stigma and a lack of trust in the justice system often mean that women and girls fail to report attacks, and those that do, are frequently failed by callous and prejudiced justice systems or outdated laws. One survivor told us she would never have reported her rape if she had known how she would have been be treated, and her story is typical in justice systems which are stacked against rape survivors.”
Whilst the situation facing survivors of rape is not uniform across the four Nordic countries, there are disturbing parallels among them whose criminal justice systems ignore, deny and tacitly condone sexual violence against women.
A first step towards protecting women and girls from rape is to adopt and effectively implement consent-based laws on sexual violence, and there has been some recent progress in this area. So far, Sweden is the only one of the four Nordic countries to have passed a consent-based law, but Denmark has recently announced that they support consent legislation, and in Finland the opposition has put forward a proposal for consent legislation and a complete reform aiming to “strengthen the role of consent” in sexual crimes legislation is being prepared.
Definition of rape based on violence and incapacity
Under the Istanbul Convention, a human rights treaty ratified by all the Nordic countries, rape and all other non-consensual acts of a sexual nature must be classified as criminal offences. However, the laws in Finland, Norway and Denmark still do not define rape on the basis of lack of consent. Instead, they use a definition based on whether physical violence, threat or coercion is involved or if the victim is found to have been unable to resist due to, for example, sleep or heavy intoxication.
The implicit assumption in law or in practice that a victim gives her consent because she has not physically resisted is deeply problematic since “involuntary paralysis” or “freezing” has been recognized by experts as a very common physiological and psychological response to sexual assault.
This focus on resistance and violence rather than on consent has an impact not only on the reporting of rape but also on wider awareness of sexual violence, both of which are key aspects in preventing rape and tackling impunity. The definition does not cover all cases of rape and thus some cases cannot be punished as rape.
Finland
Every year, around 50,000 women in Finland experience sexual violence, including rape. Most of those responsible for these crimes are never brought to justice.  In 2017 only 209 convictions were secured for rape.
Some survivors told Amnesty International that they had had positive and supportive experiences with the police and justice system. Others have described how the lack of understanding reflected deeply entrenched myths about rape and female sexuality that impact directly on access to justice.
In one disturbing district court judgment analyzed by Amnesty International, a judge acquitted the defendants in a case of multiple perpetrators saying: “The fact that a sexual partner says ‘no, I don’t want to’ before sexual intercourse or between intercourses, is not always a sufficient signal to the other person that consent and willingness to continue sex is not present.”  
Interviewed survivors described the process as stressful, scary and stigmatizing, regardless of the outcome of the case. One survivor told Amnesty International: “At the trial I thought, and said to my counsel, that if I had known what this would be like, I would never have reported the rape.”
Norway
Norwegian authorities have not taken the necessary measures to prevent rape and other forms of sexual violence or to address the consequences when such crimes occur. Prevailing and erroneous myths about rape make it hard for rape victims to report the crime to the police or to seek medical help. They also influence the way rape cases are handled by the criminal justice system.
Gender stereotypes and rape myths underpin attitudes of many people in the justice system. These damaging attitudes are reflected by one regional public prosecutor who told Amnesty International: “I have had a lot of student cases – decent young men who have done something stupid. It is not easy to convict a student who has come to this city to get a good education and who behaves well in court. He was drunk and horny and has done something stupid.”
Many rapes are not reported to the police, but even those survivors who do turn to the police face a lengthy and often flawed process. One survivor told Amnesty International: “It took almost two years from the time I reported in the autumn of 2016, until the case was closed in the spring of 2018. It is a long time to wait.”
One of the positive developments in recent years highlighted by several of the rape survivors interviewed by Amnesty International is the high standard of police interviews. As a rule, those who are responsible for conducting the interviews in cases of sexual assault including rape are trained specialists. In addition, the right to free legal counsel is an important and necessary support to the victims of rape during the whole judicial process.
Sweden
In 2018, Sweden adopted a new consent-based law on sexual crimes, making sex without consent a criminal offence as well as introducing the new offence of ‘negligent rape’.
Whilst it is still too early to assess the full impact of these legislative changes to the law, it is clearly an important step in tackling an issue that is pervasive in Swedish society. But changing the law will not be enough.
In Sweden flaws in the judicial processes need to be addressed, particularly in the police’s handling of rape cases. The inconsistent application of best practice working methods for investigations of sexual offences against adults and delays in results of forensic analysis were highlighted by representatives of different authorities, while some survivors described unacceptable delays in interviewing identified suspects.
One survivor told Amnesty International: “If they had done it properly from the start, I would have had justice today. All those hopes for justice and redress, and in the end – nothing. It was just another police report.”
Harmful attitudes will not be suddenly changed by a change in the law. A recent study found that that almost one in 10 people in Sweden agreed that gender-based violence against women is often provoked by the victim herself. One survivor told Amnesty International: ”I even got that comment from my mother. She said ’I have always tried to teach you how to dress.’”
Despite high levels of rape, there are very low prosecution rates in Sweden with only 6 percent of cases involving adults resulting in prosecution in 2017. Low prosecution and conviction rates affect confidence in the justice system.
Nevertheless, in many instances treatment of rape victims by the police has generally improved in recent years and the 2018 legal reforms require investigating police officers to immediately inform the victim about their right to counsel of their choice, free of charge.
One survivor who got a conviction in her case told Amnesty International: “It’s part of the healing. You feel: At last! At last they believe you, the system believes you…I think I am one of few who got justice. I do have hopes though, and the experience I had is what I want for everyone else.”
Denmark
Rape in Denmark is hugely under-reported and even when women do go to the police, the chances of prosecution or conviction are very slim. Of the 24,000 women found by a recent study to have experienced rape or attempted rape in 2017 alone, just 890 rapes were reported to the police. Of these, 535 resulted in prosecutions and only 94 in convictions.
Following the publication of an Amnesty International report last month, the Danish prime minister, announced that his government will back consent-based rape legislation and opposition parties has put forward a proposal on consent legislation expected to be presented in the legal committee in parliament in April.
“Whilst amending rape laws across the Nordic countries, are a vital step towards changing attitudes and achieving justice, much more is needed to effect institutional and social change,” said Kumi Naidoo. “The authorities must take steps to challenge rape myths and gender stereotypes at all levels of society. Professionals working with rape survivors must receive adequate continuous training and broader sexuality education and awareness-raising programmes are needed from a young age.
Kristine Holst, a survivor from Denmark, who became an activist after she was raped by a friend and whose story is included in the report, told Amnesty International: “I hope that the journey that began on the night of my rape, will culminate soon in the passing of consent-based legislation in Denmark. What this experience has shown me is that – if women come together and bravely speak out – change is not just possible: it is inevitable.”

BACKGROUND
In 2018, Amnesty analysed rape legislation in 31 European countries, and only eight of them have laws that define sex without consent as rape.
Last year alone, Iceland and Sweden became the seventh and eighth countries in Europe to adopt new legislation defining rape on the basis of lack of consent.  The Spanish government announced in 2018 legislative changes to amend the current rape definition, in Portugal a bill is under discussion in Parliament and in Greece, the government has opened a public consultation over the current definition of rape in the Greek Penal Code. This report is a follow up to Amnesty International’s report, Case Closed: Rape and human rights in the Nordic countries, published in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in 2008.

“We are extremely concerned that these heinous punishments have become law in Brunei today.
“This new penal code allows punishments such as amputation or death by stoning which are unspeakably cruel and have no place anywhere in the world.
“We are alarmed that the code criminalizes behaviour that should not be considered crimes at all. The international community must continue to condemn Brunei’s decision to put these cruel penalties into practice.
“The Brunei authorities must refrain from implementing these laws, and must take necessary steps to repeal this unacceptable legislation and bring it in line with international human rights laws and standards.”
These punishments are provided for in newly-implemented sections of Brunei’s Sharia Penal Code that will come into force today.
 
Background
Brunei Darussalam has signed but not yet ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and has rejected all recommendations to this effect in its human rights review at the UN in 2014.
Under international human rights law, corporal punishment in all its forms, such as stoning, amputation or whipping, constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, which is prohibited in all circumstances.
While Brunei retains the death penalty in law, it is abolitionist in practice. One new death sentence was imposed in 2017, for a drug related offence.
Brunei’s Shariah Penal Code (SPC) does not replace civil law but is expected to operate alongside it – from information available, each case requires an initial decision to determine whether it should be prosecuted under civil law, or Shariah law.

Amnesty International had the privilege of speaking with three of the women involved in producing the report: Carol Martin, Priscillia Tait (Gitxsan/Wetsuweten), and Harsha Walia. Here’s what they shared with us. 
What motivated you create this report? 
Harsha: There’s been so many reports before. There’s been the provincial inquiry and the recommendations are sitting on a shelf. We asked ourselves what was the most principled way we could approach the National Inquiry, recognizing that we can might create more recommendations that may sit on a shelf? We centered Indigenous women and their diverse methodologies in the report, rather than simply include Indigenous women into a preconceived research model. It wasn’t about hearing from Indigenous women and editing them out. We included what women wanted to say without editing. Over 100 women participated. The report is a transcription of women’s narratives with little editing. Women’s stories were central to the process. We wanted to hear women’s truths. It was led by Indigenous women and Indigenous methodology and grounded by Indigenous elders. The level of insight reflected the trust that was built between the women. 
Carol: The National Inquiry was an open door and a platform. Harsha has worked extensively over the years with women finding their voices, and she runs a group for Indigenous women [at the Downtown Eastside Women’s Centre] called Power to Women. When the National Inquiry came around, Harsha recognized that women were ready to run focus groups and extract all the information. They were the leaders and worked with experts from the community. It’s about the women. It’s for the women. 
Priscillia: I was asked to spend a couple nights leading a focus group. I felt a strong connection with the women who spoke about their difficulties with housing, because I experienced homelessness myself in 1997 with my one-year-old son, and that’s when I got involved with the Downtown Eastside. It was empowering to hear the women’s voices. 
 
The report is being released less than a month before the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is being submitted to government. What is the significance of this timing? 
Carol: The timing is just right. We don’t need the National Inquiry to come out with a report. We already know it because we’ve lived it. I’ve seen how they use our voices and our lives and what we share and it’s all shinied up and filtered to what they think the funders want to hear. This report hasn’t been touched. I’ve seen so much research done in the Downtown Eastside and it just flows through the Downtown Eastside and everyone forgets about it as a one-time thing. A lot of the women who led the groups are great leaders in the community. They get up and do housing rallies, and speak, and are given so much opportunity through the Power of Women group. I keep highlighting it because there’s nothing like it elsewhere. They speak and they rally and they march and they collect stories to be part of a report and this is stuff that doesn’t happen much. 
Priscillia: Previous studies have shown little recognition of our artistic potentials. I’m sick and tired of media stereotypes of people in the Downtown Eastside. So many women have these hidden talents. This report will hopefully open up doors to understand the personal trauma that people face and how they use the arts to work through it and to grow. I myself am a community performer. I’ve expressed myself through theatre, dance, photography, and writing. 
What is the top message you want that people to take away after reading the report? 
Priscillia: That we’re human. And we’re leaders in our own ways. We’re artists expressing ourselves as part of a healing journey. Creating this report is another part of that journey. 
Carol: When I think of this report I want people to remove this Canadian lens they have when they think of us. I want them to look at us with different eyes. I want them to read the report with different eyes and different attitudes. What feelings come up when you read this report? Do you have a distaste? Do you have an image of who you think we are? 
When you read women’s stories what is happening while you read these? What feelings are coming up? Where do you feel them? Is it in your stomach? When you read a report like this, what does it do to you? If there are negative thoughts write them down and think about where it comes from and ask why do I think this way? We need to start changing people’s attitudes about who we are. That is the feeling of change. Once you feel and acknowledge that, you will make changes in how you look at us. 
Priscillia: One of the nights I was facilitating, what really moved me was this one Indigenous woman, who had her personal luggage with her and she was explaining how she had to bring her belongings everywhere with her because she couldn’t leave them at the shelter, and she was having trouble finding housing. I went through a similar experience when I was trying to find accomodation for myself and my one-year-old son. They shut the door because I was Aboriginal and they assumed I was a drug addict and a drunk. 
Carol: It’s amazing the strength and resilience of our Indigenous women after everything we’ve gone through. We can relate to everything that everyone says because we’ve all gone through it. Downtown is actually where I found myself. I was part of the Sixties Scoop. I came to Vancouver at age 26 and fell really hard and started drinking. But Downtown with my people is where I found myself and found my strength and resilience. Once you find yourself you could be that light where people can recognize and see things that need to happen in their lives. All the years of labeling and years of making me feel ugly about myself. I used to present myself as a Canadian person, well preserved but empty of my identity and who I am and disconnected from my spirituality and who I was. When I found myself, it was a horrible experience because it was unknown to me and all I felt was ugly and dirty and I felt like a drunk. All the years of hearing that, it took many years to process myself back into my body. Think of all the kids who came home from residential school. This report covers all of that. It takes years and years of knowing each other and trusting each other to come together like this for it to be safe to talk about these things. These are women’s real stories that have been captured in this. Their voices are heard. It’s meaningful. 
Priscillia: I grew up with my grandparents, Sarah and Thomas Tait, who survived residential school. What I got from them was my humour, and my desire to help out. I’m not rich but I help out in whatever way I can because that’s what I was taught. There is so much humour in many of the stories I’ve heard from women that I’ve met. They’ve gotten through the pain and the trauma, and the laughter is part of healing too. 
Carol: Amidst of all the trust and years of knowing each other, the medicines and our elders were there throughout this whole process, telling the women what the medicine was all about. That’s how healing starts to. Connected to the medicine and who we are, our culture. 
 
Harsha: I think for settlers and non-Indigenous Canadians, often-times we’re constantly presented with stereotypes and statistics and this idea that somehow Indigenous issues are to be addressed by Indigenous people. What this report also does is suggest to settler Canadians that this is fundamentally a Canadian problem. The Downtown Eastside is seen as all about bad statistics, but in fact what’s happening in the Downtown Eastside is an extension of colonialism and gender colonialism. You can’t talk about the Downtown Eastside separate from the rest of Turtle Island. It’s connected to resource development. It’s connected to the Indian Act. It’s connected to dispossession. It’s not an insular neighbourhood. 
Indigenous women are not statistics or stereotypes. The recommendations in the report are things that are common knowledge in the neighbourhood. Indigenous women have capacity to contribute to policy discussions about their experiences. There’s 200 recommendations in this report that come from the collective brilliance of Indigenous women in community and decision-makers need to take them seriously and they’re contributing to a national discussion. The National Inquiry wouldn’t have happened without the activism and the care of women in this community. 
What message would you like to share with Amnesty supporters who are interested in reading the report and acting in solidarity with women in the Downtown Eastside? 
Carol: They need to process questions about if you’re reading something like this, read this over and over until they heal themselves. When you’re reading something what thoughts and images are coming up from you? People need to start paying attention to stories like this. It’s been over 500 years. How long will it take to start changing attitudes and beliefs about who we are. There’s a lot of work to be done. 
Priscillia: I just want readers to get to know the women. We are human. The land does not belong to the people, the people belong to the land. Go to your local Aboriginal gathering or centre. Get to know the women on a personal basis. That’s what I want from this report. We’re human and come join us.

“Six months after the extrajudicial execution of Jamal Khashoggi, there are still no real signs of justice or international accountability. It has become clear that the issue is being swept under the carpet by the Saudi authorities and foreign governments for the sake of security cooperation, lucrative business ties and arms deals.
“The Saudi Arabian authorities’ ongoing trial of 11 suspects lacks credibility and transparency. It is also outrageous to learn that some governments whose diplomats have attended the trial of the alleged suspects have remained silent on fair trial concerns, especially given the prosecution is seeking the death penalty for some defendants. Other than the attendance of representatives of foreign governments, independent monitoring bodies and media have not been permitted to attend the closed trial proceedings, which is extremely worrying. Under these unacceptable circumstances, the presence of diplomats risks being seen as legitimising a potentially flawed trial.
“Given the lack of transparency from the Saudi authorities and in the absence of an independent judiciary, an international, independent and impartial investigation is the only way to avoid a whitewash of this grave crime.
“Saudi Arabia has an appalling human rights track record. We urge the Saudi Arabian authorities to end systematic violations of human rights and to allow activists, human rights defenders, journalists, and critics to freely express their views without fear of being targeted for extrajudicial execution, arbitrary detention or other gross human rights violations.”
Background
On 2 October 2018, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was murdered in the Saudi consulate building in Istanbul, Turkey. Mr Khashoggi was reportedly strangled moments after entering the building, though the details of what happened to him remains clouded in doubt amid numerous claims, counter-claims and denials from Saudi authorities, including the whereabouts of his body. Currently, 11 alleged suspects are believed to be on trial before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh for the murder.
Amnesty International launched a campaign calling on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to set up an independent investigation into Jamal’s Khashoggi’s death on 2 October 2018.

But to not know where they are detained, or if they are even alive at all, is even harder. 
This is the situation faced by hundreds of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic Muslim people living overseas while their relatives languish in Chinese political detention camps. 
To make matters worse, their desperate search for information is being hindered by their own family members still in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region (XUAR). This is not because those relatives don’t want to help; instead, it’s because they fear cooperating could mean they are the next ones sent to the notorious camps. 
“Transformation-through-education centres” is the euphemistic term the Chinese government prefers to use for these facilities. It claims the individuals held there receive “vocational training” to help them with their “radical thoughts”. 
Terrified to talk 
Since when does such “training” include people being tortured and abused, as several former detainees and relatives of former detainees told me takes place in the camps? 
We do not know the full extent of what goes on in the camps because the “re-education” programmes, like their locations, are shrouded in secrecy. What we do know is that people are terrified to be sent there, and most who come out alive remain too scared to even describe their experiences. 
“I don’t know if they are still alive, or what else I can do to find more information about them,” said Alim*, a Uighur man living in Australia.  Alim’s parents and other relatives were sent to a re-education camp in in 2018 and have not been heard from since. 
Alim’s experience is typical of what many Uighurs living in Japan, Australia and New Zealand have described to me. 
Some have given up work to focus on finding information about their relatives in Xinjiang, but other family members that they turn to for support are not always willing to help. Several overseas Uighurs told me they have been blocked by their relatives still in Xinjiang on WeChat, a popular social media platform in China, due to fear of reprisals if they speak out. 
Those living outside of China are at risk too. Many worry they could be deported from their current homes when their passports or visas expire, then arbitrarily detained once back in China. 
There have been reports of deportation cases in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Thailand, Pakistan, Sweden and Germany. Many Uighurs I spoke to were too scared to make their locations public. Some nervously asked me if I was Chinese – and agreed to speak only when I explained that I am Hong Kong Chinese. 
Such is the level of mistrust and suspicion, that people based in Japan told me they would not even speak to fellow Uighurs in their community for fear they could be informants for the Chinese authorities. 
Some individuals have been released from China’s detention camps. But even for the families who have been reunited, much damage has already been done. 
In September 2018, I met with a group of Kazakhs in Almaty, Kazakhstan, whose relatives were detained in Xinjiang. They have since told me the good news that many of their loved ones have been released, but they have been shocked to see their relatives return as completely different people. 
Many are frightened and disoriented and suffer from memory loss. Most released are too scared to say anything about what happened to them in the camps. This is the apparent effect of “vocational training”. 
Hope of being reunited 
In this climate of fear, Uighurs outside China searching for loved ones are grateful for even the smallest tokens of support. Just one tweet from a stranger about their family’s situation will spark hope that their case could get more attention. A tweet also serves another purpose – it makes these desperate people feel that they are not alone. 
Some overseas Uighurs recently took part in the #MetooUyghur online campaign. For many, just using this hashtag represented a difficult and courageous decision to speak out. 
Others have contacted human rights organizations such as Amnesty International. The information vacuum in Xinjiang is so great that those searching for loved ones know they cannot do it on their own. 
Despite all the fear, some have begun to share their stories. As long as independent human rights monitors continue to be denied access to Xinjiang, these testimonies are important in painting a picture of the systematic and gross human rights violations by the Chinese government. 
Everyone who tells their story is taking a risk, but each voice is crucial in dismantling the wall of secrecy around what is happening in Xinjiang. It is a brave first step towards reuniting families that have been torn apart.

We do not know the full extent of what goes on in the camps because the “re-education” programmes, like their locations, are shrouded in secrecy. What we do know is that people are terrified to be sent there, and most who come out alive remain too scared to even describe their experiences. 
“I don’t know if they are still alive, or what else I can do to find more information about them,” said Alim*, a Uighur man living in Australia.  Alim’s parents and other relatives were sent to a re-education camp in in 2018 and have not been heard from since. 
Alim’s experience is typical of what many Uighurs living in Japan, Australia and New Zealand have described to me. 
Some have given up work to focus on finding information about their relatives in Xinjiang, but other family members that they turn to for support are not always willing to help. Several overseas Uighurs told me they have been blocked by their relatives still in Xinjiang on WeChat, a popular social media platform in China, due to fear of reprisals if they speak out. 
Those living outside of China are at risk too. Many worry they could be deported from their current homes when their passports or visas expire, then arbitrarily detained once back in China. 
There have been reports of deportation cases in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Thailand, Pakistan, Sweden and Germany. Many Uighurs I spoke to were too scared to make their locations public. Some nervously asked me if I was Chinese – and agreed to speak only when I explained that I am Hong Kong Chinese. 
Such is the level of mistrust and suspicion, that people based in Japan told me they would not even speak to fellow Uighurs in their community for fear they could be informants for the Chinese authorities. 
Some individuals have been released from China’s detention camps. But even for the families who have been reunited, much damage has already been done. 
In September 2018, I met with a group of Kazakhs in Almaty, Kazakhstan, whose relatives were detained in Xinjiang. They have since told me the good news that many of their loved ones have been released, but they have been shocked to see their relatives return as completely different people. 
Many are frightened and disoriented and suffer from memory loss. Most released are too scared to say anything about what happened to them in the camps. This is the apparent effect of “vocational training”. 
Hope of being reunited 
In this climate of fear, Uighurs outside China searching for loved ones are grateful for even the smallest tokens of support. Just one tweet from a stranger about their family’s situation will spark hope that their case could get more attention. A tweet also serves another purpose – it makes these desperate people feel that they are not alone. 
Some overseas Uighurs recently took part in the #MetooUyghur online campaign. For many, just using this hashtag represented a difficult and courageous decision to speak out. 
Others have contacted human rights organizations such as Amnesty International. The information vacuum in Xinjiang is so great that those searching for loved ones know they cannot do it on their own. 
Despite all the fear, some have begun to share their stories. As long as independent human rights monitors continue to be denied access to Xinjiang, these testimonies are important in painting a picture of the systematic and gross human rights violations by the Chinese government. 
Everyone who tells their story is taking a risk, but each voice is crucial in dismantling the wall of secrecy around what is happening in Xinjiang. It is a brave first step towards reuniting families that have been torn apart.

“Kenya’s mandatory biometric registration system legal framework poses a massive risk to the right to privacy of citizens, foreign nationals and refugees living in the country. Parliament should swiftly repeal the invasive sections and expedite the National Taskforce’s Data Protection Bill to bring forth a legal framework for safeguarding personal data” said Irũngũ Houghton, Amnesty International Kenya’s Executive Director.
“No country in the world has passed a law enabling it to collect DNA samples and biometric data from its entire population without even a basic legal framework for data protection. There must be concrete safeguards for data storage, security and independent oversight of the system.”
Amnesty congratulates The Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC), the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) and the Nubian Rights Forum (NRF) for their petition.
The current legal NIIMS framework raises serious human rights concerns including the fundamental right to privacy as enshrined in Article 31 of the Kenyan Constitution and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Kolade Johnson was reportedly shot accidentally by officers from the Special Anti-Cultism Squad (SACS) – a branch of SARS – who had been pursuing another man at the football viewing centre.
Amnesty International has documented a pattern of grave human rights violations carried out by SARS since 2016.
“Kolade Johnson is the latest victim of the SARS police squad, which has become notorious for extrajudicial killings, torture and extortion,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria. “This appears to be an unlawful killing which must be impartially and thoroughly investigated, with any officers suspected of criminal responsibility brought to justice in a fair trial before an ordinary civilian court.
“It is shameful that more than two years since Amnesty International highlighted crimes under international law and human rights violations by SARS, these shocking incidents continue unabated.”
According to local media reports, Kolade Johnson was hit by a stray bullet when SACS officers tried to disperse a crowd during an operation to arrest another man.
There has been a public outcry over the killing, with thousands of people using the hashtag #EndSARS in the past 24 hours.
“Nigerians will no longer accept the brutality being unleashed against them by police on an almost daily basis,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria. “SARS is a police unit created to protect the people. Instead it has become a danger to society, torturing its victims with complete impunity while fomenting a toxic climate of fear and corruption.”
Amnesty International’s investigations into the activities of SARS across Nigeria since 2016 have exposed the callous workings of a police squad operating outside of the law.
The September 2016 report ‘Nigeria: You have signed your death warrant’ showed how the unit has been systematically torturing detainees as a means of extracting confessions and bribes.
All subsequent government pledges to reform SARS, including one by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo in August last year, have amounted to nothing.
In addition to its stated remit of tackling violent crimes, SARS sometimes investigates civil matters and has tortured detainees involved in contractual, business and even domestic disputes. Victims of SARS crimes are often legally powerless to defend themselves against criminal accusations and torture.
“Much more needs to be done to end human rights violations by SARS, including unnecessary and excessive use of force, extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary detention and extortion. Wide-ranging reforms must be carried out so that Nigerians can trust the police to protect them,” said Osai Ojigho.
“Evidence of crimes and human rights violations committed by SARS is widely available, including in reports by Amnesty International, and this should aid effective investigation into crimes committed by the squad.”

Tomorrow, April 2, is the next crucial opportunity to advance the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples implementation Bill, private member’s Bill C-262, toward its eventual adoption into law.
Indigenous peoples’ organizations, human rights groups and faith communities have all called on Senators to support an anticipated vote to send Bill C-262 to Committee in preparation for its final adoption so it can receive Royal Assent before the House rises.
“The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is the framework for reconciliation and the path to closing the gap in the quality of life between First Nations and Canada,” said Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde. “These are non-partisan priorities that deserve support by all parliamentarians and all Canadians. I urge all Senators to seize this opportunity to move Bill C-262 to its next step towards Royal Assent. This move will be a step toward a more fair and just country and an important step toward reconciliation.”
Bill C-262 is a private member’s bill put forward by NDP MP Romeo Saganash requiring the federal government to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including necessary reforms of laws and policies.
“Bill C-262 provides a clear and principled framework for the federal government to live up to its promise to finally address some of the most serious human rights concerns facing Canada,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “Unfortunately, there is only a small window left for the Senate to bring legislation to a final vote before the current session of Parliament ends. It’s crucial that Senators not miss this opportunity.”
The House of Commons committee that reviewed Bill C-262 heard more than 70 witnesses chosen by all parties and only one of those witnesses expressed opposition to the Bill. Members of Parliament voted overwhelmingly in support of Bill C-262 when it was before the House of Commons last year.
“I can’t emphasize enough the importance of adopting Bill C-262,” said Rosemarie Kuptana, a leading Inuk human rights advocate and past President of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Inuit Circumpolar Council.  “There’s wide support among Canadians and Members of Parliament for Bill C-262 and we’re confident that there is a high level of support in the Senate too. The challenge now is ensuring Senators turn that support into action by showing up for the critical votes to come. Indigenous peoples are watching.” 
Mariam Wallet Med Aboubakrine, the Chair of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, said, “With Bill C-262, Canada has the opportunity to set an important and much needed example of how the UN Declaration can be implemented through a principled and collaborative process. Indigenous peoples around the world are anxious to see this bill become law.”

In a crackdown revealed in 2017, dozens of men were abducted, tortured and killed for their real or perceived sexual orientation. To date, not one person has yet been held accountable for these crimes.
“The Russian authorities have shown themselves to be complicit in heinous crimes committed in Chechnya against people believed to be gay or lesbian”, said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.
“Two years after reports of a ‘gay purge’ sent shockwaves worldwide, it’s clear that the perpetrators have gone unpunished because of state-sponsored homophobia and impunity for human rights violations in Chechnya.”
Meanwhile, authorities have also failed to provide effective protection to LGBTI rights defender Igor Kochetkov, the leading figure in the public investigation of the violent crackdown, who has recently received death threats.
On 29 January this year, a video containing insults and a death threat directed at Igor Kochetkov was widely distributed across social networks. After Igor Kochetkov presented a formal complaint against the author of this video, the police merely suggested that “next time the human rights defender should call an emergency number”. An official investigation has not been opened by the police to date.
“The shocking disregard to human lives and dignity has reached a new low as the authorities have neglected to carry out a thorough investigation into death threats sent to Russian LGBTI Network’s Executive Director Igor Kochetkov.
“However, in a rare positive twist, last week a court in Saint Petersburg ruled the police inaction in this case to be unlawful. We urge the Russian authorities to promptly implement the court’s ruling and conduct a thorough and effective investigation into the death threats against Igor Kochetkov and crimes in the Chechen Republic exposed by the Russian LGBT Network.”
Background
In April 2017, the newspaper Novaya Gazeta exposed a horrifying crackdown in Chechnya in which dozens of men were abducted, tortured and killed. The failure of the Russian state to provide justice for these victims unleashed another wave of homophobic crimes in Chechnya in 2018. By January 2019, at least two people were believed to have been tortured to death in this crackdown.

In response, on March 30 of the same year, Palestinians held demonstrations across Galilee in the north all the way to the Negev in the South. Six Palestinians were killed and more than a hundred were injured. 
Following these horrific events, this day came to be known as Land Day or ‘Yom Al-Ard’, an annual observance in which Palestinians commemorate and demonstrate their commitment to the right and ownership of their land. 
Since 1967, Israel’s policy of constructing and expanding illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian land has continued unabated, and is one of the main driving forces behind the mass human rights violations resulting from the occupation. 
Over the past 50 years, Israel has: 
demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian properties 
displaced large swathes of the population to build homes and infrastructure to illegally settle its own population in the occupied territories 
diverted Palestinian natural resources such as water and agricultural land for settlement use. 
The very existence of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories violates international humanitarian law and is a war crime. Despite multiple UN resolutions, Israel continues to appropriate Palestinian land and support at least 600,000 settlers living in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 
On March 30, 2019, Palestinians across the world will observe the 43rd Land Day to protest continued home demolitions and seizure of land by Israel to build settlements. 
Khan al-Ahmar is just one of 46 Palestinian communities in the West Bank that Israel plans to forcibly transfer to make way for illegal Jewish-only settlements. The village has more than 160 structures, including a school, a mosque and a clinic. 
On 24 May, 2018, Israel’s Supreme Court ruled in favour of demolishing the village. Less than two weeks later, the army began forcibly evicting its residents, violently attacking them and solidarity activists ahead of the displacement of the entire community. In response,  the Palestinian Ministry of Education was forced to begin the school year for Khan al-Ahmar two months early, sacrificing the students’ summer holiday to protest the school’s impending demolition in an attempt to protect it from the bulldozers. 
Over the past 10 years, more than 25 homes in Khan al-Ahmar have been demolished by the Israeli authorities, and the daily threat of destruction continues. 
Israel’s policy of settling its civilians in occupied Palestinian territory contravenes fundamental rules of international humanitarian law. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention prohibits: 
the deportation or transfer of parts of the Occupying Power’s civilian population into the territory it occupies 
the individual or mass forcible transfer and deportation of protected persons from occupied territory 
the extensive appropriation and destruction of land and property. 
These are all actions entailed by Israel’s illegal settlements. 
On January 22, 2019, the United Nations Security Council conducted its annual meeting to discuss Israel/Palestine, and specifically, the illegal Israeli settlements. 
“As 2019 begins, we should have no illusions about the dangerous dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which continue to unfold before our eyes,” cautioned Nickolay Mladenov, UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process. He reported that during the last quarter of 2018 alone, Israeli authorities advanced, approved or tendered more than 3,100 housing units for settlements in Area C – nearly half of which are deep in the West Bank. Ongoing attempts to pass legislation that would directly apply Israeli law to occupied West Bank territory raise fears of future “annexation”, according to Mladenov. 
There are now approximately 600,000 Israelis living in 250 settlements across the West Bank (including East Jerusalem). Since 1967, over 100,000 hectares of land have been appropriated by Israel. Over the past 50 years, 50,000 homes and structures have been demolished by Israel in the OPT. This has resulted in over 4.9 million Palestinians who face daily restrictions on their movement. 
Land Day has become an annual opportunity to remind the international community that Israel’s land grab is ongoing and dangerous for the human rights situations for the Palestinian People. Forcible transfer of people under occupation is a serious breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The deportation or transfer of all or parts of the population of the occupied territory within or outside this territory constitutes a war crime under Article 8 of the Rome Statute. 
Destination: Occupation is part of Amnesty’s Occupation @50 campaign, which was launched in June 2017, the 50 year anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Occupation @50 calls on states to ban Israeli settlement goods from entering their markets, and to stop companies domiciled in their territories from operating in settlements or trading in their goods.   
Destination: Occupation focuses on the online tourism industry and its role in helping maintain and grow illegal Israeli settlements. The report examines the operations of four international digital tourism companies: Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor. It exposes their activities related to Israeli settlements in the OPT and how these activities contribute to and benefit from Israel’s violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. 
As Palestinians mark the 43rd Land Day, we begin another year of the Israeli occupation and its relentless land grab and settlement expansion. Unless the international community takes a clear stand to show that it will no longer tolerate Israel’s illegal policies of annexation and settlement, both serious violations of international humanitarian law, Palestinian human rights will continue to be trampled on with impunity and UN resolutions will remain little more than empty gestures.

The lack of international accountability throughout the region has meant that governments in MENA have had free rein to imprison peaceful critics, restrict the activities of civil society or use arbitrary arrest, detention and excessive use of force against protesters demanding their rights.
“All across the MENA region, thousands of peaceful critics have been victims of relentless government violations”, said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.
“The fact that the summit is being held in Tunisia is a reminder that people across the Arab world rose up in protest calling for social justice and political reform in 2011 – yet the Arab Summit seeks to pretend that this never happened.
“Amnesty International sends a clear message to Arab leaders – who have little or no respect of human rights – that it is time to end the zero-tolerance policy toward freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.
“As a first step, they should commit to releasing all prisoners of conscience who have been imprisoned solely for expressing their peaceful opinions and ending their crackdowns on protesters.”
While brave citizens and human rights defenders are behind bars across the MENA region simply for expressing their opinions, Amnesty International is raising awareness of five Arab prisoners of conscience that the world will not hear about at the Summit. These activists are:  Nabeel Rajab from Bahrain, Loujain al-Hathloul from Saudi Arabia, Ahmed Mansoor from United Arab Emirates, Mohamed Mkhaïtir from Mauritania, and Hanan Badr el-Din from Egypt.
Last month, Amnesty International launched its report Human rights in the Middle East and North Africa: A review of 2018 which describes how authorities across the region have unashamedly persisted with ruthless campaigns of repression in order to crush dissent, cracking down on protesters, civil society and political opponents, often with tacit support from powerful allies.
The 22 countries of the Arab League will meet this Sunday 30 March in Tunis for their 36th summit.

“It’s the responsibility of the government to do everything possible to fight systemic discrimination towards marginalized groups,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnesty International Canada’s Francophone Branch. “The government must ensure that Quebec remains an inclusive society that respects human rights.”
Quebec’s proposed Bill 21 – “An Act Respecting the Laicity of the State” – would ban dozens of public employees from wearing head scarves, turbans, crosses and other visible religious symbols. The affected government positions include police officers, judges, prosecutors, lawyers, teachers and school principles. This bill is not unlike legislation we have seen in Belgium, France and Spain, which aims to restrict the wearing of religious symbols, or Iran and Saudi Arabia, which obliges individuals to dress a certain way. 
International human rights law guarantees the right to equality, freedom of expression, freedom of religion and the right to express one’s religious beliefs. By extension, everyone has the right to dress as they choose. No government can force an individual to dress or not dress in a particular way. And they must protect people from clothing-related restrictions imposed by others, including relatives or the wider community.
“Women cannot be forced to wear headscarves or veils – either by the State or the individual,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, “and it is equally unacceptable for a government to approve legislation banning women from wearing these religious symbols. Such restrictions may be permissible if they are for exceptional, specific or clearly defined reasons, such as the wearing of a veil during an identity check. But the restrictions outlined in this new bill are disproportionate.”
Indeed, international law allows legitimate restrictions on wearing religious symbols, but such restrictions must meet three strict conditions: they must be prescribed by law; they must fulfil a specific, legitimate purpose and be authorized by international law (such as public order, health or morality, public security, or the rights of others); and it must be possible to prove that the restrictions are necessary and proportionate to the attainment of the intended purpose.
“The government is attempting to divert our attention from the real issues,” concluded France-Isabelle Langlois. “Restricting fundamental rights without reasonable grounds is dangerous for our democracy. It is not a question of denying people the right to express their discomfort with certain religious practices – or criticizing them – but of allowing everyone to enjoy their fundamental rights, such as the right to equality, freedom of conscience and freedom of expression.”

“Secretary Nielsen is ready to exploit the vulnerable situations of families in order to send a loud message to the world that refugees are not welcome in America.
“The US must live up to its promise and implement humane policies that do not unnecessarily detain people seeking safety and protection.
“The DHS’s argument that treating asylum seekers humanely fuels migration is a blatant lie meant to curb the basic rights of those fleeing violence and persecution in their home countries.”
Amnesty International USA calls on Congress to reject Secretary Nielson’s request for more powers and demand that DHS renew its ‘Alternative to Detention’ programs.
Background
In October, Amnesty International launched a report on the policy of family separation and illegal pushbacks and the arbitrary detention of asylum seekers.
In February, Amnesty International USA issued statement to a Congressional oversight hearing on family separations.

‘If they can have her, why can’t we?’ chronicles the stories of 46 Dominican cisgender and transgender women sex workers, many of whom reported suffering various forms of violence, much of which amount to gender-based torture and other ill-treatment. The criminalized status of sex workers combined with profound machismo, fuels arbitrary detentions by police and enables these grave human rights violations, with impunity.
“Gender-based violence is epidemic across Latin America and the Caribbean, with women sex workers at particular risk from state officials and other individuals,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“The harrowing testimonies that Amnesty International has gathered from the Dominican Republic reveal that police routinely target and inflict sexual abuse and humiliation on women who sell sex with the purpose of punishing and discriminating against them. Under international law, such treatment can amount to gender-based torture and other ill-treatment.”
In the Dominican Republic, in 2018 alone, the Prosecutor General’s Office received over 71,000 reports of gender-based and intra-family violence, and more than 6,300 reports of sexual offenses, including 1,290 reports of rape.
The country also has one of the region’s highest femicide rates, with more than 100 cases recorded in 2017, according to the UN Gender Equality Observatory for Latin America and the Caribbean. Similarly, 47 transgender women have been killed since 2006, according to the transgender-led NGO Trans Siempre Amigas (TRANSSA).
Public health experts estimate there are as many as 97,000 cisgender women sex workers in the Dominican Republic, and at least 3,900 transgender women, many of whom engage in sex work.
Approximately half of the women interviewed by Amnesty International were cisgender women, and the other half were transgender women. The women had decided to engage in sex work for a variety of reasons. For some, it offered flexibility and control over their working hours or higher pay compared with other alternatives and gave them financial independence. For others, sex work was one of the limited options they had to cover their basic needs.
At least 10 of the 24 cisgender women interviewed for this report said police officers had raped them, often at gunpoint. Most of the transgender women had also suffered discriminatory and violent actions (typically focused on their gender-identity or expression) at the hands of the police, that could amount to torture or other ill-treatment.
Amnesty International interviewed multiple women who described having been gang raped by armed and uniformed police officers in similar circumstances – late at night, on dark street corners, often in the back of police vehicles.
One woman explained to Amnesty International how she was raped one night in October 2017.
“There were three of them. I was on a corner waiting for clients… and they abused me,” she said. “They pulled me onto the (police) van… They saw that the area was empty… They started to grope me, take off my clothes. They ripped my blouse…. One after the other,” she said.
She continued: “I was afraid. I was alone. I couldn’t defend myself. I had to let them do what they wanted with me… They threatened me, that if I wasn’t with them they would kill me. They (said) that I was a whore, and so why not with them?”
“They called me a “bitch” and used many offensive words…. They saw me, I guess, and they thought ‘Well, if they (clients) can have her, why can’t we?’”
The report also details how women sex workers who live with multiple discriminated identities – such as transgender women – experience even more pronounced exclusion and are at greater risk of torture from the state and individuals.
Transgender women reported being called “fags” and “devils” by police officials, and said they believed they were viewed as “aliens” or “animals”. Multiple transgender women reported that police had burned their wigs or forced them to clean prison cells covered in excrement to punish them.
Impunity for sexual torture is typical. The Dominican Republic fails to collect any data that would help determine the scope and severity of the problem of gender-based torture and ill-treatment by police, which is an essential step to combatting and holding perpetrators account for such grave violence. This impunity fuels the normalization of such crimes by the authorities, as well as by victims themselves in some cases.
Sex workers’ complaints are rarely taken seriously by authorities. One woman told Amnesty International: “If you go to the police station to make a complaint, they treat you like a whore. They ignore you. They don’t pay you any attention.”
Despite having ratified multiple international human rights instruments that prohibit torture, the Dominican authorities fail to prevent, properly investigate or provide remedies for these potential cases of torture, as required by international law.
Over the past decades, the Dominican Republic has taken steps to address the co-existing epidemics of violence against women and HIV/AIDS, which both disproportionately impact sex workers. But it has stopped short of listening to the needs and protecting the rights of sex workers and carrying out the legal reforms sorely needed to address the underlying drivers of stigma and discrimination against them.
Amnesty International calls on Dominican president Danilo Medina to publicly recognize and condemn the use of rape and other forms of gender-based torture and ill-treatment by the police, and the Prosecutor General’s Office to develop a protocol for the investigation of potential cases of this nature.
Dominican legislators must also urgently pass the draft law currently under consideration, which is designed to address multiple forms of discrimination, in order to ensure profound structural change and protect all historically marginalized groups from the stigma and discrimination that fuels human rights abuses.
“By passing a law to prevent discrimination against some of the country’s most marginalized women, the Dominican Republic could set an example for the rest of the Caribbean to follow in the fight against stigma, machismo, and other drivers of extreme violence against women,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“This would in turn help the country address its wider epidemic of gender-based violence, which, like violence against sex workers, is rooted in machismo and hatred.”

0,CONTINUING HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS IN GUATEMALA,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/continuing-hostile-environment-for-human-rights-defenders-in-guatemala/,"AMR 34/0128/2019 Amnesty International is concerned that the authorities are continuing to impose unjustified obstacles and restrictions on the work of human rights defenders in Guatemala.

Amnesty International is concerned that the authorities are continuing to impose unjustified obstacles and restrictions on the work of human rights defenders in Guatemala.
On 22 March 2019, the authorities made public criminal charges filed by the President of the Judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice against the human rights defenders Claudia Samayoa, President of the Board of the Unit for the Protection of Human Rights in Guatemala (UDEFEGUA), and José Manuel Martínez Cabrera, a member of the Justicia Ya collective. The two defenders were accused of illegally obtaining a copy of a decision issued by the Court on 9 January. This decision, which was also circulated on social media and in the media, was the basis of a complaint filed on 17 January 2019 by the two defenders against members of the Supreme Court of Justice, including its President.
The criminal complaint against the two defenders comes in a context of continuing attacks – including smear campaigns and vilification on social media, threats, intimidation and killings – targeting human rights defenders in Guatemala because of their human rights activities. Amnesty International views with concern the killings of 26 human rights defenders recorded during 2018, an increase compared to previous years, as well as speeches by public officials seeking to stigmatize and discredit human rights defenders in the eyes of the public. The opening of baseless judicial proceedings to intimidate, harass and wear down human rights defenders in Guatemala is a practice that Amnesty International has criticized for several years. Since the publication in 2016 of its report “We are defending the land with our blood”, the organization has received information that new criminal proceedings initiated against defenders as a direct consequence of their work remain open in Public Prosecutor’s Office for months or even years, during which time some of those accused may be held in detention.1
In addition, Amnesty International has documented a number of worrying attempts to introduce legislation aimed at hindering the work of civil society organizations. Since February 2019 a bill amending the Law on Non-governmental Development Organizations (Law No. 5257) has been put in the Congress’s agenda for discussion on a number of occasions. Amnesty International, along with several international human rights experts including the UN Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, has expressed concern about this proposed law which threatens the rights to defend human rights and to freedom of expression and association.
If passed, the new law would give the government broad powers to permanently put a stop to the activities of organizations for vaguely defined reasons such as disturbing public order, an ambiguous term whose interpretation could lead to the arbitrary closing down of civil society organizations and the imposition of criminal sanctions on human rights defenders that belong to them. The third and final reading of the bill prior to its approval could not take place because of the absence of quorum in Congress, but the final reading could be rescheduled at any time.
Amnesty International urges the Guatemalan authorities to publicly recognize the work of human rights defenders in Guatemala and to guarantee a safe and favourable environment in which they can carry out their work without fear of reprisals. It also urges the authorities to refrain from passing laws that impede their legitimate activities, such as Law No. 5257, and from misusing the justice system to intimidate, harass and discredit defenders. The Public Prosecutor’s Office is the primary body responsible for identifying criminal proceedings opened against human rights defenders where there is no basis for continuing the investigations and should either close these cases, or request that the judges hearing the cases do so, on the grounds that they are unfounded.

0,Syria: Unlawful attacks by government forces hit civilians and medical facilities in Idlib,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/syria-unlawful-attacks-by-government-forces-hit-civilians-and-medical-facilities-in-idlib/,"Syrian government forces, supported by Russia, hit a hospital, blood bank and other medical facilities as well as a bakery and a school in towns and cities under the control of armed opposition groups in Idlib, in what appear to be direct attacks on civilian objects or indiscriminate attacks,...","Syrian government forces, supported by Russia, hit a hospital, blood bank and other medical facilities as well as a bakery and a school in towns and cities under the control of armed opposition groups in Idlib, in what appear to be direct attacks on civilian objects or indiscriminate attacks, Amnesty International said today after verifying six attacks.
Over the past month, the Syrian government escalated its air strikes and artillery attacks on densely populated areas located on the strategic Damascus-Aleppo international highway in Idlib, known as M5.
Amnesty International interviewed 13 residents who witnessed such attacks in Saraqeb, Khan Sheikhoun, Talmans and Sheikh Idriss in Idlib. The organization verified the witness testimonies through analysis of videos, open source information and satellite imagery. At least four civilians were killed and four were injured in these attacks.
According to testimonies, the recent escalation in violence has displaced thousands of people to cities and towns close to the border with Turkey.
“Eight years into the crisis, the Syrian government continues to show utter disregard for the laws of war and the lives of civilians. Military gains have been achieved at a great cost to civilians, leading to tens of thousands of deaths and the flattening of cities and towns. Russia and Turkey, as the key backers of the parties to the conflict, should heed the warning of the UN and ensure that the imminent offensive on Idlib prioritizes the protection of civilians and does not exacerbate the humanitarian crisis,” said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International.
“The ongoing attacks in Idlib fit the same pattern we’ve seen before, in Aleppo, Daraa, Damascus Countryside, whereby Syrian government forces hit hospitals, medical facilities, emergency responders, bakeries, schools, leaving people no choice but to flee. The Syrian government, with the support of Russia, is clearly resorting to the same unlawful military tactics which led to massive displacement, in some cases forced displacement,” said Lynn Maalouf.
According to witnesses, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and the armed groups operating under its umbrella are present in several cities and towns either on checkpoints, military bases, police stations, or they conduct regular patrolling of residential neighborhoods. Also, local councils run by civilians are believed to be, in some cases by force, affiliated, supported or guarded by the Salvation Government, established in 2017 by HTS.
“HTS has an obligation to take all feasible precautions to protect civilians under its control, including by avoiding locating fighters and military objectives in the vicinity of concentrations of civilians. Recklessly placing what seems to be a military target in the proximity of medical facilities and within a populated area unlawfully endangers civilians and civilian infrastructure,” said Lynn Maalouf.
School attacked in Sheikh Idriss
On 26 March, Syrian government forces fired rockets at a school in Sheikh Idriss, east of Idlib city, around 8:30 a.m. during school hours. Two staff members in a field hospital in Saraqeb told Amnesty International that the attack had killed a 10-year-old boy and injured two other boys, ages 9 and 10, one of whom is in critical condition. According to residents, it appears that the rockets were launched from Abou Dohour military base located 20km away from Sheikh Idriss. There are no military targets in the school vicinity.
A resident who visited the school in the immediate aftermath of the attack said: “I heard the explosion and immediately headed to the school. I was there within three minutes of the attack by motorcycle… One of the rockets landed in the school playground. It seems there were kids playing then. Three were injured. One of them died… I saw the blood and the crater… there has been a lot of rocket launcher attacks from Abu Dohour airport… It was clear the school is the target because one of the rockets dropped in the playground and the rest of them dropped around the school, 200-meter radius. There are no military targets there. No HTS or any other factions. This area is located in the demilitarization zone so there is really nothing there.”
Field hospitals attacked
In Saraqeb, on 9 March, Syrian government forces dropped four munitions in an aerial attack that struck al-Hayat hospital, a blood bank, an ambulance response unit, and Syrian Civil Defense, also known as the White Helmets – all located within 100 meters of each other – according to four witnesses.
The witnesses said that the explosions caused serious damage to the structures and injured a staff member from the ambulance response unit. The al-Hayat hospital was shut down after the attack and patients in critical condition were transferred to other nearby hospitals while others were sent home, residents said.
Witnesses told Amnesty International that two civilians – a 25-year-old man and a child – were killed on the same day in aerial attacks on residential neighbourhoods around 150 meters away from another field hospital. They said the escalation in attacks on residential and other civilian buildings in the past few weeks had displaced half of the population to the outskirts of Saraqeb into the farming fields or close to the border with Turkey.
Amnesty’s Digital Verification Corps was able to corroborate many of these claims by video analysis, including the testimonies from Saraqeb residents regarding the 9 March attack on a blood bank and al-Hayat hospital on 9 March 2019.
The organization also reviewed satellite imagery recorded on 17 March 2019 and identified Al-Hayat hospital and geo-located the probable blood bank close to the hospital using verified open source information, social media photos and videos. What is likely a large crater is visible approximately 100 meters west of the hospital in a field.
Saraqeb is under the control of Liwa’ Jabhat Thuwar Saraqeb wa Rifouha [Brigade of revolutionary front of Saraqeb and countryside] which falls under HTS.
Similarly, in the village of Talmans in southern Idlib, two residents told Amnesty International that on 11 March at approximately 3:35pm, Syrian government forces shelled an area near al-Rahme private hospital. The shells fell on a nearby grain field killing two agricultural workers and injuring a third. No military targets are located in the vicinity of the attack. One of the residents told Amnesty International that persons displaced from other towns and villages are living near the hospital. He said, “Al-Rahme hospital was targeted with four shells. They all dropped next to the hospital not inside it. The hospital went out of service because the area is being targeted daily. It is a private hospital. The owner closed it to avoid other attacks.”
Amnesty International also interviewed four residents from Khan Sheikhoun, south of Idlib, who said the vast majority of residents had been displaced after escalating air strikes and artillery attacks in February destroyed or damaged homes and other buildings, including two bakeries and medical clinics located in residential buildings. A civil defense volunteer said: “The al-Rawda bakery, the central bakery in Khan, was destroyed in an air strike attack on 11:30am… I removed the bodies of two men who died in the explosion in front of the bakery on street.” Residents stated that there was no longer any operational hospital in Khan Sheikhoun after an air strike attack had destroyed the only field hospital in the town in February 2018. The closest hospital is 20km away in Maarat al-Noman.
“Deliberate attacks on civilians and on civilian objects, including hospitals and other medical facilities, and indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians are war crimes,” said Lynn Maalouf.
“Amnesty International calls on armed groups supported by Turkey in Afrin and Euphrates Shield Area to provide unfettered access to civilians fleeing the violence in Idlib. Turkey should open its borders to civilians wishing to flee and to humanitarian organizations providing impartial relief to civilians in need of assistance in parts of Syria under Turkey’s control,” said Lynn Maalouf.

Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Campaigns, said:
“Beneath the glamour of the F1, there is a far more sinister side to Bahrain, revealing the country as a deeply repressive state where anyone critical of the government can be jailed merely for posting a tweet.
“Prominent human rights defenders are under relentless attack in the country. Nabeel Rajab was shamefully convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for tweeting about the conflict in Yemen and torture allegations in Jaw Prison.
“Instead of just “sportwashing” its image and glossing over its dismal human rights record through high speed sport, the Bahraini government should immediately repeal laws that criminalize freedom of expression and fast track the release of all prisoners of conscience.”
Background
A blog: Bahrain: What lies behind the scenes of the Formula One Grand Prix 
Since mid-2016, the Bahraini authorities have embarked on a systematic campaign to eliminate organized political opposition in the country. The main targets of this far-reaching repression have been human rights defenders, journalists, political activists, Shi’a clerics and peaceful protesters. Political leaders from the majority Shi’a population have been disproportionately targeted throughout, there is not one Shi’a political leader of national stature left who has not been detained, imprisoned, or stripped of Bahraini nationality.
Earlier this month, Ebrahim Sharif was sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for three years, for a tweet criticizing Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. Sheikh Ali Salman, the leader of al-Wefaq, the main political opposition group, was sentenced to life in prison for his views perceived to be critical of the authorities.
Bahrain has used draconian legislation such as Law No. 58 of 2006 on the Protection of Society from Terrorist Acts, the Law on Political Associations, and repressive provisions of the Penal Code including Articles 134, 160, 165, 168, 214, 215, 216 and 310 to target protesters and other critics of the government.
Since 2011, more than 800 people have been stripped of their nationalities. Of those, 115 lost their citizenship following a ludicrous mass trial that relied on confessions extracted under torture.
In the country’s notorious Jaw Prison, the lack of medical care is shocking. In some instances, individuals with serious conditions like cancer, multiple sclerosis and sickle-cell anemia have been denied specialist care and medication.

Issa Amro, a...","The prosecution of Issa Amro, a prominent Palestinian human rights defender, over a social media post critical of the Palestinian authorities is another devastating blow for freedom of expression in Palestine, said Amnesty International ahead of his first court hearing on 28 March.
Issa Amro, a founding member of the Youth Against Settlements group, was arrested by Palestinian security forces on 4 September 2017 after  criticizing the Palestinian authorities on Facebook for arresting a journalist in Hebron who had been critical of President Mahmoud Abbas.
“It is disgraceful that Issa Amro is facing a prison term simply for expressing his views promoting human rights online. The Palestinian authorities should drop all charges against him immediately. Criticising an official should never be a crime. If imprisoned Issa Amro would be a Prisoner of Conscience,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
Upon his arrest by the Preventative Security Force in 2017 Issa Amro was detained for seven days during which he was allegedly tortured by interrogators from the Joint Security Committee, a body that with membership from different security forces.  He told Amnesty International that he was held in solitary confinement for five days and that he was punched and threatened with death by interrogators. He was then released on a $1,400 bail.
He has been charged with disturbing “public order” under Palestine’s draconian Electronic Crimes Law, as well as “causing strife” and “insulting the higher authorities” under the 1960 Jordanian Penal code which is still enforced in the West Bank. If convicted, he faces up to two years in prison and a fine.
When he was released after nearly a week in detention he was told that his case was being frozen as the charges would be dropped and the case closed. However, last month a Palestinian court in Hebron reopened his case in an apparent effort to intimidate him into giving up his ongoing work highlighting both Israeli and Palestinian violations.
“The Palestinian authorities have a dire track record of harassing and intimidating peaceful critics and human rights activists. The ongoing persecution of Issa Amro is a dire sign than these unlawful trends are perpetuating. The upcoming new government headed by prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh must signal quickly that is not the case and show real commitment to protecting the right of human rights defenders such as Isaa Amro”, said Saleh Higazi.
Death threats and intimidation
Issa Amro told Amnesty International that he had received death threats on social media and over the phone from supporters of Fatah, the Palestinian political party in power in the West Bank. He said that he feared for his personal safety and added that Palestinian authorities had also threatened those close to him to stop them from co-operating with him or with the organization Youth Against Settlements (YAS) which he is associated with.
Last month, Fatah released a press statement urging civil society organizations in Hebron not to work with Issa Amro or Youth Against Settlements and warning that those who do so would face retribution.
Issa Amro said that Israeli settlers in Hebron have increased their intimidation and incitement against him and members of Youth Against Settlements following the Fatah press statement.
“The Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have a duty to ensure that human rights defenders such as Issa Amro are free to carry out their work without threat, intimidation, or abuse; failure to protect such activities and deliberate interference in their work is a flagrant violation of international law,” said Saleh Higazi.
The Palestinian authorities in the West Bank should also stop using the repressive Electronic Crimes Law to persecute peaceful critics and activists and should instead reform this law to bring it in line with its obligations under international human rights law, or repeal it altogether.
“For over 50 years, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been subjected to systematic human rights violations under Israel’s brutal occupation. Activists like Issa Amro, who are uncovering what’s truly happening on the ground so that people can seek justice and redress, must be able to work without arbitrary interference,” said Saleh Higazi.
Background
Issa Amro is also being tried by an Israeli military court on 18 charges which all relate to his peaceful activism in Hebron. The next hearing for this trial is on 1 April.

The searches were held in the Crimean capital Simferopol, the nearby village of Strohonivka and the village of Volodymyrivka in the Bilohirsk district of Crimea.
In Simferopol’s district of Kamyanka, officers of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs cordoned off the neighborhood and called on residents who assembled during the operation to disperse. According to media reports, the searches were conducted with multiple procedural violations. Residents were not allowed to enter their homes and their lawyers were not permitted to be present during searches.

“Pending provisions in Brunei’s Penal Code would allow stoning and amputation as punishments – including for children, to name only their most heinous aspects,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Brunei Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Brunei must immediately halt its plans to implement these vicious punishments, and revise its Penal Code in compliance with its human rights obligations. The international community must urgently condemn Brunei’s move to put these cruel penalties into practice.”
These punishments are provided for in newly-implemented sections of the Brunei Darussalam Syariah Penal Code that are due to come into force on 3 April 2019, according to a discreet notice on the Attorney General’s website.
“To legalize such cruel and inhuman penalties is appalling of itself. Some of the potential ‘offences’ should not even be deemed crimes at all, including consensual sex between adults of the same gender,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “These abusive provisions received widespread condemnation when plans were first discussed five years ago.”
Amnesty expressed grave concerns over the Penal Code when the code’s first phase was implemented in April 2014.
“Brunei’s Penal Code is a deeply flawed piece of legislation containing a range of provisions that violate human rights,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “As well as imposing cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments, it blatantly restricts the rights to freedom of expression, religion, and belief, and codifies discrimination against women and girls.”
Background
Brunei Darussalam has signed but not yet ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and has rejected all recommendations to this effect in its human rights review at the UN in 2014.
Under international human rights law, corporal punishment in all its forms, such as stoning, amputation or whipping, constitutes torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, which is prohibited in all circumstances.
Acts of torture and other ill-treatment are absolutely proscribed in the main international human rights instruments, most of which Brunei has not signed or ratified. In addition, this prohibition is also recognized as a peremptory rule of customary international law, meaning that every state is bound by it even if they are not party to a relevant human rights treaty. All acts of torture constitute crimes under international law.
While Brunei retains the death penalty in law, it is abolitionist in practice. One new death sentence was imposed in 2017, for a drug related offence.

The IVD has investigated more than 62,000 cases of human rights violations in Tunisia dating back decades. A report containing its findings and recommendations will be handed over to the Tunisian civil society in a short ceremony tomorrow afternoon.
“This is a watershed moment for Tunisia – how the government responds to the report findings will be a crucial test of its genuine commitment to human rights. Tunisia’s authorities must take concrete steps to implement the Truth Commission’s recommendations and finally break the pattern of impunity that has marred human rights progress for decades,” said Fida Hammami, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Tunisia.
“The publication of the Truth Commission’s report and recommendations is a vital opportunity to bring to light the truth about the long-lasting patterns of grave human rights violations and bring to justice perpetrators who have remained unpunished for decades. It is also a step towards ensuring that victims receive reparation and that appalling crimes are not repeated in future.”
The IVD was set up in May 2014, in the wake of Tunisia’s 2011 uprising, to investigate past human rights violations as part of the transitional process following the end of President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali’s rule. Its mandate was to reveal the truth about, and ensure accountability for, human rights violations committed between 1955 and 2013.
It investigated violations including enforced disappearance, extrajudicial execution, torture, death due to torture, excessive use of force against peaceful protesters and killings of peaceful protesters during the 2010-2011 uprising.
It is the first commission of its kind in the Middle East and North Africa that has the power to refer cases relating to human rights directly to court. The establishment of the commission was a historic development for Tunisia where security officials accused of human rights violations are hardly ever prosecuted. The commission has so far referred at least 173 cases to court following their investigations.
At least 30 trials before criminal chambers specialized in transitional justice have started. However, very few alleged perpetrators have appeared in court and the pace of the transitional justice trials is too slow. For example, the trial in the emblematic case of Faysal Barakat, a 25-year-old student tortured to death in police custody in 1991, has yet to make any progress.
The trial began on 6 July 2018 and was recently postponed for the fourth time from 1 March 2019 until 14 June 2019.
Many of these trials face strong resistance from the security sector as the main security forces union in Tunisia has refused to cooperate with the trials claiming in various statements that these trials are vindictive and aim to weaken the security forces calling for a legislative reform to stop them.  The ministry of interior has also been reluctant to implement requests by courts to summon alleged perpetrators to the transitional justice trials.
“Tunisia’s authorities must demonstrate a clear political will to tackle impunity by protecting and enabling the specialized chambers dealing with transitional justice to carry out their work. The government must ensure that security sector members cooperate with transitional justice trials and that judges, victims and witnesses are protected from any act of intimidation or reprisal,” said Fida Hammami.
Since December 2018, the IVD has repeatedly requested a meeting with Prime Minister Youssef Chahed to submit its report to him personally but has yet to receive a response. Since its inception, the IVD has faced several attempts by the authorities to undermine its work and restrict its mandate. Government agencies such as the ministries of interior and defence did not cooperate fully with its investigations.
“The Prime Minister’s apparent unwillingness to receive the Truth Commission’s report is deeply worrying and raises concerns over the government’s commitment to the transitional justice process,” said Fida Hammami.
Amnesty International is also calling for Tunisia’s authorities to put in place guarantees to protect the Truth Commission’s archives, which include the testimonies of thousands of people, as they can put victims and witnesses at risk of reprisal if they are not properly secured.

Mr. Snowden was, of course, being actively sought by US authorities for having publicly leaked documents showing the massive extent of US surveillance practices.
Ms. Rodel, her daughter and the other five individuals have been at risk in Hong Kong ever since that time.  Joining with Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International approached the Canadian government nearly two years ago, in May 2017, urging that private sponsorship applications that been filed for their resettlement to Canada as refugees be approved. 
While it has taken longer than anyone would have wished for the successful resolution we see today for Ms. Rodel and her daughter, it is a tremendous relief to know that they are now here in Canada, where they are safe and can move forward with their lives.
Amnesty International commends the Canadian government for having taken this important step; thanks the individuals who have provided sponsorship for Ms. Rodel and her daughter; acknowledges the tremendous efforts made by the team of lawyers who have been working on these cases for several years; and expresses tremendous respect for Ms. Rodel and the courageous decision she made in 2013 to provide assistance, despite obvious personal risk, to a man who has since come to be recognized as one of the most influential global human rights figures of the past decade.
Amnesty International urges that the applications for resettlement to Canada as refugees made by the remaining five individuals — a couple from Sri Lanka and their two children, and a man from Sri Lanka — be approved with no further delay, so that they too can come to safety in Canada.

It is the partial culmination of a saga that began in 2013 when Rodel, her daughter and five other asylum seekers sheltered Edward Snowden, at the time the most wanted man in the world.
Rodel’s application to come to Canada as a privately sponsored refugee was filed in 2016 by non-profit For the Refugees. That application was finally approved by the Canadian government in January, but the decision was kept secret until now for security reasons. The other five refugees, whose applications were submitted at the same time, remain in limbo in Hong Kong as they wait for their approvals. These vulnerable refugees face documented threats of torture and death if returned to their home countries, according to Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations.
“Two are safe, five are not,” said Marc-André Séguin, president of For the Refugees. “We’re deeply grateful to the government of Canada for getting Vanessa and Keana to safety, and now we need them to finish the job.”
“Hong Kong is in the process of changing their laws to strip asylum seekers of their due process rights,” said Ethan Cox, a spokesperson with For the Refugees. “Any further delay in processing the paperwork for the other five refugees could have deadly consequences.”
“Canada has done a great thing here, giving a home to a brave woman and her young daughter,” said Cristina Rogov, a lawyer with For the Refugees. “But the clock is still ticking for three other refugees and their two small children. Like Vanessa Rodel, they have been targeted due to their association with Snowden, and like Vanessa Rodel, their lives are in Canada’s hands. It’s time for Justin Trudeau to cut through the red tape and get them to safety.”
Rob Tibbo, the Hong Kong lawyer for the families, added, “After seven years of fighting for the Snowden Refugees’ rights and freedoms, today the family of Vanessa and Keana have flown out of Hong Kong, finally leaving behind a world of racism, discrimination, exclusion and persecution. They are en route to Canada, where they will finally find safety and freedom in an inclusive society.”
“I ask Mr. Trudeau to bring an end to the nightmare the remaining Snowden Refugees are experiencing in Hong Kong,” added Tibbo, “by simply bringing them all to Canada now.”  
As privately sponsored refugees, their resettlement costs are borne by the non-profit. For the Refugees is funded by tens of thousands of small-dollar donors, who donated $149,933.60 CAD last year, the majority of which went to cover the living expenses of the families in Hong Kong. The non-profit is run by a volunteer board and has no permanent staff.

The decision gives Mr. Khadr, whose ordeal has spanned 17 years and three unanimous Canadian Supreme Court decisions in his favour, his long-awaited full freedom.
Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada noted: “The litany of serious human rights violations Mr. Khadr has endured since the beginning of this ordeal – particularly during 10 years of detention at Guantánamo Bay – include torture and ill-treatment, discrimination, arbitrary imprisonment, unfair trial, denial of consular rights and refusal to recognize his status as a child soldier.”
Neve noted further: “Mr. Khadr’s experiences were callously compounded by the defiant refusal of the Harper government to intervene and seek to uphold the rights of a Canadian citizen. Today’s judgement stands to bring this unrelenting journey through injustice to an end, after nearly 17 years. It is time, at long last, to ensure that human rights will finally and fully prevail in Omar Khadr’s case.”
Omar Khadr was serving an eight-year sentence resulting from his conviction in October 2010 by a military commission at Guantánamo Bay, when he was released on bail in May 2015 pending an appeal of that conviction. His sentence would have ended in October 2018, and he would have been eligible for parole in the fall of 2015.
His lawyers argued that even though there were technically three and a half years of his sentence left to be served since the clock stopped ticking in May 2015, Mr. Khadr’s bail conditions since then have mirrored those of conditional supervision. They argued that the court should therefore find that his sentence has, in fact, been served – and the court agreed.
The decision, rendered by Chief Justice Mary T. Moreau, found not only that Mr. Khadr had served his sentence, but also that the time Mr. Khadr spent under bail conditions was, in fact, longer than the conditional supervision would have been. She recognized that the ongoing delays in the US appeal were beyond his control, and that it would be contrary to principles of the Youth Criminal Justice Act to place him under further conditional supervision he effectively had already served while released on bail.
Amnesty International urges the Canadian government to accept this ruling and refrain from any further appeal. Moving forward, Amnesty International further urges Canada to abide by its international human rights obligations to ensure effective remedy for victims of torture by conducting a full investigation to identify and hold accountable any Canadian officials who were complicit in human rights violations Mr. Khadr has suffered over these past 17 years.  The Canadian government should also press the US government to carry out similar investigations with respect to the responsibility of US officials for the torture and other violations Omar Khadr experienced while held in US custody in Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay.

“It is great news that Reem and Rawan are now in a safer place. They showed immense courage and took huge risks to escape the repeated abuse by their male relatives. The sisters must be allowed to build their lives without living in fear that their family or the Saudi authorities will force them back.
“Reem and Rawan’s male relatives got away with repeated beatings because of the lack of adequate protection against domestic violence in the country. This is only one facet of the systemic discrimination that Saudi women face under Saudi Arabia’s repressive guardianship system. This system not only treats women like second-class citizens, it places them in grave danger. No woman or girl should fear for their life like Reem and Rawan did. Saudi Arabia must urgently reform the guardianship system and end the whole range of discriminatory laws and practices women face.”
Background
The sisters, who are aged 18 and 20 and are known by the pseudonyms Reem and Rawan, for their own protection, fled Saudi Arabia after suffering repeated beatings by male family members and being treated “like slaves.” They arrived in Hong Kong last September when transiting. Within hours, they were blocked from continuing their journey by Saudi consular agents at Hong Kong International Airport. With no other option available to them, the sisters left the airport and lived in hiding in Hong Kong.
The sisters subsequently learned that their passports had been revoked, making it impossible for them to extend their visas to remain in Hong Kong. Reem and Rawan were allowed to stay in Hong Kong as “tolerated” overstayers. The period of toleration was extended and due to expire on 8 April, while the sisters explored third country resettlement options.
Had they been taken back to Saudi Arabia, the sisters would have likely faced retaliation by their family members or criminal charges for leaving their homes without the permission of their male guardian, for escaping the country and for renouncing Islam. In Saudi Arabia, “apostasy” is a serious crime that carries the death penalty.
Under Saudi Arabia’s repressive guardianship system, women and girls face systematic discrimination, both in law and in practice. They are unable to travel, engage in paid work or higher education, or marry without the permission of a male guardian. Women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia who have campaigned against the repressive male guardianship system have been arbitrarily detained since May 2018 under conditions of torture and other ill-treatment and are now prosecuted, facing harsh prison sentences.

Since the Saudi and UAE-led coalition’s bombardment of Yemen began in March 2015, Amnesty International has documented a horrific catalogue of crimes under international law perpetrated by all, including Yemeni government forces, the Coalition and allied forces, as well as by the Huthis and allied forces.
“After four years of bloodshed in the Arab world’s poorest country, Yemenis can no longer bear the catastrophic humanitarian impact of the war. The international community must step up efforts to ensure that civilians are protected, obstacles to humanitarian assistance and arbitrary restrictions on import of essential goods are lifted, and impunity for war crimes and other violations is ended,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Campaigns Director.
The organization has documented violations by all parties to the conflict over the past four years, including indiscriminate attacks, arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment, sexual assault, and the imposition of restrictions on the entry and movement of essential goods and aid. Some of these amount to war crimes.
“Enough is enough. With the number of victims in Yemen spiralling, and the dire humanitarian situation worsening daily, these devastating violations must come to an end and those responsible must be held to account,” said Samah Hadid.
A consortium of Western states – including the USA, UK, and France – continue to supply members of the Saudi and UAE-led coalition with arms despite overwhelming evidence that they have been used to commit war crimes. Only a handful of countries have suspended arms sales, these include the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Switzerland.
For four years, Amnesty International has been campaigning for the suspension of arms transfers to the Saudi and UAE-led coalition.
“Western states must immediately halt the arms trade to warring parties. They must put human rights and the lives of millions of Yemeni civilians and their own legal obligations above lucrative arms sales,” said Samah Hadid.
For more information, read this open letter, co-signed by a coalition of civil society organizations, calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to scrap Canada’s multi-billion-dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia.

Racists and bigots believe that diverse societies don’t work. Frustrated that their howling at the moon wasn’t enough, they’re now picking up weapons in an attempt to prove themselves right. We can’t keep expressing shock and then moving on until the next outrage. We watched in astonished horror last year when a Nazi entered a US synagogue and shot dead 11 worshippers. And yet after the initial alarm, the world carried on like before. 
These haters are destabilising our societies and concerted action needs to be taken before things get even worse. 
To be clear, this isn’t just about western societies. Many Muslims see Christchurch as a small part of a global rising tide of Islamophobia perpetrated by insecure majorities. Let’s take a whistle-stop world tour from east to west. 
In Myanmar, decades of hate speech and persecution culminated in 2017 with over 700,000 predominantly Muslim Rohingya having to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh after a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing. The implicated military in Myanmar has been given plenty of diplomatic cover by China, whose authorities are currently holding up to 1 million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups  in euphemistically titled “transformation-through-education” camps in Xinjiang. It’s one of the stories of our age, subjugation on an epic scale. 
India’s historic multi-faith character has taken a hit under the leadership of Narendra Modi, a man who was chief minister during the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Muslims. His brand of Hindu nationalism has led to divisiveness rather than unity, leading to growing phenomena such as “cow-related violence”. 
Many politicians across Europe have been gaining ground by peddling anti-Muslim messages. France’s Marine Le Pen compared Muslims spilling onto pavements from packed mosques after Friday prayers to Nazi occupiers. A key message of the Brexit campaign was the “threat” of Turkey joining the EU. Arch-Brexiteer Nigel Farage once accused British Muslims of having “split loyalties”. 
The biggest beneficiary of ballot box Islamophobia though is Donald Trump with his campaign promise of a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”. He said that this ban would stay in place until the country’s representatives “can figure out what the hell is going on”. Presumably, despite all his intelligence, he’s still not got a grasp of it. Trump arrived on the back of a generation of Islamophobia which went hand-in-hand with the controversial wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, which let us not forget, resulted in the still barely acknowledged deaths of hundreds of thousands of Muslims. 
When the global picture is this grim, it’s little wonder that many Muslims feel embattled. Especially when they are also being told that despite these tragic numbers, they are actually the aggressors. 
This is not, however, a religious conflict. The millions of Muslims who have lost their lives, been put in detention, or repressed in other multifaceted ways, have not been treated this way as part of a religious war. These are not the new crusades. The perpetrators are too diverse and too disparate for this to be case. So are the victims. Christians are also repressed in China, Pakistan and Indonesia. Christian and Muslim Palestinians face violence and discrimination every day in the context of Israel’s occupation of their territory. France and Germany reported disturbingly sharp rises in anti-Semitism last year; who can forget the distressing images of swastikas daubed across graves in Jewish cemeteries in Herrlisheim and Quatzenheim in eastern France? In light of the evidence,  a ‘War on Islam’ thesis doesn’t add up. 
This is about how nation states treat their minorities. In this respect, Muslim-majority states are also often found wanting. Infamously there are no churches in Saudi Arabia. Given these circumstances, it was no surprise to see Saudi Arabia’s crown prince giving endorsement to China’s treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. 
Harmony isn’t going to be achieved if only we had more interfaith dialogue and more mosque open days. Tackling this threat effectively requires a radical rethink about how we talk about freedom, equality and respect for all. 
The strength of a nation lies in how well you treat all your people. It’s a mark of strength when you celebrate everyone who lives alongside you. We move forward when everyone has the freedom to live their lives as they wish, to contribute to their society as they see fit, and to be the people they want to be. 
I grew up in Scotland and am proud of my nationality and my faith. We used to say that it takes many different coloured threads to make tartan, just as it takes many different types of people to make Scotland.  Every culture around the world must find their language to bring people together, rather than to drive them apart. In 1945, the Nazis were defeated through war. This time, we’ll beat the haters through the force of our love, compassion and shared humanity.

Amnesty International is concerned about the consequences this has on the human rights situation of Palestinians living in the occupied territories. 
The three-page letter calls on the Canadian government to uphold its duties under international law by ensuring that settlement goods are barred from Canada and business is not benefiting from human rights violations caused by the ongoing occupation. 
Bill C-85 was introduced in the House of Commons in October 2018 and adopted on February 8, 2019. The amendments to Bill C-85 make no distinction between products made on illegal Israeli settlements and other Israeli products. Failure to make this distinction is destructive to the human rights situation for the Palestinian people living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 
Amnesty International’s letter raises concerns about the impact of this trade agreement on the human rights situation for the Palestinians living in the OPT, and specifically, the expansion and viability of the illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land. 
The Canadian government’s adoption of Bill C-85 implies that Canada is not only accepting the illegal construction of settlement homes and infrastructure on Palestinian land, but is actively contributing to Israeli and international businesses in settlements which have established a thriving economy to sustain their presence and expansion. This “settlement enterprise”, which relies on unlawfully appropriated Palestinian resources, including land, water and minerals, to produce goods that are exported and sold for private profit, is inherently illegal and causes tremendous harm to Palestinians in the OPT. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of settlement goods are exported internationally each year, providing resources for sustaining illegal Israeli settlements and perpetuating grave violations. Our recent report ‘Destination: Occupation’ documents some of the ways settlement businesses (such as those related to tourism) have had devastating consequences for Palestinian communities. 
 Through the adoption of Bill C85, the Canadian government is facilitating and contributing to the financial growth of the illegal settlements. In doing so, the Canadian government fails to meet its obligation under international law not to recognize as lawful an illegal situation. Canada must take action to stop the financial support and expansion of settlements and ban settlement goods from entering its markets. 
For over the past 50 years, Israel has demolished tens of thousands of Palestinian properties and displaced large swathes of the population to build homes and infrastructure to illegally settle its own population in the occupied territories. It has also diverted Palestinian natural resources such as water and agricultural land for settlement use. 
Israel has also used tourism as an opportunity to strengthen its occupation and control of the Palestinian people. Corporations like Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia and TripAdvisor list numerous hotels, B&Bs, attractions and tours in Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). They do so despite knowing that Israel’s settlements are illegal under international law, and a war crime. 
Destination: Occupation is part of Amnesty’s Occupation @50 campaign, which was launched in June 2017, the 50 year anniversary of the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Occupation @50 made a bold, new call on states to ban Israeli settlement goods from entering their markets, and to stop companies domiciled in their territories from operating in settlements or trading in their goods.  Destination: Occupation aims at covering the online tourism industry and its role in helping maintain and grow illegal Israeli settlements. The report draws on Amnesty International’s extensive research into Israel’s human rights violations in the OPT over decades and examines the operations of four international digital tourism companies: Airbnb Inc (operator of Airbnb), Booking.com BV (Booking.com), Expedia Group Inc. (Expedia and Hotels.com), and TripAdvisor Inc. (TripAdvisor). It exposes their activities related to Israeli settlements in the OPT and how these activities contribute to and benefit from Israel’s violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

The court found that the bar violated Section 15 of the Charter, the right to equality and non-discrimination.
DCO claimants are those whose country of origin is designated by the Minister as a country that is less likely to produce refugees. There are currently 42 countries designated as a DCO, including Mexico, which continues to face an unrelenting human rights crisis in such areas as violence against women, disappearances and torture, and Hungary, where there are well-documented cases, including by Amnesty, of persecution of Roma people.
An application for a PRRA allows an individual under a removal order to be able to have the risk of persecution they might face upon deportation be examined by an officer. Submitting a PRRA application results in an automatic stay of deportation until the application is reviewed and a decision is rendered.
In his decision this week, Feher et al v Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, 2019 FC 335, Justice Boswell noted that “timely access to a PRRA is a significant benefit for failed refugee claimants and delaying this access to some claimants based on their country of origin impairs their right to equality” (para 296). The court also noted that there is an unmitigated risk of refoulement for DCO claimants as a result of the 36-month PRRA bar (para 293).
There are several ways in which DCO claimants are disadvantaged in the refugee protection system. In fact, this decision comes 4 years after a decision from the same court to strike down the bar on DCO claimants from being able to appeal denied refugee claims to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). In that decision, YZ v Canada, 2015 FC 892, the court found that denying access to the RAD was a violation of the right to equality and non-discrimination.
DCO claimants are currently subjected to a shortened timeline to submit their refugee claim (45 days as compared with 60 days for non-DCO claimants), they do not have access to an automatic stay of removal while an appeal is being heard or a judicial review of a RAD decision is being considered, and cannot apply for a work permit until after 180 days have elapsed since their claim is referred to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD).
DCO claimants are also ineligible to apply for a PRRA for 36 months from the date of rejection of their claim, while failed non-DCO refugee claimants must wait 12 months. This difference in treatment for failed non-DCO and DCO claimants was the impugned issue in this week’s decision.
“Amnesty International has long advocated for Canada to do away with the DCO regime altogether. Making distinctions between safe and unsafe countries of origin not only leads to unequal and unfair treatment, to draw the line is inherently subjective and arbitrary,” Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, said. “Refugee claimants from DCO countries must rebut the presumption that the country they are fleeing is, in fact, safe. This presumption has the effect of insinuating that the refugee claimant is fabricating or has no sound basis to their story before their claim is even considered. This is contrary to basic refugee law principles which require decision makers to presume a refugee claimant is telling the truth unless there is a reason, such as serious inconsistencies, to disbelieve them.”
“Although neither decision strikes down the DCO regime itself, they both show that there are serious constitutional problems with the DCO regime,” Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Advocacy and Policy Campaigner at Amnesty International Canada noted. “The effect of the DCO regime has been to systematically violate the rights of refugee claimants. In 2018, 52% of the claims from Hungary were accepted, even though Hungary is on the DCO list.”
Instead of further tweaking a fundamentally rights-violating system, Amnesty International urges Canada to refrain from appealing the decision and take immediate steps to do away with the DCO regime altogether. Canada must ensure a fair process for all refugee claimants regardless of national origin. Every refugee claimant should be given a fair hearing and guaranteed due process.

“It has been nearly two months since Truong Duy Nhat disappeared from a Bangkok shopping centre, shortly after submitting an asylum claim and following growing harassment by Vietnamese police. Reports that Nhat is now in a Hanoi prison are extremely worrying, and we are calling on the Vietnamese authorities to confirm whether he is in their custody and disclose his whereabouts at once,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Adviser.
“The Vietnamese and Thai authorities need to come clean about why and how Nhat returned to Viet Nam so soon after he applied for asylum in Bangkok. There is a strong possibility that he was transferred to Vietnamese custody despite the real risk of serious human rights violations,” said Joanne Mariner. “Nhat is a journalist and a former prisoner of conscience who has already suffered greatly for peacefully expressing his political views. If he is being detained he should be given immediate access to legal counsel and brought before a judge. Unless the Vietnamese authorities can show valid grounds to detain Nhat they must free him immediately.”
According to several media reports, including from Radio Free Asia (RFA), where Nhat published a regular blog, Nhat’s friends and family have recently been able to confirm his detention in Hanoi’s T-16 jail, although they have not yet been able to visit him. He has been reportedly held at the prison since 28 January 2019, shortly after he was last seen in Bangkok.
Credible information indicates that Nhat was seized by unidentified men in a Bangkok shopping centre called Future Park on 26 January 2019.
Truong Duy Nhat  fled Viet Nam in early January 2019. He submitted an asylum claim at the Bangkok office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on 25 January 2019, the day before he disappeared. That day, he sent his relatives two photos of himself at the UNHCR gate. He was also in touch with his employers at RFA. He had not been heard from since the following day.
Truong Duy Nhat was previously jailed from 2013 to 2015 on charges of ‘conducting propaganda against the state for his work as an independent journalist and commentator. Amnesty International considered him a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression. After his release he continued working as an independent journalist. In December 2018, he received reports that he was likely to be re-arrested, and he noticed a heightened police presence near his house, prompting him to leave the country.

NEWSFLASH
March 21, 2019
OTTAWA – Whether it’s the devastating legacy of mercury contamination at Grassy Narrows, ongoing pollution from the Mount Polley mining disaster, or the looming threat of the Site C dam construction, Amnesty International says government decisions that ignore the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples must be recognized as a form of environmental racism.
“It’s no coincidence that three of our highest priority human rights cases in Canada all revolve around contamination and threats to the rivers and lakes on which Indigenous peoples depend for their livelihoods and ways of life,” says Tara Scurr, business and human rights campaigner with Amnesty International Canada. “Far too often, governments in Canada have demonstrated that they place little value on the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples and the revitalization of their cultures and traditions. That’s why we are marking World Water Day by renewing our commitment to support the Indigenous water defenders leading these crucial and inspiring human rights struggles.”
It is the responsibility of resource development companies to respect human rights – and for our governments to swiftly act when they do not.
In B.C.’s Quesnel Lake region, the site of the Mount Polley tailing pond collapse in August 2014, people like Bev Sellars have been fighting to hold those responsible to account. Sellars, the former chief of the Xat’sull First Nation, filed private charges against the Mount Polley Mining Corporation, but in 2018, the province stayed those charges. This is in addition to a criminal investigation launched by B.C.’s Conservation Officer Service and the RCMP in 2015. However, nearly five years since the disaster, the public is still waiting to learn if any charges will be laid by the Aug. 4, 2019 deadline. Despite all this, Mount Polley is permitted to discharge mine waste water into Quesnel Lake. Residents are fighting the discharge permit before B.C.’s Environmental Appeal board.
“We have already lost access to our land, traditional foods and medicines,” said Sellars. “We can’t afford to sit back and watch more toxic waste being dumped into our sacred waterways. The province of B.C. may have stepped aside, but we will not let our livelihoods be destroyed.”
A recent health study demonstrates the depths of the health crisis experienced by the Grassy Narrows First Nation as the result of mercury poisoning, including learning disabilities and nervous system disorders among youth born long after the initial disaster. In the 1960s, a paper mill dumped mercury into the English and Wabigoon river system in Northwestern Ontario, contaminating the water and poisoning the fish. Although members of Grassy Narrows have long known that mercury poisoning has impacted the health of the community, the federal and provincial governments have done little to address their needs, or even acknowledge the crisis.
“We won’t stop demanding justice until all the members of our community have access to the supports and care that they need,” said Grassy Narrows First Nation Chief Rudy Turtle. “Despite the impacts on our community of decades of mercury poisoning, our incredible children and youth have demonstrated their resilience by drawing so much public attention to our struggle. We need Prime Minister Trudeau to do everything in his power to join us in preventing more generations from bearing the brunt of this environmental crisis.”
Meanwhile, construction of the Site C dam is underway in the Peace Valley, despite a United Nations committee’s calls to immediately halt the project. In a letter issued in December, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) gave the federal and B.C. governments until April 2019 to prove that steps are being taken to suspend construction of the multibillion-dollar public dam project. Any further construction work could permanently damage the land rights of Indigenous peoples in the Peace River area.
“Our people are living with the harm caused by previous dams on the Peace River and now the B.C. government wants to take away some of the most critical cultural and ecological areas that are left for us,” said Chief Roland Willson of the West Moberly First Nations. “There’s a good reason that this project has been condemned by the UN’s top anti-racism body. The only question now is whether the federal and provincial governments will listen and act.”
On Friday, March 22, World Water Day will serve as a reminder that the fight is far from over for those living in West Moberly First Nation, the Quesnel Lake region and Grassy Narrows. The ongoing environmental crises in these communities are the result of massive resource development projects that either have had or risk having irreversible harmful effects on the communities’ water sources, cultural practices and way of life.
These destructive environmental crises exemplify a pattern of rights violations experienced by Indigenous peoples that amounts to environmental racism. For too long, the rights of those living in these affected communities have been ignored.
On this World Water Day, let us act in solidarity with Indigenous peoples in the Peace Valley, Grassy Narrows and Quesnel Lake areas whose livelihoods and cultural identities depend on healthy rivers and lakes.

At the Nordic Electric Vehicle (EV) Summit in Oslo, the organization is highlighting how lithium-ion batteries, which power electric cars and electronics, are linked to human rights abuses including child labour in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and environmental risks which could undermine their green potential.
“Finding effective solutions to the climate crisis is an absolute imperative, and electric cars have an important role to play in this. But without radical changes, the batteries which power green vehicles will continue to be tainted by human rights abuses,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“The massive global corporations that dominate the electric vehicle industry have the resources and expertise to create energy solutions that are truly clean and fair, and we are challenging them to come back to Oslo next year with proof of real progress. With demand for batteries soaring, now is the time for a drastic overhaul of our energy sources that prioritizes protection of human rights and the environment.”
Human rights violations linked to mineral extraction
Electric vehicles are key to shifting the motor industry away from fossil fuels, but they are currently not as ethical as some retailers would like us to believe. Years of unregulated industry practices have led to detrimental human rights and environmental impacts, which governments and industry are not doing enough to tackle.
Amnesty International has documented serious human rights violations linked to the extraction of the minerals used in lithium-ion batteries, particularly in the DRC. A 2016 investigation found children and adults in southern DRC working in hand-dug cobalt mines facing serious health risks, neither protected by the government nor respected by companies that profit from their labour. Amnesty’s research has linked these mines to the supply chains of many of the world’s leading electronics brands and electric vehicle companies.
Despite projections that the demand for cobalt will reach 200,000 tons per year by 2020, no country legally requires companies to publicly report on their cobalt supply chains. With more than half of the world’s cobalt originating in southern DRC, the chance that the batteries powering electric vehicles are tainted with child labour and other abuses is unacceptably high.
There has been some progress since 2016. In response to Amnesty’s research several leading companies, including Apple, BMW, Daimler, Renault, and the battery manufacturer Samsung SDI, have published data about their supply chains, and the organization is today calling on others to do the same.
Amnesty International has also begun documenting violations of the human rights of Indigenous peoples living near lithium mines in Argentina. Indigenous communities are not being properly consulted about mining projects on their lands and are given insufficient information about the potential impacts of mining on their water sources. Without human rights protections, the harm to Indigenous communities could increase as lithium demand soars. 
Other emerging threats
The environmental impact of producing batteries is also a concern. Most of the current manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries is concentrated in China, South Korea and Japan, where electricity generation remains dependent on coal and other polluting sources of power.
This means that, while electric vehicles are essential for shifting away from fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, more needs to be done to reduce the carbon footprint within the manufacturing phase. Meanwhile, rising demand for minerals like cobalt, manganese and lithium has led to a surge in interest in deep-sea mining, which studies predict will have serious and irreversible impacts on biodiversity.
Amnesty International is also calling on companies to ensure that batteries are disposed of responsibly. There is already significant evidence showing that battery waste from electronics, which contains various hazardous materials, has been irresponsibly disposed of, contaminating soil, water and air. 
“Every stage of the battery lifecycle, from mineral extraction to disposal, carries human rights and environmental risks,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“We need to change course now, or those least responsible for climate change – indigenous communities and children – will pay the price for the shift away from fossil fuels. The energy solutions of the future must not be based on the injustices of the past.”
An alternative vision
Using the Nordic EV Summit as a platform, Amnesty International today outlined its vision for an ethical battery which does not harm human rights or the environment at any stage of its lifecycle. The organization is calling for action by government, industry, innovators, investors and consumers to create an ethical and sustainable battery, which can be used for electric vehicles and in the electronic industry, within five years.
Amnesty International’s work will focus on all three phases of the battery lifecycle:
Extraction: Mapping supply chains of key minerals, calling for human rights impacts to be identified, prevented and addressed, and calling for a prohibition on commercial deep-sea mining;
Manufacturing: Calling for carbon footprints to be properly disclosed, minimised, and offset; and for rights to and at work, including health, equality and non-discrimination, to be legally protected and enforced;
Re-use and recovery: Calling for products to be designed and regulated so that their potential for re-use is optimised and waste is penalized; and illegal or dangerous exportation and dumping of batteries is prevented.
The challenge to companies
Amnesty International today emphasized that electric vehicle and electronics companies have a responsibility to ensure their products do not contribute to or perpetuate human rights abuses. The organization is calling on industry leaders to commit to a radical overhaul of their approach to energy solutions.
As a first step, companies should publicly disclose information about how human rights abuses and environmental risks are being prevented, identified and addressed throughout the lithium-ion battery’s lifecycle.
“With a climate crisis looming, consumers have the right to demand that products marketed as the ethical choice really stand up to scrutiny,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“Companies who overlook human rights concerns as they clean up their energy sources are presenting their customers with a false choice; people or planet. This approach is gravely flawed and will not deliver the sustainable changes we need to save humanity from climate devastation. We are asking industry leaders to think hard about what kind of future they want to build.”
Background
Amnesty is collaborating with Greenpeace USA to identify and map human rights and environmental impacts throughout the battery lifecycle, including critical points of intervention need to produce an ethical battery.
Efforts are underway in Norway to create a legal requirement on corporate actors to conduct human rights due diligence.

Almost two years after they were first arrested, two prominent figures from Amnesty International Turkey and nine other human rights defenders must be acquitted of the absurd charges they still face, said Amnesty International ahead of their trial which resumes tomorrow in Istanbul. 
Taner Kılıç, Amnesty Turkey’s Honorary Chair, and İdil Eser, the organization’s former Turkey Director, are being tried alongside nine other activists on baseless allegations of “membership of a terrorist organisation”.  
“After almost two years and without a shred of credible evidence presented to substantiate the absurd charges made against them, it is now time to end this judicial farce and acquit Taner and the Istanbul 10,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Over the course of six trial hearings, the prosecutor’s case against the human rights defenders has been comprehensively disproven. The court must now finally lift the threat of conviction that needlessly hangs over their heads and put an end to their ordeal.”  
Taner Kılıç spent more than 14 months in prison before his release on bail in August 2018. Eight of the Istanbul 10 spent almost four months each behind bars before they were bailed in October 2017.  
“Taner and the Istanbul 10 have dedicated their lives to defending the rights of others and are potent symbols of what is happening under the government’s relentless crackdown in Turkey today,” said Kumi Naidoo. 
“Human rights defenders in Turkey spend their days either languishing in jail or living in constant fear of prosecution and imprisonment. The Istanbul 10 and Taner should be exonerated and all those jailed merely for defending human rights must be immediately and unconditionally released.”

Are you committed to kindness and respect? Do you want to learn more about Amnesty International’s work? Then the Amnesty International Human Rights College (HRC) is the opportunity for you! 
Not convinced yet? Here are four reasons to apply to the 2019 Human Rights College in Toronto, Ontario! Read on to find out why previous HRC participants: Fatima, Sareema, Amanda, and Rachel decided to apply, their favourite parts, and what they are up to now! 
 
My name is Fatima Beydoun and I attended the Human Rights College (HRC) that took place in Calgary in 2017. I decided to apply for the Human Rights college mainly for the reason that Amnesty International (AI) Canada was relatively new to me and I hadn’t known much beyond the online presence I was exposed to, but knew that working against injustices was a passion of mine. After attending a few roundtables that took place in Halifax leading up to the College, my interest in AI Canada surged and I wanted to learn about different ways in which I could host community events to promote various human rights initiatives while collaborating with other youth from across the country. My favourite part of HRC was a “speed dating” portion where the participants were able to connect with staff and directors of AI Canada involved at various levels who were able to share with us the work that they do within the organization and answer any of the questions we had. The whole experience truly informed and shaped my activism in allowing me to develop a sense of confidence to share the knowledge I gained with others by getting heavily involved with my university’s AI Canada chapter the following fall. I am now the Co-president of that society and sit as a member of the National Youth and Action Advisory Committee for AI Canada, where I have the opportunity to carry out campaigns for various causes in my community. 
 
My name is Sareema Husain (pictured on the left)  and I attended the Human Rights College in 2017. I decided to apply because I found that although I was passionate and motivated about activism, I wasn’t seeing that translate into effective change. I wanted to gain practical skills to reel people in, especially when it came to publicizing events and media storytelling on human rights issues. My favourite part of the HRC was an opening talk by an indigenous elder. He said “we must do more than talk about reconciliation. We must practice reconciliation in our everyday lives, with ourselves and our communities first”. My biggest takeaway from the HRC was that change does not always arise from hard discipline or using guilt as a propeller for action. The most effective thing you can do is lead by example. My time with Amnesty and HRC connected me with like-minded youth and led me to create “The Matchstick”, Amnesty’s Youth Newspaper.  Though the newspaper hasn’t had much traction lately, it was heartening to know Amnesty was eager to provide the resources needed in order for youth to feel legitimized and have their voices heard. If you have a big idea regarding human rights awareness and are not sure how to make it happen, attend HRC! You won’t regret it. 
 
My name is Amanda Cha (pictured in the centre), one of the attendees of the 2017 HRC in Calgary. I decided to apply because I was part of my high school Amnesty International Club, but I wanted to be more directly involved with the organization. I was also interested to see how people across Canada with a variety of backgrounds are viewing Amnesty’s work and current human rights issues. In addition, I already lived in Calgary, so it was an opportunity that I could not miss! My favourite part of the HRC was the people–the participants, the organizers, and everyone who agreed to share their knowledge. It was fascinating to observe a wide range of perspectives on social issues and how Amnesty operates. My HRC experiences helped furthering my ongoing activism, as I gained information on how to get more involved with Amnesty, including being part of this HRC organizing committee! Furthermore, with more knowledge on how Amnesty is structured and managed, I am able to provide stronger arguments when encouraging people to support Amnesty. 
 
My name is Rachel Saunders (pictured on the left) and I attended the Human Rights College in Calgary 2017. I decided to apply because I had attended a workshop Amnesty put on for youth activists that January. I fell in love with the organization and wanted to continue to show my support in any way possible. The Human Rights College seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn more about Amnesty International and how I could make a difference in my own community. The biggest take away from the HRC was how incredibly loving and kind everyone was. Everyone made you feel welcomed and were extremely encouraging. I’ve made some friends there that I still keep in touch with to this day. By attending the HRC I was able to get in contact with my local field worker who helped me start an Amnesty International Society at my university. It taught me that even the simplest acts can make a huge difference in an individual’s life.

Not convinced yet? Here are four reasons to apply to the 2019 Human Rights College in Toronto, Ontario! Read on to find out why previous HRC participants: Fatima, Sareema, Amanda, and Rachel decided to apply, their favourite parts, and what they are up to now! 
 
My name is Fatima Beydoun and I attended the Human Rights College (HRC) that took place in Calgary in 2017. I decided to apply for the Human Rights college mainly for the reason that Amnesty International (AI) Canada was relatively new to me and I hadn’t known much beyond the online presence I was exposed to, but knew that working against injustices was a passion of mine. After attending a few roundtables that took place in Halifax leading up to the College, my interest in AI Canada surged and I wanted to learn about different ways in which I could host community events to promote various human rights initiatives while collaborating with other youth from across the country. My favourite part of HRC was a “speed dating” portion where the participants were able to connect with staff and directors of AI Canada involved at various levels who were able to share with us the work that they do within the organization and answer any of the questions we had. The whole experience truly informed and shaped my activism in allowing me to develop a sense of confidence to share the knowledge I gained with others by getting heavily involved with my university’s AI Canada chapter the following fall. I am now the Co-president of that society and sit as a member of the National Youth and Action Advisory Committee for AI Canada, where I have the opportunity to carry out campaigns for various causes in my community. 
 
My name is Sareema Husain (pictured on the left)  and I attended the Human Rights College in 2017. I decided to apply because I found that although I was passionate and motivated about activism, I wasn’t seeing that translate into effective change. I wanted to gain practical skills to reel people in, especially when it came to publicizing events and media storytelling on human rights issues. My favourite part of the HRC was an opening talk by an indigenous elder. He said “we must do more than talk about reconciliation. We must practice reconciliation in our everyday lives, with ourselves and our communities first”. My biggest takeaway from the HRC was that change does not always arise from hard discipline or using guilt as a propeller for action. The most effective thing you can do is lead by example. My time with Amnesty and HRC connected me with like-minded youth and led me to create “The Matchstick”, Amnesty’s Youth Newspaper.  Though the newspaper hasn’t had much traction lately, it was heartening to know Amnesty was eager to provide the resources needed in order for youth to feel legitimized and have their voices heard. If you have a big idea regarding human rights awareness and are not sure how to make it happen, attend HRC! You won’t regret it. 
 
My name is Amanda Cha (pictured in the centre), one of the attendees of the 2017 HRC in Calgary. I decided to apply because I was part of my high school Amnesty International Club, but I wanted to be more directly involved with the organization. I was also interested to see how people across Canada with a variety of backgrounds are viewing Amnesty’s work and current human rights issues. In addition, I already lived in Calgary, so it was an opportunity that I could not miss! My favourite part of the HRC was the people–the participants, the organizers, and everyone who agreed to share their knowledge. It was fascinating to observe a wide range of perspectives on social issues and how Amnesty operates. My HRC experiences helped furthering my ongoing activism, as I gained information on how to get more involved with Amnesty, including being part of this HRC organizing committee! Furthermore, with more knowledge on how Amnesty is structured and managed, I am able to provide stronger arguments when encouraging people to support Amnesty. 
 
My name is Rachel Saunders (pictured on the left) and I attended the Human Rights College in Calgary 2017. I decided to apply because I had attended a workshop Amnesty put on for youth activists that January. I fell in love with the organization and wanted to continue to show my support in any way possible. The Human Rights College seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn more about Amnesty International and how I could make a difference in my own community. The biggest take away from the HRC was how incredibly loving and kind everyone was. Everyone made you feel welcomed and were extremely encouraging. I’ve made some friends there that I still keep in touch with to this day. By attending the HRC I was able to get in contact with my local field worker who helped me start an Amnesty International Society at my university. It taught me that even the simplest acts can make a huge difference in an individual’s life.

More than 100 strikes by US drones and manned aircraft since early 2017
Strikes in Somalia tripled under Trump, outpacing Yemen and Libya combined 
The US government must carry out impartial, thorough investigations into credible evidence its rapidly escalating air strikes in Somalia have killed numerous civilians, Amnesty International said in a new report today.
The Hidden US War in Somalia details how 14 civilians were killed and eight more injured in just five of the more than 100 strikes in the past two years. These five incidents were carried out with Reaper drones and manned aircraft in Lower Shabelle, a region largely under Al-Shabaab control outside the Somali capital Mogadishu. The attacks appear to have violated international humanitarian law, and some may amount to war crimes.
When approached with Amnesty International’s findings, the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) repeated its denial that any civilians have been killed in its operations in Somalia.
“The civilian death toll we’ve uncovered in just a handful of strikes suggests the shroud of secrecy surrounding the US role in Somalia’s war is actually a smokescreen for impunity,” said Brian Castner, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Advisor on Arms and Military Operations.
“Our findings directly contradict the US military’s mantra of zero civilian casualties in Somalia. That claim seems all the more fanciful when you consider the USA has tripled its air strikes across the country since 2016, outstripping their strikes in Libya and Yemen combined.”
In the course of their investigation Amnesty International researchers travelled to Somalia, conducted more than 150 interviews with eyewitnesses, relatives, persons displaced by the fighting, and expert sources – including in the US military – and rigorously analysed corroborating evidence, including satellite imagery, munition fragments, and photos from the aftermath of air strikes.
Strikes proliferate after Trump weakens safeguards
The number of US strikes in Somalia surged after 30 March 2017, when President Trump signed an Executive Order declaring southern Somalia an “area of active hostilities”.
US forces carried out 34 strikes in Somalia in the last nine months of 2017 – more than in the entire five years from 2012 to 2016. This increased again in 2018, to 47 strikes; and there have already been 24 in the first two months of 2019 alone.
According to a retired US Brigadier General Amnesty International spoke to, this lessened the burden on the US military to guarantee that civilians will not be killed in air strikes. Worryingly, the General also believes that the Executive Order widened the net of potential targets to include virtually any adult male living in villages sympathetic to Al-Shabaab and seen in proximity to known fighters. Such a broad targeting mandate would violate international humanitarian law and lead to unlawful killing of civilians.
For example, in a strike on the hamlet of Farah Waeys, AFRICOM claims that “all individuals injured or killed were members or affiliates of Al-Shabaab,” while Amnesty International has documented that two civilian men were killed, and five women and children injured, in addition to Al-Shabaab casualties.
Damning evidence of civilian casualties
Amnesty International uncovered compelling evidence that US air strikes killed a total of 14 civilians and injured eight more, in five attacks that may have violated international humanitarian law and could, in some cases, constitute war crimes. Reports of more civilian casualties from other strikes could not be sufficiently corroborated for inclusion in the report.
In one case, a US military air strike in farmland near the village of Darusalaam killed three local farmers in the early morning hours of 12 November 2017. They were resting in the open after working well into the night digging irrigation canals.
At around 3am an air strike targeted them without warning. The blast sent other farmers scrambling for cover and woke residents of two nearby villages. Villagers who went to recover the bodies at first light described the men’s horrific injuries.
Amnesty International later analysed photographic evidence of the bodies that is consistent with eyewitness testimony. Two of the men were badly disfigured. A large ordnance fragment entered the first man’s forehead, collapsing his skull; his forearms were blown backward and nearly torn off, but for a thin flap of skin. The second man’s face, throat and chest were pockmarked by multiple ordnance fragments. The third man had a large wound on his side, and a small blow to his head, just above the right eye.
A farmer from Darusalaam village told Amnesty International: “The noise of the plane was louder than before, the day the attack happened. The weeks before, it used to come and leave, only that night it was not leaving. It was coming and coming and coming. When the noise [of an air strike] happened, everything ceased…I was so frightened. I couldn’t keep watch on the farm at all. I went under the shelter of the tree and hid… These three young men were not expecting to be killed by a plane, and we did not expect the world to be silent.”
As in the other cases Amnesty International investigated, multiple local residents identified the victims as civilians and not Al-Shabaab fighters.
Photos of the three dead farmers and the surrounding area allowed Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps to pin down the location of the air strike.
They also provide other important clues, such as fractured dirt and a one-metre crater produced by high explosives, as well as ordnance fragments that indisputably come from a GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition. This type of weapon can only be launched from the US Air Force’s AC-130 aircraft, a gunship most often used in close air support of infantry, not in isolated air strikes. Not seen in Somalia in over a decade, the aircraft’s presence marks an escalation of the conflict. AFRICOM has not reported the employment of AC-130s, but it did confirm that it carried out an air strike in the Lower Shabelle region at approximately 3am on 12 November 2017, claiming that it had killed “several” militants.
In another case, five civilians, including two children, were killed when a suspected Al-Shabaab truck exploded as it passed through the hamlet of Illimey on 6 December 2017. Satellite imagery shows that up to 10 structures were partially destroyed in the blast and resulting fires.
A friend of one of those killed heard the blast from Farsoley, a village 14km away: “It was huge…within about five minutes, I could see a huge dark smoke going up. We all said something really terrible happened…I rushed to the scene…[the truck] was completely destroyed. The whole village was burned. All the trees nearby were also burned. There was a big hole where the [truck] was hit.”
While AFRICOM categorically denies having launched the attack on Illimey, there is compelling evidence that an air strike was involved, and a US security agency may be responsible.
Media reports and multiple eyewitnesses said that the explosion occurred when a munition was fired at the vehicle from the air. Eyewitnesses recall seeing or hearing an aircraft either before or after the attack, and Amnesty International reviewed satellite imagery that is consistent with an air strike being the cause of the explosion.
Higher death toll likely
US forces are known to have carried out a further 76 air strikes in Somalia during the period Amnesty International examined, as well as 24 in the first two months of 2019, so the civilian death toll may well be much higher.
For Somalis affected by US air strikes, there has been little, if any, chance of obtaining justice. It is near impossible to even report the killing or injury of family or community members, given the location of these attacks and the security risks associated with doing so.
“The US government must ensure investigations into all credible allegations of civilian casualties are carried out, with accountability for those responsible for violations and reparation made to the victims and survivors,” said Ella Knight, Military, Security and Police Researcher at Amnesty International.
“Both the US and Somali governments need to put an end the lack of transparency and must do more to enable affected communities to self-report civilian casualties – without this, justice is likely to remain elusive.”

The organization said the focus should be on saving people who are still trapped in the affected areas and ensuring that humanitarian assistance is provided to so that people’s basic needs are met and their human rights are protected.
With the cyclone expected to move further west, the authorities should also aim to mitigate further loss of life by devising early-warning mechanisms and other risk-reduction strategies.
“The Southern African Development Community and the international community must provide the necessary resources to aid rescue efforts in the countries hit by Cyclone Idai in order to save lives and provide relief for those who have lost their homes and livelihoods,” said Muleya Mwananyanda, Deputy Regional Director for Southern Africa.
Cyclone Idai hit Zimbabwe and Mozambique between 14 and 16 March. The powerful cyclone was predicted by the South African Weather Service on 11 March.
Hundreds of people remain trapped in the cyclone-hit areas, while some are still unaccounted for.
Mozambican president, Filipe Nyusi, has said that the death toll could be as high as 1000.
Zimbabwe’s eastern Chimanimani district and Mozambique’s Beira are among the worst hit. According to the United Nations, nearly 10,000 people were affected by the cyclone in Zimbabwe.
Mozambique and Zimbabwe are vulnerable to flooding during the rainy season, with previous disasters having caused fatalities and left people homeless. The number of cyclones and extreme floods have been increasing in Southern Africa due to the change in weather patterns likely caused by climate change.
“As the effects of climate change intensify, these extreme weather conditions can be expected to revisit us more frequently. The devastation wrought by Cyclone Idai is yet another wake-up call for the world to put in place ambitious climate change mitigation measures,” said Muleya Mwananyanda.
“Regional leaders and governments of wealthier countries must support effective early-warning systems, disaster preparedness and climate change adaptation strategies to save lives and protect human rights.”
Under international human rights law, the primary responsibility to provide assistance and protection to the victims of the disaster lies with the governments of the affected countries. However, other countries also have the obligation to provide assistance through international cooperation if this is needed to protect human rights.

At least three unidentified individuals seen moving around his house doing surveillance  
Authorities in Equatorial Guinea should immediately return a passport and phone to a prominent human rights activist who was banned from leaving the country and then handcuffed, put on a military plane and sent back to his home town, Amnesty International said today, with a call to guarantee his safety and freedom of movement.
Alfredo Okenve was arrested on 15 March after having been banned from receiving in the capital Malabo the “Franco-German prize for human rights” for his work. 
“This ban shows how determined the authorities are in restricting Alfredo Okenve’s ability to do his legitimate work in Equatorial Guinea even when he is due to receive an award for his courageous work to defend and promote human rights,” said Marta Colomer, Amnesty International’s Senior Campaigner for West Africa.
“Sending him back handcuffed on a military plane will not stop Alfredo Okenve and many other activists in the country from standing up for human rights. The authorities should immediately take all necessary measures to lift the restrictions on his freedom of movement and allow him to carry on doing his work safely, without any threats, attacks or other form of harassment.”
Alfredo Okenve, president of the Center for Development Studies and Initiatives (CEID), was informed at the end of last year that he had won the prize awarded by the French and German embassies. He left Bata, his home town, to arrive in the capital Malabo where the award was due to be given to him during a ceremony in the afternoon of 15 March. 
In the morning, two policemen went to the house of Alfredo Okenve’s close relative, arrested and questioned him about the activist’s whereabouts. When rumours that police were looking for Alfredo started to spread out, the two organizing embassies, France and Germany, decided to cancel the award ceremony. They also had an agreement with the authorities that Alfredo will be allowed to leave the country that day.
At the airport, Alfredo was prevented from boarding the plane and was escorted by eight security agents, handcuffed and put into a military plane and taken to his home town of Bata. Once they arrived, a military officer told him: “The instruction is to stay at home, do not go out of the city.”
Since the weekend, Alfredo is in Bata without his phone and passport which were confiscated at the airport. At least three unidentified individuals have been seen moving around his house doing surveillance. 
The case of Alfredo is illustrative of Equatorial Guinean authorities’ crackdown on activists and human rights defenders. On 25 February, Joaquín Elo Ayeto, activist and member of opposition party Convergencia para la Democracia Social (CPDS), was arbitrarily detained and tortured by security forces, accused of holding information on an alleged coup attempt. In January, the French lawyer William Bourdon who intervened in a case in France against the son of the Equato-Guinean President, was targeted with others by a warrant of arrest for financing of terrorism.
“French and German representatives should emphatically condemn the most recent attack on Alfredo and send a clear message to the authorities that this concerning trend of harassing and attacking human rights defenders would worsen the deteriorating human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea,” said Marta Colomer.
“Alfredo Okenve has dedicated his life to campaigning for human rights. That is not a crime and he should not be harassed because of his legitimate work. His passport and phone should also be given back to him and allowed to travel safely.”

Garing and another man, both from Sarawak, Malaysia, were convicted of murder by the High Court of Singapore in 2014 for killing a man during an armed robbery that took place in 2010. Garing was sentenced to death.
His family was recently informed that his execution is scheduled to take place on Friday 22 March.
“Once again, Singapore threatens to inflict the kind of cruelty it claims to oppose. No matter how heinous the crime, the death penalty is a degrading and inhuman punishment. We denounce its use in all circumstances,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Singapore Researcher at Amnesty International. “The Singaporean authorities must immediately halt their plans to carry out this callous execution.”
This would be the first execution to take place in Singapore this year that Amnesty International is aware of. The Singaporean authorities carried out 13 executions in 2018, but details of the executions are not publicly available.
“The number of executions in Singapore surged into double digits last year, for the first time since 2003,” said Rachel Chhoa-Howard. “This is a deeply concerning escalation. We urge the authorities to change course and re-establish the moratorium on executions, as a first step towards their abolition.”
Background
When Micheal Anak Garing and his co-defendant were charged, a conviction of murder carried the mandatory death penalty. Following amendments to Singapore’s Penal Code that came into effect in 2013, murder without an explicit intention to kill became punishable by life imprisonment and caning, or, at the judge’s discretion, by the imposition of a sentence of death. At the co-defendants’ sentencing in April 2015, Garing was sentenced to death, having been identified as the one who inflicted lethal wounds on the victim – a fact that he later contested in his appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was rejected in 2017. His co-defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment and 24 strokes of the cane.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime, the guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty violates the right to life and is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.
As of today, 106 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and 142 in total are abolitionist in law or practice. In 2017 the death penalty was imposed or implemented for drug-related crime in 15 countries, against international law and standards.  Amnesty International recorded executions for drug-related offences in only four countries: China (which classifies figures as a state secret), Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore. Singapore retains the mandatory death penalty, in certain circumstances, for murder and drug trafficking, contrary to international safeguards and restrictions on the use of the death penalty.

Hamas security forces’ violent crackdown against peaceful Palestinian protesters, activists, human rights workers – including an Amnesty International worker – and local journalists must be immediately halted and investigated, said Amnesty International.
Hundreds of protesters have been subjected to beatings, arbitrary arrest and detentions, and torture and other forms of ill-treatment since 14 March, when Palestinians took to the streets across the Gaza Strip to protest against the rising cost of living and deteriorating economic conditions under the Hamas de facto administration.
Today, an Amnesty International Research Consultant, Hind Khoudary, has been detained and interrogated by the security forces of the Ministry of Interior for working with Amnesty International. Her interrogation lasted for three hours during which four male interrogators subjected her to ill-treatment. The interrogators used abusive language and warned her not to carry out human rights research and threatened to prosecute her for spying and working as a foreign agent.
“The crackdown on freedom of expression and the use of torture in Gaza has reached alarming new levels. Over the past few days, we have seen shocking human rights violations carried out by Hamas security forces against peaceful protesters, journalists and rights workers,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“It is clear that Hamas security forces are trying to stop human rights defenders from carrying out the vital work of documenting and reporting on the severe violations they are perpetrating during this ongoing violent and arbitrary crackdown. We are sending a clear message to the Gaza authorities today that we are watching and we will work to ensure that all those responsible for these violations are held to account”. 
The human rights violations perpetrated by Hamas forces against peaceful protesters, journalists, and human rights defenders in Gaza are the most severe for more than a decade.
Protesting hunger and taxation
The latest round of repression by Hamas began on 10 March 2019, when 13 activists planning demonstrations to protest the high cost of living in Gaza were arrested during a private meeting at a house belonging to the activist Jihad Salem al-Arabeed in the town of Jabalya, in the northern Gaza Strip.
The arrest came after the group launched a social media campaign titled ‘The revolt of the hungry’ and ‘Down with price hikes’, calling for a protest on Thursday, 14 March 2019 in Jabalya.
Security forces stormed into the house without an arrest warrant. The activists were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in detention. On 12 March, they were released with a warning not to continue with their plans.
On the afternoon of 14 March 2019, Hamas security forces – some dressed in civilian clothes – violently attacked hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in Jabalya refugee camp, Deir al-Balah camp, al-Boreij camp and Rafah using sound grenades, batons, pepper spray, live ammunition and physical assaults.
Human rights workers and journalists targeted
On 15 March, Hamas forces raided a house in Deir Al-Balah camp belonging to a local journalist, Osamah Al-Kahlout. Inside the house were the Director of the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), Jamil Sarhan, and ICHR lawyer Baker Al-Turkmani. Both human rights workers, who had been monitoring the protests, were beaten and hospitalized and their mobile phones were confiscated. After identifying themselves to the security officers who raided the house, Sarhan and Turkmani were taken outside and repeatedly punched.
On 16 March, Hamas security forces in Gaza arrested a number of human rights defenders while they were working in the Al-Shujayya neighbourhood, east of Gaza city. The four reportedly detained were: Samir Al-Mana’ama, lawyer at Al Mezan Center for Human Rights (Al Mezan); Khaled Abu Isbetan, fieldworker at Al Mezan; Sabreen Al-Tartour, field worker at the Palestinian Center for Human Rights; and Fadi Abu Ghunaima, field worker at Al Dameer Association for Human Rights in Gaza.
Meanwhile, several journalists across Gaza were beaten, detained and were forbidden from documenting the demonstrations. Many journalists, lawyers and NGO workers were reportedly summoned for interrogation after recording testimonies on the conduct of the Hamas police.
“The Hamas de facto administration must immediately launch an independent, thorough and transparent investigation into the unnecessary and excessive use of force, arbitrary arrest and detention, and torture and other ill-treatment by security forces. Where there is sufficient admissible evidence, suspected perpetrators should be prosecuted in fair trials,” said Saleh Higazi.
“The authorities in Gaza have a duty to ensure that journalists and human rights defenders are free to carry out their work without threat, intimidation, or abuse; failure to protect such activities and deliberate interference in their work is a flagrant violation of international law.”

Spokespeople available in Lesvos as situation on islands remains critical  
European leaders were sent a clear message last night when a huge “Refugees Welcome” sign was projected on to the side of the Acropolis.
The stunt, organized by Amnesty International, is intended to draw attention to the suffering of refugees trapped on the Greek Islands by the EU-Turkey deal, which marks its third anniversary today.
“Three years after the EU-Turkey deal was implemented, it is vital that this call for humanity is seen not just across Athens, but across the whole of Europe,” said Fotis Filippou, Campaigns Director for Europe at Amnesty International.
“The situation facing thousands of migrants and refugees on the islands is a scar on the conscience of Europe. Anyone looking up at the Acropolis can see thousands of years of civilisation. Anyone who looking towards the refugee camps on the Greek islands will see that our leaders have learnt nothing.
“It is time for our leaders to put humanity first. They must end the tragedy thousands of people are facing as a result of the EU-Turkey deal and act now to ensure that those trapped in abject misery on the islands are finally moved to safety on the mainland and on to other European states.”

Amnesty International researchers will be in Lesvos and available for interview on 18 and 19 March.
The huge “Humanity First, Refugees Welcome” message was projected on to the side of the Acropolis.
The EU-Turkey deal is a statement of cooperation between EU states and the Turkish government aimed at returning people crossing to the Greek Islands back to Turkey on the premise that Turkey is safe for them. This included asylum seekers and vulnerable migrants. What ensued in practice is a containment policy, trapping people in the Greek hotspots for extended periods of time.
There are currently more than 15,000 people on the Greek island ‘hotspots’, more than a half of whom are women and children. The majority are staying in overcrowded camps, many sleeping in unsuitable tents and containers, facing risks to their safety and security. The camp on the island of Samos alone houses more than 4,000 people, a number exceeding its capacity by more than five times.
On paper, the arrangement was to be accompanied by a “1:1 scheme”: a commitment to resettle one Syrian to EU Member States for every Syrian being returned from Greece to Turkey. Figures show, however, that only over 8,000 resettlements of Syrians have been carried out in 2018, while around 3.6 million remain in Turkey. In parallel, out of 32,494 total sea arrivals to Greece in 2018, returns to Turkey amounted to only 322.

“The four-year prison sentence slapped on Oyub Tititev is an affront to human rights, reason, and justice. By pronouncing him guilty, despite all the evidence to the contrary, the court has demonstrated how deeply flawed the Russian justice system is. The court has revealed itself to be little more than a tool that the regional authorities have used to silence one of the last human rights defenders working in Chechnya.
“When this sham trial started, the human rights community called on the Russian authorities to transfer proceedings out of Chechnya, pointing out that the court will be under pressure from the regional authorities and unable to try Oyub fairly and reach an independent decision. By failing to do so, the Russian federal authorities proved to be accomplices in this gross injustice and in the violation of Oyub Titiev’s human rights.
“We call on the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Oyub Titiev as he is a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned solely for his human rights work in Chechnya.”
Background
On 18 March, the Shali City Court sentenced Oyub Titiev, the head of the Chechen office of the Memorial Human Rights Centre, to four years in penal colony. Oyub was found guilty of “drugs possession” (Article 228, part 2 of the Russian Criminal Code). Prior to the sentencing he spent one year and two months behind bars in pre-trial detention.

The struggle over mercury contamination at Grassy Narrows. The risks to water and fish from the Mount Polley mining disaster. The threatened destruction of the Peace River Valley by the Site C dam.  
 Each of these cases is a powerful illustration of the continued importance of healthy rivers and lakes to the well-being of the Indigenous peoples who rely on them — and the terrible consequences when federal and provincial governments ignore their rights.  
 Bringing these three cases together is a way to highlight common themes and engage more people in speaking out for justice.  
 Our campaign on water defenders and human rights launches on World Water Day (March 22) and will continue through the summer. We’re offering a variety of tools and techniques to focus on these three cases at public events, whether you have a table at an event already planned in your community or you host your own water rights event.  
 Look for the following:  
Group activities: For each of the cases, we are highlighting action techniques that you can do as an individual just about anywhere, such as calling the BC Premier or tweeting the Prime Minister. Sometimes these are more fun, engaging and inspiring when you make it a group activity. The easy to use online tools are ideal for hosting a twitter party or click-to-call phone party.  
Case sheets: For each of the three cases, we will be preparing printable case sheets similar to those produced for Write for Rights. One idea is to host a letter-writing event focused on clean water and human rights. Download them all at www.amnesty.ca/defendingwater (Grassy Narrows – Mount Polley – Site C)  
 Video: We are producing a short video with clips from Indigenous activists from the affected communities. The video can be used as the inspiration opening to an event or as part of a tabling display.  
 Webinars: On Thursday March 21 at 8:30 PM EST we’ll host the first of a planned series of webinars digging deeper into the issues highlighted by these cases. The webinar is now full, but you can register to receive the recording and to be notified if space opens up. Register now for the webinar>>>

“The criminal case against Anastasia Shevchenko is profoundly flawed, and by forging ahead with it regardless, the Russian authorities are creating an abhorrent precedent. Anastasia has lost her freedom and yet she has not committed any recognizable criminal offence. The authorities are casting their net ever more widely, with another former Otkrytaya Rossiya’s employee, Maksim Vernikov, now also facing criminal proceedings. We call on Russia to stop this increasingly ugly persecution.
“The Russian authorities must drop all charges against Anastasia Shevchenko and Maksim Vernikov, and repeal the ludicrous ‘undesirable organizations’ law which is blatantly being used to target human rights defenders.”
Background
On 21 January 2019, the first-ever criminal investigation under Article 284.1 of the Criminal Code (“Activity of an undesirable organization”) was opened against Anastasia Shevchenko.  She was put under house arrest two days later.
Maksim Vernikov’s flat was searched on 14 March after which he was interrogated as a criminal suspect under the same charge and placed under travel restrictions.
If found guilty, Anastasia Shevchenko and Maksim Vernikov face up to six years in prison.  
Since the law on “undesirable organizations” came into force in May 2015, 15 foreign entities have been blacklisted. The banning of two of them — the UK-based Open Russia and Open Russia Civic Movement — was used to persecute the members of the Russian movement of the same name.

“The ICC prosecutes the most serious crimes under international law, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Impeding the work of ICC investigators disrupts its vital function and demands impunity for the White House’s own policies. In doing so, it risks setting a dangerous precedent.
“That the administration has chosen visa bans, powerful tools typically reserved for the most serious of human rights abusers, to prevent investigation into allegations involving some of the most serious crimes in the world is highly indicative of its culture of disregard for rights abuses.”

0,Tunisia: Repressive state of emergency bill a threat to human rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/tunisia-repressive-state-of-emergency-bill-a-threat-to-human-rights/,"A deeply flawed draft state of emergency law currently being discussed in parliament could grant Tunisian authorities sweeping powers to ban demonstrations and strikes, suspend activities of NGOs, impose arbitrary restrictions on movement of individuals and carry out unwarranted searches of...","A deeply flawed draft state of emergency law currently being discussed in parliament could grant Tunisian authorities sweeping powers to ban demonstrations and strikes, suspend activities of NGOs, impose arbitrary restrictions on movement of individuals and carry out unwarranted searches of properties based on vague national security grounds, said Amnesty International. A parliamentary debate on the proposed law has started and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks.
The organization is calling on Tunisia’s parliament not to adopt the new bill unless fundamental changes are made to bring it in line with international law and the country’s own constitution.
“Tunisia has operated under a continuous state of emergency for more than three years. What should be an exceptional temporary state has become the new normal. Tunisia’s authorities should be urgently working to restore full respect for the rule of law – not approving a repressive draft law that will further endanger human rights,” said Magdalena Mughrabi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“If this law is approved it will give the authorities free rein to restrict human rights whenever they feel like it, seriously threatening the progress Tunisia has made since the 2011 uprising.”
The proposed law is intended to replace a 1978 presidential decree that has been used to impose a continuous state of emergency since November 2015. The decree, which grants Tunisia’s president the power to suspend certain rights such as the right to freedom of expression, assembly, association and movement, has been deemed unconstitutional. It has been repeatedly used to impose emergency measures in an often arbitrary, discriminatory and disproportionate manner leading to a range of human rights violations.
The 1978 decree violates both international law and Article 49 of Tunisia’s new 2014 constitution, both of which require that restrictions on human rights be necessary, proportionate and prescribed by law. However, the new proposed bill fails to address these shortcomings.
The new draft law would allow the president to declare a state of emergency for six months, renewable for a three-month period. However, it does not impose a limit on the number of times it can be applied, leaving it open to being renewed indefinitely. It also leaves the decision to declare or renew a state of emergency at the exclusive discretion of presidential and executive branches of government, without requiring involvement of parliament or the constitutional court.
The bill, like the current decree, would give Tunisia’s executive authorities permission to ban any strike or demonstration perceived to threaten public order, search places frequented by anyone suspected of threatening national security including accessing their computers or other equipment without prior judicial authorization.  It would also allow authorities to seize passports or place under house arrest or electronic or administrative surveillance anyone whose “activities are deemed to endanger security” without obtaining a court order. The draft law also fails to provide sufficient judicial oversight for emergency measures and empowers the Ministry of Interior to suspend associations suspected of undermining public order and security or obstructing the work of the authorities.
To address these flaws, the law must clearly stipulate that it is necessary for authorities to obtain prior judicial authorization when issuing or enforcing any decision to subject an individual to exceptional emergency measures such as house searches or assigned residence orders. The bill must also grant individuals the right to appeal such measures before an independent and impartial judicial body.
“Tunisia’s members of parliament should not consider adopting this law until strong human rights safeguards are incorporated. Under international law, emergency powers should only be applied in exceptional circumstances when it is strictly necessary to protect national security from a threat to ‘the life of the nation’. As it stands, this law gives the Tunisian authorities a free pass to crack down on human rights on vague national security grounds,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
Since the state of emergency was declared in 2015 security forces have carried out thousands of arrests, many of them arbitrarily, and thousands of raids across the country on security grounds, often using excessive and unnecessary force, as well as searching houses without judicial warrants. The authorities have also used emergency measures to impose night-time curfews in areas of unrest, and to detain and pass harsh sentences against those accused of “breaking the curfew”. They have placed at least 138 people under assigned residence orders, restricting their movement to specific areas amounting at times to house arrest. Often these orders have been applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner based on appearance, religious beliefs or previous criminal convictions, and without any means to challenge them.
“The repeated abuse of emergency measures since 2015 highlights the urgent need for the new law to contain provisions that will prevent such human rights violations. It should clearly state that the objective is to return to normalcy as soon as possible,” said Magdalena Mughrabi.
Background
President Béji Caid Essebsi submitted the state of emergency bill to Tunisia’s parliament on 30 November 2018 to replace a 1978 presidential decree. Discussion of the bill within the Parliament’s Rights and Freedoms Committee began on 18 January 2019.
Tunisia’s authorities initially declared a state of emergency, invoking the 1978 decree, on 15 January 2011 and repeatedly renewed it until March 2014, when it was allowed to expire. President Beji Caid Essebsi then re-imposed the state of emergency on 4 July 2015 following the mass shooting on the beach at Sousse. The state of emergency was lifted in October of that year, but was reinstated on 24 November 2015, immediately after the attack on the Presidential Guard in Tunis. It has been regularly renewed since, most recently on 5 March 2019.
In his report following his last visit to Tunisia in 2017, the then UN special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism expressed “concern about the legality and persistent extension by the President of the far-reaching emergency powers provided to law enforcement officials.” The report also urged Tunisian authorities to “take immediate measures to discontinue the abusive, and internationally illegal, practice of routinely extending the extraordinary powers conferred to law enforcement institutions under the state of emergency, which de facto normalizes what should be an extraordinary legal regime.”

“This is one of the darkest days in New Zealand’s history. The attackers who unleashed their deadly hatred and racism upon women, men, and children as they took part in Friday prayers has thrown us all into shock and grief.
“This is also a moment of reckoning for leaders across the world who have encouraged or turned a blind eye to the scourge of Islamophobia.

The bill will enter into force in ten days after publication.
“The ratification of the Convention paves the road to the effective inclusion of 180,000 people living with disabilities in the social and economic life of Kyrgyzstan,” said Anna Kirey, Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at Amnesty International.
“It should be a priority for the government of Kyrgyzstan to guarantee that persons with disabilities are involved in all decision-making processes, including relevant working groups and committees. The Convention’s implementation will demand combined approaches to policy and advocacy from persons with disabilities and their organizations.   
“Amnesty International was honoured to support Kyrgyzstani partners in campaigning for the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Together we made tangible progress towards combating prejudices and misconceptions about persons with disability.”
“This success was made possible thanks to the work of tireless activists, one of whom, Gulzar Duishenova, features in this year’s Write for Rights campaign.”
Gulzar Duishenova told Amnesty International:
“I am grateful for all the support and solidarity from so many of Amnesty International’s activists who care about our rights despite being from a different country.
“As the saying goes, if people with disabilities and elderly people live well, the whole of society lives well. I also want to say it loud and clear that nothing about us should be done without us.”
Background
On 14 March, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov signed the bill ratifying the CRPD previously adopted by the Zhogorku Kenesh (the country’s Parliament). Kyrgyzstan is one of three former Soviet countries that have signed but until recently hadn’t ratified the Convention. The two remaining countries are Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

“The government has sadly reneged on its earlier commitment to abolish the death penalty in totality, but we urge the government to keep its promise to abolish the death penalty once and for all at the soonest opportunity,” Amnesty International Malaysia Executive Director Shamini Darshni Kaliemuthu said today. 
On 13 March 2019, Deputy Minister in charge of Law Mohamed Hanipa Maidin announced to Parliament that the Government is proposing to introduce sentencing discretion for 11 offences under the Penal Code and Firearms (Increased Penalties) Act 1971, which currently carry the mandatory death penalty. The change would leave the imposition of the death penalty at the hands of judges.
“The disappointing decision today seems to suggest that abolishing the mandatory death penalty is a watered-down compromise where the government appears to have bowed to political and public pressure to retain the death penalty. The government must reconsider. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment that does not have a place in civilized society,” Shamini said.
It is expected that bills to abolish the mandatory death penalty will be tabled in Parliament in the current sitting which ends on 11 April.
“The abolition of the mandatory death penalty will be a critical change in Malaysian law that will lead to advances in the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty. The introduction of full discretion at sentencing would allow judges to consider the individual circumstances of the offender as well as of the offence while taking into consideration any mitigating factors. This could potentially lead to a decrease in the number of death sentences imposed. However, this does not go far enough in bringing about the stated goal of abolition and should be a very first step in the direction,” Shamini said. 
Whether mandatory or discretionary, the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent nor does it reduce crime.
“The criminal justice system in any country is far from perfect, and mistakes can and will happen. Instances of wrongful executions could happen and would be an egregious error. The death penalty is irreversible in its nature, it is a punishment that perpetuates the cycle of violence into society. It is imposed and administered through justice systems that can be vulnerable to discrimination and error – particularly when safeguards protecting against use of torture or other ill-treatment to extract confessions from defendants are lacking. It perpetuates the cycle of violence it seeks to stop in society, while studies consistently show that it has no unique deterrent effect on crime,” Shamini said. 
Amnesty International Malaysia opposes the death penalty unconditionally as a violation of the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and as the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.
“The government must stay the course and abolish the death penalty once and for all. The full abolition of the death penalty would be an exemplary move for Malaysia’s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights and will resonate widely in the Southeast Asian region where we believe Malaysia could emerge as a leader in human rights.”
Amnesty International Malaysia also calls on the Government and prison authorities across the country to maintain the moratorium on all executions established in July 2018.

The prosecution of 11 women activists before a Criminal Court in Riyadh for their human rights work and contact with international organizations is an appalling escalation of the Saudi authorities’ crackdown on peaceful activism, Amnesty International said today.
Some of the women were charged with promoting women’s rights and calling for the end of the male guardianship system. The women were also charged with contacting international organizations, foreign media and other activists, including their contact with Amnesty International
“The charges against the activists are the latest example of the Saudi authorities abusing legislation and the justice system to silence peaceful activists and deter them from working on the human rights situation in the country. This trial is yet another stain on the Saudi authorities’ appalling human rights record, and shows how empty the government’s claims of reform really are,” said Samah Hadid, Amnesty International’s Middle East Campaigns Director.
“Activists brought to trial today are amongst Saudi Arabia’s bravest women human rights defenders. They have not only been smeared in state-aligned media for their peaceful human rights work, but have also endured horrendous physical and psychological suffering during their detention.

Pushed to the edge: Violence and abuse against refugees and migrants along Balkan Route details how, by prioritizing border control over compliance with international law, European governments are not just turning a blind eye to vicious assaults by the Croatian police, but also funding their activities. In so doing, they are fueling a growing humanitarian crisis on the edge of the European Union.
“To understand where European government’s priorities lie, one only needs to follow the money. Their financial contribution towards humanitarian assistance is dwarfed by the funds they provide for border security which includes equipping Croatian border police and even paying their salaries,” said Massimo Moratti, Director of Research for Amnesty International’s Europe Office.
“Meanwhile people fleeing war and persecution are beaten and robbed by the Croatian police and forcibly pushed back to legal limbo, left at the mercy of a failing asylum system in Bosnia and Herzegovina.”
Currently around 5,500 women, men and children are trapped in two small Bosnian towns near the Croatian border, Bihac and Velika Kladusa, living in defunct former factories without basic amenities. Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot offer them adequate protection or living conditions and the improvised camps are unhygienic, lacking hot water, medical care and sufficient food.
One Afghan mother told Amnesty International: “We don’t have enough food to feed the whole family, especially the children. They are always hungry.”
Bureaucratic obstacles, inadequate legal assistance and limited administrative capacity mean that potential asylum-seekers are unlikely to get their asylum claims processed in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most attempt to proceed to other European countries.
This journey is not easy. Having previously entered the EU through Greece and Bulgaria and having been abjectly failed by the asylum system there, people exit the EU to continue the journey along the Balkans. In order to reach Slovenia or Italy, where the EU Schengen free movement regime begins, they have to navigate Croatia’s dense forests, fast moving rivers and, in some places, live minefields.
In the first ten months of 2018, at least 12 people drowned in the Western Balkans, most of them trying to cross the border from Croatia to Slovenia. Dozens more died in other ways. One young woman from Afghanistan told Amnesty International how, after seeing a bear in a forest in Croatia, a woman she was travelling with miscarried. “She got so scared that she delivered a stillborn baby. She was six months pregnant.”
Those attempting the journey are frequently subjected to deliberate pushbacks and collective expulsions – often accompanied by violence and intimidation – at the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, without having their asylum claims considered.
Nearly all in the camps in Bihac and Velika Kladusa had been pushed back into Bosnia and Herzegovina from Croatia or Slovenia and nearly one third of those interviewed had experienced violence at the hands of the Croatian police. Many described how they were beaten, had their documents destroyed and possessions stolen in what appears to be a systematic and deliberate policy by Croatian authorities designed to deter future attempts to enter the country.
One young man from Gaza told Amnesty International what happened when he was caught by police with nine others. “They drove us to the border with Bosnia. They made us get out of the car one-by-one and started beating us with batons,” he said.
He then described how they were sprayed in the face with what he thought was pepper spray: “I couldn’t see anything. My eyes were burning. Then they told us to go and never come back to Croatia”.
Sami from Algeria told Amnesty International how he and a group of other men were taken one-by-one, and made to stand in a circle of masked policemen who beat them with batons and a baseball bat. “Then they took our money and the phones and told us to go towards Bosnia,” he said.
Another man described how Croatian police took their shoes, warm clothes and sleeping bags and forced them to walk barefoot for kilometres through freezing rivers and streams towards the Bosnian border. Such returns regularly took place at night and in remote areas outside of regular border crossings.
Those caught in Italy and Slovenia are often subject to chain pushbacks, summarily handed over to Croatian police and forcibly expelled back to camps in Bosnia and Herzegovina without having their asylum claims considered.
As the allegations of violent pushbacks on the borders have mounted, Croatian authorities have increasingly discouraged public scrutiny of country’s migration practices. Attempts by Croatian public institutions to oversee migration practices at the border have been blocked and organizations working on migrant and refugee rights have been targeted by the authorities.
NGO volunteers have been harassed, held for hours by police without formal charges and threatened with criminal prosecution. The Ministry of Interior has even accused some NGOs of assisting people to enter Croatia irregularly. This has had a chilling effect on those working to support refugees.
In spite of these appalling practices at the border, the European Union has continued to allocate significant funds to assist Croatia in its border security infrastructure. The EU has also wilfully ignored the failures of the European asylum system that make these journeys necessary. “As temperatures rise and the snows melt, the number of people attempting to cross Croatia will swell. But with Bosnia and Herzegovina ill-equipped to handle the arrival of an increasing number of people seeking protection, action must be taken to avoid a humanitarian crisis in on the edge of the EU,” said Massimo Moratti.
“European leaders can no longer wash their hands of responsibility for the continued collective expulsions and violent pushbacks along the Balkan route that are the result of their determination to fortify EU borders, no matter what the human cost is.”

Amnesty International today warned that the failure of governments to tackle climate change could amount to the greatest inter-generational human rights violation in history, as it welcomes a global day of school strikes against climate change planned for Friday 15 March by young people.
“Amnesty International stands with all children and young people who are organizing and taking part in school strikes for climate action. This is an important social justice movement that is mobilizing thousands of people to peacefully call on governments to stop climate change,” said Kumi Naidoo, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.
“It is unfortunate that children have to sacrifice days of learning in school to demand that adults do the right thing. However, they know the consequences of the current shameful inaction both for themselves and future generations. This should be a moment for stark self-reflection by our political class.
“Instead of criticising young people for taking part in these protests, like some misguided politicians have done, we should be asking why governments are getting away with playing truant on climate action.”
Amnesty International warned that climate change is having and will have even more devastating impacts on human rights unless governments act now to change course.
Climate change especially affects people who are already vulnerable, disadvantaged or subject to discrimination.
Children especially are more vulnerable to climate-related impacts, due to their specific metabolism, physiology and developmental needs. Climate change also poses a risk to their mental health; children exposed to traumatic events such as natural disasters, exacerbated by climate change, can suffer from post-traumatic stress disorders.
“Climate change is a human rights issue precisely because of the impact it is having on people. It compounds and magnifies existing inequalities, and it is children who will grow up to see its increasingly frightening effects. The fact that most governments have barely lifted a finger in response to our mutually assured destruction amounts to one of the greatest inter-generational human rights violations in history,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Millions of people are already suffering from its catastrophic effects – from prolonged drought in sub-Saharan Africa to devastating tropical storms sweeping across South-east Asia and the Caribbean.
During the summer months for the northern hemisphere in 2018, communities from the Arctic Circle to Greece, Japan, Pakistan and the USA experienced devastating heatwaves and wildfires that killed and injured hundreds of people.
“Children are often told they are ‘tomorrow’s leaders’. But if they wait until ‘tomorrow’ there may not be a future in which to lead. Young people are putting their leaders to shame with the passion and determination they are showing to fight this crucial battle now,” said Kumi Naidoo.
The latest pledges made by governments to mitigate climate change— which are yet to be implemented—are completely inadequate as they would lead to a catastrophic 3°C increase in average global temperatures over pre-industrial levels by 2100.
Amnesty International calls on states to scale up climate action substantially and to do so in a manner consistent with human rights. One of the crucial ways this can happen is if people most affected by climate change, such as children and young people, are engaged in efforts to address and mitigate climate change, whilst being provided with the necessary information and education to participate meaningfully in such discussions, and included in decision-making that directly affects them.
“Every day that we allow climate change to get worse ultimately makes it harder to stop and reverse its catastrophic effects. There is nothing stopping governments from doing everything in their power to reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the shortest possible time-frame. There is nothing stopping them from finding ways to halve emissions from their 2010 levels by 2030, and to net-zero by 2050, as climate scientists have called for,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“The only thing standing in the way of protecting humanity from climate change is the fact that our leaders lack the political will and have barely tried. Politicians can keep making excuses for their inaction, but nature does not negotiate. They must listen to young people and take steps today to stop climate change, because the alternative is unthinkable.”

Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh 
Bibi Ayesha is a 15 year old Rohingya girl who  was born in Bangladesh. Her family fled Myanmar during a wave of human rights violations against the Rohingya community in 1992. They have never been given official refugee status in Bangladesh.  Her father, determined to ensure that education was accessible for his daughter, managed to enroll her in a local school near the Nayapara Refugee Camp where they live.  
Earlier this year in January, however, the Bangladeshi government began strictly enforcing a long-standing policy that no Rohingya students would be allowed in local schools on the grounds that they are refugees and must go to schools in the camps.  However, the government does not allow formal schools in the camps, because they believe that will encourage refugees to remain in Bangladesh. The only options are the very basic Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) and Learning Centres, which mainly offer a place to play and some very rudimentary lessons. 
Bibi, who has an obvious passion for learning, has remained at home ever since, and says, “I love education. I don’t want to be uneducated, it’s important. I want to become a doctor because I want to help my society, my country, and my people.”  Bibi rightly asks, “Education for all, why not for refugees?”

Bibi’s friend and schoolmate, Lucky Akhtar, also 15 years old, has similarly been forced to stop going to school.  Lucky says, “we had a hope in our hearts that with our education we would be able save and help our community… Now, we don’t know what will happen… If we can’t study ourselves, how possibly can we help others?” 
Access to decent education is not a reality today for Rohingya refugee children and youth in Bangladesh. It should be.  It is a right, enshrined in a number of international law treaties, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Bangladesh is bound by and which applies to all children in the country regardless of their status. The recent decision to enforce a strict ban on access to local schools clearly discriminates against a group already in a very vulnerable situation. However, it is also self-defeating. Education can play a vital role in maintaining stability and hope in the refugee camps; investing in the next generation and thereby helping to foster conditions for a successful return to Myanmar when it is safe to go home. 
Fatima* (not her real name), is 12 years old.  She continues to go to a Child Friendly Space, the only option available to her in Jamtoli Camp. She says, “studying is my favourite thing” and “I want to study to become a teacher.” Sadly, though, the CFS will not offer her an education that enables her to realize that dream. 
Rehina* (not her real name) is also 12 years old and fled from Myanmar with her family in 2017. She lives with her sister and brother in Kutupalong, the largest of several Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, in fact now the largest refugee camp in the world with over 600,000 inhabitants. Rehina used to attend one of the Child Friendly Spaces, that caters to young children. But she does not go anymore as her father, who has conservative religious views, has decided that since she has started to menstruate, she must now stay home. She misses going to the CFS, where she enjoyed learning new things. Even if her father did support her, however, there is no other option for older girls to pursue appropriate studies. 
 
Ali, 16 years old, “I hope that someday I might be a leader in my community. I want to help find the solutions to the problems we Rohingya face. Education would help me do that.” © Amnesty International 
Ali and Saeed are both 16 years old and wish nothing more than to be able to go to school.   They are too old to benefit from one of the Child Friendly Spaces. And there is nothing else open to them. Ali highlights how education is the key to so much. 
 “I hope that someday I might be a leader in my community.  I want to help find the solutions to the problems we Rohingya face.  Education would help me do that.  But there is no option for me right now.  Instead I don’t know what my future will be.” 
Yasmin (17) and Minera (15) spoke to Amnesty in one of the Women Friendly Spaces in Kutupalong  Camp. When they came to Bangladesh as adolescents, there was nothing for them – only the younger children. Minera wants an education so she can “read a book or a newspaper.” Yasmin says getting an education will help her to earn a living. They have only recently learnt to write their own names. 
There are no formal schools in the camps. The Bangladesh government does not allow them. So, at best Bibi, Lucky, Rehina, Fatima, Ali, Saeed, Yasmin and Minera and other children can go to a Child Friendly Space, or perhaps a Woman Friendly Space for the older girls, where they might learn a little English, Burmese or Rohingyan language and have the chance to play and interact with other children and young people. 
The importance of these facilities should not be underestimated, as all children have the right to leisure and play. However, the limited education they offer does not meet the standards required by international human rights law whether at the, primary level, which should be compulsory and available free to all children, or secondary level.  In this respect the Bangladesh government needs to remember that all refugee children are entitled to not just protection and humanitarian assistance but also human rights, including the right to education as guaranteed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.    
Consequently, while child Friendly Spaces have a role to play, they are not enough. 
The mothers, fathers and grandparents we met, all stressed the need for a “real education” for their children and grandchildren. One woman with three young grandchildren noted, “I worry a lot for my grandchildren. What is their future?” She wants them to have an education.

Worried about the lack of schools, adults in the camps, many of whom worked as teachers in Myanmar, are trying to informally fill the gap. That may mean grandfathers like Sayed Alom and Mohammed Ali provide occasional lessons to their grandchildren. But as Sayed notes, “it is not always easy to convince the children to sit and learn from me when they can instead roam around the camp.” 
Hamid* and Raees* (not their real names) were both teachers in Myanmar, Hamid as a volunteer in a community school and Raees as a physics and economics teacher in a government school.  They have tried to arrange informal classes for their own children and neighbouring families, but with very different results showing how arbitrary and unfair the existing system can be.  
Hamid and two other friends were each offering informal classes to small groups of five students each.  However, the Majhi (local leaders in the camps, appointed by Bangladeshi authorities) in his Block at Balukhali Camp threatened to report him to the government official in charge of the camp, and so he has had to stop his teaching. Raees on the other hand is teaching a group of 20 students (including two girls) in his home for several hours a day, 6 days per week, with the full support of the Majhi in his Block.  
Raees stresses that “to learn is to grow and expand and understand the world and we should never rob children of that basic right, especially now when our Rohingya people have such difficult circumstances.” Hamid worries that “there are so many different attitudes and approaches to education in the camps and in the end some children are luckier than others, maybe just because of which Block they live in.” 
 
The government’s ban on education for all Rohingya refugees is also impacting young adults who have lived in Bangladesh for a long time; many for their whole lives, never having lived in Myanmar.  Mohammed Kashin, 27 years old, was born in Bangladesh after his parents fled there in 1992.  He had recently enrolled in a technical school in the village of Ukhiya and was studying computer science.  But just like Bibi, he had to stop attending classes in January when it was announced that even Rohingya refugees who have lived their whole lives in Bangladesh are no longer allowed to go to local schools. 
“One day I felt I was learning something that would help me build a better future, and now that has been taken away from me.  And why?  Just because I am Rohingya?  Just because I am a refugee?  That is not fair.”

“Mexico has a long and disturbing history of human rights violations. In recent years, the country has descended into a serious crisis. After decades of struggle by human rights organizations and victims’ groups, it would be a tragedy to miss this opportunity to change the country’s direction,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
“President López Obrador must acknowledge and prioritize the major human rights challenges facing the country. Now is the time to take concrete action to achieve genuine change. Recognition of the work done by human rights defenders and organizations, as well as support for them, must be a priority for the president.”
At the end of November, Amnesty International wrote an open letter to President López Obrador with  recommendations for specific actions he could take in the first 100 days of his government to improve the human rights situation. To close this campaign, the organization has written another letter noting the progress made and reiterating its call for other measures. 
“The human rights discourse and actions during the first 100 days of the new government have been inconsistent. We appreciate the government’s willingness to acknowledge the state’s responsibility for some crimes under international law and serious human rights violations in the past and to apologize to the victims,” said Tania Reneaum, Executive Director of Amnesty International Mexico.
“However, we regret that no progress has been made on major issues such as recognition of the competence of the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances to consider reports filed in Mexico, and ratification of the Escazú Agreement, an international treaty that would help to protect defenders of the environment”, added Tania Reneaum.
A recent change in the Constitution allows the creation of a National Guard, which will involve the military for a period of up to five years. It will be essential for the president and his government to guarantee observance of international human rights standards, including civilian command and full accountability to a civilian and independent body with the necessary expertise. Mexico’s government must use this constitutional reform as a starting point for planning for the orderly withdrawal of the armed forces from public security tasks.
There have certainly been some positive steps, for example, in the search for truth and justice and in cases of human rights violations, through the creation of an investigative commission on the Ayotzinapa case, which began work on 15 January. And the commitment expressed by Alejandro Encinas, Under-Secretary for Human Rights, to start a programme to search for disappeared persons, under the responsibility of the National Search Commission, which Amnesty International hopes will be implemented soon.
“In 100 days, we have seen some small changes and, in general, good intentions, but Mexico needs and deserves more if it is going to achieve real change in the country’s human rights situation,” concluded Tania Reneaum.

On 13 March 2018 a military court acquitted Ziad Itani of charges of spying for Israel and released him. He had spent three and a half months in detention, on the basis of trumped-up charges. During the trial, Itani reported being held in solitary confinement, subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in detention, and denied access to legal counsel. The Military court failed to act on these reports.
In mid-November 2018, Itani filed a civil lawsuit against officers and civilian assistants, but the State Prosecutor referred the case to the Military Prosecutor, even though both international and domestic law would require such reports to be investigated within the civilian criminal justice system.
“A year after his release Ziad Itani still bears the physical and psychological scars of the torture he experienced in detention. He was wronged the first time when he was arrested and detained; the second time when he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, and now he is being wronged again by the authorities’ failure to ensure accountability for the torture he continues to suffer from,” said Sahar Mandour, Amnesty International’s Lebanon Researcher.
“The authorities have recently taken steps to align Lebanon with its international obligations, namely by ratifying the anti-torture law and a just last week, by appointing the members of the National Preventive Mechanism. Ziad Itani’s case is a real litmus test of their intent to implement the law and meaningfully address torture.”
On 23 November 2017, the General Directorate of State Security, a security institution that reports directly to the President and Prime Minister, arrested Ziad Itani on trumped-up charges of spying for Israel. He was given no access to a lawyer. When he appeared before the Military Court judge, he reported that State Security officers in uniform and in civilian clothing beat him with electric cables, tied his body in a stress position using an iron chain, hung him by his wrists for hours, kicked and punched him in the face and threatened to rape him and his daughter.
Ziad Itani alleges that officers even forced a pen into his hand and made him sign a confession while he was lying on the floor unable to stand after a long torture session. He also described how officers brought to the interrogation room two of his family’s neighbours who insulted and spat on him, and threatened to harm his family and burn their house. He said officers also blackmailed him into confessing, in exchange for protecting his family.
After his release, his hands were constantly shaking, he was constantly agitated and emotionally unstable. Amnesty International reviewed medical records relating to the damage done to his teeth and his wrists.
On 25 January 2019 the Military Court opened its investigation into the fabrication of evidence that led to Itani’s arrest; however there has been no progress made into the investigations into the torture and other ill-treatment.
Under the Lebanese anti-torture law, the reports of torture should have been transferred immediately to a civil court and investigated within 48 hours.
Despite it being largely in line with international standards, Amnesty International had raised its concern about the fact that the law did not explicitly bar the Military Court from investigating reports of torture. 
“The Lebanese authorities must ensure that Ziad Itani’s torture is immediately investigated by a civilian court in a prompt and effective manner and ensure that perpetrators are held to account. It is only through implementation that they will signal a genuine intent to address torture in the country,” said Sahar Mandour.
Background
Last week, the Lebanese government approved the appointment of five members of the National Prevention Mechanism against torture and other ill-treatment. Under the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture, both of which have been ratified by Lebanon, this mechanism is tasked with visiting all places of detention with a view to recommending measures to prevent torture and other ill-treatment.

The...","A series of videos shared on social media in recent weeks have shed light on the daily harassment and violent attacks women in Iran face at the hands of morality police and pro-government vigilantes seeking to enforce the country’s forced hijab (veiling) laws, said Amnesty International.
The videos show members of the public or plain-clothes morality police aggressively confronting or attacking women for defying Iran’s degrading forced hijab laws, in the name of defending “public decency”. Perpetrators of such attacks appear to be getting bolder in their assaults in response to efforts by women to film the violence they face and share the videos on social media.
“The video footage that has emerged in recent weeks demonstrates the shocking levels of abuse women in Iran face on a daily basis from morality police or pro-government thugs simply for daring to defy the country’s abusive forced hijab laws,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director.  
“Iran’s forced hijab laws are not only deeply degrading and discriminatory, they are also being used to justify violent assaults on women and girls in the streets.”
Women in Iran are routinely stopped in the street at random by morality police, who insult and threaten them, order them to pull their headscarves forward to hide strands of hair or give them tissues to wipe off their make-up. Women are often physically assaulted including by being slapped in the face, beaten with batons, handcuffed and bundled into police vans.
In one of the videos posted online recently, a woman films a confrontation that she says began after a pro-state vigilante persistently ordered her to wear her hijab properly. In the video the man hurls abusive insults at her and, when she objects, he turns around and sprays her in the face with what appears to be pepper spray.
In another video, a man is shown yelling, insulting and ordering a woman to put on her headscarf. The woman is heard screaming about his threat to fire a stun gun at her and the man responds: “I did not fire at you. I only showed it to you.”
In a third video posted online, a plain-clothes man standing next to a morality police van is seen aiming a gun at unarmed men and women who have intervened to stop the violent arrest of a woman who is not wearing a headscarf.
The person who filmed the video explains in a comment that they and other members of the public had to rescue the woman from the morality police, who had confiscated her car keys and were attempting to push her into their van.
Iranian women’s rights defenders have courageously filmed these incidents as part of the My Camera My Weapon campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the constant harassment and assault that women and girls face in Iran’s streets as a result of forced hijab laws.
The videos were posted online by prominent Iranian journalist and women’s rights activist Masih Alinejad, based in the USA, who has run a series of high-profile online campaigns against forced hijab. As well as My Camera My Weapon, these include: My Stealthy Freedom, a Facebook page where women in Iran are encouraged to post photos of themselves without headscarves, and White Wednesdays, a campaign which calls on women to protest forced hijab laws by wearing white headscarves every Wednesday. 
The increased spotlight on the assaults on women defying laws on forced hijab has been met with a chilling smear campaign by state media against women’s rights defenders calling for the abolition of these abusive laws.
There are serious concerns that Iran’s authorities are fuelling these assaults in order to silence women at a crucial moment – just as they are gaining the courage to speak out publicly against forced hijab and amplifying their voices through social media.
“These brutal assaults targeting women and girls are a violation of their right to be protected from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment under international law,” said Philip Luther.
“Millions of Iranian women are being denied the right to be treated with dignity and to go about their daily lives without fearing violence or harassment.”
Iran’s forced hijab laws are a blatant breach of the rights to freedom of expression and religion, and the right to privacy. Women and girls in Iran are not allowed to set foot outside their homes unless they cover their hair with a headscarf and cover up their arms and legs with loose clothing.
Under Iranian law, women and girls as young as nine years old who are seen in public without a headscarf can be punished with a prison sentence of between 10 days and two months, or a cash fine. In practice, Iran’s authorities have imposed forced hijab on girls as young as seven years old.
Over the past year, Iran’s authorities have stepped up their crackdown on women’s rights defenders peacefully protesting against forced hijab laws. The most shocking example is the case of prominent human rights lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was sentenced up to 34 years to 33 in prison and 148 lashes in part, for her opposition to forced hijab laws.
The charges on which Nasrin Sotoudeh was convicted include “inciting corruption and prostitution” and “openly committing a sinful act… by appearing in public without a hijab”. Some of the activities that the authorities have cited as “evidence” against her include: opposing forced hijab; removing her headscarf during prison visits; defending women who peacefully protested against forced hijab; giving media interviews about the violent arrest and detention of women
protesting against forced hijab; and placing flowers at the scene where a woman protester was violently arrested.

Mohammad Shtayyeh, the...","The State of Palestine’s new government must seize the opportunity to reverse the appalling deterioration of human rights that took place under the previous administration and signal that it is serious about meeting its international obligations, Amnesty International. Mohammad Shtayyeh, the newly appointed prime minister, is expected to form a government in the coming days. 
Since June 2014, when the national consensus government led by former Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah came to power, Amnesty International has documented escalating human rights violations by Palestinian security forces in the West Bank despite the State of Palestine having joined international human rights treaties. These include excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, the use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment leading to deaths in custody, and an intensified crackdown on freedom of expression and civil society.
“In recent years Palestinian activists, human rights defenders, civil society organizations and journalists have faced a chilling onslaught by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. The new Palestinian government must not repeat mistakes of the past. Instead of attacking critical voices, it must ensure that the rule of law and rights and liberties are protected,” said Saleh Higazi, Deputy Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International.
“The new government must signal a sincere commitment to respecting its international human rights obligations by taking immediate steps to ensure that all laws and policies protect the rights and liberties of individuals under its authority.”
In its annual review of human rights in Palestine, Amnesty International highlighted concerns regarding violations, particularly by security forces, of civil and political rights. Reports from local human rights organizations, including Palestine’s national human rights institution the Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR) and the Palestinian Center for Development Media Freedoms, indicate arbitrary arrests and detention, torture and other ill-treatment, and violations of freedom of expression and assembly by Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza are becoming institutionalized.
Many of these violations stem from the increasing repression of dissent in the context of ongoing political disputes between the administrations in the West Bank and Gaza since 2007. Amnesty International has documented the targeting of media, NGOs, demonstrators and others in the West Bank who oppose the Fatah-led government’s policies.
In 2017, the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank introduced the Electronic Crimes Law, imposing tight controls on media freedom and permitting the arbitrary detention and imprisonment for up to 15 years of anyone criticizing the Palestinian authorities online, including journalists and whistle-blowers. Under the legislation, anyone deemed to have disturbed “public order”, “national unity” or “social peace” faces heavy fines and up to 15 years of hard labour in prison. Amnesty International has documented dozens of cases of activists, human rights defenders and journalists who have been prosecuted under this law in the West Bank. 
In Gaza, the Hamas de facto administration continued crackdowns on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly by using excessive force to disperse peaceful protests and arbitrary arrests and detention against people criticizing its rule. Gaza courts continued to hand down death sentences in proceedings that fail to meet international fair trial standards.
Impunity fuelling violations
Torture and other ill-treatment in custody continue to be committed with impunity by Palestinian police and other security forces in the West Bank, and by Hamas police and other security forces in Gaza. The ICHR estimates the number of victims to be in the hundreds.
Palestinian authorities in the West Bank have increasingly used a 1954 law that allows individuals to be detained without charge or trial indefinitely on the order of a regional governor. In 2018 alone, the ICHR documented 201 cases of such detentions.
In the rare cases where the Palestinian authorities have taken steps to hold perpetrators within the police and security forces accountable for human rights violations, they have resorted to disciplinary measures rather than criminal prosecutions, even in cases where suspects are accused of using abusive or arbitrary force.
“The near-total lack of accountability under previous governments has fuelled a climate of impunity which has encouraged the continued use of excessive force and other abuses by Palestinian police and other security forces today,” Saleh Higazi said.
“Palestinians, whose rights have already been routinely crushed by Israel’s occupation, must not be brutalized and repressed by their own government. The new government must take effective measures to improve the human rights of all its people.”
Background
On 29 January Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accepted the resignation of the government of national consensus led by Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, which had been in power since June 2014.
The national consensus government had minimum authority in the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by the Hamas de facto administration.
The new government formation follows a Supreme Constitutional Court decision on 12 December 2018 to dissolve the Palestinian Legislative Council, which is dominated by Hamas, and hold legislative elections within six months.

0,Iran: Shocking 33-year prison term and 148 lashes for women’s rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/iran-shocking-33-year-prison-term-and-148-lashes-for-womens-rights-defender-nasrin-sotoudeh/,"The sentencing of prominent Iranian human rights lawyer and women’s rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh to 33 years in prison and 148 lashes in a new case against her is an outrageous injustice, said Amnesty International today.  The sentence, reported on her husband Reza Khandan’s Facebook page,...","The sentencing of prominent Iranian human rights lawyer and women’s rights defender Nasrin Sotoudeh to 33 years in prison and 148 lashes in a new case against her is an outrageous injustice, said Amnesty International today. 
The sentence, reported on her husband Reza Khandan’s Facebook page, brings her total sentence after two grossly unfair trials to 38 years in prison. In September 2016, she had been sentenced in her absence to five years in prison in a separate case.
“It is absolutely shocking that Nasrin Sotoudeh is facing nearly four decades in jail and 148 lashes for her peaceful human rights work, including her defence of women protesting against Iran’s degrading forced hijab (veiling) laws. Nasrin Sotoudeh must be released immediately and unconditionally and this obscene sentence quashed without delay,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director.
“Nasrin Sotoudeh has dedicated her life to defending women’s rights and speaking out against the death penalty – it is utterly outrageous that Iran’s authorities are punishing her for her human rights work. Her conviction and sentence consolidate Iran’s reputation as a cruel oppressor of women’s rights.”
This is the harshest sentence Amnesty International has documented against a human rights defender in Iran in recent years, suggesting that the authorities – emboldened by pervasive impunity for human rights violations – are stepping up their repression.
Nasrin Sotoudeh was arrested at her home on 13 June 2018. This week, she was informed by the office for the implementation of sentences in Tehran’s Evin prison where she is jailed that she had been convicted on seven charges and sentenced to 33 years in prison and 148 lashes. The charges, which are in response to her peaceful human rights work, include “inciting corruption and prostitution”, “openly committing a sinful act by… appearing in public without a hijab” and “disrupting public order”.
During her sentencing, Article 134 of Iran’s Penal Code was applied, which allows judges to use their discretion to impose a higher sentence than the maximum statutory requirement when a defendant faces more than three charges. In Nasrin Sotoudeh’s case, the judge, Mohammad Moghiseh, applied the maximum statutory sentence for each of her seven charges and then added another four years to her total prison term, raising it from the statutory maximum of 29 to 33 years.
“Jailing a human rights defender for her peaceful activities is abhorrent but the fact that the judge in Nasrin Sotoudeh’s case used his discretion to ensure that she stays locked up for more than is required under Iranian law compounds the outrageous injustice of her sentence,” said Philip Luther.
“Governments with influence over Iran should use their power to push for Nasrin Sotoudeh’s release. The international community, notably the European Union, which has an ongoing dialogue with Iran, must take a strong public stand against this disgraceful conviction and urgently intervene to ensure that she is released immediately and unconditionally.”
Today, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that judge Mohammad Moghiseh told journalists that Nasrin Sotoudeh has been sentenced to seven years in prison: five years for “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security” and two years for “insulting the Supreme Leader”. The report did not provide further details or clarify whether the judge was referring to a separate case. If the report was referring to the same case, Amnesty International cannot currently explain why the information appears to contradict that provided to Nasrin Sotoudeh by the office for the implementation of sentences in Evin prison.

“After a year of investigation, the Brazilian authorities’ alarming inability to solve the killing of Marielle Franco sends a message that attacks against human rights defenders will go unpunished,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“The authorities that took office following last year’s elections must bring all those responsible for ordering and carrying out the killing to justice and show that attacks of this nature will not be tolerated in Brazil.”
Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes were shot dead while driving through Rio de Janeiro’s Estacio neighbourhood on the night of 14 March 2018. Information disclosed by the authorities and uncovered by the press has raised concerns that investigators may not have followed the due process and could have been influenced by external interference.
Amnesty International calls on the Brazilian authorities to respect due process and appoint an independent and external team of experts to monitor the investigation and examine any allegations of negligence, wrongdoing or undue interference. The authorities must also take all necessary measures to guarantee the safety of the witnesses of the killing and the families of Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes, in accordance with their specific needs and wishes.
“A year on from Marielle Franco’s death, it’s clear that this was a carefully planned and executed targeted killing in which state agents likely participated at some level,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil.
“The Brazilian authorities must guarantee the rights to truth, justice and reparation for the families of Marielle Franco and Anderson Gomes. We will not rest until justice is done.”
Brazil is one of the world’s deadliest countries for human rights defenders. As Amnesty International has previously documented, the Brazilian authorities have a very poor track record of investigating killings of human rights defenders and killings that involve police officers.
Amnesty International has mobilized hundreds of thousands of people around the world in the past year to demand justice for Marielle. Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, is visiting Brazil from 11 to 14 March to mark the anniversary and remind the Brazilian authorities that the world is watching and will not rest until the case is solved.
Amnesty International encourages the international community, including foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations, to reach out to the Brazilian authorities and urge them to identify all those responsible for ordering and carrying out the killing and bring them to justice in a fair trial that meets international standards.
Additional information:
Known for defending the human rights of young black people, women, favela residents and LGBTI people, Marielle – herself a black bisexual woman born in a favela – was elected a Rio de Janeiro city councillor in 2016. She had previously served on Rio de Janeiro’s State Human Rights Commission from 2006 to 2016, where she frequently spoke out about extrajudicial executions and other human rights violations committed by police officers and state security forces. Shortly before she was killed, Marielle was appointed to monitor the federal intervention into public security in Rio de Janeiro.
The authorities investigating Marielle’s death have neither confirmed or denied that they are following lines of investigation reported by the media regarding the possible involvement in of military police officers, local officials, militia groups or a group of professional hitmen known as the “crime office”.
Reports in the press suggest the murder weapon was a HK-MP5 submachinegun, a model whose use in Brazil is restricted to security and military personnel and certain criminal justice officials. Several weapons of this model that were registered in the Rio de Janeiro civil police inventory in 2011 subsequently disappeared, while the ammunition used in the crime allegedly belonged to a federal police batch that went missing a few years ago.
Witnesses said that both Marielle’s car and that of her killers were moving when the shots were fired. The precision of the shots, which hit Marielle several times in the head, indicate that the shooter had undergone specialist training. Surveillance cameras at the exact scene of the crime were switched off one or two days before. Other surveillance footage shows two cars cameras following Marielle on the night of her killing. Local media reported that their number plates were false.
Throughout the investigation, forensic experts have made public allegations of negligence, improper procedures and violations of due process. These include allegations that there was no X-ray examination of the bodies during the autopsy, the car that they were killed in was stored improperly, and eyewitnesses to the crime were not called to make statements.

An investigation by Amnesty International has revealed that children as young as eight years old have been raped in the Yemeni city of Ta’iz. The suspected perpetrators, including members of militias backed by the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition, are yet to be held to account.
The families of four boys told Amnesty International that their sons had been sexually assaulted in a series of incidents over the past eight months. In two of the cases, families alleged that those responsible were Islahi-aligned militiamen supported by the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition. 
“The heartbreaking testimonies of these young survivors and their families expose how the ongoing conflict has rendered children vulnerable to being sexually exploited in a city plagued by weak security and institutions. These victims and their families have been left unprotected and alone to face the horrific ordeal of sexual abuse and its aftermath,” said Heba Morayef, Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.  
“The Yemeni authorities must thoroughly investigate these allegations to signal that these crimes will not be tolerated and to protect the children’s families from reprisal. Suspects, including members of the fighting forces and community leaders in trusted positions, must be brought to justice in fair trials. Rape and sexual assault committed in the context of an armed conflict are war crimes. Commanders who fail to stop such heinous acts can themselves be responsible for war crimes. ”
Amnesty International has documented four cases of sexual violence, namely the rape of three children and the attempted sexual assault of a fourth. Two medical reports seen by the organization indicated signs of anus lesions on two of the survivors which is consistent with their testimonies.
A pattern of impunity and reprisals has thus far discouraged families from reporting these incidents, especially since suspects are reported to be politically aligned with the local Islahi-controlled authorities. While two civilian suspects are currently detained pending trial in relation to two of the four cases, militia suspects have not been arrested in the remaining two cases. Amnesty International wrote to the Ta’iz prosecutor seeking comment and clarification but did not receive a response. In recent months, the Yemeni judicial system and institutions have been reactivated in southern parts of the country, handling a modest number of cases.
Families have faced a variety of impediments in reporting these incidents to the authorities. According to the families and documents reviewed by Amnesty International, all four cases were reported directly to the Criminal Investigations Department in Ta’iz. Even though the Criminal Investigations Department directed one of the main hospitals in Ta’iz to examine the three rape survivors and issue medical reports, the hospital failed to implement those orders in one case, despite repeated requests by the victim’s mother. Moreover, the hospital asked for money to produce the report, which the family was unable to afford.
These cases documented by Amnesty International do not appear to be the only incidents. Families and local activists reported at least two other cases in which families are too afraid to talk, fearing reprisal from local militias that are largely backed by members of the Saudi Arabia-led Coalition in Yemen. Two of the four affected families have had to relocate, fearing reprisals from militias.
Lack of accountability
In two of the four cases –  one rape and one attempted assault – families alleged that those responsible were Islahi-aligned militiamen.
A 16-year-old boy, who says he was raped in late December 2018 by an Islahi-aligned militiaman in an Islahi-controlled area of Ta’iz city, told Amnesty International:
“He threatened me with his rifle… he began to hit me with the back of the rifle, kicked me and pushed me into the wall to try and knock me out… he then said to me, ‘I want to rape you.’ I then started to cry… and asked him to consider me like his son. He got angrier and started hitting me more… he grabbed me by the neck and pushed me to the ground and I started screaming and he hit me with the rifle on my neck and raped me.”
The boy’s mother described the evening her son got back home after the incident:
“When he arrived that evening, he went directly to the bathroom. When he came out afterwards, I asked him what was wrong, and he wouldn’t tell me what had happened. He then began to cry, and I started crying.
“We sat next to each other for three days, both unable to eat or drink or sleep… his psychological state was very poor from the fright and his complexion looked yellow and drained… he just sat there staring into space. He was unable to sit afterwards or go to the bathroom for three days.”
She reported the rape to the Ta’iz Criminal Investigations Department who issued an order, seen by Amnesty International, that the forensic medical doctor should issue a report. The doctor, who works in a hospital under the control of the Islah group, refused.
The hospital then asked for money to produce the report but she was unable to afford to pay for it upfront. She said she would pay on delivery of the report, but it was never completed.
“The doctor told me there is nothing wrong with your son and wouldn’t produce a report. At that moment, I started shouting at him, ‘Aren’t you afraid of God?’”
According to another testimony, an Islahi-aligned militant attempted to sexually assault a 12-year-old boy in July 2018 in Ta’iz, but the boy escaped.
A relative of the boy told Amnesty International he was tricked into delivering a package to a neighbour’s house by a militiaman who then followed and attacked him:
“He took him into his bedroom and threw him onto the bed and threw his rifle down next to him… he began to threaten him and told him if he screamed or shouted, he would use the loaded rifle… He [militiaman] then went to close the bedroom door and started to undress… at that moment, the little boy got frightened and picked up the weapon and shot the man to defend himself… He then escaped.”
The attacker subsequently died. The family reported the incident to the local authorities but received no protection. They were attacked in their home two days later by militiamen belonging to the same group as the attacker. Three family members were injured, requiring surgery, and one person was killed in clashes.
Local authorities held the 12-year-old, his father and two brothers in voluntary detention for two weeks after the attack, to protect them from further reprisals.
Vulnerable to Assault
In another case, the mother of an eight-year-old boy told Amnesty International that her son was raped on at least two separate occasions between June and October 2018 by both the son of an Islahi imam and his friend at a local mosque. She explained that her son’s behaviour started changing and that he was very often in tears.
“My son told me that [the son of the Imam] locked him in the mosque’s bathroom and put his hand over his mouth, choking him, and he started to undress him… After he finished with him, he let another guy come in and also have his way with my son,” she said.
According to medical reports examined by Amnesty International, the eight-year-old boy has since been suffering from impaired mobility, lack of concentration and a concussion as a result of the repeated assaults and beatings.
His mother told Amnesty International he previously excelled at school but after the assault was unable to hold a pen or write. She explained that he now suffers from a sleeping disorder and is prone to uncontrollable crying and screaming.
Amnesty International also spoke to the father of a 13-year-old boy who says he was raped by the same two men at the same mosque.
“These horrific abuses illustrate how children are increasingly vulnerable during armed conflict where institutions and protection mechanisms break down, often creating a vacuum where abuse and exploitation can thrive. This is exacerbated by the absence of the rule of law in Yemen. Any delays to bringing the perpetrators of these attacks to justice risk more children being targeted,” said Heba Morayef.
“The Yemeni authorities, supported by humanitarian organizations working in the country, must also urgently provide support, medical care and psychosocial support to victims and their families.”
Like other conflict situations, sexual violence remains underreported in Yemen due to the difficulty of verifying cases because of the sensitivity of the issue. There are no publicly available, recent figures on sexual violence against children. However, the UN Population Fund report that 60,000 women are at risk of sexual violence, including rape. Sexual violence against boys and men in armed conflict is common but underreported, according to the UN.
Calls for accountability
In recent months, the Yemeni judicial system and institutions, which had not functioned for years, have been reactivated in southern parts of the country handling a modest number of cases.
According to the family of the 12-year-old, the militiamen have not been arrested for the subsequent attack, and they have had to relocate outside Ta’iz due to fear of reprisals, shutting down their family businesses. Similarly, no one has been arrested in relation to the rape of the 16-year-old and the alleged perpetrator – a militiaman – remains at large. Meanwhile, two civilian suspects are currently detained pending trial in relation to the remaining two cases.
“There must be prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations into all of these cases. Anyone against whom there is sufficient admissible evidence should be prosecuted in a fair trial without recourse to the death penalty and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishments,” said Heba Morayef.
Yemeni law provides for the use of the death penalty against sexual violence offenders. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child ratified by Yemen in 1991, obliges states parties to take all appropriate measures to protect children from all forms of physical or mental violence, including sexual abuse.
Background
Since 2015, Ta’iz has witnessed intermittent heavy clashes between Huthi forces and an amalgamation of anti-Huthi forces loyal to the Coalition and the Yemeni government, which intensified during 2018.
Four years of conflict have led to the proliferation of militias on the Coalition and Yemeni government side, with the main ones affiliated with Saudi-backed Islah or Salafist groups. Although they are nominally on the same side of the conflict, these militias have competing agendas and there is frequent infighting.
A recent Amnesty International investigation highlighted the risk of the illicit diversion of weapons from members of the Coalition to unaccountable militias – similar to groups in Ta’iz – accused of war crimes and other serious violations. The organization is calling on all states to immediately suspend arms transfers to members of all parties to the conflict in Yemen.
Since 2015, Amnesty International and other organizations have documented the impact of the continuing armed conflict in Ta’iz, including indiscriminate shelling by Huthi forces as well as other militias that have led to hundreds of casualties. The city of Ta’iz remains a humanitarian disaster, with the Huthi forces besieging it for nearly four years. Amnesty International has previously documented Huthi-imposed arbitrary restrictions on essential medical supplies and the movement of civilians and civilian goods.
Amnesty International has also documented how Coalition-aligned and Yemeni government forces harassed and intimidated hospital staff and endangered civilians by stationing fighters and military positions near medical facilities, particularly during fighting in late 2016. At least three hospitals were shut down due to threats against staff.
