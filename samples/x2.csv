A series of simultaneous press conferences were held in seven African countries on Wednesday to warn that millions of people in Darfur face death and disease. African non-governmental organizations joined Amnesty International offices in Africa to call on the government of Sudan to allow aid organizations resume their operations in the country. 
The coalition also called on the government of Sudan to stop harassing and intimidating human rights defenders and staff of national and international aid and human rights organizations.  
The government of Sudan shut down the operations of 13 international and 3 national aid organizations on 4 March. Their decision followed the issue of an arrest warrant against President Omar Al Bashir of Sudan by the International Criminal Court.  
The aid organizations have been in Darfur since 2003 and have been providing water, food, shelter and medicines to the people of Darfur because the government was unable to provide these essential supplies. The government of Sudan has not put measures in place to ensure that aid supplies to civilians would be unaffected.  
The President of Sudan is reported to have indicated that the government of Sudan intends to expel all aid organizations within one year.  
The coalition called on the government of Sudan to reverse and not implement this decision. They also called on the African Union, especially the Peace and Security Council, to use its influence and ensure that this threat by the government is withdrawn. 
Press conferences were held simultaneously in Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Mali.  
The coalition includes Amnesty International, East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Network, Human Rights Institute for South Africa, Access to Justice (Nigeria), Alliances for Africa (Nigeria), Centre for Rule of Law (Nigeria), Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (Nigeria), Committee for Defence of Human Rights (Nigeria), Human Rights Law Service (Nigeria), Legal Defence and Assistance Project (Nigeria), National Association of Democratic Lawyers (Nigeria), Partnership for Justice (Nigeria), Socio-Economic Rights & Accountability Project (Nigeria), West African Bar Association (Nigeria), Women Advocates Research & Documentation Centre (Nigeria), Women’s Consortium of Nigeria (Nigeria), Release political prisoners group (Kenya), Educational centre for women and democaracy ( Kenya) and Independent medical legal unit (Kenya).

WHEN: 17 October 2008 – International Day for the Eradication of Poverty 
WHAT: Amnesty International supporters take part in global events against poverty and inequality 
WHERE: Worldwide including United Nations Headquarters (New York), Australia, Belgium, Canada, Mexico, India, Switzerland, Turkey, UK  
People living in poverty are far too frequently excluded from discussions about how to improve their lives, Amnesty International said today on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.  
The organization said that the vicious cycle of poverty and human rights abuse could only be broken if people living in poverty were able to speak out and be heard. It urged governments to adopt policies that enable people living in poverty to be part of decision-making, as well as better analyzing how human rights violations drive and deepen poverty.  
Widney Brown, Amnesty International’s Director of International Law and Policy, said: “A key focus of this year’s International Day is ensuring that people living in poverty are at the centre of discussions about solutions. Too often decisions are made in which the people whose lives are most impacted are not even consulted, which makes the eradication of poverty ultimately less possible.  
“States need to dismantle barriers which obstruct people’s access to education, health care, food, clean water and sanitation. They must also address discrimination against people who endure human rights violations and who have the least access to justice, including indigenous people, women, children and people with disabilities,” she said.  
On Oct 17, at the United Nations: 
Widney Brown will take part in a major discussion on poverty at the UN in New York, which is set to be webcast on www.un.org 
Amnesty International has produced a film about Michael Nyangi, from the Kibera slum area in Kenya. Michael runs the Lomoro Microfinance organization, which works within six different slum areas in Nairobi. A qualified accountant, he created Lomoro five years ago when he was 23. It now has 150 members and helps people to start small, income-generating projects. Michael also lives in Kibera, one of the biggest slum areas, which is home to 1.5 million people.  
The film is set to be shown at the United Nations in New York on 17 October as part of events to commemorate the day, and so his views, and those of his neighbours, can better be heard.  
On International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, thousands of Amnesty International supporters will take part in worldwide protests (all times local):

Violence against women and girls is a priority concern for Amnesty International and in 2004 a global campaign to Stop Violence against Women was launched. So far the campaign has contributed to successes that have brought a number of legislative and policy changes at national levels, as well as supported efforts in the international arena for the adoption of Resolutions 1325 and 1820 by the United Nations Security Council. 

These resolutions on Women Peace and Security aim to ensure women’s equal participation in conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflict peacebuilding and to increase the human rights protection of women and girls in conflict situations.

Despite these advances, violence against women and girls remains widespread across the globe.  Recent research in Afghanistan, Armenia, Canada, Cote D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Jamaica, Haiti, Liberia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Venezuela, and the USA has shown that this violence is not only a human rights violation but also a key factor in obstructing the realization of women’s and girls’ rights to security, adequate housing, health, food, education and participation. Millions of women find themselves locked in cycles of poverty and violence, cycles which fuel and perpetuate one another.

Poverty is characterised by the daily experience of human rights abuses that lead people into deprivation, insecurity, exclusion and voicelessness. Poverty is an affront to human dignity and the worst human rights crisis in the world. It exists in all countries and affects women disproportionately – 70% of the world’s poor are women. 

Neither violence against women nor poverty are inevitable, though they combine to restrict women’s choices and put women at risk from violence. While all girls have the right to education, which is vital in allowing them to choose their futures, this right is often curtailed by violence and poverty. In countries such as Haiti, girls may have little choice but to grant sexual favours in order that they can pay their school fees. 

Others who go in search of a public place with lighting by which to do their homework because their home has no electricity, are attacked by groups of men. As a result of the abuse, it is likely that girls’ education will be disrupted or discontinued. 

Violence against women is a human rights abuse for which states are responsible. Amnesty International will continue to demand accountability from both national and international actors for these violations. It will continue to call upon states and the international community to ensure equal access to rights and services for women and girls. 

This includes systemically incorporating the analysis of the impact on the enjoyment of women and girls’ human rights into all strategies, programs and reporting related to poverty reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 

This must also include progress made in the elimination of gender-based violence. Human rights violations cannot be stopped, poverty ended, nor development achieved without the active participation of the people affected by these abuses, in particular women and girls.

Brothers Arash and Kamiar Alaei, two Iranian doctors, detained without charge for six months, are awaiting the verdict of the unfair trial they faced in a closed session before a Revolutionary Court in Tehran, Iran on 31 December 2008. 
Specialising in the prevention and management of HIV and AIDS, they have worked for nearly a decade on HIV and AIDS programs in Iran, notably those addressing harm reduction aimed at injecting drug users. 
Amnesty International fears that they are prisoners of conscience. Despite repeated calls from international bodies and by the organization and its worldwide membership, for the brothers to be released unless charged with an internationally recognizable criminal offence, the Iranian authorities responded by unfairly trying them. 
In a press conference on 30 December 2008, Iran’s spokesperson for the judiciary, Alireza Jamshidi stated that the Arash and Kamiar Alaei faced charges of “acting against national security through cooperating with America”, “propaganda against the system” and “membership in groups hostile to the system”. 
One of the charges appears to be Article 508 of Iran’s Penal Code. It allows up to ten years’ imprisonment for “cooperation” with an “enemy government”, though the Penal Code is silent as to what constitutes “cooperation” or what is meant by an “enemy government”. 
Amnesty International has repeatedly drawn attention to the catalogue of vaguely worded articles relating to association and ”national security” in Iran’s Penal Code. These prohibit a range of activities, such as those connected with public discourse, and, as in this case, contact with international bodies. 
The prosecution is said to have cited the brothers’ participation at international AIDS conferences as part of their scheme to foment a so-called “velvet revolution” against Tehran. 
“Contacts with international public health and academic bodies to share knowledge and ensure that HIV and AIDS sufferers obtain the best treatment possible should be acknowledged not criminalized,” said Drewery Dyke, Iran researcher at Amnesty International. 
The conduct of their one-day trial did not meet the most basic fair trial standards. The prosecutor was said to have refused to disclose in court some of the charges faced by the brothers, so that their lawyer, Masoud Shafie, did not know all the charges they faced in order to prepare an effective defence; he was not allowed to review all the evidence nor reportedly given adequate opportunities to refute the prosecution’s case. 
Jonathan Hutson, a spokesperson for Physicians for Human Rights stated that “The publicly announced charges were unfounded, politically motivated and illegitimate; […] they were not guilty of crimes. They were practicing good medicine.” 
At the time of the trial, the brothers had been held five months longer than what is envisaged in Iran’s Code of Criminal Procedures allows. Article 33 of the Code calls for cases to be settled within one month of arrest, and although temporary extensions to the detention order are allowed; it is not clear in the brothers’ case that the detention orders were, as required, documented, nor whether they had the opportunity to challenge the order. 
Who are the Alaei brothers?
Dr Arash Alaei was arrested by Iranian security forces on 22 June 2008.The following morning, they escorted him to his mother’s house in Tehran, where they arrested his brother, Dr Kamiar Alaei They also seized documents belonging to the brothers. 
Kamiar Alaei is a doctoral candidate at the State University of New York (SUNY) Albany School of Public Health in Albany, New York. He was due to resume his studies there last September. He holds a Masters degree in Population and International Health from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. 
Arash Alaei is the former director of the International Education and Research Cooperation of the Iranian National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. 
Since 1998, the Alaei brothers have been working on HIV and AIDS treatment and prevention programs, particularly focused on harm reduction for injecting drug users. 
The brothers’ work with drug addicts and prostitutes in Tehran featured in a 2004 BBC television documentary, Mohammed and the Matchmaker, in which Kamiar Alaei said: “We face a huge potential HIV problem in Iran, and in order to start to confront it we need to talk about the root causes […] Many people are still afraid to talk about it. Some people with HIV are ostracised and stigmatised, and they are often very isolated.” 
In addition to their work in Iran, the Alaei brothers have held training courses for Afghan and Tajik medical workers, and have worked to encourage regional cooperation among 12 Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries. 
Their efforts expanded the expertise of doctors in the region, advanced the progress of medical science, and earned Iran recognition as a model of best practice by the World Health Organization. 
Iran’s response to HIV and AIDS – pioneered at least in part by the brothers – has been accorded international respect, particularly the preventative measures promoted by Arash and Kamiar Alaei, 
According to the 2008 Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic (published by UNAIDS on 29 July 2008 and available at www.unaids.org) “the… support for needle exchange projects in countries such as the Islamic Republic of Iran… serve as clear examples of courageous, visionary leadership in the response to HIV”. 
However, the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which took office in August 2005, has started to remove its support for such centres. 
Over 3,100 doctors, nurses and public health workers from more than 85 countries have signed an online petition demanding their release. The petition can be signed at https://www.iranfreethedocs.org.

“I lost my house, rice and belongings like clothes and utensils. All houses were burned down and destroyed by the excavator and the bulldozer. They kept good-condition corrugated steel and planks of wood for themselves. They even took water jars and looted our chickens and ducks. They never came to evict us like this before.”

A villager in Sihanoukville, who lost her home on 20 April 2007. 
Amnesty International today said that forced evictions are one of the most widespread human rights violations affecting Cambodians in both rural and urban areas. At least 150,000 Cambodians across the country are known to live at risk of being forcibly evicted in the wake of land disputes, land grabbing and development projects. 
In sharp contrast to the rhetoric of the government’s pro-poor policies and in breach of international human rights laws and standards, thousands of people, particularly those living in poverty, have been forcibly evicted from their homes and lands, reveals a new Amnesty International report, Rights Razed – Forced evictions in Cambodia, launched today.   
The Cambodian authorities are not only failing to protect – in law and practice – the population against forced evictions, but are actively involved in these unlawful practices. 
 “The authorities have been instrumental in demolishing villages, setting homes ablaze and making poor people homeless without due process and at the behest of those who wield economic and political power,” said Catherine Baber, Director of Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Programme. “It is clear that relevant laws are seldom and arbitrarily applied, and  the authorities have not protected the human rights of people affected by forced evictions.” 
Rights Razed shows how affected groups have had no opportunity for genuine consultation before eviction, received little or no information on planned evictions, and had no access to adequate alternative housing. In addition, they have been left with no recourse to justice. The cases presented in the report also show how, contrary to international human rights law, the authorities have opted for eviction long before all other alternatives have been explored.   
“Unless the Cambodian government takes immediate and effective steps to ensure that its population, particularly those living in poverty, is protected against forced evictions, its poverty reduction agenda rings hollow. Cambodia urgently needs to end all forced evictions,” said Catherine Baber. 
Amnesty International calls on the Cambodian government to: 
•    End all forced evictions and introduce a moratorium for all mass evictions until legislation and policy is put into place that requires any further evictions to be conducted in full compliance with international human rights laws and standards.
•    Ensure that those victimised by forced evictions have access to, at the very least, minimum essential levels of shelter, clean water, sanitation, health services and education, including through the provision of humanitarian assistance where necessary.
•    Abide by its obligations under international human right law to give those affected by eviction an opportunity for genuine participation and consultation. 
Notes to editors: 
Background: 
A forced eviction is ‘the permanent or temporary removal against the will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection,’ according to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Forced evictions have been recognized by the UN Commission on Human Rights as a gross violation of human rights, and are also – as in the cases presented here – associated with other human rights violations.  
As a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and other international human rights treaties which prohibit forced eviction and related human rights violations, Cambodia has an obligation to stop forced evictions and to protect the population from forced evictions.

In this, the 60th anniversary year of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights (UDHR) on World Refugee Day, Amnesty International calls
on states to reaffirm everyone’s right to seek and to enjoy asylum from
persecution, as recognized in the words of article 14 of the UDHR. 

Almost two million Iraqi refugees, fleeing murder, kidnap, torture and ill treatment, are now living in Syria and Jordan.

In the Mediterranean region, asylum-seekers and migrants continue to die in the sea in their desperate attempt to reach Europe.
 


These are two of the many refugee problems that confront the world today.

Meanwhile, doors are being quietly closed. People fleeing Iraq now face
visa restrictions as they try to enter Jordan and Syria. Sweden, host
to the largest number of Iraqi refugees in Europe, has now changed its
approach and is returning refugees to very dangerous areas of their
home country. In the Mediterranean region, European Union countries
such as Spain and Italy are involved with interception operations and
joint migration control measures with countries in North and West
Africa. People are being sent back to the terrible situations they were
desperately trying to escape.

International assistance for Iraqi refugees in Syria and Jordan is
desperately needed, contributions to UN agencies working with refugees
from Iraq inadequate. In May 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) made a fresh appeal for increased funding for its
Iraq work. They cited a shortfall of $127 million for assistance
programmes without which essential health and food assistance programs
may have to be reduced, forcing many Iraqis into further destitution
and raising the likelihood of higher malnutrition rates and increased
rise of child labour. 

A total of 147 states are parties to the 1951 Convention relating to
the Status of Refugees (the Refugee Convention) or its Protocol – the
main international instruments protecting refugees. 

Amnesty International calls for world governments to ensure that their
actions and policies do not undermine the protection offered by the
Convention and other international instruments. Amnesty International
also believes that states should not only protect the rights of
refugees within their jurisdiction but should also help other countries
dealing with large scale refugee situations.

Amnesty International calls on the European Union to fully respect its
obligations towards refugees, by ensuring that its border controls do
not directly, or indirectly, force asylum-seekers to return to transit
countries where they would be at risk of arbitrary detention,
collective expulsion, refoulement – – as in the case of a number of
countries in North and West Africa – – even the risk of being dumped in
the desert without food or water. 

The organization also calls on the European Union to ensure that in the
development of its common asylum system, all asylum-seekers under the
jurisdiction of its member states have access to fair and satisfactory
asylum procedures regardless of their country of origin or transit, and
that the use of inadequate accelerated asylum procedures is ended.
 


Amnesty International urges states to increase the use of
resettlement as one of several responsibility-sharing tools to relieve
the burden of receiving states and to provide refugees with a durable
solution. For many refugees, it is the only way to ensure they have
access to basic rights such as education, health care and adequate
housing. For some, their illness, disability or trauma means they do
not have access to adequate care in their countries of asylum. Only
nine countries have traditionally had large resettlement programmes;
these have been recently joined by developing countries such as Chile,
Burkina Faso and Brazil, which have started to resettle small numbers
of refugees. Amnesty International calls on other states to join this
list.

Finally, Amnesty International urges states, in cooperation with UNHCR,
to develop an effective way of sharing the responsibility for large
numbers of refugees, as and when urgent situations arise.

The answer to this grievous problem cannot be to countenance human
suffering and turn our backs on people in tragic circumstances. It is
to take more responsibility for this global problem in a global way.

(Kingston) Amnesty International today criticized the Jamaican authorities for wilfully neglecting poor Jamaicans by failing to tackle the corruption and violence that is shattering their inner-city communities.
 

“Poor inner-city Jamaicans are paying the price of this public security crisis with their lives. They are being held hostage in an endless confrontation between criminal gangs, police officers who kill with impunity and authorities who are failing to protect their human rights,” said Fernanda Doz Costa, Amnesty International’s researcher on Jamaica.
 

In a new report released today at a press conference in Kingston, the organization revealed the reality of the hundreds of thousands of Jamaicans condemned to live with violent criminal gangs and abusive policing, and stigmatized by the authorities.
 

Jamaica has one of the highest rates of violence and police killings in the Americas with around 1,500 homicides and 272 police killings in 2007 – an average of three homicides a day and three police killings every four days. Most of the victims of violent crime live in deprived communities – where they also suffer from unemployment, poor access to health and education services, limited supplies of drinking water and poor sanitation.  
 

People living in inner-city communities are left at the mercy of gang leaders who use the vacuum left by the state to control huge aspects of their lives — including the collection of “taxes”, allocation of jobs, distribution of food and “scholarships”, and the punishment of those who transgress gang rules.
 

Criminal gangs were created in the 1960’s by the two main political parties – People’s National Party (PNP) and Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Jamaican governments and political leaders have actively helped create and maintain the environment in which gang violence could flourish.
 

Violence in these communities is particularly high when rival gangs are “at war” over territorial control. Entire populations are shut down by barricades and unable to leave their homes after 5pm. As a result, children don’t go to school out of fear and adults don’t go to work because transport is suspended.
 

As one woman from an inner-city community told Amnesty International, “At night we had to sleep on the floor, all of us, the children, the grandma, all of us; covered by the mattress because sometimes the shots can go through the house and kill us.”
 

“Criminal gangs make up a small proportion of the community population but their actions are devastating: they keep thousands of people living in constant fear and provide an excuse for government officials to label all community members as criminals,” said Fernanda Doz Costa.
 

Despite the violence they experience daily, community members are reluctant to report abuses due to fear of reprisals by gang leaders, lack of confidence in the judicial system and mistrust of police officers working in their communities.
 

“There are many good serving police officers in Jamaica who risk their lives every day to help improve security for Jamaican citizens. However, the political determination to bring human rights abusers to justice and purge corruption is still lacking,” said Fernanda Doz Costa. 
 

Amnesty International calls on the Jamaican authorities to take urgent and effective measures to tackle the underlying causes of this public security and human rights crisis – including the reduction of homicide rates in inner-cities, the introduction of human rights-based policing, and the reform of the judicial system to improve access to justice.
 

“The conversation that needs to take place in Jamaica is no longer about ‘ifs’ or ‘hows’ but about when to make the changes needed to stop the crisis taking any more lives and the answer is today.”)
 

A copy of the report “’Let them kill each other’ – Public Security in Jamaica’s inner cities” is available on: https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/AMR38/001/2008/en

This report describes some of the most serious human rights abuses being experienced by children in the context of the conflict in Nepal and highlights the failure of both the security forces and the CPN (Maoist) to respect children’s rights. It calls on both parties to take urgent measures to minimise the impact of the conflict on children’s lives. The report considers children in the contexts of being killed, detained and tortured; of sexual violence; education, abduction and recruitment; and children from fractured families.

Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab is a multidisciplinary team that uses cutting-edge digital investigation tools to document human rights violations remotely. It helps to ensure that information emerging from conflict areas is timely, accurate and meets the needs of human rights work in crises situations. 
This is particularly important in situations where it is dangerous for researchers to be on the ground, and in an era when disinformation and misinformation can spread rapidly.   
The Evidence Lab has been working hard to identify and verify the details of possible unlawful attacks which have killed or injured civilians, and destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. This documentation provides essential evidence which can later be used to hold perpetrators of violations accountable. 
The Evidence Lab collects audio-visual material and analyzes it for evidence of violations of international law. This material includes satellite imagery, video footage and photos of air strikes and other attacks, and of the aftermath of these attacks, as well as images of weapons remnants. Where possible, evidence is corroborated by interviewing witnesses to the attacks. 
Below is a list of attacks by Russian forces in Ukraine which the Evidence Lab has verified to date. Some of these – including strikes on hospitals and schools, indiscriminate attacks which killed or injured civilians, and the use of banned cluster munitions – may constitute war crimes under international law. 
*This list is regularly updated 
Part of Amnesty’s Crisis Response Programme, the Evidence Lab brings together open source and visual investigators, remote sensing experts, weapons analysts, data scientists, developers and other experts to conduct digital investigations and tell the stories of people most affected by conflict. 
The Evidence Lab website provides an online space to share best practices, new techniques, resources and guides, helping human rights investigators to take advantage of the vast amount of information which is shared online every day. 
Find out more about their work here. 
The Evidence Lab receives information from a variety of sources, including what is known as “citizen evidence” - material that has been collected by someone other than an established human rights investigator. 
This sort of documentation is frequently shared publicly through social media networks such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and often exposes in great detail abuses which might have otherwise gone unnoticed. The Lab also receives evidence directly from witnesses on the ground. 
Depending on what they are looking for, Evidence Lab researchers use a range of verification methods. These include: 
Geo and chrono-location 
Confirming where and when a video or photo was taken. This can be done by cross-checking the material with satellite imagery, ground level photography and other publicly available information. A researcher can look at the landscape, trees, buildings, and streets in the images, and check if they match with street views or other photos from a known location. 
The researchers can also analyze weather patterns and shadows to see if they match the conditions that prevailed when the photo or video was claimed to have been taken. 
Remote sensing 
The researchers use satellite imagery and other sensors such as Radar and LiDAR to look for tell-tale signs of attacks like destroyed buildings, craters, debris, troop or weapon movements.  A bird’s eye view is also important to cross-check and verify potential targets and understand the dynamics of these attacks. 
Weapons identification 
Amnesty International’s arms experts analyze photos, videos and other data to verify which weapons are being used and if they lead to human rights violations. This could include studying the shape of a crater left by a missile, watching footage of air strikes, or examining photos of weapons remnants. The researchers also analyze weapons trade data to understand ownerships of these weapons 
Eyewitnesses 
Importantly, the Evidence Lab works with researchers who interview eyewitnesses to attacks and collect testimonies that might corroborate the digital evidence. 
Preservation 
The Evidence Lab catalogues and preserves all the original evidence, together with all its verification and analysis for accountability and justice mechanisms. We aim to support relevant justice actors, and hand over our evidence to ensure perpetrators are held to account. 
The Evidence Lab works both intensively, documenting individual attacks in great detail, and in a big picture way, looking for broad patterns of violations and building a detailed timeline of events. A key goal is to provide an accurate account of events, combating the misinformation and disinformation that is often rampant during conflicts and other crisis situations. 
These documentation efforts are also useful in compiling a log of reliable evidence that could later be used to hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account. 
More broadly, we help to tell the stories of people who are directly affected by these crises and to give them a voice. 
Demand that the Russian authorities stop this act of aggression and protect civilians now.

Armed police on Monday afternoon raided a human rights workshop attended by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) activists in Kampala, prompting Amnesty International to reiterate its call on the government to end its outrageous harassment of people involved in lawful activities. 
At least five staff of the East and Horn of Africa Human Rights Defenders Project (EHAHRDP) who organised the workshop were detained by the police along with at least 12 of the workshop participants. 
Some of the participants, who were from Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania were able to escape after being informed by members of the media that the police were on their way. 
“This ludicrous and senseless harassment of human rights activists has no basis in law whatsoever and has to stop,” said Michelle Kagari, Amnesty International’s deputy director for Africa. 
“We are seeing a worrying pattern emerging whereby the Ugandan authorities engage in arbitrary activities deliberately designed to intimidate and threaten legitimate human rights work.” 
“The participants in this workshop had done absolutely nothing wrong and we call on the police to end this outrageous behaviour which makes a mockery of Uganda’s human rights obligations.”

Amnesty International have released a new video revealing how the organization helped to uncover the Pegasus Project spyware scandal. 
The video details how Amnesty International’s Security Lab played a crucial role in exposing the forensic evidence that proved the data could be connected to NSO Group’s Pegasus surveillance software. 
The short film features interviews with Amnesty Tech staff who worked on the months-long investigation before the story made headlines around the world in July 2021. 
Danna Ingleton, Amnesty Tech’s Deputy Director, said: “The Pegasus Project was the culmination of years of work investigating NSO Group’s shadowy Pegasus software. 
“Our new video provides an insight into how we developed our forensic tools to expose the vast scale of unlawful surveillance and human rights abuses that were ongoing, and also what needs to be done next to regulate an industry that is clearly out of control.” 
The Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media non-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, which conducted cutting-edge forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware. 
The collaboration revealed how NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware has been used to facilitate human rights violations around the world on a massive scale, following the revelation of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets. 
The Pegasus Project had significant impact that continues to reverberate around the world. On 11 March, the European Parliament voted to create a new “committee of inquiry” to investigate abuses of Pegasus by European member states. The Pegasus Project has also resulted in numerous criminal cases being brought by those who discovered their devices had been targeted with the spyware, including in France, Mexico and India. 
In November 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced NSO Group was being placed on a blocklist due to its “malicious cyber activity”. A few weeks later, Apple launched a legal action against NSO Group to “curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware”. The company praised Amnesty Tech and Citizen Lab for their ground-breaking work to identify cybersurveillance abuses. 
The video is available now on Amnesty International’s ‘Investigating the Truth’ YouTube channel here.

Fair Trial Manual – Second Edition 
The Amnesty International Fair Trial Manual is a practical and authoritative guide to international and regional standards for fair trial. These standards set out minimum guarantees designed to protect the right to a fair trial in criminal proceedings. The Manual explains how fair trial rights have been interpreted by human rights bodies and by international courts. It covers rights before and during trial, and during appeals. It also covers special cases, including death penalty trials, cases brought against children, and fair trial rights during armed conflict. This is the second, updated and revised, edition of the Manual and is available in Arabic, English, French, Russian and Spanish. Other language versions are in development. The first edition, published in 1998, is available here [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/POL30/002/1998/en] in six languages.  
“When I found the Fair Trial Manual, I felt like I had struck gold. It explains the multitude of legal standards in a comprehensive, straightforward and accessible way.” – Dr. Vivienne O’Connor, US Institute of Peace

(Moscow) – The Russian authorities have made little attempt to effectively investigate possible involvement by local officials in the July 2009 murder of the prominent human rights advocate Natalia Estemirova, Human Rights Watch, Civil Rights Defenders, Front Line Defenders, Amnesty International and the Norwegian Helsinki Committee said today, on the second anniversary of her death. The organizations, citing a new independent report detailing severe problems with the government’s inquiry, reiterated their call for a thorough, impartial, and transparent investigation and the prosecution of those responsible.“Two years after Estemirova’s murder, there are more questions than answers about the circumstances surrounding her killing,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Russian authorities need to deliver justice in Estemirova’s case to demonstrate their sincerity about protecting human rights in Chechnya and throughout the North Caucasus.”Estemirova, a researcher for the Russian human rights group Memorial on human rights abuses in Chechnya, was abducted outside her home in Grozny on the morning of July 15, 2009. Her body was found in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia later that day. She had been shot. Chechen authorities, including President Ramzan Kadyrov, had publicly criticized her relentless reporting of rampant human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances by the Chechen government. The circumstances of Estemirova’s death and the threats against her and others point to possible official involvement in or acquiescence to her murder.Despite repeated reassurances by the Russian authorities that Estemirova’s case was practically solved, the investigation appears mired in official findings that she was killed by Chechen insurgents in retaliation for having exposed some of their crimes. On July 14, the Memorial Human Rights Center, the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) and Novaya Gazeta published a report on shortcomings in the government’s investigation. They found, for example, discrepancies in the evidence taken from the car purportedly used in the killing, a failure to collect DNA samples from a broader range of suspects in Chechnya, and an unwillingness to look into a possible role by the Kurchaloi district police. The Kurchaloi district police had been implicated in an extrajudicial execution Estemirova had exposed in the weeks before her murder.  Threats and harassment against human rights defenders in Chechnya have increased since Estemirova’s murder, and the working environment remains very hostile. Three weeks after she was killed, Zarema Sadulaeva and Alik Djabrailov, activists with “Save the Generation,” a local nongovernmental organization, were also abducted in Grozny and murdered. The investigation into their killing has not yielded tangible results.  Staff members of the Joint Mobile Group of the Russian Human Rights Organizations in Chechnya (Mobile Group), established in November 2009 with lawyers and others from throughout Russia to work in Chechnya on a rotating basis, have been threatened on numerous occasions. Earlier in July, police in Grozny warned two local activists working closely with the group to discontinue their work. In February 2010, three of the group’s staff were arbitrarily detained by police authorities in the Shali district of Chechnya. They were unlawfully kept in custody overnight, and some of their equipment was confiscated or damaged. The responsible officials have not been held to account.  The Mobile Group is the recipient of the 2011 Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk and the 2011 Human Rights Prize of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. “The Mobile Group essentially picked up the mantle of Natalia Estemirova as it is now handling the most sensitive human rights cases in Chechnya,” said Mary Lawlor, Front Line Defenders director. “We are immensely concerned about security for its staff on the ground.”“The situation for human rights defenders in Chechnya is no better today than it was two years ago,” said Nicola Duckworth Europe and Central Asia Director at Amnesty International. “The authorities must demonstrate a sincere commitment to the defense of human rights defenders; this cannot be done without effective investigations into past killings.” The Russian government has obligations under both domestic and international law to investigate Estemirova’s case effectively and prosecute all those responsible, regardless of rank or position, the five organizations said. The standards for such investigations have been elaborated by the United Nations through the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, and other expert manuals and writings.The investigation should thoroughly examine possible official involvement in Estemirova’s murder, at all levels of government, the group said. It should not exclude the possibility of involvement of the republic’s leadership, which has been implicated in other cases of retaliation against those who expose abuses in Chechnya, made threatening statements to Estemirova and other Memorial staff, and fostered an atmosphere of impunity for law enforcement and security forces.“Estemirova exposed horrific abuses by military and law enforcement personnel at great personal risk,” said Marie Manson, program director for Civil Rights Defenders. “The Russian authorities need to fully investigate possible involvement of Chechen officials who may have seen her work as a threat, and may have been involved in her disappearance and murder.”

Bangladeshi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Hriday Chandra Mondal, a schoolteacher who was arrested on charges of “hurting religious sentiment” after he discussed in the classroom the distinction between religion and science, Amnesty International said. 
In the discussion at school, where teachers should be free to discuss any ideas or facts without fear of reprisals, the teacher argued that “religion is a matter of faith” while “science looks at evidence”, according to a recording that was filmed by [a student/someone in the class and?] shared on social media. In the audio recording accessed by Amnesty International, the teacher said: “There is no evidence in religion. Religion in the end says God will take care of everything. Religion offers memorized words whereas science shows evidence”. 
On 22 March, two days after the recording was made, the school’s headteacher told the media that students and other people from the community were demonstrating outside the school calling for punishment for Hriday Chandra Mondal. Later that day, an office assistant of the high school filed a case before the police against the teacher, who was subsequently arrested. He has since been held in judicial custody after being denied bail twice. The next bail hearing is scheduled for 10 April 2022 at the District and Sessions Judges Court. 
It is outrageous that a teacher finds himself behind bars simply for voicing his opinion while teaching a class. Teachers should be free to discuss ideas and opinions of all kinds without fear of reprisals. 
“Hriday Chandra Mondal is detained solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression and must be released immediately and unconditionally,” said Smriti Singh, Deputy Regional Director for South Asia at Amnesty International. 
“Hriday Chandra Mondal’s detention is emblematic of a disturbing trend in Bangladesh where the space for free expression is rapidly shrinking. Detaining a teacher for simply discussing ideas in class sets a dangerous precedent where even challenging students to think critically can now land someone in jail” 
Amnesty International has been documenting a growing sense of fear among people in Bangladesh stemming from the arbitrary detention and growing criminalization of the right to freedom of expression. Hriday Chandra Mandal’s case only exacerbates the situation and represents a direct threat for one of the last bastions of free expression in the country. 
Several civil society and academic organizations, including the Bangladesh Astronomical Association and the Centre for Women Journalists, have condemned the arrest and raised concerns about the ability of academics to teach. Similarly, human rights defenders, lawyers and teachers around the country have raised questions about the time of the arrest, which according to them appears to be politically motivated. 
“Hriday Chandra Mondal’s detention is a shameful demonstration of the erosion of the human rights situation in Bangladesh. The authorities must take urgent measures to improve the conditions that allow people to express freely and safely, and ensure that teachers can speak freely in class without fear of reprisals,” said Smriti Singh. 
Background 
Under international human rights law, the exercise of the right to freedom of expression may only be subjected to certain restrictions if they are provided by a clearly formulated law and are demonstrablynecessary and proportionate for the purpose of protecting specified public interests (national security, public order, or public health or morals) or the rights or reputations of others. Protection of abstract concepts or religious or other beliefs, or the religious sensibilities of their adherents, is not a permissible ground for restricting the right to freedom of expression. 
The UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief recently observed that “sensitivity concerning religious sentiments of different religious and belief communities should become an important feature of culture of communication… Subjective feelings of offensiveness, however, should never guide legislative action, court decisions or other State activities”.

By Yasmin Kayali, co-founder and CCO of Basmeh & Zeitooneh, a refugee-led organization in Lebanon 
In the midst of hardship and catastrophe, refugee-led organizations are making a real difference for refugees and locals alike.  
On August 4, a harrowing explosion rocked the port of Beirut, killing hundreds and demolishing homes, schools, and businesses for kilometers. This most recent catastrophe comes on the heels of the now rapidly-spreading COVID-19, and an economy that was already buckling. Here in Lebanon, we are tired and we are in pain.  
The situation is challenging for all. For some, it has become tragic. The over 1.5 million refugees who sought safety in Lebanon were already struggling. Without the right to work, and access to basic social services like health care severely compromised, refugees could not rebuild their lives. Now, refugees and Lebanese alike face a humanitarian crisis. 
In the face of these many hardships, the organization I co-founded, Basmeh & Zeitooneh (B&Z), has been there. When COVID-19 showed up in Lebanon, our staff toured refugee and Lebanese communities giving health awareness sessions, ramped up mask production and secured hundreds of tablets to keep our kids in school virtually. Between March and July, we distributed food baskets, hygiene kits, and cash assistance reaching more than 6000 households in need. 
As the currency has plunged and banks have closed, B&Z has remained diligent. If a mother visits one of our community centres looking for work, we offer her training in an embroidery workshop (for example), her baby can be cared for in our nursery, her middle child registers at our school, her eldest can receive vocational training and her husband can apply for a small business grant. This holistic system lifts up the whole family. 
And now, even as our own staff and families recover from injuries, we are in Beirut’s streets cleaning rubble, distributing hot food and water, fundraising to refurbish homes, and advocating for access to health care for all. Our community’s survival depends on it. 
In some ways, Basmeh & Zeitooneh is a typical refugee-led organization (RLO). Started by four Syrian activists — a lawyer, a marketeer and two engineers — we did what all community leaders do: put our hearts and heads into helping our fellow citizens. Because we are embedded within affected communities, we understand the ins-and-outs of daily challenges, can rally community resources to support vulnerable people, and will pivot quickly to respond to emerging needs. 
The explosion in Beirut, COVID-19, and economic collapse only highlight what has always been true: RLOs have the relationships, knowledge, and agility to help keep communities safe and stable. 
In other ways, Basmeh & Zeitooneh is an unusual RLO. What started as a small emergency response initiative in the basement of a Lebanese church, is active today around the world in Lebanon, Turkey, Kurdistan, Syria, the USA, the UK and Switzerland. At its peak, B&Z was supporting more than a million people with various programs annually, and employing more than 350 individuals — the majority of whom were refugees themselves. Though we struggle with sustainable funding, it is undeniable that we are among a very small group of RLOs globally that have grown to such a size. 
In truth, despite having the relationships, knowledge and agility to make a tremendous difference in the lives of refugees around the world, RLOs face massive hurdles when trying to access funding. Most funding applications don’t acknowledge or provide workarounds for realities on the ground (including challenges with banking, registration, and currency fluctuation that plague us now more than ever); use sub-contracting as a way of dictating programming; and rarely provide core funding. 
The cumulative impact of these practices can be devastating for refugee communities: sometimes the only programs available, and often the most trusted, are deeply under-resourced. In fact, less than 1% of humanitarian funding goes to local organizations. RLOs receive some small fraction of that. 
Where Basmeh & Zeitooneh has experienced growth it has been because we forged direct relationships with a handful of donors and influencers who respected our identities and trusted our viewpoints. In rare circumstances that approach has led to multi-year core funding, giving us the space to grow strategically and to establish an ongoing, sustained presence within communities. On rare occasions we’ve been invited to decision-making tables, and have been given a say in strategy. These practices need to become the norm if we are to see refugee communities around the world safe and stable. 
Despite our successes and tenure, Basmeh & Zeitooneh too still struggles.  For example, some of our schools are only funded until next year. Without support, hundreds of students will literally be on the streets. And, although the annual snowstorms are predictable, every year we have to wait until children start freezing to death for financing to appear. To provide a particularly fresh example: following the destruction of the port explosion, donors have expressed the desire for full-fledged emergency response, but remain unwilling to pay for core mission support (overheads). 
This is the continuation of a long-standing challenge: we have one finance officer managing four+ budgets and one grants officer managing 29+ partnerships. Our technical managers each manage three countries. This is unreasonable, and we know there is a better way. 
In honor of World Humanitarian Day, Basmeh & Zeitooneh has come together with Amnesty International, Asylum Access, Independent Diplomat, Local Engagement Refugee Research Network, Open Society Foundations, Oxfam International, Saint Andrew’s Refugee Services (StARS), Young African Refugees for Integral Development (YARID), and Xavier Project to demonstrate that it is possible to give what’s needed now to support refugee-led action around the world. 
Through a strategic partnership with NeedsList, donors can connect directly and immediately support RLOs around the world who are playing a critical role in responding to COVID-19, and many other challenges, that impact their communities. 
Please join us in supporting their responses, and in calling for increased support for RLOs around the world.

“The new measures on school management and national security education, including the establishment of taskforces to monitor student behaviour and activities, would significantly curb freedom of expression on campus in Hong Kong. 
“Banning expression of political opinion on campus is not a national security issue; it is a sweeping restriction and a blatant human rights violation. National security must not be used to deny students the right to express different political views. 
“According to the guidelines provided by the Bureau, school governance authorities will be asked to prohibit students and teachers from participating in political activities and expressing political views on campus. Books and teaching materials containing information that may ‘endanger national security’ are also to be removed. However, the authorities’ overly broad and vague definition of national security may further silence opposition views on campus. 
“International human rights law states that governments can only restrict rights in response to specific threats of the use of force that threaten a state’s existence or territorial integrity; peaceful political discussions and activities on campus are far from that. 
“The Hong Kong government must not use national security as a pretext to unnecessarily censor freedom of expression on campus.” 
Background: 
The Education Bureau (EDB) issued circulars to schools on Thursday (4 February) to provide guidelines on school administration in relation to safeguarding national security, including details on the implementation of learning and teaching resources for national security education in the school curriculum. 
The Bureau required school governance authorities to prevent and stop on-campus political activities, including displaying items advocating independence of Hong Kong, chanting political slogans and forming human chains. It said such activities may be “in breach of the Basic Law, the National Security Law and all laws applicable to Hong Kong”, for the purpose of enhancing students’ sense of national security, national identity and law-abiding awareness. 
School governance authorities are also required to form specific taskforces overseeing areas of school administration, staff management and student discipline, in order to “create a peaceful and orderly school environment and atmosphere”. 
According to international human rights law, expressions can only be punished on national security grounds if the authorities can demonstrate a clear and imminent threat of violence. In particular, if done peacefully, advocacy for a change in government or government policy, criticism or even insult to a state’s institutions or its symbols, or exposure of human rights violations, must not be penalized.

There’s a stereotype in some parts of rural Pakistan that the internet isn’t for women. It’s where people watch bad stuff or make illegitimate relationships. In a conservative Muslim society, women are not supposed to be online. Many women choose to use the internet in secret, so their family members – especially men – don’t know about it.  
I’ve seen blackmail, photoshopped pictures, hacking of personal accounts and rape threats. 
And that’s one of the reasons why women in some areas don’t feel safe online. They feel threatened in the same way they do offline. I’ve seen blackmail, photoshopped pictures, hacking of personal accounts and rape threats. Women activists and feminists are trolled and targeted as “unethical western agents”. Nearly half of reported cyber crimes are connected to the harassment of women on social media. 
The most shocking case I’ve seen is when some men filmed the rape of a female teacher in a remote village and then spread the video by MMS. The community reacted terribly towards her. The accused are behind bars but the woman’s life is totally ruined. She can’t go back to teach kids because her village sees her as the guilty person. 
Online blackmail is a real problem too.There was a recent scandal in Peshawar where two male students hacked women’s Facebook profiles. They said they would post the women’s personal details – phone number, home address, details of intimate relationships, everything that they could find – unless they received money.  
The women complained to Facebook, but they said the pages did not violate their community guidelines. The problem was that the Facebook teams had no knowledge of the local language, Pashto. Eventually, they took the pages down and the girls reported the case to the Federal Investigation Agency who arrested the two hackers.  
And then there’s trolling, the worst of which is directed at female journalists. Our society is changing, but women are still meant to make babies, cook food and look after the home. They are not supposed to be intellectual or take part in political discussions. So whenever a woman speaks out on social media, some men see them as a threat 
Women do need to be cautious online. But being safe is less about using specific security tools and more about changing behaviour. That’s why I’m teaching young women at universities and colleges about using the internet safely. It’s about really basic things, like how to make a strong password to stop your profile being hacked, or making sure you use a secure web browser. They’re also learning about the law and how to make a complaint so that it is properly considered by the authorities.   
The spark and shine when I see women using social media for the first time is amazing. 
But the internet is brilliant for women in Pakistan.It’s a way for them to stay in touch with their families. It means they can speak freely and get the information they need. And it gives them a way to earn a living without leaving their house, for example by doing data entry or writing online articles. Women need to be able to deal with the negatives of the internet so they can make the most of the great opportunities it provides. 
I’ve been many times to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where Malala is from, to do ‘safe online spaces’ workshops with young women and girls. The spark and shine when I see them using social media for the first time is amazing. They’re like: “Wow! What is this?” They make their own Twitter accounts, they send each other Tweets, and just absolutely love it. I can see the sense of liberty and freedom in their eyes. I have to kick them out of the lab in the evening!

Turkish authorities have an opportunity tomorrow to release from custody one of its mostinternationally respected human rights defenders, Prof. Dr. Şebnem Korur Fincancı, who has beenunlawfully detained since 26 October 2022. It is her second unlawful detention in six years inretaliation for her renowned medical and rights work. 
Today Amnesty International, DIGNITY, Human Rights Watch, the International RehabilitationCouncil for Victims of Torture, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), REDRESS and the WorldMedical Association call on the Turkish authorities to release Prof. Dr. Korur Fincancı, thepresident of the Turkish Medical Association’s Central Committee, member of the Executive Boardof the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, member of the International Forensic Experts Groupat IRCT, and Advisory Council member at PHR. Korur Fincancı, who has exhumed mass graves inBosnia for the U.N. and conducted other high-profile forensic investigations in Turkey and abroad,is one of the country’s foremost forensic physicians and a longtime partner to leading medical andhuman rights organizations. 
“At tomorrow’s hearing the Turkish court can right an outrageous wrong, not only for ŞebnemKorur Fincancı but for human rights advocates everywhere,” said Erika Dailey, director ofadvocacy and policy for PHR. “Korur Fincancı, an acclaimed forensic physician, has dedicatedmuch of her life to fighting torture and ill-treatment in Türkiye and around the world. We now callfor a fair hearing that leads to dropping these spurious charges and her immediate andunconditional release.” 
The hearing, which will take place at 09.30 (CET+2) on 23 December before the İstanbul 24thHeavy Penal Court, will be attended by international trial monitors, including from theInternational Rehabilitation Council for Victims of Torture, PHR, and others. The prior pressconference, organized by the Turkish Medical Association and the Human Rights Foundation ofTürkiye on 22 December, will be livestreamed on YouTube. 
Korur Fincancı is a distinguished expert on the documentation of torture. She collaborated withIRCT, PHR and others in creating the Istanbul Protocol, the international standard for forensicinvestigations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. She was awarded the Hrant Dink Prize in2014, Physicians for Human Rights Award in 2017, and the Hessian Peace Prize in 2018. Leadinganti-torture campaigners spoke out on Dr. Fincancı’s arbitrary arrest in The Lancet in November.Following her detention, the Ankara civil court lodged a complaint against the Turkish MedicalAssociation. “Dr. Korur Financı is one of the Turkish physicians who has been persecuted in recentyears merely for speaking out for the protection of health and human rights,” said Dr. MicheleHeisler, PHR’s Medical Director. “Part of the Turkish government’s crackdown aims to strip theindependent Turkish Medical Association, which represents about 60 percent of the country’sphysicians, of its autonomous leadership through legislative sleight of hand. Health professionalseverywhere should rally to the aid of their besieged colleagues in Türkiye.” 
A separate civil lawsuit has been initiated in Ankara under the Law on the Turkish MedicalAssociation (No. 6023) seeking to remove the elected leadership of the Turkish MedicalAssociation and its local branches. 
In June 2016, Korur Fincancı and two co-defendants were arrested, briefly imprisoned, andcharged with disseminating “terrorist propaganda” after taking part in a solidarity campaign with anewspaper critical of the government of Türkiye. She was acquitted in July 2019, but her acquittalwas overturned on appeal in November 2020 and her re-trial is ongoing. 
“Şebnem Korur Financı’s arbitrary detention is part of a deliberate strategy put in place by thegovernment to discredit her long-standing work in investigating grave human rights violations as aforensic expert and a human rights defender in Türkiye and around the world. The authorities’reaction and her arrest constitute a blatant violation of her freedom of expression and testify oncemore of the ongoing crackdown on human rights in the country,” said Lisa Henry, SecretaryGeneral at IRCT. 
Prof. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, Chair of Council of the World Medical Association, said, “Herwork should be lauded, not punished.” 
Amnesty International, DIGNITY, Human Rights Watch, IRCT, PHR, REDRESS and the WorldMedical Association reiterate their calls for all charges against Şebnem Korur Fincancı to bedropped and for an end to the unjust targeting of physicians and dissenters in Türkiye.

**UPDATE** The trial of the 18 members of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light took place on 20 September. Three members were sentenced to one year in prison and the rest of the group to six months in prison, with fines.Algerian authorities should immediately drop all charges against 18 members of the Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light minority group and release three of them who have been detained since June, Amnesty International said today, ahead of their trial on 6 September for “participating in an unauthorized group” and “denigrating Islam”. 
“It is a travesty of justice that these individuals are being detained or prosecuted over their religious beliefs,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. “They should be allowed to peacefully practice their religion without risking intimidation or reprisals from the authorities.” 
Three members of the religion continue to be held in detention despite their lawyers appealing for their release on three separate occasions. The court rejected the lawyers’ requests on the grounds that the investigation is ongoing. 
It is a travesty of justice that these individuals are being detained or prosecuted over their religious beliefs. 
In an interview with Amnesty International before his arrest and detention, Redouane Foufa, the group’s coordinator in Bejaia, said that around 30 soldiers had previously searched the house he shares with other members of the group, and seized ID cards, passports, phones and laptops. 
Yasmine Guissi, Redouane Foufa’s niece, told Amnesty International: “In the beginning, the families were hopeful. We were thinking they would be released, but it kept dragging on and now it is really hard. Their kids keep asking, ‘where is baba?’ The kids are not allowed to go to visit them, and anyway the family can only visit once every two weeks.” 
Souhila Benkaddour, the wife of Cherif Mohamed Ali, another detained member of the group, discovered she was pregnant after her husband was detained, yet was unable to tell him the news. Cherif found out two weeks later from his lawyer. 
She told Amnesty International: “When I found out that I was pregnant, after four years of waiting, I kept the images of our baby in my womb from the first scan to show to my husband when he got out of prison.…  Today I am living another joy while he is absent – I found out the gender of our newborn boy. God willing, my husband will be present with me during the birth.” 
Background 
The 18 members of the Ahmadi group face trial at the first instance court in Bejaia on 6 September, having been charged under Article 46 of the Law on Associations and Article 144 bis 2 of the Algerian Penal Code. 
The Ahmadi Religion of Peace and Light was established in 1993. The religious group, which has around 70 active members in Algeria, follows the teachings of Imam Mahdi and venerates Imam Ahmed al-Hassan as its divine guide. Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Algeria has ratified, governments must ensure the right to freedom of religion, thought, and conscience of everyone under their jurisdiction, and in particular to religious minorities. This right includes the freedom to exercise the religion or belief of one’s choice publicly or privately, alone or with others. 
However, in 2006, Algeria passed Decree 06-03 which introduced restrictions on the exercise of religions other than Islam. Between 2017 and 2022, Algerian authorities used both this Decree and the Penal Code to prosecute hundreds of non-Sunni believers and to close several Protestant churches. 
Algeria’s new Constitution, adopted in November 2020, dropped freedom of religion and belief from the Rights and freedoms chapter, and only upheld “freedom to practice religion” while stating that it “must be exercised in respect of the law.”

Presidential elections in Dominican Republic offer an “extraordinary opportunity” in the battle for human rights, Amnesty International said as it urged candidates to take a public stand on a range of issues including alarming levels of police killings, violence against women and abuses against migrants. An open letter details a series of recommendations for presidential candidates, including the need for an extensive reform of the police, the appointment of an ombudsman and the provision of effective measures of redress in cases of gender based violence, abuses against migrants, denial of identity documents to Dominicans of Haitian descent and forced evictions. “The presidential elections offer an extraordinary opportunity to discuss the challenges faced by the Dominican Republic, including on how to better protect and promote human rights,” said Javier Zúñiga, Special Advisor at Amnesty International. “Human rights must not be seen as a secondary or separate issue from daily issues of politics and economics, but as integral and essential to the Dominican society.” Amnesty International formulated recommendations to candidates on a number of human rights issues, including: Human rights violations by the police in the context of public security The National Police is responsible for a high level of human rights violations, including unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests. Abusive policing methods have shown to exacerbate the problem of public security, by alienating large parts of the population from the police and by sending the message that it is legitimate to take justice into one’s own hands. Human rights violations by the police are often inadequately investigated and many officers responsible are not brought to justice. Amnesty International believes the new President should ensure that the Office of the Prosecutor General instructs all prosecutors to investigate thoroughly all allegations of human rights violations by the police. The president should also initiate a comprehensive human rights based reform of the National Police, which should include aspects related to recruitment, promotion and vetting of officers, internal and external oversight on the police and working conditions of officers. The new president will also have to ensure that victims and families of victims of human rights violations by the police receive full reparation. Violence against women and girls The manifestos of several presidential candidates include legislative, policy and administrative measures to enhance prevention of gender-based violence and improve care for survivors of violence. Whoever wins the election will be expected to implement a range of measures including creating units to assist women survivors of violence in each of the country’s 32 provinces; steps to ensure satisfactory prosecution of cases of gender-based violence; an increase in the number of trained personnel in the Public Prosecutor’s Office working to combat violence against women and girls and ensure the establishment of a minimum of one shelter for each of the country’s nine regions. The new President should also promote the reform of national legislation in order to ensure that abortion is permitted at least when the pregnancy poses a risk to the life or grave risk to the health of the woman and when the pregnancy is the consequence of rape, sexual assault or incest Abuses against Dominicans of Haitian origin and Haitian migrants Hundreds of thousands of Dominicans of Haitian origins have been denied access to identity documents by the Central Electoral Board. This results in people being denied access to education, employment and health services, the right to vote and citizenship. The Dominican authorities continue to carry out mass expulsions of Haitian migrants, inspite of an appeal in February 2010 (renewed in June 2011) from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to suspend all involuntary returns to Haiti on humanitarian grounds, following the 2010 earthquake. Most of these mass expulsions continue to be carried out in breach of international human rights standards and those expelled have no recourse to appeal. The new president will be responsible for ensuring that the rights of all Dominican and Haitian origin and Haitian migrants are respected and protected. Forced evictions According to local NGOs, at least 100 forced evictions were carried out between January and September 2011 across the Dominican Republic. Most of the evictions are executed without due process or consultation with the communities affected. They take place to make lands available for the construction of infrastructure, tourist estates or industrial complexes. On several occasions, fatalities and injuries from gun shots by the armed forces have been reported during forced evictions. The new president will have to ensure that evictions only occur in exceptional circumstances and only after genuine consultation with communities. Consultations must cover the identification of all feasible alternatives to eviction, resettlement options, and they must ensure people forcibly evicted are provided with adequate notice, adequate alternative accommodation, compensation, and effective remedies. Amnesty International invited candidates to present written responses on the issues raised indicating its intention to make them public before the election date. Presidential elections in the Dominican Republic are scheduled for 20 May 2012.

Prisons in Ghana are failing to meet international standards. Remand or unconvicted prisoners can spend years awaiting trial and may be held in conditions that amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Both unconvicted and convicted male prisoners experience unacceptably high levels of overcrowding. Food supplies to prisoners have been grossly inadequate. Access to health care is far below acceptable standards. Opportunities for education and training are limited and not available to remand or unconvicted prisoners or those held under sentence of death.

The arrest of Joseph Kony, a prominent leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), must be carried out in accordance with human rights standards, Amnesty International said today following the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Kony and three other LRA leaders have evaded capture since 2005 when they were charged by the International Criminal Court (ICC) with crimes against humanity and a raft of war crimes, including murder, forcible enlistment of children under the age of 15, sexual slavery and rape.  For many years, Amnesty International has been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested.“Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial,” said Erwin van der Borght, Africa director at Amnesty International. For more than two decades, Amnesty International has documented crimes committed by the Lord’s Resistance Army and their horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda. Amnesty International has also documented human rights violations committed by the Uganda People’s Defence Forces against the civilian communities where the LRA were present, and against captured LRA members.“It is important to remember that many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment,” said Erwin van der Borght “Forces pursuing the LRA must seek to arrest the suspects in accordance with international law.” Every effort must also be taken to protect the civilian communities where the LRA are present, recognizing that they are at grave danger of attack and being forcibly recruited into the LRA.Amnesty International believes that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony should be led by the governments of the countries in the region where the LRA operates, not by the US armed forces. The UN and the African Union, both of which are involved in the effort to arrest the LRA suspects, also have an essential role to play in supporting efforts to arrest the LRA leaders, in protecting affected communities and monitoring and reporting on the status of human rights protection.“Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights. It is also vital to make sure that any action ensures the protection of civilians in the surrounding areas.” The death of any of the accused men would deny justice to the victims of LRA abuses. 
Measures also need to be taken to provide reparation to the victims of human rights violations by the LRA to address their suffering, including providing medical and psychological care to victims of sexual violence and reintegrating child soldiers back into their communities and to make education and vocational training available to them.

The London Conference on Somalia has not adequately tackled the dire human rights situation in the country which is threatening the lives of civilians including children, Amnesty International said today. “The recent surge in military operations increases civilians’ vulnerability to attacks and displacement, and brings more arms into a country already awash with weapons,” said Benedicte Goderiaux, Amnesty International’s Somalia researcher. “This is a lethal mix that could fuel further human rights abuses. At this conference we hoped to see more efforts to improve the safety of the Somali population.” Though the conference’s closing communiqué made some reference to human rights, it fell short of the measures required to address the risks faced by civilians in Somalia. At a minimum the international community must ensure that its current actions in Somalia do not contribute to a further deterioration in the human rights situation. The international community must take concrete measures to increase the monitoring, documenting and public reporting of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed by any party to the conflict in Somalia. Children in Somalia are particularly vulnerable in the armed conflict. They continue to be killed – including in recent airstrikes in southern Somalia – while many more lose parents, carers and homes to the fighting. Armed groups specifically target children, recruiting them as child soldiers, and denying them access to education. The step up in military operations against al-Shabab has led the armed group to intensify their child recruitment drive. The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) and militia affiliated with them have also been accused of having child soldiers in their ranks.   The international community should ensure that effective mechanisms are put in place for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers. Until then, no military or security assistance should be provided to armed forces and groups that use child soldiers, and the international community must respect and strengthen the UN arms embargo on Somalia. “It is disappointing that international discussions continue to sideline the protection of civilians, and especially children. There is no question that this must be central to any strategy to improve the future of Somalia,” said Benedicte Goderiaux.   Amnesty International is also calling for action to address wide-ranging impunity for the decades of human rights violations and abuses committed in Somalia, some of which could amount to war crimes. An independent commission of inquiry should be established to investigate these abuses. “Unless impunity is tackled, perpetrators of human rights abuses will have no incentive to stop and others will be encouraged to commit abuses,” said Benedicte Goderiaux. “The international community must not leave Somalia’s civilian population to bear the brunt of this endless cycle of violence.”

The elementary school in the Slovak village of Šarisské Michaľany in the Prešov region must desegregate Roma classes as ordered by a court decision communicated earlier this month, said Amnesty International and the Slovak non-governmental organization (NGO) Center for Civil and Human Rights.In a landmark decision, the Prešov District Court ruled on 5 December 2011 that the school had discriminated against Romani children by teaching them in separate classrooms without reasonable justification. The decision was delivered by the court on 3 January 2012.  “For the first time a domestic court in Slovakia has addressed the widespread and unlawful practice of segregated education of Romani children that affects the lives of thousands of children and traps them in a cycle of poverty and discrimination,” said Barbora Černušáková, Amnesty International’s expert on Slovakia.“Romani children in the elementary school in Šarisské Michaľany are starting the new term in segregated classes but it must not be for long. The school must make immediate arrangements so that they can enjoy the same educational standards as other children within integrated classes,” said Stefan Ivanco from the Centre for Civil and Human Rights.For years the elementary school in Šarišské Michaľany has organised separate mainstream classes on a different floor of the building attended exclusively by children of Roma ethnic origin. This situation was compounded in the school year 2008/2009 when the school transferred to the separate classes all the remaining Romani children who had previously attended integrated classes with other children from the majority population. The proceedings against the school were initiated by the Center for Civil and Human Rights in June 2010. The Center argued that this segregated education of Romani children in separate classes constituted a serious form of unlawful discrimination based on their ethnic origin and a violation of their right to an education free from discrimination. Amnesty International submitted a written intervention in the case highlighting that the separation of Romani children in segregated Roma-only classes constitutes a violation of the right to equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination under international law.    The Prešov District Court rejected the school’s arguments that the education of Romani children from socially disadvantaged background in separate classes is the only means to provide equal quality of education for all pupils. The school had argued that the separate classes were set up to allow teachers to adopt a more individualised approach when teaching those children. However, the school failed to provide any evidence of the benefits for the Romani children of being taught in separate classes and that the measure was only temporary rather than long term. Furthermore, drawing on a range of international and regional human rights standards including relevant judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court stated that the school practice of segregated education violates the country’s human rights obligations. The school is considering whether to appeal the District court decision. “The school authorities must eliminate all forms of segregation and replace it with inclusive education. This may be a challenging task, but there is no alternative in order to fully realise the rights of all pupils in the school. We will be happy to assist the school in formulating and implementing an internal desegregation plan in line with the Court’s decision,” said Stefan Ivanco from the Center for Civil and Human Rights.”The implications of the Court’s decision go much further than the elementary school in Šarišské Michaľany. It is a wake-up call for Slovak schools in general to adopt an inclusive approach based on the ethnic, cultural and social diversity of children. Inclusive education in a diverse environment teaches them to be friendly, tolerant, considerate and responsible in a society that is inherently diverse.”   “All elementary schools must develop an individualised approach to teaching which does not unjustly exclude any child from mainstream education. National and local governments have to fully support them in line with their domestic and international legal obligations.” Amnesty International and the Center for Civil and Human Rights have been raising concerns over entrenched discrimination and segregation of Romani children in Slovak schools with the Slovak government for years. In September 2010, Amnesty International recommended a set of measures to be taken by the government in order to ensure the prohibition of segregation is enforced and put into practice. “The Court’s ruling against segregation in education based on ethnic origin in one particular school must spur Slovak authorities into action. Following the resignation of the government in November 2011, all political parties that will form the new government following elections in March must pledge to eradicate the existing systemic discrimination and segregation within the school system in the country,” said Barbora Černušáková from Amnesty International.“Real change won’t happen without genuine political will. So far we have seen very little action from the Slovak authorities. Accountability for the elimination of discriminatory barriers and for the successful integration of Romani children into mainstream education lies with the Slovak government.”

The Center for Civil and Human Rights (Poradòa) is a non-governmental organization focusing on the protection of human rights in the Slovak Republic, with special emphasis on the rights of minorities and protection from discrimination. Since its establishment in 2002, Poradòa has been combating the extensive problem of discrimination against the Roma minority in Slovakia in various areas, especially in access to public services, employment, education and health care. Moreover, it has been working on issues related to the protection of reproductive rights, specifically, it has been trying to eliminate the practice of forced and coercive sterilization on Roma women in Slovakia. Poradòa also provides free legal counselling in the area of discrimination and continuously litigates strategic cases of racial discrimination in Slovak courts, including Slovak Constitutional Court and European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

The Afghan government must work with neighbouring countries to protect human rights while facing an increasingly bloody insurgency, Amnesty International said today as a conference in Istanbul brought together officials from across the region.  
Heads of state from Afghanistan and Pakistan joined other regional officials and key partners – including the USA and NATO – at the conference to discuss a road map for Afghanistan’s security handover, planned for 2014.  
“The security of Afghan people is inextricably intertwined with that of the wider region, and any road map must ensure improved protection and promotion of human rights across the region,” said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Programme Director.  
“Particularly, the stability and prosperity of the region depends on authorities on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border taking action to prioritize human rights – especially women’s rights – in the run-up to and after the NATO handover.” 
Amnesty International’s recent assessment of the state of human rights in Afghanistan shows that some progress has been made in the decade since the US-led military intervention began. This includes enacting new human rights laws, a decrease in discrimination against women and better access to education and health care.  
But progress has faltered on justice and policing in the country, and in improving conditions for the more than 450,000 people displaced by the conflict. Civilian deaths are on the rise, with the vast majority of civilian casualties now attributed to the Taleban and other insurgent groups. Afghans living in areas heavily affected by the insurgency have seen a serious deterioration in their living conditions.  
While NATO forces have committed to build up the capacity of Afghanistan’s security forces to protect Afghan people, serious and persistent challenges remain. 
A UN report last month documented widespread torture in detention centres run by the Afghan intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security. Amnesty International has for years raised concerns about such ill-treatment of detainees.  
Peace negotiations with the Taleban and other insurgent groups have also been shrouded in secrecy, with the Afghan people, including civil society, human rights activists and even the Afghan parliament, not adequately informed about progress.  
“If peace talks with the insurgents are to result in a genuine, legitimate process, more transparency is crucial. It is unacceptable that Afghanistan’s own population is kept in the dark about the negotiations,” said Sam Zarifi.  
“It is also essential that women’s rights are not traded away during reconciliation talks with the Taleban and that Afghan women are meaningfully represented at the negotiating table.”  
Amnesty International has outlined key areas where Afghan authorities and their international partners must stand firm in negotiations, to defend the limited improvements in human rights in recent years.  
These include upholding advances in women’s rights, as well as ensuring freedom of expression for all, as the country has seen a burgeoning community of independent journalists in recent years.  The Afghan government must also work with the International Criminal Court to investigate those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan. 
“It is absolutely essential for the road map drawn up by Afghanistan and its partners to draw a red line around the human rights improvements made so far. These important advances are non-negotiable and must form the basis for future progress,” said Sam Zarifi.  
A conference in Bonn next month will bring together hundreds of delegates to discuss the international community’s role in promoting Afghan stability after the troop pull-out in 2014.
