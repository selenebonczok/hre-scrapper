“The absence of basic requirements of a fair trial – such as having access to a lawyer – strips today’s verdict of any reliability or credibility.
“The eight men were held in solitary confinement for over a year – this in itself can amount to torture. They were also denied access to their lawyers from the beginning of the trial; a number of the men claimed they had been tortured to sign so-called confessions but there have been no investigations into these claims. These details leave us with no confidence in the process that led to the conviction of the three men.
“It is welcome news that five men were acquitted; however, the authorities must now effectively investigate allegations of torture and quash the unreliable convictions of the remaining three. If there is not sufficient evidence against them and they cannot be prosecuted fairly, they too should be acquitted and released.”
“The flagrant disregard for human rights in this case is incongruous with the global image of a state-of-the-art, open and inclusive state that the authorities in the UAE seek to project.”
Background:
The eight Lebanese citizens were detained in the UAE between December 2017 and February 2018. They lived and worked in UAE for more than 15 years, seven of them worked with Emirates Airline.
All have been held in solitary confinement, charged with terrorism-related offences, and denied access to legal representation. A number of them have reported having been tortured in order to sign “confessions,” which they were not allowed to read. The charges they face include “forming a terrorist cell” and planning “terrorist” attacks in the UAE on orders of Hezbollah, a Shi’a political party and armed group based in Lebanon.

“Alabama’s vote is the latest in a string of abortion bans specifically designed to strip people’s reproductive rights away. These bans will be deadly, endanger pregnant people’s lives, and criminalize doctors and health care providers for simply doing their jobs and providing care.
“These bans reinforce violence against women by victimizing survivors of rape and sexual violence twofold by denying their right to access abortion. They are a gross and dangerous turn back to a dark history where women risked their lives to access their sexual and reproductive rights.”

In June last year, one of my colleagues at Amnesty International received a WhatsApp message from an unknown number. It contained details about a protest supposedly taking place at the Saudi embassy in Washington DC, and my colleague was instantly suspicious. The message came at a time when Amnesty International was campaigning for the release of six jailed activists in Saudi Arabia, and something didn’t feel right.
An analysis of the links in the message proved these suspicions to be well-founded. Amnesty’s Tech team found that clicking the link would have secretly installed potent spyware on the phone, obtaining total access to calls, messages, photos and GPS location. A closer look enabled us to trace the attack back to a secretive Israeli company: NSO Group.
NSO Group sells surveillance software to governments and has been linked to digital attacks on human rights activists all over the world. The attempt to spy on Amnesty was the final straw for us. Today I am providing evidence to support 30 plaintiffs taking legal action in Israel, petitioning the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to revoke NSO’s export license. As I have set out in an affidavit to the court, NSO’s software is a threat to activists and journalists all over the world. Digital rights group Citizen Lab has linked the company to attacks against civil society in Bahrein, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We cannot sit back and watch while NSO becomes a go-to for repressive governments.
Like many previously documented attacks, the message sent to Amnesty had all the hallmarks of Pegasus, a dystopian piece of NSO software which can gain control of a phone’s keypad, camera and microphone. Pegasus was the tool used to track Ahmed Mansoor, an Emirati human rights defender who is currently serving a ten-year jail sentence. Citizen Lab has also exposed Pegasus’s role in a spyware scheme targeting Mexican activists and journalists, including those investigating corruption and drug cartels.
It’s worth reiterating here that NSO itself states it only sells to governments. But governments, of course, are not necessarily more benign than cyber criminals, and some are significantly worse. By now, NSO surely knows what kind of hands its products end up in.
Last year the company came under new scrutiny following allegations its software was used to track murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi – an accusation the company has denied. But despite the ever-growing pool of evidence, the Israeli government has continued to give NSO the green light to export its products. Specific details of how the export licencing works and what kind of security or ethics checks it entails are difficult to find. The process is shrouded in secrecy; but it is clearly not stringent enough to keep NSO’s products out of the hands of human rights abusers. We don’t know if NSO has been used by the Israeli government in the context of surveillance of Palestinians.
The Israeli MoD has ignored multiple requests from Amnesty and others to revoke the company’s license, which is why we’re providing evidence in this legal action.
If the world’s largest human rights organization, which has technology experts among its staff, can be targeted, it’s probably the tip of the iceberg when it comes to NSO’s reach. Attacks like the one on Amnesty also show just how brazen the international surveillance industry has become. Earlier this year, Citizen Lab researchers looking into NSO were reportedly targeted by private operatives, in what seemed to be an attempt to silence and intimidate them.
But this case also is about more than human rights work – it highlights the threat to privacy for all of us. Today it was reported that a vulnerability in WhatsApp could expose billions of users to attacks by NSO spyware. Amnesty has not yet been able to verify these reports but if true they exemplify fully our claim to the Israeli courts: NSO has gone rogue and the Israeli MoD holds no proper oversight, control or regulation.
While NSO is allowed to market and sell its products without proper oversight, it’s essentially growing into a private international intelligence agency guided solely by profit and seemingly accountable to no one. Its spyware is so potent that most people would never know if their phone or computer had been infected.
NSO has repeatedly denied that Pegasus has been misused to target human rights defenders. Since a change of ownership in February this year the company has been trying to clean up its image, buying Google search ads and launching a new website where it claims to take “a pioneering approach to applying rigorous, ethical standards to everything we do.” No further details are provided, which hardly lends credibility to the claims. For those whose safety is jeopardized by NSO’s reckless sales, this kind of platitudes isn’t enough. Our petition today is a first step which we hope will eventually put a stop to NSO’s web of global surveillance.

It restricts the ability to farm their land, attend a protest, improve their homes, raise families, travel for medical purposes, or access essential services such as electricity and clean water. 
A Palestinian prisoner’s experience is even more dire: they must not only withstand all the above, but also arbitrary detention from Israeli and Palestinian forces, cruel and unlawful treatment, the repression of fundamental human rights, and the ongoing unlawful detention of children. 
For both, life is made all the more insufferable by Israel’s ever-expanding settlement operation. 
Palestinians in the occupied territories are subject to military law, which excludes the most fundamental human rights – such as the right to legal counsel during interrogation – while Israeli settlers enjoy the protections of Israeli civil law. 
Administrative detention allows Israeli authorities to arbitrarily detain prisoners without providing reasons for arrest, delay their trials for six months and then renew their detentions indefinitely without charge. At the end of 2018, over 5,500 Palestinian prisoners remained in Israeli prisons, including nearly 500 administrative detainees. 
Documented detention conditions for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons include cruel and unlawful punishment, such as the deprivation of family visits and disallowing detained mothers to hold their children. 
On April 17, 2017, Palestinian prisoners launched a mass hunger strike to protest their conditions and historic ill treatment at the hands of Israeli authorities. A relative of one prisoner testified, “The Israeli authorities play with our emotions, they torture and punish us.” 
It is not only the Israeli authorities who subject the Palestinian people to such violations. The Palestinian Authority habitually detains Palestinians in an attempt to repress freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and social justice organizing. One Ramallah-based NGO reported that Palestinian authorities attacked media freedom 77 times during 2018, often through arbitrary arrests and physical assault. 
This abuse of power is reinforced by Israeli Military Order 101, enabling Israeli authorities to regularly imprison or fine Palestinians for peaceful expression of political dissent. This dual-sided censorship is intended to crush all forms of political engagement and strip Palestinians of their fundamental right to peaceful assembly. 
One example is the case of Issa Amro. Founder of the Youth Against Settlements and the “Open Shuhada Street” campaign, Issa has spoken at the United Nations about his peaceful efforts to stand against Israel’s military rule, demanding an end to Israel’s settlements in the city of Hebron and other places in the occupied West Bank. 
Despite international recognition, he is routinely punished and faces criminal charges. Issa stated: “I have been arrested more times than I can count for non-violent human rights work.” On March 28, 2019, Issa was again detained, this time for criticizing the Palestinian government in a Facebook post. 
Palestinians need to be able to stand up for their rights without the threat of imprisonment, and the world needs to know what is happening to them. It can’t happen without activists like Issa. The charges against him and other human rights defenders like him must be dropped. 
Despite ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child nearly 30 years ago, Israeli forces routinely detain children and subject them to degrading treatment. Since 2000, an estimated 10,000 Palestinian children have endured the fear, intimidation, physical violence and humiliation that occurs during arrest. 
Israel prosecutes up to 700 Palestinian children via the military court system annually. According to Defense for Children International – Palestine, 96% of the children prosecuted between 2013-2018 did not have family present during interrogations. They arrive at interrogations blindfolded and sleep-deprived, and their confessions are often made after verbal and physical abuse – the likes of which often amount to torture. 
Because these children live under Israeli military law, the common act of stone-throwing is a criminal offense – for which Israel arrested over 200 children as of October 2018. 
Palestinians who build or improve their homes without difficult-to-obtain permits face jail time as well. For the Hashimeh brothers, who built an addition on their childhood home in Wadi Qadoum, there were only two options: demolish the home they built for themselves, or watch Israel demolish their home, and face jail time and punitive fines for failing to demolish it themselves. 
These restrictive Israeli policies on home construction in East Jerusalem are part of a wider two-tiered discriminatory Israeli plan aimed at solidifying a Jewish majority in Jerusalem, and are directly responsible for countless arbitrary arrests. 
This systemic dispossession of land, power, and human rights is enough to lead communities to despair, and Palestinian children whose homes have been demolished to make way for Israeli settlers experience depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and sleep disruption. 
The compounded effects of displacement and dispossession of land, coupled with the constant threat of arbitrary detention, forces Palestinians to live an unendurable situation.   
Over 600,000 Israelis settlers have occupied Palestinian land in the West Bank alone, resulting in the more than 50,000 demolished Palestinian homes and the restricted movement of nearly 5 million people. In 2017, Israel committed to accelerating its expansion of settlements, causing a recent United Nations Forum to discuss the threat of de facto annexation. 
The Israeli settlement operation is recognized as illegal under international law, yet only those standing against it suffer imprisonment. 
The international community must not only speak up for the rights of the occupied, but stand against those who profit from occupation. In doing business with illegal Israeli settlements, the Canadian government and Canadian companies contribute to – and profit from – their maintenance, development and expansion, which amount to war crimes under international criminal law. This acquiescence normalizes and legitimizes to the public what is recognized under international law as an illegal situation. 
Amnesty International calls upon the international community to sign petitions to stop enabling illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories. The petitions can be found here: Occupation at 50 and Destination: Occupation.

“While this promises to be a first step towards holding al-Bashir accountable for his heinous crimes, the Sudan authorities must hand him over to the International Criminal Court to answer charges of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. Al-Bashir must face justice not only for recent crimes, but also for the crimes under international law he allegedly committed while he was in power.
“This announcement is all the more significant coming off the back of yet another night of bloody violence in Sudan during which at least four people were killed, and about 90 sustained gunshot injuries. The prosecutor must also investigate and charge everyone else responsible for the continued use of excessive lethal force against peaceful protestors.
“It should not be forgotten that the Sudan Transitional Military Council also bears responsibility for failing to protect peaceful protestors. They must hold to account any security officer who fired live bullets on the protestors camped out at the military headquarters and in other parts of the country.”
Background
At around midday on 13 May uniformed security officers were captured on a widely circulated social media video whipping protestors. The onslaught escalated from around 6pm when live shots were fired resulting in at least four deaths, one of whom was a military officer, and more than 90 people injured, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors. The doctors said they had also treated 40 injuries arising from whipping and suffocation by tear gas.

In the past year, Saudi Arabian activists, including several women human rights defenders, have suffered the terrible ordeal of arbitrary detention, unable to speak to or see their loved ones for long months and with no access to legal representation. Women activists also detailed accounts of their torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse to the court, and many of them now face a prison term for their peaceful activism and speech.  
“Today marks a year of shame for Saudi Arabia. A year ago, the authorities started locking up some of Saudi Arabia’s bravest women activists, instead of celebrating hand in hand steps that should have served to advance the rights of women in the country,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
“Then they went on to detain those who still dared to stand up for these women, advocate for women’s rights in the country, or even express any questioning of the authorities’ policies.”
Loujain al-Hathloul, Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef, Saudi Arabia’s leading women’s rights campaigners, were detained on 15 May 2018 and have been facing trial for their human rights work since March 2019.
While Iman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef were amongst seven women provisionally released in the past two months, Loujain al-Hathloul and several other women activists remain in prison. Women human rights defenders, Nassima al-Sada and Samar Badawi, have been detained since July 2018 without charge with tens of other fellow activists. In April 2019, the authorities escalated their crackdown on critics, arbitrarily detaining at least 14 journalists, writers, academics and family members of women’s rights defenders.
In November 2018, Amnesty International revealed reports of torture, ill-treatment and sexual abuse of at least 10 activists arbitrarily detained since May 2018, which included several women human rights defenders. The organization called on the authorities to allow independent monitors access to detained activists.
“This is also a shameful day for Saudi Arabia’s closest allies in the West, namely the USA, the UK and France. Instead of prioritising business deals and arms sales, they should be intransigent – and publicly so – in pressuring the Saudi Arabian authorities for the immediate and unconditional release of all individuals who are being punished for expressing their views peacefully,” said Lynn Maalouf.
A few months following the wave of arrests targeting women’s rights activists, the Saudi Arabian authorities escalated their crackdown on dissent, as manifested in the Public Prosecution’s calls for the execution of religious clerics and Shi’a activists on trial before the counter-terror court for charges related to exercising their peaceful rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. This includes prominent religious cleric Sheikh Salman al-Awda, who was accused of 37 charges, including his affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood and calls for government reforms.
In late April 2019, the authorities also carried out a mass execution of 37 men, the majority of them from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority and executed after unfair trials. At least 15 men executed last month were sentenced to death based on “confessions” they said were extracted through torture, including a young man who was convicted of a crime that allegedly took place while he was under the age of 18.
In 2019 alone, the Saudi authorities have executed at least 110 people.
Background:
On the first anniversary of the arrests, Amnesty International repeats its call on supporters worldwide to continue taking action for the detained activists until they are unconditionally free.
Over the past year, over 280,000 people have stood in solidarity with Saudi Arabia’s women human rights defenders and activists through signing petitions and writing to the Saudi Arabian authorities demanding their release.
On Wednesday 15 May, Amnesty International UK and the Saudi Arabia-focused campaign organization ALQST are hosting an event to mark one year since the group of women’s rights activists were arrested. For more details, please contact: www.amnesty.org.uk/amnesty-media-team

“The Sri Lankan authorities must protect the country’s Muslim minority as it is being targeted by mobs in horrific attacks on their homes, mosques and businesses in the wake of the Easter Sunday massacre. The authorities must take steps to promote unity in diversity against the forces of hatred, those promoting fear and violence, and pitting communities against each other.
“The authorities must put the protection of human rights at the heart of its response and prevent further violence, including holding the suspected perpetrators of earlier attacks accountable. In particular, prosecutions must also meet international fair trial standards.
“It is alarming to see reports that those suspected to be involved in the March 2018 anti-Muslim violence may have been involved in these recent attacks as well.
“These attacks did not emerge out of a vacuum. There were clear signs that a backlash against Muslims was underway and the authorities could have acted on reports of threats earlier, potentially preventing much of the violence over recent days.”
Background
On 21 April, more than 250 people were killed and hundreds injured when bombers from a local Islamist armed group affiliated to the so-called Islamic State targeted three churches and three hotels on Easter Sunday.
Despite heightened security measures in the country, including intermittent bans on social media and a discriminatory ban on face-veils, there have been frequent reports of anti-Muslim attacks in many parts in the country.
On 13 May, the government imposed a countrywide curfew following reports of widespread attacks against Muslim-owned businesses, homes and mosques. Amith Weerasinghe who has been arrested on 14 May in connection to the attacks was also one of the people previously arrested, and later released on bail in 2018 for his role in anti-Muslim attacks in Digana.

By Grand Chief Dr. Abel Bosum and Alex Neve
In 2010, former prime minister Stephen Harper publicly reversed his government’s opposition to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In a formal “statement of support,” the Harper government said that it had listened to Indigenous leaders in Canada and “learned from the experience of other countries” and was now “confident” that Canada could move ahead with implementation of the Declaration “in a manner that is consistent with our Constitution and legal framework.”
So why wouldn’t Conservative Members of Parliament and Senators support legislation intended to finally move ahead with the work of implementing the Declaration in Canada?
Bill C-262 is the private member’s bill introduced by NDP MP Romeo Saganash. Passage of C-262 would create a legal framework requiring the federal government to work collaboratively with Indigenous peoples on the measures needed to bring Canadian law and policy into line with the minimum global standards set out in the Declaration. 
Critically, passage of the Bill C-262 would not suddenly change the legal status of the Declaration in Canada. Courts would continue to use the Declaration in the interpretation of Canada, just as they are already doing. However, passage of C-262 would establish an ongoing process of federal implementation that could not be easily abandoned by future governments.
The Bill enjoys widespread support. Out of 71 witnesses who appeared before a Parliamentary Committee examining the Bill last year, only one opposed adoption of C-262. 
Yet, when it came to a vote in the House of Commons, Conservative MPs refused to join the other parties in supporting the Bill. Video widely circulated online even showed Conservative MPs giving each other a high five after they voted against the Bill.
Now the Bill is before the Senate where its fate will be decided. The Bill is being sponsored in the Senate by independent Senator Murray Sinclair. The support of the former Chief Commissioner of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission is a powerful symbol that the Bill is an opportunity to advance reconciliation in Canada. Unfortunately, however, the limited time remaining to adopt C-262 before the current session ends means that even a small minority opposing the Bill could threaten its passage into law.  
A number of Conservative Senators have already gone on the record opposing the Bill. Their main concern seems to be that the UN Declaration could have far-reaching and unpredictable impacts in Canada. Some have already used procedural tactics to attempt to stall debate over the Bill.
These Senators seem to forget that the Declaration is not new – that it was developed over a period of more than twenty years and adopted by the United Nations more than a decade ago. They also seem to forget that a Conservative government studied the Declaration and came to the conclusion that it could and should support its implementation. And they are clearly ignoring the fact that the very purpose of the Bill is to ensure ongoing dialogue between government and Indigenous peoples over how the Declaration will be interpreted and applied in the future.
With an election looming, we are at a point where every issue on Parliament is seen as an opportunity to score points over political opponents. The cause of reconciliation, however, must not be dragged down by partisan politics. 
Bill C-262 is something that every federal party could and should support. In doing so, they have an opportunity to send a clear message to the public about the importance they place on reconciliation.

RE: Ending Sex Discrimination in the Indian Act
Dear Minister Bennett,
On April 12, 2019, the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls took the unique step of issuing a statement prior to issuing its Final Report. The statement called on the Government of Canada to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the 2019 federal election to end sex discrimination in the Indian Act. The Commissioners stated that “The gendered discrimination over decades has disenfranchised women from their communities, broken up families, and caused great disparity in rights and benefits as between First Nation women and men.” The National Inquiry statement echoed the same call made by First Nations women leaders on April 9, 2019 in Ottawa.
As Parties with Standing to the National Inquiry, and organizations and individuals who have been closely following the National Inquiry’s work, we are writing now to urge you to respond swiftly and immediately to this first recommendation from the National Inquiry by bringing the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before the upcoming federal election. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women have all identified sex discrimination in the Indian Act as a root cause of the violence that First Nations women, girls, and two-spirit people experience.
The UN Human Rights Committee ruled in January 2019 that the sex-based hierarchy between s. 6(1)(a) and s. 6(1)(c), introduced by the 1985 Indian Act, and continued by the amendments of 2011 and 2017, violates the right to the equal protection of the law without discrimination based on sex, and violates the equal right of men and women to the enjoyment of Indigenous culture, guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the National Inquiry said in its statement “Indigenous women are independent right-holders and Canada should uphold their rights.” Recognizing Indigenous women as equal in dignity and rights is a threshold requirement for moving forward to end the crisis of violence.
This ruling from the UN Human Rights Committee comes as a result of almost fifty years of struggle by First Nation women to be recognized as equal in law. Jeannette Corbiere Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Sandra Lovelace-Nicholas, Sharon McIvor, Dr. Lynn Gehl have all fought for equality for Indigenous women in the registration provisions of the Indian Act; it is surely time for Canada to recognize this right.
On May 3, 31 organizations and a prominent academic wrote to you requesting an official response to the National Inquiry’s final report before the House of Commons rises in June. We call on you, as a key part of this official response, to take action to bring the outstanding provisions of Bill S-3 into force before June 21. This action by your Government will show that you intend to treat seriously the National Inquiry’s recommendations. It will demonstrate to people in Canada, and especially to Indigenous women, that they have value in the eyes of your Government and are worthy of the dignity and respect that equal rights in law convey. It will empower Indigenous women in their own struggle to stop the violence.
We urge you to respond swiftly to the National Inquiry’s report by ending the sex discrimination in the Indian Act, and bringing the outstanding sections of Bill S-3 into force before the election.

“Laden with arms that will likely be used in the war in Yemen, the Bahri Yanbu has been bouncing off European ports like a pinball. After loading up with Belgian munitions in Antwerp, it has visited or attempted to visit ports in the UK, France and now Spain, and is due to dock at the Italian port of Genoa later this week. 
“This is a serious test of EU countries’ resolve to uphold their obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) and EU Common Position on Arms Exports. Several states have failed this test in the space of just a few days.
“No EU state should be making the deadly decision to authorize the transfer or transit of arms to a conflict where there is a clear risk they will be used in war crimes and other serious violations of international law.
“The Bahri Yanbu’s voyage reminds us that states prefer to allow the lucrative global arms trade to continue to operate behind a veil of secrecy. But this veil is not impenetrable, and Amnesty International and its partners will continue to closely monitor developments and denounce states for flouting their international legal obligations.”
Background
In Yemen, the Saudi Arabia/UAE-led Coalition has used arms imports to contribute to thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, including as a result of attacks that violated international humanitarian law. This has exacerbated the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, where 2.2 million people have been displaced and 22 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance
According to the EU’s reporting on arms exports, EU member states issued at least 607 licences worth over 15.8 billion euros to Saudi Arabia in 2016. The main European exporters of conventional arms to Saudi Arabia include the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Bulgaria. Between 2013 and 2018, Saudi Arabia accounted for nearly half of the UK’s and a third of Belgium’s arms exports. Other countries – including Germany, the Netherlands and Norway – have started to restrict weapons sales to the Saudi and UAE-led coalition.
According to a published export schedule for Saudi Arabian state-owned shipping vessels, the Bahri Yanbu set sail from Corpus Christi, USA on 2 April 2019, destined for Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. It then called at several other US ports and one Canadian port before crossing the Atlantic and stopping in Germany, Belgium and the UK in early May.
On 3 May, it was reportedly loaded with six containers of Belgian-manufactured munitions at Antwerp, before continuing on to France. It was due to dock at the French port of Le Havre to receive additional arms on 8 May, but following legal action by French NGOs and increased public scrutiny, it continued its voyage without stopping in France, and made an unscheduled stop at Santander in northern Spain on 12-13 May. Its next scheduled port of call is in Genoa, Italy, originally planned for 16 May.
Amnesty International activists in Belgium, France, Spain and Italy have been monitoring the Bahri Yanbu’s voyage around Europe. The activists have joined protests and co-authored a letter to the Spanish authorities to call on them not to authorize its transit through Spanish waters. The organization will highlight the apparent ATT and EU Common Position violations at a 17 May meeting of the European Council’s Working Party on Conventional Arms Exports.

In a...","Amnesty International is supporting a legal action to take the Israeli Ministry of Defence (MoD) to court, to demand that it revokes the export license of NSO Group, an Israeli company whose spyware products have been used in chilling attacks on human rights defenders around the world.
In a petition to be filed tomorrow at the District Court of Tel Aviv, approximately 50 members and supporters of Amnesty International Israel and others from the human rights community set out how the MoD has put human rights at risk by allowing NSO to continue exporting its products. In August 2018 an Amnesty staff member was targeted by a particularly invasive piece of NSO Group software called Pegasus, also linked to attacks on activists and journalists in Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates.
“NSO Group sells its products to governments who are known for outrageous human rights abuses, giving them the tools to track activists and critics. The attack on Amnesty International was the final straw,” said Danna Ingleton, Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech, who has provided supporting testimony.
“The Israeli MoD has ignored mounting evidence linking NSO Group to attacks on human rights defenders, which is why we are supporting this case. As long as products like Pegasus are marketed without proper control and oversight, the rights and safety of Amnesty International’s staff and that of other activists, journalists and dissidents around the world is at risk.”
The legal action is supported by Amnesty International as part of a joint project with New York University (NYU) School of Law’s Bernstein Institute for Human Rights and Global Justice Clinic, which seeks justice for human rights defenders targeted with malicious software. Faculty Director Margaret Satterthwaite said:
“The targeting of human rights defenders for their work, using invasive digital surveillance tools, is not permissible under human rights law. Without stronger legal checks, the spyware industry enables governments to trample on the rights to privacy, freedom of opinion and expression.”
“The Israeli government needs to revoke NSO Group’s export license and stop it profiting from state-sponsored repression.”
A global web of surveillance
Research has documented the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to target a wide swathe of civil society, including at least 24 human rights defenders, journalists and parliamentarians in Mexico; an Amnesty International employee; Saudi activists Omar Abdulaziz, Yahya Assiri, Ghanem Al-Masarir; award-winning Emirati human rights campaigner Ahmed Mansoor; and allegedly, murdered Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
In August 2018, an Amnesty International staff member received a message which contained a link purporting to be about a protest outside the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington. It was sent at a time when Amnesty International was campaigning for the release of Saudi women human rights activists. If clicked, the link would have secretly installed Pegasus software, allowing the sender to obtain near-total control of the phone.
NSO safeguards “ineffective”
NSO Group claims it helps governments fight terrorism and crime, but it has failed to rebut mounting evidence linking its products to attacks on human rights defenders. Although the company says it undertakes a rigorous review before sales of its products, these claims lack detail and, considering the number of attacks on civil society, appear to have been ineffective in numerous cases.
NSO Group has repeatedly denied, but not credibly addressed, the accounts that its Pegasus spyware platform has been misused to target human rights defenders. Nor has it accepted responsibility or provided remedies for the multiple reported instances of misuse of its surveillance technologies. The company has failed to disclose its due diligence process, except for veiled references to the existence of an ethics committee. It remains unclear what factors are taken into consideration before the company sells an inherently invasive product like Pegasus.
Without effective oversight based on proper regulation of the sale of commercial spyware, and absent adequate action by NSO Group to prevent, mitigate, and remedy misuse of its technology, civil society actors remain vulnerable to unlawful surveillance simply for exercising their human rights. 
“It’s time to stop the use of NSO Group’s tools to infiltrate, intimidate and silence civil society. We are determined to hold NSO Group to account for its role in attacks on human rights defenders,” said Danna Ingleton.
Background
Amnesty International contacted NSO Group in late 2018 to address the issues set out above. Their full statement is here:
“NSO Group develops cyber technology to allows government agencies to identify and disrupt terrorist and criminal plots. Our product is intended to be used exclusively for the investigation and prevention of crime and terrorism. Any use of our technology that is counter to that purpose is a violation of our policies, legal contracts, and the values that we stand for as a company. If an allegation arises concerning a violation of our contract or inappropriate use of our technology, as Amnesty has offered, we investigate the issue and take appropriate action based on those findings. We welcome any specific information that can assist us in further investigating of the matter.”

“Amnesty International condemns the police intervention to break up this celebration of pride on the METU campus today. It is a dark day when university authorities call the police to silence students who are simply demanding their rights to dignity and equality.
All those detained by police must be released immediately and unconditionally.”
Students demonstrated peacefully but were told by police that they were not allowed to stand under tents, to fly a rainbow flag, to sit on the lawn, and eventually they were prevented from reading out a statement. Those detained include LGBTI student activists from ODTU LGBTI Solidarity group Melike Balkan and Özgür Gür and an academic from the university.

This case was about the basic right of immigration detainees to challenge the lawfulness of their detention by way of habeas corpus – a constitutionally protected right rooted in centuries of common law protections limiting the power of the State to arbitrarily deprive individuals of their liberty. When the case was heard last fall, Amnesty International argued that Canada has an international legal obligation to guarantee immigration detainees are able to exercise this right.
“The right to liberty is a fundamental human right. This decision vindicates immigration detainees who have been denied their liberty for years on end with no meaningful way to challenge that injustice and regain their freedom,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “They can now seek justice in superior courts and have their Charter rights protected and enforced.”
Tusif Ur Rehman Chhina, the respondent in the case, is a man of Pakistani origin who was held for over 2 years in immigration detention, beginning in November 2015. During that time, his detention was reviewed 12 times under the mechanism put in place by the federal Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Nevertheless, he was kept in detention because the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) believed that detention was necessary in order to eventually deport him, even though there were alternatives to detention presented.
When Mr. Chhina, who was being held in Alberta, applied to a provincial court in Alberta to have the legality of his detention reviewed, it declined to hear the case stating that the existing federal statutory mechanism was sufficient. The Alberta Court of Appeal subsequently overturned that decision, underscoring the importance of the right to habeas corpus. The Supreme Court upheld that decision today, holding that the trial judge should have heard Mr. Chhina’s application.
This case paves the way for immigration detainees to seek remedy for the deprivation of their liberty from provincial superior courts through a habeas corpus application.
“This is undoubtedly a victory, but more needs to be done. There is no legal limit on the maximum length of time that an individual can be held in immigration detention in Canada. People can be held in immigration detention, sometimes indefinitely, without any charges. That is unacceptable,” said Justin Mohammed, Amnesty International’s Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner.
Amnesty International was represented at the Supreme Court by Michael Bossin, Jamie Liew and Laïla Demirdache.

“We call on Thai authorities to acknowledge whether they are in military or police custody and establish their whereabouts. If they are in state custody, we urge authorities to ensure that the three men are held in an official place of detention and have immediate access to independent lawyers, doctors and family members.
“We also call on authorities to either charge them with a recognizable criminal offence in line with international standards or release them from custody, and not penalise them for their exercise of the right to freedom of expression.”
Background
Chucheep Chiwasut is a radio disc-jockey and political activist, who regularly broadcast political commentary to Thailand from exile. Reports do not indicate whether they were transferred to Thai authorities from Viet Nam through a formal deportation or extradition procedure.
Chiwasut has long outstanding charges of lèse-majesté filed against him under Article 112 of the Thai Penal Code – it is believed that both Siam Theerawut and Kritsana Tupthai also have criminal complaints against them under Article 112.  In September 2018, Prawit Wongsuwan, Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister, told the media that Chiwasut headed a secessionist movement. The Thai authorities at the same time arrested individuals with t-shirts associated with the “Organisation for Thai Federation”—the movement they alleged that Chiwasut leads—as well as members of Chiwasut’s immediate family in Thailand. Thai authorities have made long-standing requests to neighbouring states for the extradition of individuals charged with Article 112 of the Thai Penal Code, governing lèse-majesté, including Chucheep Chiwasut.
Amnesty International has particular concerns for the safety of Thai exiles whose extradition has been sought by the Thai authorities. Unknown individuals have abducted five Thai political opposition activists in exile in Laos – including people who made broadcasts while in exile, and who faced lèse-majesté or weapons charges – who have subsequently disappeared or been killed. They include individuals whose extradition the Thai authorities had repeatedly requested, including on the alleged basis that their broadcasts into Thailand from Laos were a threat to national security.

But while al-Bashir’s 30-year rule has come to an end, the human rights situation in Sudan, which has deteriorated dramatically since the beginning of the protests, continues to worsen. Many of the protestors calling for peace, justice, rule of law and economic reforms have paid the price of change with their lives and liberty.
The Sudanese security forces brutally suppressed the protests by unlawfully killing protestors, mercilessly beating them in the streets, and unlawfully detaining and subjecting them to torture and other ill-treatment. Security forces stormed hospitals firing live ammunition and tear gas at patients and medical staff attempting to arrest injured protestors, in an outrageous violation of international law.
Al-Bashir’s ousting offers an unprecedented opportunity to entrench human rights in Sudan’s transition.
So far, Sudan’s authorities have terminated the state of emergency announced on 22 February, released protestors from jail, and promised to try security officers who killed protestors. But much more must be done to facilitate a peaceful transition, accountability and a future Sudan that protects, respects and fulfils human rights.
Amnesty International calls for these human rights priorities during Sudan’s transition: 
Respect for human rights 
The Sudanese peoples’ rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, which are critical for the transition, must be protected, respected and fulfilled. 
End repression of dissent and peaceful protests 
Allow protests, including the on-going sit-in outside the army headquarters in the capital Khartoum. End the use of lethal and excessive force against protestors. Even after Al-Bashir’s ousting, security forces continue to use lethal force against protestors. On 21 April, security forces injured protesters in Kutum city, North Darfur, while on 4 May they killed one person during a protest on 4 May in Nyala, South Darfur. 
Release prisoners of conscience 
Immediately and unconditionally release all people arrested for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association since the protests began in mid-December 2018, including the Darfuri students arrested in December 2018. 
Surrender former President al-Bashir to the International Criminal Court (ICC) 
Urgently declare the whereabouts of former President Omar al-Bashir and immediately surrender him to the ICC to ensure justice can be served for the atrocities committed during his three decades in power. Al-Bashir faces five counts of crimes against humanity, two counts of war crimes and three counts of genocide allegedly committed in Darfur. 
End endemic impunity 
Suspend army officers, police and intelligence officials suspected of involvement in crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations, pending investigations and ensuring the suspects are prosecuted where there is sufficient admissible evidence.
Prosecute in fair trials, not imposing the death penalty, all security officers, politicians and others suspected of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. 
Reveal details of National Congress Party (NCP) members in detention  
Disclose the whereabouts of all arrested and detained NCP members, and charge them with a recognizable criminal offence in line with Sudan’s obligations under international law, without recourse to the death penalty, or release them. Respect the rights of these detainees, ensuring they have access to lawyers of their choice, family visits and medical treatment. They must not be subjected to torture and other ill-treatment while in detention. 
Reform the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) 
Immediately undertake a comprehensive reform of the NISS to ensure it complies with the country’s international human rights obligations.
Remove immunities provided in the 2010 National Security Act that provides NISS agents with power of arrest and detention. 
Ensure impartial investigations into killings and torture 
Investigations into all allegations made since December 2018 of unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment and death in detention must be fair, effective, comprehensive and transparent. Steps must be taken to bring suspected perpetrators to justice in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty. 
Set a timeline for legal reform of the national security law and other laws 
Amnesty International believes that this process must be comprehensive and include a review and amendment to the Public Order, Criminal, Criminal Procedures, Personal Status, and Press and Publication laws. 
Establish an official moratorium on executions 
Abolish the death penalty.
Remove articles that impose corporal punishment.

0,FAQ: Indigenous rights and caribou recovery initiatives in northeast BC,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/backgrounders/faq-indigenous-rights-and-caribou-recovery-initiatives-in-northeast-bc/,Why is a caribou protection plan needed in northeast BC? The BC government reported in 2018 that the six caribou herds in the southern Peace region “have undergone a dramatic decline in numbers” over the last decade and will disappear entirely if conditions do not change. All of the herds are...,"Why is a caribou protection plan needed in northeast BC?
The BC government reported in 2018 that the six caribou herds in the southern Peace region “have undergone a dramatic decline in numbers” over the last decade and will disappear entirely if conditions do not change. All of the herds are currently listed as “threatened” under the Species at Risk Act, but the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada has recommended that five of the herds be classified under the even more urgent category of “endangered.”
Having declared that there is an “imminent threat” to the survival of caribou in British Columbia, the federal government is now required by law to act. The Species at Risk Act allows for the federal government to support protection and recovery plans developed by the provincial government. But if the province fails to act, the federal government must impose a protection and recovery plan of its own.
Why were First Nations central to the development of the protection plan?
First Nations have distinct rights with respect to the protection and management of caribou. Legal obligations under Treaty 8, the Constitutional protection of Aboriginal and Treaty rights, and international human rights law all require the federal and provincial governments to cooperate with First Nations and ensure their full and effective participation in the decision-making process.
The West Moberly and Saulteau First Nations also have specific knowledge and expertise, having led some of the first and most significant efforts to conserve caribou populations in the region.
What are the possible economic impacts of the proposed plan?
The partners to the agreement – the federal, provincial and First Nations governments – have all said that any negative impacts will be minimal. The plan does not restrict backcountry leisure activities that are important to the local economy. The partners have said that a dedicated consultation process with local user groups will help identify areas for snowmobiling that do not pose undue risk to caribou. The agreement also does not place restrictions on existing mining and oil and gas operations.
Protection of crucial habitat requires changes to logging practices and the protection and restoration of caribou habitat. The total timber supply reduction is estimated to be 300,000 cubic metres. This is about 3.5 percent of the 7,900,000 cubic metres of annual allowable cut within the three forest management units in the region. In fact, the amount of logging that would be allowed in the region would remain considerably higher than it was even in 2017 and much higher than it was a decade ago.
Why is this issue of concern to Amnesty International?
In our 2016 report, Out of Sight, Out of Mind, Amnesty International noted that while intensive resource development in northeast BC has generated enormous wealth for the province and the country, and provided high paying jobs for many, the scale of development also has negative impacts that are too often ignored in public policy. The report drew particular attention to the wholesale erosion of the natural landscapes necessary to support Indigenous cultural traditions and the opportunity for young Dunne-Za and Cree people to learn these traditions. A critical finding of the report is that the right of Indigenous peoples to be part of the decision-making processes around the land use and conservation needs to be respected.
The report also drew attention to a background of pervasive racism and discrimination against Indigenous peoples in northeast BC. In the context of the many accounts of racist attacks on women, elders, youth and others that were shared with Amnesty International in the course of our research, we take the racism expressed in the current public debate very seriously and remind political leaders that they are legally obliged to do everything in their power to counter it.

0,Canada: Amnesty International Urges Federal and Provincial Governments to be Resolute in their Commitment to Reconciliation in the Face of Racist Backlash,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/canada-amnesty-international-urges-federal-and-provincial-governments-to-be-resolute-in-their-commitment-to-reconciliation-in-the-face-of-racist-backlash/,"Partnership Agreement on Caribou Protection in Northeast BC “When caribou disappear, a piece of our culture disappears and we lose a little bit of who we are as the Indigenous people of the area.” – Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations A Partnership Agreement between First...","Partnership Agreement on Caribou Protection in Northeast BC  
“When caribou disappear, a piece of our culture disappears and we lose a little bit of who we are as the Indigenous people of the area.” – Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations
A Partnership Agreement between First Nations and the federal and provincial governments is an important opportunity to take practical steps to recover endangered caribou populations in British Columbia and take meaningful action on reconciliation.
In the face of a public backlash characterized by racism and bigotry, Amnesty International is urging Premier John Horgan and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to be resolute in fulfilling their commitments and obligations, including recovery of endangered species, reconciliation with First Nations, and combatting racism, by seeing the Partnership Agreement on Caribou Recovery through to implementation.
On May 6, 2018, the federal government declared an “imminent threat” to the survival of caribou in British Columbia. Under the Species at Risk Act, the federal government is now required to adopt emergency measures to protect caribou unless a sufficiently robust protection and recovery plan is put in place.
The draft Intergovernmental Partnership Agreement for the Conservation of the Central Group of the Southern Mountain Caribou, currently undergoing public consultation, was developed through negotiation between the federal and provincial governments and the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations. The agreement is grounded in traditional knowledge and years of scientific study regarding caribou and caribou habitat.
Caribou are central to the culture and identity of Treaty 8 First Nations in British Columbia and to other Indigenous peoples across Canada. The protection of caribou in northeast BC has direct implications for rights set out in Treaty 8, entrenched in the Canadian Constitution, and protected in international human rights law.
Treaty 8 First Nations have long demonstrated leadership in caribou conservation. In the 1970s, elders decided that their communities would voluntarily place a moratorium on exercising their Treaty right to hunt caribou out of concern for the impacts that industrial development and habitat loss had on the herds. The Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations have developed an innovative penning program to protect female caribou and their young calves.
The draft partnership agreement is intended to protect critical habitat while creating new employment opportunities in landscape restoration and conservation. The agreement will have no impact on existing mining and oil and gas operations in northeast BC. The agreement does not restrict any hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, or other recreational activities. Snowmobile activity within caribou habitat will be addressed through a future dedicated consultation process with local user groups. And while the agreement will defer logging activities within a protected area, the reduction in timber volume is limited to about 300,000 cubic metres, a small fraction of the 7,900,000 cubic metres of annual allowable cut in the region.
Amnesty International is concerned, however, that not only have the impacts been misrepresented and exaggerated in public debate around the agreement, but that much of this debate has taken on an antagonistic, racist and often hateful tone.
Indigenous peoples have been systematically excluded from decision-making for so long, and their rights so routinely denied, that no doubt some people find it hard to imagine things being done differently.
However, if Canada is to live up to its commitments to reconciliation and respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples, intergovernmental collaborations with Indigenous Nations must become the norm. For that to occur, it is clear that the federal and provincial governments must be stalwart in defending the role of Indigenous peoples in decision-making and to stand with Indigenous peoples when confronted with backlash.
Respecting human rights benefits all of society. Reconciliation is in the best interest of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people alike.
Amnesty International has written to the federal and provincial governments urging them to be resolute, clear and consistent in support of these values, whether in response to overt expressions of hate or in the face of more subtle and insidious rhetoric that tries to depict the “interests” of an Indigenous minority as being a threat to the non-Indigenous majority.
In our 2016 major report, Out of Sight, Out of Mind, Amnesty International documented some of the ways that decisions made without adequate involvement of Indigenous peoples or proper consideration of their rights have had complex, far-reaching and profoundly harmful affects on their health and well-being of First Nations families and communities in northeast BC.
Amnesty International looks forward to the implementation of the partnership agreement as concrete indication that another, better approach to decision-making is indeed possible.

0,China: Transgender people risk their lives with dangerous self-surgery,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/china-transgender-people-risk-their-lives-with-dangerous-self-surgery/,"Transgender people in China are performing highly dangerous surgery on themselves and buying unsafe hormone treatments on the black market because it is almost impossible for them to access the health care they urgently need, Amnesty International said in a new report. “’I need my...","Transgender people in China are performing highly dangerous surgery on themselves and buying unsafe hormone treatments on the black market because it is almost impossible for them to access the health care they urgently need, Amnesty International said in a new report.
“’I need my parents’ consent to be myself’- Barriers to gender-affirming treatments for transgender people in China” reveals that prevalent discrimination and stigma, restrictive eligibility requirements, and a lack of information, leave transgender people to seek unregulated and unsafe gender-affirming treatments.
“China is failing transgender people. Discriminatory laws and policies have left many people feeling they have no choice but to risk their lives by performing extremely dangerous surgery on themselves and to seek unsafe hormone drugs on the black market,” said Doriane Lau, China Researcher at Amnesty International.
“The authorities and medical profession must stop classifying transgender people as having a mental illness. The highly-restrictive requirements for accessing gender-affirming surgeries and lack of health-related information needs to change so people can access the health care they need.”
The transgender community in China is largely invisible, and faces entrenched discrimination at home, school, work and in the healthcare system. Despite the challenges, 15 transgender people from across the country were willing to share their experiences with Amnesty International. 
Many spoke of the emotional distress caused by the mismatch of their gender and sex characteristics.
Zijia*, a 21-year-old a transgender woman, told Amnesty International why she started to use hormone treatment: “I was anxious to change my body. I felt disgusted with my male sex characteristics. The medication brought changes gradually, but I felt much better right away. I could finally start being myself.”
However, in interviews, Amnesty International found an alarming lack of knowledge about how transgender people can access gender-affirming treatments in the public health system. This, combined with stringent and discriminatory eligibility requirements, means transgender people are often not supported to access the health care they need.
In China, transgender people are classed as having a “mental illness” and gender-affirming surgeries require the consent of families. This is a major barrier in accessing safe treatment. Due to the fear of rejection, many transgender people choose not to tell their families.
Many other criteria to qualify for gender-affirming surgeries – such as not being married or having a clean criminal record – also create significant barriers to accessing this treatment.
Dangerous self-surgery
Let down by the health system, transgender people have taken the highly dangerous step of attempting to perform surgeries on themselves. Two people told Amnesty International of their traumatic experiences, including Huiming, who became desperate to align her male sex characteristics with her female identity after the onset of puberty.
The 30-year-old began to self-medicate while still in university, buying hormone drugs via the online black market – but stopped after only a month due to suffering extreme mood swings and significant impact on her mental health.  
Accessing gender-affirming treatments at a hospital was not an option as she feared her family would reject her when she asked for their consent. In 2016, she took the desperate decision to attempt surgery on herself.
Huiming felt she had no other option: “I thought I was an abnormal person. How could I explain this to my family? I was both happy and scared. I was scared because I was bleeding so badly, I could die right there. I feared I would still die a man, since I only did part of my surgery.”
Huiming was rushed to the emergency room. She asked the doctor to lie to her family and say she had an accident. Her parents remained unaware about their child’s desperate act to remove her male sex organs. In 2017, Huiming traveled to Thailand for gender-affirming surgery. Before she went, Huiming came out to her mother who accepted her for who she is.
Unsafe medication
Due to the failings of the health system, transgender people who have an urgent need to align their body with their gender identity told Amnesty International that they have had little choice but to resort to the unsafe and risky black market to obtain hormone medication.
This includes buying medication through social media chat groups, online shops, and via overseas surrogate shoppers, often at inflated prices compared to the legal market. None of the transgender people Amnesty International interviewed had accessed advice from medical professionals when they started taking these drugs.
Without any regulation and oversight, there is a real risk the drugs purchased on the black market are unsafe and counterfeit. Without knowing the required dose, side-effects, or quality of the drugs, many told Amnesty International how they experienced different levels of mood swings, with some even plunging into depression, with no medical supervision or access to a doctor to address these conditions.
People were prepared to risk buying unsafe medication as they wanted to escape the distress triggered by living in a body that did not align with how they see themselves.
Shanshan, a 21-year-old transgender female from Beijing, hated her male sex characteristics. “My greatest anxiety is being a man. Sometimes it felt so bad I wanted to commit suicide,” she told Amnesty International.
Unable to live with the anxiety, Shanshan began buying hormone medication on the black market.
Lack of adequate information
The transgender people Amnesty International interviewed did not get any advice or guidance on gender-affirming treatments from their doctors when they first started using hormones, and instead learnt about treatment options from friends and by searching for information on the internet. They did not feel that doctors in the public health system were able to support them.
Health care facilities specializing in gender-affirming treatments are not common. There is only one multi-disciplinary clinic in the whole of China that specializes in a range of gender-affirming treatments. The multi-disciplinary medical team for gender-affirming care opened in September 2018 at Peking University Third Hospital and is the first of its kind in China.
The current guidelines for medical professionals on gender-affirming treatments are not fit for purpose. These guidelines combined with a lack of adequate information means transgender people face significant barriers and challenges to access the care they need.
In March 2019, the Chinese government accepted recommendations by the UN Human Rights Council to legislate to ban discrimination against LGBTI people.
“The Chinese government can show it is serious in addressing discrimination against the LGBTI community by removing the barriers transgender people face when trying to access safe gender-affirming treatments,” said Doriane Lau.

“The President’s commutation of these death sentences to life imprisonment is an important milestone for Gambia which is slowly and steadily moving away from the death penalty.
“Less than a week ago, Amnesty International met with President Adama Barrow who confirmed to us his commitment to outlaw this cruel punishment – it’s good to see him take another concrete step against the death penalty.
“This decision is a positive step, however we want the authorities to go further by abolishing the death penalty for all crimes without delay, including in the country’s future constitution.
“We also hope they will implement our recommendations to repeal draconian media laws, reform the security sector and end discrimination against women.”
Background
Gambia’s Attorney General and Justice Minister, Aboubacarr Tambadou, said yesterday that President Adama Barrow has commuted the death sentences of 22 prisoners to life imprisonment. This followed an Amnesty International mission to Gambia to present to the authorities a series of recommendations covering 10 areas of reform to protect and promote human rights. The recommendations include the abolition of the death penalty and commutation of all death sentences to terms of imprisonment.
In February 2018, President Adama Barrow announced the establishment of an official moratorium on executions. In September 2018, Gambia ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty thus becoming the 86th State Party to the treaty.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

By Justin Mohammed
Refugee claimants who cross the Canada-U.S. border irregularly do not reach that decision lightly. Upon doing so, they are arrested and temporarily detained until police establish their identity and ensure they aren’t a security threat. Possessions are restricted to those that they can carry. The route can be dangerous; frostbite has claimed fingers, and hypothermia has even claimed a life. After the refugee protection claim is launched, they remain in limbo for months or years without a guarantee they will be allowed to stay.
This is what refugee claimants coming through the U.S. weigh when they decide to seek Canada’s protection.
In spite of this, the federal government has decided to tighten its borders, further targeting refugee claimants who seek Canada’s protection by travelling through the U.S.
First, Canada will deny access to the independent Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) — the cornerstone of our refugee status determination system — to people who have made prior claims for refugee protection in the U.S. (along with Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom).
Second, Canada is seeking to amend the Safe Third Country Agreement so refugee claimants who cross the border between official ports of entry will be forced back to the U.S.
To some, the idea of fleeing human rights violations in the U.S. is absurd. But that is the harsh reality for refugees and migrants in the U.S. Consider the discriminatory travel ban on Muslim-majority countries. Child and family separation. Harsh detention practices. Removal of gender-based violence as a ground for protection. Axing presumptive release for pregnant women in immigration detention.
Recently, the Trump Administration released yet another cruel deterrence policy: denying bond hearings until refugee claims are finalized, which can take years. In patent evidence of its absurdity, the new rule was suspended for 90 days because detention facilities are already so stretched that they will not be able to manage the influx.
While Canada cannot change these policies, it certainly should demonstrate opposition by setting a better example. The alternative is a race to the bottom, wherein each country would seek to adopt the harshest policies as a deterrent to those seeking protection.
If we reject such an approach, we might nonetheless ask: can we afford it, and is it fair?
In the past two years, about 40,000 people have crossed the border irregularly. That is about 55 people per day. That influx does lead to an increased demand on resources, and the way we accommodate those needs is the subject of legitimate debate.
At the same time, it’s important to view the number in context. There are almost 1 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, almost a quarter of the country’s total population. Bangladesh is hosting about 1 million Rohingya refugees, 700,000 of whom have fled Myanmar since August 2017. Uganda is home to more than 1 million South Sudanese. Those countries are hosting exponentially greater numbers with far fewer resources. By comparison, Canada is largely exempt from the so-called global refugee crisis.
It’s trite to suggest Canadians value fairness. Fairness entails treating like cases alike, and yet politicians and pundits continue comparing immigrants and refugees, saying the latter need to “get in the right line” or disparaging them as “queue jumpers.”
In fact, there are different “lines” — one for those who wish to immigrate to Canada, and another for those seeking protection as refugees. The IRB decides whether refugee claimants have met the legal definition, and those who do not are subject to removal.
Canada’s proposed changes will establish an unfair, two-tier system. Some refugee claimants will have access to the independent IRB and an oral hearing, while others will be relegated to a process in which a government official decides their fate, with no legal right to an oral hearing. This makes the system less, not more, fair.
Tightening our borders is a knee-jerk reaction to a situation, largely caused by our neighbours to the south, at a time when the number of irregular crossings is in decline. Like all things that are not fully scrutinized and debated, it will do little to help and will cost the most to those asking Canada for nothing more than the right to be heard.

With Singapore’s parliament beginning a new session on Monday 6 May, parliamentarians are currently debating the Protection of Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill and it may be passed imminently. The government introduced the text last month, on 1 April, to “protect society from damage by online falsehoods created by ‘malicious actors.’”
“This bill would give the Singapore authorities unchecked powers to clamp down on online views of which it disapproves,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southeast Asia.
“Given Singapore’s notorious record of censoring criticism of the government and the ruling party on elaborate but ultimately hollow legal grounds, Singaporeans have every reason to fear that this law is designed to gag online expression once and for all. It criminalises free speech and allows the government almost unfettered power to censor dissent. It doesn’t even provide any real definition of what is true or false or, even more worrying, ‘misleading.’”
The Protection of Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill provides for severe criminal penalties including up to 10 years’ imprisonment for anyone found guilty of breaking the law. It also requires social media companies, such as Facebook, to remove content or display prominent corrections at the government’s direction on their platforms, or face fines of up to SGD 1 million (US$730,000).
Facebook is currently building its first Asian data centre in Singapore in a billion-dollar investment.
“This law would give Singapore overwhelming leverage over the likes of Facebook and Twitter to remove whatever the government determines is ‘misleading’,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “This is an alarming scenario. While tech firms must take all steps to make digital spaces safe for everyone, this does not provide governments an excuse to interfere with freedom of expression – or rule over the news feed.”
The draft law is part of a long-running campaign by the Singaporean government to clamp down on peaceful government critics through repeated restrictions on the media and criminal indictments against activists, among other measures.
In the lead-up to this draft law, a parliamentary Select Committee held hearings last year on ‘online falsehoods’. The sessions were marred by baseless criticism of civil society activists, and the forced removal of Han Hui Hui, a human rights defender and political activist, during a hearing on 29 March 2018.
She was forcibly evicted from the public gallery for holding up the cover of a book titled Authoritarian Rule of Law, Legislation, Discourse and Legitimacy in Singapore.
Other human rights defenders, including Jolovan Wham, a well-known activist, have also been the repeated target of repressive laws. In March 2019, he was charged with ‘illegal assembly’ for posing for a photo in front of a court building.
“Singapore already has a woeful track record of treating peaceful critics like criminals,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “With this alarming bill, the government will be able to further police the online platforms that so many Singaporeans use. It must be withdrawn.”

“If the news is true, it’s a great relief that Asia Bibi and her family are safe. She should never have been imprisoned in the first place, let alone faced the death penalty. That she then had to endure the repeated threats to her life, even after being acquitted, only compounds the injustice. This case illustrates the dangers of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and the urgent need to repeal them.”
Background
Asia Bibi is a Christian farm worker, who was sentenced to death for blasphemy in 2010. After an eight year ordeal, Pakistan’s Supreme Court acquitted her of all charges and released her in October 2018. Following which Pakistan’s government insisted the Supreme Court to hear a “review petition” in her case. On 29 January 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed the review petition and upheld its acquittal. Asia Bibi received repeated death threats from religious extremists in Pakistan, following the Supreme Courts orders.
Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are broad, vague and coercive. They have disproportionately targeted religious minorities, including in false cases brought forward to pursue personal vendettas.

Recent reductions in government monitoring aggravate the risk of conflict
Looming dry season set to intensify pressure on traditional lands   
There is an imminent risk of violent clashes in Brazil’s Amazon region unless the government protects Indigenous peoples’ traditional lands from increasing illegal land seizures and logging by armed intruders, Amnesty International warned today.
Amnesty International recently visited three different Indigenous territories in northern Brazil where illegal intruders had begun or expanded efforts to seize land and/or cut down trees. Indigenous leaders told the organization that they had received death threats for defending their traditional lands. They also fear new intrusions in the dry season (May/June to October/November) when easier physical access to forests facilitates clearance and burning.
“Brazil’s Indigenous peoples and their land face enormous threats and the situation will soon become untenable in the dry season,” said Richard Pearshouse, Senior Crisis & Environment Advisor for Amnesty International.
“The government must protect Indigenous peoples who are defending their land, or blood will be shed.”
In April 2019, Amnesty International interviewed 23 Indigenous people in three territories in northern Brazil: Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau in Rondônia state, and Arara in Pará state. Amnesty International also interviewed 12 people knowledgeable about intrusions in Indigenous territories, including government officials, Public Prosecutors and representatives of non-governmental organizations.
According to representatives of non-governmental organizations and authorities, intruders are often local individuals who are encouraged and supported to occupy plots of land and/or sell the timber by local farmers and politicians.
Indigenous peoples in some territories conduct patrols to monitor and protect their land from these intrusions. As the intruders are often armed, there is a high risk of violent clashes with Indigenous peoples. 
In all three sites, Indigenous leaders have repeatedly denounced recent illegal land seizures and logging to government authorities. However there have been only limited responses from government authorities, and illegal land seizures and logging have continued.
An intrusion by some 40 illegal intruders into Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory in January 2019 resulted in a government surveillance operation in the area over a week later in which one person was arrested and later released. A much larger intrusion into Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territory followed, in April 2019, estimated to involve many hundreds of illegal intruders. A government surveillance operation led to two people being arrested a week after the April intrusion. 
Gunshots during the night
Indigenous peoples from all three territories told Amnesty International that illegal intruders had recently cut new paths into the forest near their villages and roads. In some territories they also described frequently hearing sounds of tractors and chainsaws inside the territories.
A 22-year-old Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau woman described how she felt in the days after the intrusion in January 2019:
“When I heard about the invasion, I was scared because it is very close to the village. I had never seen one so close. I was afraid they would come here. I couldn’t sleep anymore. There were gunshots during the night for several nights. I was scared. I put the children to sleep, but I couldn’t sleep.”
Amnesty International’s researchers observed traces of roads and paths inside the Indigenous territories previously used by intruders, as well as pictures and videos of markers delineating plots and paths, and a tractor carrying timber. 
A Karipuna leader told Amnesty International about fears the situation may escalate to violent clashes in the dry season:
“They [the illegal intruders] left a message that we [the Indigenous leaders] should not walk in their paths, we would disappear … If government doesn’t protect the territory, a tragedy between intruders and Indigenous might happen. During the dry season, invasions will increase even more because authorities haven’t taken any measures.”
The government’s response to these illegal land seizures and logging remains inadequate. The surveillance of Indigenous territories depends in large part on coordination among different governmental bodies. Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) lacks police powers and relies on the support from other institutions, such as the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the Federal Police (Polícia Federal). Experts told Amnesty International that surveillance operations have been reduced because of budget constraints over recent months.
Indigenous people expressed their frustration to Amnesty International that few intruders are held accountable, while experts highlighted the need to investigate those supporting and funding the illegal land seizures and logging. 
Between January and April 2019, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s office (Ministério Público Federal) sent at least four letters to the Ministries of Justice and Women, Family and Human Rights – the Ministry responsible for the National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) since January 2019 – describing a deterioration of the security situation in the Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territories and warning of a risk of conflict. The office requested the immediate support from the National Security Force while authorities develop a long-term protection plan for the territories.
To date, the Ministries of Justice and Women, Family and Human Rights have not coordinated with the National Security Force to protect the Karipuna and Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau territories and the long-term protection plan remains unresolved.
“Unless FUNAI and the other authorities step up the fight against illegal land seizures and logging, violent clashes between Indigenous peoples and intruders are incredibly likely,” said Richard Pearshouse.
“The government should promptly affirm its commitment to the protection of Indigenous territories and ensure they are respected.”
Deforestation in Indigenous territories worsen
Illegal land seizures and logging are usually less common in rainy season (October/November to May/June) than dry season (May/June to October/November). The NGO Imazon has reported the loss of 12 square kilometres of forest inside Indigenous territories in the Amazon during the first three months of the year. This represents a 100% rise compared to the same period in 2018.
Studies indicate that, where traditional lands of Indigenous peoples are primary forests, demarcation of Indigenous territories can play a protective role against deforestation. Conserving primary forests is key in the fight against climate change because when forests are cleared or burnt, stored carbon is released into the atmosphere mainly as carbon dioxide.
“Protecting the human rights of Indigenous peoples is key to preventing further deforestation in the Amazon. The international community should be watching carefully and supporting those Indigenous communities on the front lines of the fight to protect the world’s most precious forests,” said Richard Pearshouse.

“For the last eight years students at this university have marched through their campus to celebrate Pride and demand equality and dignity for LGBTI people. It is celebration of love which sends a message of hope to all those struggling to uphold fundamental rights in Turkey and beyond.
“Rather than banning Pride events, the university should be supporting and protecting such marches and challenging homophobia and transphobia. The Rectorate must reverse its decision and allow students without fear of intimidation or violence.”
Background
The march was scheduled to take place on 10 March.
Turkish authorities must ensure that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) individuals and their allies are able to enjoy their rights to freedom of expression and assembly without fear of intimidation or violence.
According to Ministry of Interior’s response of 14 March 2019 to a formal information request by the lawyer of KAOS-GL, an LGBTI rights organisation, there is no general ban on LGBTI events in Ankara and each application is assessed individually. The general ban issued by Ankara Governor under the State of Emergency was lifted through a court decision on 21 February 2019.

“Today marks an important victory for press freedom in Myanmar. The case against Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo was a travesty of justice from start to finish and they should never have spent a day in prison.
“While all those who campaigned for their release welcome the government’s decision, the reality is the country retains a range of repressive laws used to detain journalists, activists and any perceived critic of the authorities. Until these laws are repealed, journalists and activists remain under a permanent threat of detention and arrest.
“In recent weeks, Amnesty International has recorded a surge in politically motivated arrests – most for criticism of the military. The government must follow through its rightful decision to free Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo by releasing all other journalists and prisoners of conscience detained on hollow charges, and by repealing all laws that keep a chokehold on freedom of expression.”
Background
Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in Yangon, on 12 December 2017. At the time, the two were investigating a massacre of 10 Rohingya men and boys committed by members of the Myanmar security forces in northern Rakhine State, for which seven Myanmar soldiers were later jailed by a military court.
The two journalists were charged with breaching the Official Secrets Act and on 3 September 2018 sentenced to seven years in prison. An appeal to the Yangon High Court was rejected in January 2019. On 16 April 2019, Wa Lone, Kyaw Soe Oo and their colleagues were award the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting.
Recent weeks have seen an alarming spate of politically motivated arrests and detention. These include: 
On 12 April, film director and a founder of the Myanmar Human Rights, Human Dignity International Film Festival Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi was detained in connection with Facebook posts critical of the military and the 2008 Constitution;
On 19 April, authorities announced they were opening a case for “online defamation” against Ye Ni, the editor of the Burmese section of The Irrawaddy for an article which the Myanmar military deemed “one-sided”;
On 22 April a group of five people was taken into custody and are facing charges of defamation and making “statements conducing to public mischief” after they live-streamed a satirical Thangyat performance mocking the Myanmar military during Myanmar’s new year festival. 
These arrests are made possible by a range of repressive laws, which have for years been used to silence critical voices. To date, the NLD-led government – and parliament – has largely failed to take action to repeal or amend those laws that are incompatible with international human rights laws and standards. Instead, both the government and the military have actively used such laws to curb freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

“We welcome the news that Dr Eduardo Cardet has been released on probation and can be reunited with his family. However, as long as his freedom is conditional, Eduardo Cardet is still a prisoner of conscience. He should never have been arrested in the first place.”
“Although his release on parole is a positive step, we reiterate that the arrest and subsequent conviction of Dr Eduardo Cardet in 2016 was politically motivated. Therefore, we will keep demanding his absolute freedom, without any conditions. We will continue to closely monitor his situation and to conduct global campaigning actions in defence of his rights.”
Dr Eduardo Cardet, leader of the Christian Liberation Movement (MCL), was arrested on 30 November 2016, five days after the death of Fidel Castro. He was later found guilty of assaulting a state official and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment in March 2017.
Several witnesses who spoke to Amnesty International contradict the official version of events. Prior to his arrest, Dr Eduardo Cardet had given interviews published in international media in which he had been critical of the Cuban government.
According to information received by Amnesty International, Dr Eduardo Cardet will have to comply with certain conditions in order to remain out of prison until his sentence ends on 30 September 2019. Dr Eduardo Cardet will be informed of the conditions of his release in a hearing set for 16 May.

“We are extremely concerned to hear that Elżbieta Podlesna, a Polish human rights activist, was arrested and detained for several hours on spurious charges today upon her return to Poland from a trip to Belgium and the Netherlands with Amnesty International.
Elżbieta is suspected of “offending religious beliefs”, after the police claimed that they found copies of a posters depicting the Virgin Mary with a halo around head and shoulders in the colours of the LGBTQ flag in her house when they raided it. The image had been posted around the town of Płock at the end of April.
“Given the lack of evidence of a crime here, we can only see that Elżbieta has been detained for her peaceful activism. Amnesty International calls on the Polish authorities to stop harassing peaceful protesters and activists in Poland, including by arbitrarily arresting people who stand up for their rights.

Industry associations, like the Mining Association of British Columbia, hold dozens of events to promote mining investment in Canada and abroad. 
But for corporate accountability activists, May is also Mining Justice Month. 
Amnesty activists will be well-aware that every May Amnesty joins more than 30 partner organizations from the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability (CNCA) and grassroots groups across Canada to take action in solidarity with human rights defenders and communities harmed by Canadian oil, gas and mining operations abroad and in Canada. 
This May, we call on you to speak out in defense of human rights for water defenders in Canada, earth defenders in Latin America, and for Canadian corporate accountability rules that truly protect human rights. 
 
Last Mining Justice month, we were hopeful that the newly announced Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise (CORE) would soon roll up his or her sleeves and get to work investigating the many troubling abuse allegations against overseas Canadian extractive and garment industry operations. We called on you to ask the Prime Minister to follow through on commitments to grant the CORE the necessary powers to do the job right – and you did so in great numbers. Thank you! 
But the government dragged its heels for the next 15 months. 
On April 8, 2019 it announced the appointment of lawyer Sheri Meyerhoffer. But any excitement about the post dissipated when it became clear that the government had not given her a mandate or the powers to independently investigate complaints. 
Over the next few weeks, Amnesty is calling on everyone concerned about corporate accountability and the grave dangers facing earth and water defenders for speaking out against the harms caused by Canadian extractives industries to join us in taking action. 
Here are some of the ways you can get involved to make sure Canada is Open for Justice: 
 
Nearly 5 years has passed since the Mount Polley copper mine tailings disaster in British Columbia. 25 million cubic meters of mine waste and tailings pond water ended up in pristine Quesnel Lake. People are still afraid to swim, eat or drink water from the lake. But out of economic necessity, some people have no choice but to drink the water or eat fish caught there. 
Despite these serious health and human rights concerns, despite the disproportionate impact in Indigenous peoples in the region who rely on fish from Quesnel Lake and surrounding rivers, and despite calls for justice and accountability from two United Nations bodies, Canada has failed to fine, sanction or hold anyone criminally responsible. And this is a shame, because it denies residents and Indigenous peoples who were harmed their human right to remedy and reparations. 
BC’s Conservation Officer Service, the RCMP, and Fisheries and Oceans Canada have until August 4, 2019 to lay criminal charges for violations of the federal Fisheries Act that led to the disaster. Meanwhile, the company continues to discharge filtered mine waste into Quesnel Lake via large discharge pipes. It does not use best available technologies or practices to treat waste water coming out of its processing plant. Residents are furious and deeply concerned. 
Please join Amnesty in speaking out in support of residents and Indigenous peoples harmed by the Mount Polley mine disaster in their quest for justice and accountability. Five years is too long to wait! 
Here are some of the activities you can join during May Mining Justice month: 
 
Across Latin America, people who seek to protect land, water and forests face an unprecedented increase in attacks and killings. It’s the most dangerous region in the world to defend environmental human rights. 
The aim of these attacks is to paralyze peaceful struggles of communities exercising their right to speak out about irresponsible logging, mining and dam projects that threaten the environment on which they depend. 
It is vital that Canada puts in place effective safeguards to ensure the trade and investment our government promotes in Latin America does not lead to conflict and violence against earth defenders.   
 
As you can see, there are many ways you can get involved in Amnesty’s campaigns to support environmental human rights defenders and demand Canada protects their rights. 
Challenge yourself, your family and friends to take 2 actions per week from the list above. 
By the end of Mining Justice Month, you will have taken 8 actions in support of greater corporate accountability in Canada. Thank you!  You are a human rights champion!

Throughout the month of May, we are collecting cards to echo the calls for action by mothers of the disappeared in Mexico. 
 
May 10 is Mother’s Day in Mexico. Thousands of mothers marked the date by taking part in a huge Mother’s Day March for Dignity (promoted in their poster, left), carrying the photos of sons and daughters who disappeared, never to be seen again. The mothers of the disappeared organize the march to make visible the massive dimensions of this heart-rending crisis and to call for action. 
More than 40,000 people are now reported missing in Mexico. It’s a staggering number that only continues to grow. Some people were abducted by criminal gangs. In other cases, public officials were involved. 
For years, authorities have done little or nothing to help the mothers of the disappeared. Investigations have been non-existent or deeply flawed. Mothers are left to do the searching themselves, tormented by not knowing if their loved ones have been killed or whether they are being held captive in need of rescue.   
Trying to uncover the truth is dangerous work. Mothers have been threatened and had to go into hiding. Others have been killed or disappeared themselves. 
Even so, the mothers refuse to give up. 
They have joined together in self-help groups that have multiplied and now form a national movement. Through their tireless work, the mothers have achieved a law that creates a National Search Commission and special investigators to bring disappearances to justice. 
These are important commitments but they are yet to be implemented. So the mothers are speaking out to demand that everything called for by the law is actually implemented. 
 
  
Why? 
President López Obrador values opinions that come from the grassroots of society, including from countries with which Mexico has a close relationship. 
The mothers of the disappeared have asked for solidarity from inside and outside Mexico to echo their voices and help them achieve urgently-needed advances. 
Andrés Manuel López Obrador became president of Mexico last December and promised change. He expressed public concern about the crisis of disappearances and launched a special commission to investigate the disappearance of the 43 students of Ayotzinapa. Much more is needed. Public pressure can help.
