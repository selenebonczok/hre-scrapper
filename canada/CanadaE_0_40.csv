0,Biodiversity: COP15 biodiversity deal a ‘missed opportunity’ to protect Indigenous peoples’ rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/biodiversity-cop15-biodiversity-deal-a-missed-opportunity-to-protect-indigenous-peoples-rights/,"Despite constituting just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples’ lands host 80% of the world’s biodiversity.","The Global Biodiversity Framework agreed at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal, which aims to preserve biodiversity globally by calling on states to commit to declaring 30% of the earth protected for conservation by 2030, is a missed opportunity to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples, Amnesty International said today. 
The accord, known as the 30 x 30 agreement, sets significant targets aimed at arresting the alarming decline in biodiversity seen in recent decades. States at COP15, however, fell short of explicitly recognizing Indigenous peoples’ lands and territories as a separate category of conserved area, which ultimately threatens their rights. 
“This COP15 conference offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set ambitious goals aiming to protect the diversity of flora and fauna on the planet. While the accord contains a number of highly important environmental targets and human rights safeguards, which states will now be held accountable for, it fails to fully protect and uphold Indigenous peoples’ rights,” said Chris Chapman, Amnesty International’s Adviser on Indigenous Rights. 
“In the Global Biodiversity Framework agreed today at COP15, states present at the Conference did not wholly incorporate Indigenous peoples’ demand for their lands and territories to be fully recognized as a category of conserved area, a plea that was intended to protect them from the predations they often experience in areas such as state-run national parks. 
“Consequently, states have failed to fully recognize Indigenous peoples’ immense contribution to conserving biodiversity, putting them at greater risk of human rights violations. 
“The Global Biodiversity Framework negotiated at COP15 only partly acknowledges Indigenous peoples’ outstanding contribution to conservation. Despite constituting just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples’ lands host 80% of the world’s biodiversity. 
“Over the four years that the accord has been negotiated, the protections of Indigenous peoples’ rights have been much strengthened, thanks to the tireless work of the Indigenous leaders and activists involved. 
“Yet regardless of the safeguards in the document, a number of Indigenous peoples remain opposed to calls to expand protected areas, given the appalling abuses that are committed in such areas in many countries.” 
Biodiversity is an essential element of a healthy environment. In a landmark resolution passed this year, the UN General Assembly agreed to recognize the right to a healthy environment as a human right, in a move that may transform efforts to fight climate change and protect the right to live in dignity for billions of people. Failing to address biodiversity loss will lead to severe repercussions for future generations, who will inherit its irreversible results. 
“Considering the gaps in the framework, monitoring the deal’s implementation and combatting any human rights violations arising from the establishment of protected areas will now prove absolutely crucial,” said Chris Chapman. 
Background 
COP15, which ran from 7-19 December in Montreal, marked the latest conference held to discuss the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity, an agreement adopted in 1992. The talks aimed to set specific goals for 2030 and targets to 2050. 
Amnesty International stresses the urgent need to address the loss of biodiversity as an essential step towards climate justice and to protect the right to live in a safe, clean and sustainable environment.

It’s been 74 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the UN General Assembly. 
This international document is meant to guarantee the human rights and freedoms of all people, regardless of their race, creed, gender or nationality. It makes clear that “human rights should be protected by the rule of law”. 
While the UDHR was a progressive document at the time, it was not born in a vacuum. The UDHR was brought to life as an attempt by world leaders of the time to prevent a repeat of some of the darkest days in history, which took place during the horrors of World War II. 
Historians have estimated that anywhere between 40-million and 60-million people were killed during that war and yet, despite the subsequent adoption and introduction of the UDHR, and the adoption of several other human rights instruments, new wars as well as long-standing and unresolved conflicts continue to cause pain and suffering to civilians around the world. 
Compounding this problem is the ever-growing deficit in global leadership to envision and reimagine a new value-driven, rights-respecting world order. The international system is clearly in crisis, hardly holding together to decisively resolve many of the mutually reinforcing complex global political and socio-economic challenges the world faces today. 
On 24 February, people across Ukraine woke up to the news that their country was being invaded by Russia’s military. In the middle of the night, Russian tanks rolled into the country and the military attacked from multiple directions, killing civilians and destroying public infrastructure and people’s homes. 
As the war rages on, the sheer scale of human rights violations and crimes under international law that are exposed grows with every passing day. Entire neighbourhoods have been destroyed through disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, with the UN recording nearly eight million Ukrainian refugees across Europe and many more people missing or forcibly transferred to Russian territory. 
In towns such as Bucha, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka and Vorzel, Amnesty International collected evidence and testimony of unlawful killings, including apparent extrajudicial executions. Some victims had their hands tied behind their backs while others showed signs of torture. In further instances of likely crimes against humanity, convoys of civilians fleeing with their children were fired upon. 
The impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine is not contained within Europe. The economic and social rights of millions of people across Africa, and globally, have suffered as a consequence of Russian aggression. 
In Africa, the war has plunged the continent into a deeper economic crisis, which was already struggling, following the disastrous impact of Covid-19 on people’s livelihoods. The significant rise in the cost of oil, of which Russia is the biggest supplier globally, has driven food prices higher, including the cost of staple food such as bread. 
Together, Russia and Ukraine account for almost a third of the world’s wheat exports with African nations among their largest purchasers. According to the World Food Programme, Russia and Ukraine supply 100% of Eritrea’s supplies and 66% of Ethiopia’s wheat. With both countries already facing humanitarian crises, due to armed conflict and drought, things have been worse as a result of a war fought far from their shores.  
In different parts of Africa, people who are trapped in conflicts in countries such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan have continued to pay the price of these protracted wars in 2022 and are experiencing full-scale violations of their human rights.  
Again, failed leadership by the UN and the AU has meant war and conflict have become a standard bearer of the rule of law deficit so evident in most of the war-torn parts of the continent. 
For example, in Ethiopia, the conflict in the northern region of Tigray entered its second year in November 2022. Grave human rights violations, including sexual violence, have been a defining feature of the conflict. Multiple forms of sexual violence — including rape, sexual slavery, sexual mutilation and torture — have been perpetrated against Tigrayan women and girls by government forces, their allied militias and by the Eritrean forces that have been fighting alongside the Ethiopian military. 
Similarly, the Tigrayan forces committed grave human rights violations, including sexual violence, against women and girls in the Amhara and Afar regions. As human rights lawyer Brian Kagoro has opined – it has become “a festival of illegalities”! 
In South Sudan, sexual violence has been and continues to be a persistent feature of the conflict that broke out in the country on 15 December 2013. Perpetrators include government security actors, non-state armed groups, militias and armed and unarmed men. Guns are used to facilitate conflict-related sexual violence with impunity by security forces, who threaten women and girls to comply with their sexual demands. 
In the DRC, successive multi-layered armed conflicts have devastated the country since the early 1990s. Congolese and foreign armies as well as non-state armed groups have continued to commit countless crimes under international law throughout 2022, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other grave human rights abuses. The long-proclaimed potential of the DRC to be the final key that unlocks Africa’s development in power, energy, and mineral development has sadly so far remained a stillbirth. 
In Somalia, the ongoing conflict between Somali authorities and the armed group al- Shabaab, which also involves allied regional and international forces including the United States Africa Command (Africom) and the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) now replaced by the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (Atmis), continues to have a devastating toll on civilians. 
In Mali, thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and many civilians have been killed amid increased fighting between Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and Malian armed forces and allied armed groups, as the conflict in northern Mali escalated in June. 
Parties to these conflicts committed war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The pursuit of justice for victims proved largely to be elusive. 
A centrally discussed concern in Africa, as indeed in other parts of the world, is what author and historian Anne Applebaum coined in her new book as the “seductive lure of authoritarianism” – a drift towards toxic nationalism, populism and despotic abuse of power by leaders of countries operating in concert with others.  
It is self-evident that despotic leaders do not rule alone, they rely on a system – a package of enablers, political allies, bureaucrats and state-controlled media figures to pave the way to support their [mis]rule.  
You can see the cross-border alliance of this project, the copycat behaviour in the enactment of draconian anti-NGO laws from one country to the other, the curtailment of human rights and excessive weaponisation of the law as an instrument of repression, smear campaigns against activists, the abuse of the criminal justice system by means of political persecution in the name of prosecution and the downright colonial-era intimidation tactics by an assortment of state functionaries and their supporting cast.  
These authoritarians use a common playbook – including the promotion and harvesting of fear, undermining of institutions, blaming outsiders for domestic failure, exploiting religion, rewriting history, dividing and conquering, eroding the truth and doing anything to sustain their repression and get away with their crimes. 
These tactics shrink the space for human rights and civil society. To highlight this problem, the Southern African Human Rights Defenders Network meeting in Lusaka in the last week of November, chose this as the theme of their annual human rights summit! 
Across Africa, authorities have escalated their crackdown on peaceful dissent, including the detention of government critics and opposition leaders for speaking out against injustice. Prominent Zimbabwean opposition leader Job Sikhala has been languishing in detention for more than five months without having been found guilty of any crime, after attending the funeral of a political activist. In September, author and activist Tsitsi Dangarembga and fellow protester Julie Barnes were each convicted of “inciting violence” and handed a six-month suspended sentence after they protested economic hardships in 2020. 
In Angola, authorities tightened their grip on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association by preventing civil society meetings from taking place ahead of the general election in August. 
In the DRC, authorities have continued to use the state of siege, which is similar to a state of emergency, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, as a tool to crush dissent. Military and police authorities have used sweeping powers to silence individuals deemed critical of the state of siege, including members of parliament, pro-democracy activists and human rights workers. In April, a military court in Beni convicted 12 activists from the citizen movement Lutte pour le Changement in a shameful attempt to silence critical voices. 
Human rights gains are never given on a silver platter. They are a function of struggle, of organising, not agonising and of resilience and standing up to human rights abusers. 
Against this backdrop, we have also seen positive signs in 2022 that are encouraging for those fighting to promote and ensure the protection of human rights. The global fight against the death penalty is being won, slowly but surely. While an overwhelming majority of countries in the region have not yet abolished the death penalty for all crimes, some including Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, are not carrying out any executions. 
Meanwhile, Zambia has begun the process of doing away with the death penalty through parliament after President Hakainde Hichilema announced in May that the country would be working to abolish this cruel and inhuman form of punishment. 
In Malawi, justice was served in April when a court convicted 12 men over the 2018 killing of MacDonald Masambuka, a person with albinism. 
In another victory for human rights, in South Africa a constitutional court ruling in November provided new protection for human rights defenders and activists against Strategic Litigation against Public Participation (Slapp) suits designed to silence criticism. The court ruled that Slapp suits target activists, journalists, whistleblowers and everyday people who exercise their constitutional rights, including challenging injustice, masquerading as ordinary lawsuits. 
In the second judgment, the constitutional court held that companies that suffer harm to their reputation as a result of defamation may not claim compensation for non-financial losses if the defamatory speech forms part of “public discourse on issues of legitimate public interest”. 
From Tanzania to Uganda, Russia to Sri Lanka, France to Senegal, and Iran to Zimbabwe, state authorities are implementing an expanding array of measures to suppress organised dissent.  
Protesters across the globe are facing a potent mix of pushbacks, with a growing number of laws and other measures to restrict the right to protest, including the misuse of force; “authoritarian legalism” characterised by use, abuse and non-use of the law; the expansion of unlawful mass and targeted surveillance; internet shutdowns and online censorship; smear campaigns; and abuse and stigmatisation. 
As offline space shrinks, we are seeing greater and more organised mobilisation and reclaiming of civic space online through greater digital activism. This included routine online pushback on falsehoods, misinformation and manipulation by an African population embracing digital tools and spaces for activism and social change. 
This year, Amnesty International launched a new global campaign to confront states’ widening and intensifying efforts to erode the right to peaceful assembly. 
Our “Protect the Protest” campaign will challenge attacks on peaceful protest, stand with those targeted, and support the causes of social movements pushing for human rights change.

“The spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Meta’s pursuit of profit 
The legal action claims that Meta promoted speech that led to ethnic violence and killings in Ethiopia by utilizing an algorithm that prioritizes and recommends hateful and violent content on Facebook. The petitioners seek to stop Facebook’s algorithms from recommending such content to Facebook users and compel Meta to create a 200 billion ($1.6 billion USD) victims’ fund. Amnesty International joins six other human rights and legal organizations as interested parties in the case. 
“The spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Meta’s pursuit of profit, as its systems are designed to keep people engaged. This legal action is a significant step in holding Meta to account for its harmful business model,” said Flavia Mwangovya, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director of East Africa, Horn, and Great Lakes Region. 
One of Amnesty’s staff members in the region was targeted as a result of posts on the social media platform. 
“In Ethiopia, the people rely on social media for news and information. Because of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. I saw first-hand how the dynamics on Facebook harmed my own human rights work and hope this case will redress the imbalance,” said Fisseha Tekle, legal advisor at Amnesty International. 
Fisseha Tekle is one of the petitioners bringing the case, after being subjected to a stream of hateful posts on Facebook for his work exposing human rights violations in Ethiopia. An Ethiopian national, he now lives in Kenya, fears for his life and dare not return to Ethiopia to see his family because of the vitriol directed at him on Facebook. 
Because of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. 
Fatal failings 
The legal action is also being brought by Abraham Meareg, the son of Meareg Amare, a University Professor at Bahir Dar University in northern Ethiopia, who was hunted down and killed in November 2021, weeks after posts inciting hatred and violence against him spread on Facebook. The case claims that Facebook only removed the hateful posts eight days after Professor Meareg’s killing, more than three weeks after his family had first alerted the company. 
The Court has been informed that Abraham Meareg fears for his safety and is seeking asylum in the United States. His mother who fled to Addis Ababa is severely traumatized and screams every night in her sleep after witnessing her husband’s killing. The family had their home in Bahir Dar seized by regional police. 
The harmful posts targeting Meareg Amare and Fisseha Tekle were not isolated cases.  The legal action alleges Facebook is awash with hateful, inciteful and dangerous posts in the context of the Ethiopia conflict. 
Meta uses engagement-based algorithmic systems to power Facebook’s news feed, ranking, recommendations and groups features, shaping what is seen on the platform. Meta profits when Facebook users stay on the platform as long as possible, by selling more targeted advertising. 
The display of inflammatory content – including that which advocates hatred, constituting incitement to violence, hostility and discrimination – is an effective way of keeping people on the platform longer. As such, the promotion and amplification of this type of content is key to the surveillance-based business model of Facebook. 
Internal studies dating back to 2012 indicated that Meta knew its algorithms could result in serious real-world harms. In 2016, Meta’s own research clearly acknowledged that “our recommendation systems grow the problem” of extremism. 
In September 2022, Amnesty International documented how Meta’s algorithms proactively amplified and promoted content which incited violence, hatred, and discrimination against the Rohingya in Myanmar and substantially increasing the risk of an outbreak of mass violence. 
“From Ethiopia to Myanmar, Meta knew or should have known that its algorithmic systems were fuelling the spread of harmful content leading to serious real-world harms,” said Flavia Mwangovya. 
“Meta has shown itself incapable to act to stem this tsunami of hate. Governments need to step up and enforce effective legislation to rein in the surveillance-based business models of tech companies.” 
Deadly double standards 
The legal action also claims that there is a disparity in Meta’s approach in crisis situations in Africa compared to elsewhere in the world, particularly North America. The company has the capability to implement special adjustments to its algorithms to quickly remove inflammatory content during a crisis. But despite being deployed elsewhere in the world, according to the petitioners none of these adjustments were made during the conflict in Ethiopia, ensuring harmful content continued to proliferate. 
“Meta has failed to adequately invest in content moderation in the Global South 
Internal Meta documents disclosed by whistle-blower Frances Haugen, known as the Facebook Papers, showed that the US $300 billion company also did not have sufficient content moderators who speak local languages. A report by Meta’s Oversight Board also raised concerns that Meta had not invested sufficient resources in moderating content in languages other than English. 
“Meta has failed to adequately invest in content moderation in the Global South, meaning that the spread of hate, violence, and discrimination disproportionally impacts the most marginalized and oppressed communities across the world, and particularly in the Global South.”

But, amid the gloom, there were plenty of good news stories to celebrate this year.  
Throughout 2022, Amnesty’s ongoing campaigning, media and advocacy work contributed to positive outcomes for people all over the world whose human rights were being violated. Individuals unjustly detained were freed from prison. Human rights abusers were held accountable. Vital legislation and resolutions were passed by governments at national and international level. Progress towards the global abolition of the death penalty continued. And important advances were made both for the rights of women and LGBTI people. 
Here’s a round-up of human rights wins in 2022.  
Amnesty’s ongoing work for individuals helped secure the release of people across the world, delivered justice for families, and held abusers accountable.  
In January, university lecturer Professor Faizullah Jalal was released after being arbitrarily arrested and detained by the Taliban.  
Hejaaz Hizbullah, a Sri Lankan lawyer and Amnesty prisoner of conscience, was granted bail in February after almost two years of pre-trial detention under Sri Lanka’s draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Two other detainees held under the PTA, Ahnaf  Mohamed Imran and Divaniya Mukunthan, were also released on bail in August and September respectively.  
In Honduras, the “Guapinol eight”, a group of water rights defenders and prisoners of conscience, were unconditionally released in February, after spending more than two years in prison for their human rights work. 
The following month, in neighbouring Guatemala, Indigenous Mayan environmentalist and prisoner of conscience Bernardo Caal Xol was released early after being jailed on bogus charges related to his activism. More than half a million actions were taken on his behalf during Amnesty’s 2021 Write for Rights campaign.  
Elsewhere, Magai Matiop Ngong — for whom more than 700,00 actions were taken during Write for Rights 2019 — was released from prison in South Sudan in March, having been sentenced to death at the age of 15 in 2017.   
August saw the release of schoolteacher Hriday Chandra Mondal, who was detained for discussing the difference between science and religion in his classes. All charges against him were subsequently dropped.  
In May, 18-year-old Palestinian Amal Nakhleh, who suffers from a chronic autoimmune disorder, was released from Israeli administrative detention following 16 months of campaigning by Amnesty and others. 
In July, a Russian court acquitted Yulia Tsvetkova of “production and dissemination of pornographic materials” over her body-positive drawings of vaginas that were published online.  
Following an Urgent Action by Amnesty, Maldivian activist Rusthum Mujuthaba, who was being held on blasphemy charges in relation to a social media post, was released from prison in August.  
Palestinian national Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari was released from prison in Saudi Arabia in October after spending more than three years in arbitrary detention along with his son, Dr. Hani al-Khudari. Both men were handed down prison sentences based on trumped-up charges. Dr. Hani al-Khudari remains in prison despite the expiry of his sentence in February and Amnesty continues to campaign for his release.  
Six Palestinian men who reported that they had been tortured in Palestinian Authority prisons were released on bail within two weeks of Amnesty’s intervention in November.     
Thanks to the support of Amnesty Argentina, a Ukrainian family was able to escape the war and settle in the country in November. A short film documenting their story is available here.  
In Yemen, journalist Younis Abdelsalam was released in December after being arbitrarily detained for over a year for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression.  
In Malawi, justice was served in April when a court convicted 12 men over the 2018 killing of MacDonald Masambuka, a person with albinism.  
In June, partial justice was finally delivered for the 2016 murder of environmental and Indigenous rights activist Berta Cáceres, as David Castillo was sentenced to prison for co-authoring her killing. Amnesty continues its campaign to bring others suspected of responsibility for Berta’s murder to justice.  
After pressure from the US authorities, and following a visit by President Biden to Israel, the Israeli Defense Ministry agreed in October to pay compensation to the family of Palestinian-American Omar As’ad, who died after Israeli soldiers ill-treated him at a checkpoint in January.  
In November, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation informed the Israeli government that it would conduct an investigation into the May killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by an Israeli soldier.    
In December, a Lebanese judge indicted five State Security members on charges of torture in the case of Syrian refugee Bashar Abdel Saud, who died in custody in August.  
Amnesty’s campaign for the global abolition of the death penalty saw further success in 2022, as a string of countries abolished or took significant steps towards abolishing the punishment.   
The abolition of the death penalty for all crimes came into force in Kazakhstan in January. Papua Guinea followed suit in April, repealing the punishment 30 years on from its reintroduction.  
Via social media, Zambia’s President announced in May that the country would begin the process of abandoning the death penalty and, in June, Malaysia’s government initiated the process of removing the mandatory death sentence for 11 offences.  
In September, a new law which removed death penalty provisions from the penal code in Equatorial Guinea came into effect. 
Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that have not yet abolished the death penalty for all crimes, including Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, continued to carry out no executions.  
At both national and international level, Amnesty’s work was vital in helping secure the passage of essential legislation and resolutions, as well as ensuring that companies were held accountable for their human rights responsibilities.  
National  
There were important wins on Refugee and Migrants’ Rights in the U.S. For example, in March, the Department of Homeland Security announced the designation of Afghanistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The move offers protection from deportation to Afghans without visa status and in the U.S. before March 15, 2022, allaying immediate fears of a return to a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Amnesty USA is Campaigning for a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for Afghans seeking safety, the Afghan Adjustment Act.  
In a win for the protection and promotion of the right to freedom of expression in May, the Supreme Court of India suspended the 152-year-old sedition law.  
The government of Sierra Leone drafted a new mental health bill in June that is more aligned with international human rights standards than the outdated and discriminatory ‘Lunacy Act’ of 1902. This was a central call in Amnesty’s May 2021 report focusing on the issue.  
In Niger, the country’s parliament adopted amendments to the cybercrime law in June that lifted prison sentences for libel and insults. The law had been routinely used to target and arbitrarily detain human rights defenders, activists and journalists.  
In the US, legislation on gun violence long campaigned for by Amnesty USA and partners was adopted, with the passage of the Safer Communities Act in June. The legislation provides an additional $250 million for community violence interruption (CVI) programs.  
Amnesty saw impact from our work on children in conflict zones in Niger, including increased UN monitoring of the situation. In July, the UN Secretary-General called on his Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict to “promote enhanced monitoring capacity in the Central Sahel region”, which would cover the tri-border region of Niger, which was one of the main recommendations of our September 2021 report.  
Throughout the year, Amnesty also saw some businesses take their human rights obligations more seriously. 
Following Amnesty’s request, the authorities of Sierra Leone asked the Meya mining company operating in Kono district to respond to our concerns about the negative impact of its activities on local people. The company replied that it was engaged in various actions to improve the safety of populations and access to drinking water for communities.   
Amnesty’s investigation into the aviation fuel supply chain linked to war crimes in Myanmar played a role in several companies announcing their withdrawal from jet fuel sales to the country, where shipments risk being used by the Myanmar military to carry out deadly air strikes. The companies included Puma Energy, which announced its exit less than two weeks after being presented with Amnesty’s findings. Thai Oil and Norwegian shipping agent Wilhelmsen also confirmed they would pull back from the supply chain, with more expected to follow.  
International  
Following Amnesty’s report, in March, UN Special Rapporteur (SR) Michael Lynk said that Israel is practising apartheid, followed by UN SR Balakrishnan Rajagopal in July, joining a growing chorus of expert assessments.    
In April, the European Union reached political agreement on the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark regulatory framework that will, among other things, require Big Tech platforms to assess and manage systemic risks posed by their services, such as advocacy of hatred and the spread of disinformation.  
Important progress was made on environmental justice, with the passage of a resolution at the UN General Assembly in July recognising the right to a healthy environment. The news followed a similar resolution passed by the UN Human Rights Council at the end of 2021.  
In July, ten European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden rejected the Israeli Defense Ministry designation of seven Palestinian civil society organizations as “terrorist” and “illegitimate”. The US government expressed its concern when the Israeli military raided the offices of the organizations in August, and UN experts condemned the Israeli attacks on Palestinian civil society in October.  
At its 51st session, the UN Human Rights Council released a special resolution on Afghanistan in September. Amnesty suggested the inclusion of a call for the UN Special Rapporteur to prepare a thematic report on the situation of women and girls. Several countries supported the idea, and it was included in the final resolution.   
In October, the UN Human Rights Council renewed the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela — a key independent international mechanism actively investigating and regularly reporting on past and ongoing international crimes and other human rights violations — until September 2024. And, in November, the Human Rights Council passed a landmark resolution to establish a new fact-finding mission to investigate alleged human rights violations in Iran related to the ongoing nationwide protests that began on 16 September 2022.  
The mandate of the OHCHR’s Sri Lanka Accountability Project was extended for a further two-year period in October. The project has a mandate to collect and preserve evidence for future accountability processes — a key aspect of ensuring pressure remains on the Sri Lankan government to remedy and stop both historical and current human rights violations.  
The year saw a number of victories for women’s rights, with Amnesty at the forefront.  
In the latest progress on sexual and reproductive rights in Latin America, Colombia decriminalized abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy in February. The news followed the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020 and the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico 2021.  
In May, the lower chamber of Spain’s parliament passed a bill containing important measures to prevent and prosecute rape. Finland’s parliament passed similar measures in June, adopting reforms that make lack of consent key to defining rape. Finland also passed reforms in October that eased the strictest abortion laws in the Nordic region.  
September saw the acquittal of Miranda Ruiz, a doctor who had been unjustly prosecuted in Argentina for having guaranteed a legal abortion.    
Amnesty contributed to some notable wins for LGBTI rights throughout 2022.  
In an important affirmation of transgender individuals’ rights to dignity, happiness and family life, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that having children of minor age should not immediately be the reason to refuse to recognize the legal gender of transgender persons.  
In July, same-sex marriage became legal in Switzerland, after almost two-thirds of the population voted in favour of it in a referendum. Slovenia followed suit in October, legalising same-sex marriage after a constitutional court ruling.   
A ban on the award-winning film Joyland, which features a transgender person as a central character, was reversed in Pakistan in November.

0,Peru: Crisis in the country must be addressed with full respect for human rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/peru-protests-human-rights/,Amnesty International is calling on Peruvian authorities to respect demonstrators' right to peaceful protest.,"The Peruvian authorities must refrain from using excessive force in response to the demonstrations spreading across the country and guarantee the rights to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, Amnesty International said today, after confirming at least two deaths and dozens of injuries yesterday. 
Romario Quispe Garfias, 18, and another 15-year-old boy were killed yesterday in Andahuaylas, in the context of a political crisis that has generated protests in different areas of the country since 7 December, while the media reported that two more people died in protests today. Dozens of people, including civilians and police officers, have also been injured by firearms and blunt objects. 
In addition, the National Association of Journalists of Peru recorded attacks on 21 journalists in Lima, Apurímac, Huaura, Arequipa and Puno while covering the protests between 7 and 11 December. Amnesty International has received information of other events in which the environment of violence hinders the practice of journalism and puts at risk the work and the right to inform and be informed. The aggressions range from the excessive use of force by the National Police to demonstrators committing aggressions, insults and attempting to strip journalists of their work equipment. 
“State repression against protesters is only deepening the crisis in Peru. The authorities must put an end to the excessive use of force against demonstrations and guarantee the right to peaceful protest, using the legal and proportional means necessary to restore citizen security. Moreover, to prevent further escalation of violence, we urge the authorities to seek dialogue and put human rights at the heart of their response to the crisis,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.   
‘The human rights of all people must come above any political interest. The solution to this crisis cannot involve more violence. The authorities must put the protection of the population before any political interest.’ 
Amnesty International has verified images of police firing tear gas canisters from close range directly at the bodies of protesters in Plaza San Martin in Lima. Force should not be used except when strictly necessary, in a proportional manner and for a legitimate purpose, which should then be subject to a process of accountability. In situations of violence, security forces must individualize the response to those responsible for generating disturbances or endangering the life and integrity of others. 
Amnesty International reminds the authorities that a protest does not lose its peaceful character because of sporadic acts or unlawful behavior by individuals. Therefore, the respect, guarantee and protection of the human rights of those who demonstrate peacefully must not be diminished. State security forces should also prioritize the peaceful resolution of the situation and avoid using force in ways that contravene international standards. 
The Peruvian authorities must promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigate all allegations of human rights violations in the context of the current crisis. Amnesty International is particularly concerned that the Police Protection Law (No. 3110), which has been in force since March 2020, leaves open the possibility for excessive use of force by the National Police to go unpunished, in contravention of Peru’s obligations under international law. 
Amnesty International reiterates its call for unrestricted respect for human rights and for the authorities to deploy all available resources to resolve this conflict through dialogue, listening to all voices and stopping the repression in order to avoid more deaths and human rights violations. 
The authorities must also use all available resources to safeguard the life and integrity of all injured persons, guaranteeing them immediate, timely and adequate medical attention. Likewise, they must provide the necessary support to the families of the deceased. 
“The human rights of all people must come above any political interest. The solution to this crisis cannot involve more violence. The authorities must put the protection of the population before any political interest,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru.

“The horrific public execution of Majidreza Rahnavard today exposes Iran’s judiciary for what it is: a tool of repression sending individuals to the gallows to spread fear and exacting revenge on protesters daring to stand up to the status quo. The arbitrary execution of Majidreza Rahnavard less than two weeks after his only court hearing lays bare the extent of the Iranian authorities’ assault on the right to life and their disregard for even maintaining a façade of meaningful judicial proceedings. 
“We urge the international community to take all necessary measures to pressure the Iranian authorities to stop executions and quash death sentences. 
Amnesty International further urges all states to exercise universal jurisdiction over all officials reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights.” 
Background 
Majidreza Rahnavard’s unfair trial consisted of just one session before a ‘Revolutionary Court’ in Mashhad, Khorasan-e Razavi province, on 29 November. He was charged with “enmity against God” (moharebeh). 
The authorities accused him of fatally stabbing two Basij agents in Mashhad on 17 November. Before his court session, state media broadcast videos of Majidreza Rahnavard giving forced “confessions”. His heavily bandaged left arm could be seen in a cast, raising serious concerns that he was subjected to torture. 
Amnesty International has identified 20 people at risk of execution in connection with the protests. They include: 
The horrific public execution of Majidreza Rahnavard today exposes Iran’s judiciary for what it is: a tool of repression sending individuals to the gallows to spread fear… 
Thousands have been arrested and indicted, raising fears that many more people could face the death penalty in connection to protests. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the individual, or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

In updated research, Amnesty International has documented how the unlawful killings of children by Iran’s security forces continue unabated, detailing the names and details of at least 44 children and the heartless violence inflicted upon their families.    
The authorities have been killing children in a bid to crush the spirit of resistance among the country’s youth and retain their iron grip on power at any cost. 
“The authorities have not only condemned families of children killed to a lifetime of inconsolable sadness, but they have also inflicted extreme mental anguish upon them through cruel restrictions on burials, commemorations and relentless intimidation aimed at enforcing silence. These practices violate the absolute prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The recent establishment of a UN fact-finding mission to collect, consolidate and analyse evidence of such violations sends a clear message to the Iranian authorities that they can no longer commit crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights without fear of consequences. Amnesty International now urges all states to exercise universal jurisdiction to criminally investigate Iranian officials involved in militarized attacks on demonstrators, including children.” 
Amnesty International’s research has shown that Iran’s security forces shot 34 of the identified child victims with live ammunition in the heart, head or other vital organs. At least four were killed by metal pellets unlawfully fired by the security forces at close range. Five other children, four girls and one boy, died from injuries consistent with fatal beatings, and one girl was killed after being struck on the head with a tear gas canister. The recorded child victims include 39 boys, aged between two and 17, and five girls, three of whom were 16 years old, one 17 years old, and one aged six. 
Children represent 14% of overall deaths of protesters and bystanders recorded by Amnesty International, which exceeds 300 since the protests erupted. Our investigations into killings by security forces continue and the number of those killed, including children, is believed to be higher (For more information on the organization’s methodology, see here). 
The Iranian authorities have routinely harassed and intimidated the families of child victims to coerce them into silence or to force them to accept narratives absolving authorities of responsibility for the deaths of their loved ones in written statements or video recordings broadcast on state television. Amnesty International has identified such practices against the relatives of at least 13 child victims. Information obtained by the organization from informed sources indicates that security forces subjected them to coercion including arbitrary arrest and detention, threats to bury the bodies of their loved ones in unidentified location, and threats to kill, rape, detain or otherwise harm bereaved parents and their surviving children. 
The father of Koumar Daroftadeh, a 16-year-old boy killed by live ammunition said on 13 November in an interview with Radio Farda, an independent media outlet: 
“They [security and intelligence agents] summoned me and told me that I should say whatever they dictate to me… The authorities killed my son and must be held accountable. 
Security and intelligence agents often threatened not to return the bodies of child victims for burial unless families commit, in writing, to remaining silent and observing restrictions on funeral and memorial ceremonies. 
In some cases, officials prepared the bodies of victims for burial without notifying families, then handed them the bodies, wrapped in shrouds, minutes before the scheduled burial, denying families their right to wash and prepare their loved ones for burial in accordance with their own religious and cultural traditions. 
Other restrictions included forcing families to bury their loved ones in remote villages, banning the use of word “martyr” and prohibiting relatives from hanging large memorial banners or sharing images of victims and funeral posters on social media. 
The Iranian authorities have publicly denied responsibility for the killing of at least 19 of the child victims. They have blamed 12 of these deaths on attacks by either “hired terrorists” or “unknown persons”, attributed three to suicidal or accidental falls from heights, one to a suicidal or accidental drug overdose, one to a dog bite, one to a motorcycle accident and another to a stampede. 
For nine other children, all from the oppressed Baluchi minority, the authorities have questioned their deaths, claiming in their reports to member states of the UN Human Rights Council that “there is no death record” for the children concerned in the Sistan and Baluchistan province. 
Over 60% of the children killed were from Iran’s oppressed Baluchi and Kurdish minorities. These communities have long suffered from systemic discrimination and persecution by the authorities.  
A family member of a child unlawfully killed in Sistan and Baluchistan told Amnesty International: 
“They did not pay any attention to us. They [Iranian authorities] do not consider us [Baluchis] human. There are many witnesses [to the killings], but their testimonies are worthless against the Islamic Republic because the authorities do not accept them.” 
Of the 44 recorded child victims, 18, which amounts to 40%, belonged to Iran’s oppressed Baluchi minority. Thirteen of them were killed by security forces on 30 September in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan province, during the deadliest day of the authorities’ crackdown on the protests, widely known to Iranians as “Bloody Friday”. 
Ten of the children killed, which amounts to 20%, were from the Kurdish minority and were killed in eight cities or towns in the Kurdish populated provinces of Kurdistan, Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan. 
The remaining 16 child victims were killed in six other provinces across Iran. 
“The authorities have been killing children in a bid to crush the spirit of resistance among the country’s youth and retain their iron grip on power at any cost. And yet despite that, many children have courageously continued to take to the streets in search of a future without political oppression and inequality,” said Heba Morayef.

0,Amnesty International Canada launches 2022 Human Rights Agenda,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/amnesty-international-canada-launches-2022-human-rights-agenda/,The organization’s annual report on the state of human rights in Canada was released one day before UN Human Rights Day.,"Amnesty International Canada released its annual report on the state of human rights in Canada on Friday, one day before UN Human Rights Day. 
In its 2022 Human Rights Agenda, the organization reviews Canada’s domestic performance over the past year against its international human rights commitments and lays out concrete, actionable steps to bring the country’s human rights record in line with its obligations. 
The report is launching at a pivotal juncture for Canada, as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and surging anti-rights movements increasingly threaten people’s fundamental rights and their well-being, both in this country and abroad. 
‘Public pledges and investments are insufficient markers of human rights protection. They demand robust, sustained, and measurable implementation. Only the lived experience of those whose rights are most at risk can tell us the full story and whether progress was indeed made.’ 
“Canada’s numerous, eloquent commitments to reconciliation with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit Peoples, ending racial discrimination, climate change, and refugee protection must be commended. But these are far from enough,” Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-speaking Section), wrote in the report’s introduction. 
“Public pledges and investments are insufficient markers of human rights protection. They demand robust, sustained, and measurable implementation. Only the lived experience of those whose rights are most at risk can tell us the full story and whether progress was indeed made.” 
This year’s Human Rights Agenda focuses on five distinct but related priorities highlighted in Amnesty International Canada’s Strategic Plan 2022-2030. They are: the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Discrimination and Racial Justice; Gender Justice; People on the Move: Refugee and Migrants Rights; and Climate Justice and Corporate Accountability. By applying an intersectional lens, the report’s authors champion an approach to policy-making that not only respects but reflectsthe intersecting identities of right-holders, especially people belonging to historically marginalized groups. 
Nivyabandi pointed to climate change as a disproportionate threat to people and groups whose rights are already at risk. “We cannot truly understand climate change without unpacking its heightened impacts on Indigenous communities, women and 2SLGBTQIA+ people, immigrants and refugees, and people with disabilities,” she said on Friday. “Canada’s response to climate change must put their experiences, their interests, and ultimately, their rights first.” 
While the report shines a light on continuing human rights violations, it also recognizes victories that human rights defenders in Canada celebrated in 2022. For example, Canada edged closer to eliminating the cruel, discriminatory practice of immigration detention after four provinces – British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Manitoba – separately announced that they would stop holding migrants detained by the Canada Border Services Agency in provincial jails. 
“Jailing newcomers simply for seeking a better life in Canada is cruel, unnecessary, and it disproportionately targets over-policed groups such as Black men,” said Nivyabandi, echoing the findings of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada’s joint 2021 report “I Didn’t Feel Like a Human in There:” Immigration Detention in Canada and Its Impact on Mental Health. “We thank provincial leaders for stepping back from this abhorrent practice and urge the Canadian government to do the same.” 
The release of the 2022 Human Rights Agenda comes as Amnesty International supporters across Canada gather in person to participate in the global movement’s signature letter-writing event. Centred around UN Human Rights Day on December 10, Write for Rights sees thousands of groups in more than 200 countries and territories take millions of actions in support of people whose rights are under attack. 
In years past, dozens of Write-A-Thons – lively events where activists gather to write letters, sign petitions, enjoy music and refreshments, and listen to inspiring guest speakers – took place in communities across Canada. However, in 2020 and 2021, those gatherings were cancelled or migrated online because of COVID-19 restrictions. 
“Defending human rights, at its core, is about people joining together and harnessing their collective power to counter injustice,” Nivyabandi said. “Gathering online can be an effective tool to spur change, but it is not the same experience as the intimacy and immediacy of getting together in person, sharing stories, and acting as a group. That is where empathy thrives and momentum grows unstoppable.”

Today the Government of Canada released a plan to end new public finance for fossil fuels abroad and instead prioritize clean energy projects. The policy, which comes into effect on January 1, 2023, marks a critical first step towards eliminating Canada’s massive levels of support for oil and gas and aligning federal support with a climate-safe future. 
The new policy applies across all federal departments, agencies and Crown corporations but will predominantly impact Export Development Canada (EDC), a Crown corporation with a long history of funneling billions in support to the oil and gas industry. This new policy will end a significant portion of EDC’s support for fossil fuels and redirect those funds to support the clean energy transition. 
Although the policy contains some exceptions for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the policy lays out a number of robust conditions that projects must meet. Any project receiving support must align with a pathway consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5°C. If applied with integrity, it is unlikely that any fossil fuel project would meet these conditions.  
Unlike most of Canada’s peers, the policy leaves the door open for fossil fuel projects on national security grounds, and further detail is needed on how this will be interpreted. In this year’s World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency was clear that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy are the solution to the current energy crisis, not new investments in oil and gas. 
The new restrictions will impact support for international fossil fuel projects. However, the bulk of public financing for fossil fuels currently supports domestic activity. The Government of Canada has already committed to ending inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by the end of 2023 and to ending all domestic public finance for fossil fuels. This new policy reiterates those commitments, though it does not include a timeline or process for the latter. Given that the federal government has already provided up to CAD $18 billion in traceable support to oil and gas companies so far this year, it is critical that Canada make good on these commitments and phase out support for all fossil fuels – domestically and abroad, without loopholes.   
With this new policy, Canada joins a group of first movers who have implemented the pledge signed at last year’s UN climate conference (COP26) to end their direct international public financing for fossil fuels by the end of 2022 and fully prioritize their public finance for the clean energy transition. The landmark agreement, known as the Glasgow Statement, is the first multilateral commitment to address public finance for oil and gas. If all signatories follow through on their pledge with integrity, it will directly shift $38 billion a year from fossil fuels to clean energy and help direct even larger sums of public and private money away from investments in climate-harming fossil fuels. As the end of 2022 deadline approaches, the United States, Germany, and Italy are the only major signatories missing updated policies. 
Further detail is needed to ensure these funds are shifted to support renewable energy projects that respect and protect human rights, particularly the rights of Indigenous peoples, and uphold the principle of free, prior and informed consent. 
Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada“We welcome Canada’s important step today to restrict public support for the international fossil fuel sector. To fully protect human rights, Canada must phase out all fossil fuels and prioritize a rapid, equitable transition to renewable energy alternatives which do not violate human rights and Indigenous communities in particular.” 
Claire O’Manique, Public Finance Analyst, Oil Change International 
“Oil and gas is usually the elephant in the room in Canadian climate policy. Today’s guidance is a notable break from this norm, and if applied with integrity — including not misusing the national security loophole — it will make a multi-billion dollar dent in our public support for oil and gas. As Minister Wilkinson signalled, an urgent next step is the federal government keeping their promise to end public support for oil and gas at home as well by the end of 2023. In addition, Canada must start using our public finance to support a worker- and community-led just transition away from oil and gas in Canada.” 
Julia Levin, National Climate Program Manager, Environmental Defence Canada 
“We applaud the Government of Canada for showing much-needed climate leadership today. This new policy, if applied with integrity, should end Canada’s track record as one of the worst providers of international fossil finance in the G20 and shift billions towards climate solutions. Now the government must quickly take the final step and end all fossil financing – without any loopholes for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen or CCUS. This will free up billions of dollars to support a fair transition for workers and communities, and set Canada up to thrive as the world moves beyond oil and gas.” 
Vanessa Corkal, Senior Policy Advisor, International Institute for Sustainable Development 
“With this new policy, Canada has taken a vital step forward to align its financial flows with its climate ambition. The government is sending a clear signal: we cannot continue to pour fuel on the fire. Redirecting this support to clean energy will accelerate the global energy transition and support long-term stability and job creation. The next step is to keep this momentum going with the complete phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and domestic public finance in the coming year.” 
Karen Hamilton, Director, Above Ground 
“Today Canada took a significant step forward, by ruling out public financing for some types of oil and gas projects abroad. We’re nonetheless concerned to see that Ottawa is exempting projects that use CCUS, a false climate solution promoted by industry at the expense of the millions, if not billions, of vulnerable people suffering most from the climate emergency. We hope the government revisits that decision, and moves forward with a plan to end public financing for domestic oil and gas activity as well.” 
Tamara Morgenthau, Senior Attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law 
“Canada’s policy is a needed step in the right direction — away from bankrolling destructive fossil fuels and toward financing a renewable energy transition. However, the loopholes it carves out for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage, threaten to undermine this progress and prolong reliance on fossil fuels. To fulfill its human rights and climate change obligations, Canada must follow the science and phase out all fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas – no exceptions.” 
Eddy Pérez, International Climate Diplomacy Director, Climate Action Network – Réseau action climat Canada“Civil society has been fighting for more than a decade for Canada to end its suicidal support to the industry that is putting us in conflict with nature and making us sicker and poorer. Today’s announcement represents a major milestone, and a win against the destructive corporate interests that too often dominate Canada’s policy and investment decisions. Ending international support for oil and gas means we can instead invest in solutions, justice, and partnership instead, and increase support for climate action and biodiversity conservation in the Global South.” 
Émile Boisseau-Bouvier, Climate Policy Analyst, Équiterre“From 2019 to 2021, Canada supported fossil fuels 11 times more than renewables. We can’t meet our climate goals and achieve a successful energy transition if Canadians’ money is funding the problem rather than the solutions. This announcement is a welcome one, as it marks the beginning of a break with the status quo and should ultimately move the country out of its dual posture of being both the firefighter and the arsonist: fighting climate change while funding oil and gas. We are now eagerly awaiting details on ending fossil fuel subsidies within our borders, another major hindrance to the energy transition.”

“We are horrified that the Iranian authorities have executed Mohsen Shekari, less than three weeks after they convicted and sentenced him to death in a grossly unfair sham trial. With the Iranian authorities brutally acting on their public threats to expedite capital proceedings and carry out executions swiftly, we fear that other protesters under death sentences or charged with capital offences are at imminent risk of being sent to their deaths, said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The shocking way Mohsen Shekari’s trial was fast-tracked through Iran’s judicial system without allowing him the chance of a meaningful trial and appeal process is yet another illustration of the fact that the authorities are resorting to the death penalty as a weapon of political repression. The clear aim is to instil fear among the public in a desperate attempt to cling to power and end the popular uprising.” 
The authorities convicted Mohsen Shekari of the vague and overly broad charge of “enmity against God” (moharebeh) in connection with accusations of “blocking a street in Tehran, creating fear and depriving people of freedom and security, and intentionally wounding a security agent with a cold weapon (knife)”, in contravention of international law which requires that the death penalty be used only in the most serious crimes involving intentional killing. 
Given that the Iranian authorities are adamant on continuing their killing spree, both on the streets and through sham trials, it falls on the international community to urgently take action to stop further executions. 
Amnesty International fears that many others in Iran could face the death penalty in relation to the popular uprising, given the thousands of people arrested and indicted. Amnesty International has identified at least 18 others at risk of execution in connection with the protests and at different stages of the criminal justice process. 
The 12 people under sentence of death are: Sahand Nourmohammad-Zadeh, Mahan Sedarat Madani, Manouchehr Mehman Navaz, Mohammad Boroughani, Mohammad Ghobadlou, Saman Seydi, Hamid Ghare Hasanlou, Akbar Ghafarri, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz. 
The six people on trial and/or charged with crimes carrying the death penalty are: Abolfazl Mehri Hossein Hajilou, Mohsen Rezazadeh Gharegholou, Saeed Shirazi, Ebrahim Rahimi, Majidreza Rahnavard, Toomaj Salehi. 
“Given that the Iranian authorities are adamant on continuing their killing spree, both on the streets and through sham trials, it falls on the international community to urgently take action to stop further executions. The international community must go beyond expressions of outrage and condemnation and take all necessary measures to pursue accountability for all officials including those in security, intelligence, prosecutorial and judicial positions involved in crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights, including the right to life. This should include exercising universal jurisdiction to investigate all those suspected of such crimes and issuing arrest warrants when there is sufficient evidence,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
Background 
Even before the uprising began in mid-September, Amnesty International warned of a horrifying spike in executions in Iran, with the authorities killing at least 251 people in the first six months of 2022. The organization opposes the death penalty without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

A group of 18 countries, led by Vanuatu, is formally presenting a resolution to the UN General Assembly on 9 December asking that the UN Court issue an advisory opinion on the rights and obligations of countries under international law in relation to climate change. The resolution is due to be voted on in coming weeks, with a majority required to pass it. 
Marta Schaaf, Amnesty International’s Director of Climate, Economic and Social Justice, and Corporate Accountability Programme said: 
“The initiative to request an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on state obligations regarding climate change will clarify and strengthen the international legal framework and foster the ambitious action required to match the urgency and gravity of the climate crisis. The past year has been wracked by extreme weather events made much more likely by climate change, and reports from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others show immediate action is imperative. 
“A robust advisory opinion from the ICJ can guide this action. The court will not make new legislation but will examine existing international law, particularly environmental law and human rights law, in the light of the scientific consensus on the causes and consequences of climate change. 
By backing the resolution in the UN General Assembly, governments can show their support for tackling the climate crisis and for protecting the human rights of current and future generations. An overwhelming majority of states voting for this resolution would signal international determination to tackle the existential threat of climate change and advance a human rights-based approach to the climate crisis.”

0,Biodiversity: COP15 biodiversity deal a ‘missed opportunity’ to protect Indigenous peoples’ rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/biodiversity-cop15-biodiversity-deal-a-missed-opportunity-to-protect-indigenous-peoples-rights/,"Despite constituting just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples’ lands host 80% of the world’s biodiversity.","The Global Biodiversity Framework agreed at the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in Montreal, which aims to preserve biodiversity globally by calling on states to commit to declaring 30% of the earth protected for conservation by 2030, is a missed opportunity to protect the rights of Indigenous peoples, Amnesty International said today. 
The accord, known as the 30 x 30 agreement, sets significant targets aimed at arresting the alarming decline in biodiversity seen in recent decades. States at COP15, however, fell short of explicitly recognizing Indigenous peoples’ lands and territories as a separate category of conserved area, which ultimately threatens their rights. 
“This COP15 conference offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to set ambitious goals aiming to protect the diversity of flora and fauna on the planet. While the accord contains a number of highly important environmental targets and human rights safeguards, which states will now be held accountable for, it fails to fully protect and uphold Indigenous peoples’ rights,” said Chris Chapman, Amnesty International’s Adviser on Indigenous Rights. 
“In the Global Biodiversity Framework agreed today at COP15, states present at the Conference did not wholly incorporate Indigenous peoples’ demand for their lands and territories to be fully recognized as a category of conserved area, a plea that was intended to protect them from the predations they often experience in areas such as state-run national parks. 
“Consequently, states have failed to fully recognize Indigenous peoples’ immense contribution to conserving biodiversity, putting them at greater risk of human rights violations. 
“The Global Biodiversity Framework negotiated at COP15 only partly acknowledges Indigenous peoples’ outstanding contribution to conservation. Despite constituting just 5% of the world’s population, Indigenous peoples’ lands host 80% of the world’s biodiversity. 
“Over the four years that the accord has been negotiated, the protections of Indigenous peoples’ rights have been much strengthened, thanks to the tireless work of the Indigenous leaders and activists involved. 
“Yet regardless of the safeguards in the document, a number of Indigenous peoples remain opposed to calls to expand protected areas, given the appalling abuses that are committed in such areas in many countries.” 
Biodiversity is an essential element of a healthy environment. In a landmark resolution passed this year, the UN General Assembly agreed to recognize the right to a healthy environment as a human right, in a move that may transform efforts to fight climate change and protect the right to live in dignity for billions of people. Failing to address biodiversity loss will lead to severe repercussions for future generations, who will inherit its irreversible results. 
“Considering the gaps in the framework, monitoring the deal’s implementation and combatting any human rights violations arising from the establishment of protected areas will now prove absolutely crucial,” said Chris Chapman. 
Background 
COP15, which ran from 7-19 December in Montreal, marked the latest conference held to discuss the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity, an agreement adopted in 1992. The talks aimed to set specific goals for 2030 and targets to 2050. 
Amnesty International stresses the urgent need to address the loss of biodiversity as an essential step towards climate justice and to protect the right to live in a safe, clean and sustainable environment.

It’s been 74 years since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) by the UN General Assembly. 
This international document is meant to guarantee the human rights and freedoms of all people, regardless of their race, creed, gender or nationality. It makes clear that “human rights should be protected by the rule of law”. 
While the UDHR was a progressive document at the time, it was not born in a vacuum. The UDHR was brought to life as an attempt by world leaders of the time to prevent a repeat of some of the darkest days in history, which took place during the horrors of World War II. 
Historians have estimated that anywhere between 40-million and 60-million people were killed during that war and yet, despite the subsequent adoption and introduction of the UDHR, and the adoption of several other human rights instruments, new wars as well as long-standing and unresolved conflicts continue to cause pain and suffering to civilians around the world. 
Compounding this problem is the ever-growing deficit in global leadership to envision and reimagine a new value-driven, rights-respecting world order. The international system is clearly in crisis, hardly holding together to decisively resolve many of the mutually reinforcing complex global political and socio-economic challenges the world faces today. 
On 24 February, people across Ukraine woke up to the news that their country was being invaded by Russia’s military. In the middle of the night, Russian tanks rolled into the country and the military attacked from multiple directions, killing civilians and destroying public infrastructure and people’s homes. 
As the war rages on, the sheer scale of human rights violations and crimes under international law that are exposed grows with every passing day. Entire neighbourhoods have been destroyed through disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, with the UN recording nearly eight million Ukrainian refugees across Europe and many more people missing or forcibly transferred to Russian territory. 
In towns such as Bucha, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka and Vorzel, Amnesty International collected evidence and testimony of unlawful killings, including apparent extrajudicial executions. Some victims had their hands tied behind their backs while others showed signs of torture. In further instances of likely crimes against humanity, convoys of civilians fleeing with their children were fired upon. 
The impact of Russia’s war against Ukraine is not contained within Europe. The economic and social rights of millions of people across Africa, and globally, have suffered as a consequence of Russian aggression. 
In Africa, the war has plunged the continent into a deeper economic crisis, which was already struggling, following the disastrous impact of Covid-19 on people’s livelihoods. The significant rise in the cost of oil, of which Russia is the biggest supplier globally, has driven food prices higher, including the cost of staple food such as bread. 
Together, Russia and Ukraine account for almost a third of the world’s wheat exports with African nations among their largest purchasers. According to the World Food Programme, Russia and Ukraine supply 100% of Eritrea’s supplies and 66% of Ethiopia’s wheat. With both countries already facing humanitarian crises, due to armed conflict and drought, things have been worse as a result of a war fought far from their shores.  
In different parts of Africa, people who are trapped in conflicts in countries such as Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan have continued to pay the price of these protracted wars in 2022 and are experiencing full-scale violations of their human rights.  
Again, failed leadership by the UN and the AU has meant war and conflict have become a standard bearer of the rule of law deficit so evident in most of the war-torn parts of the continent. 
For example, in Ethiopia, the conflict in the northern region of Tigray entered its second year in November 2022. Grave human rights violations, including sexual violence, have been a defining feature of the conflict. Multiple forms of sexual violence — including rape, sexual slavery, sexual mutilation and torture — have been perpetrated against Tigrayan women and girls by government forces, their allied militias and by the Eritrean forces that have been fighting alongside the Ethiopian military. 
Similarly, the Tigrayan forces committed grave human rights violations, including sexual violence, against women and girls in the Amhara and Afar regions. As human rights lawyer Brian Kagoro has opined – it has become “a festival of illegalities”! 
In South Sudan, sexual violence has been and continues to be a persistent feature of the conflict that broke out in the country on 15 December 2013. Perpetrators include government security actors, non-state armed groups, militias and armed and unarmed men. Guns are used to facilitate conflict-related sexual violence with impunity by security forces, who threaten women and girls to comply with their sexual demands. 
In the DRC, successive multi-layered armed conflicts have devastated the country since the early 1990s. Congolese and foreign armies as well as non-state armed groups have continued to commit countless crimes under international law throughout 2022, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other grave human rights abuses. The long-proclaimed potential of the DRC to be the final key that unlocks Africa’s development in power, energy, and mineral development has sadly so far remained a stillbirth. 
In Somalia, the ongoing conflict between Somali authorities and the armed group al- Shabaab, which also involves allied regional and international forces including the United States Africa Command (Africom) and the African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) now replaced by the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (Atmis), continues to have a devastating toll on civilians. 
In Mali, thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes and many civilians have been killed amid increased fighting between Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) and Malian armed forces and allied armed groups, as the conflict in northern Mali escalated in June. 
Parties to these conflicts committed war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. The pursuit of justice for victims proved largely to be elusive. 
A centrally discussed concern in Africa, as indeed in other parts of the world, is what author and historian Anne Applebaum coined in her new book as the “seductive lure of authoritarianism” – a drift towards toxic nationalism, populism and despotic abuse of power by leaders of countries operating in concert with others.  
It is self-evident that despotic leaders do not rule alone, they rely on a system – a package of enablers, political allies, bureaucrats and state-controlled media figures to pave the way to support their [mis]rule.  
You can see the cross-border alliance of this project, the copycat behaviour in the enactment of draconian anti-NGO laws from one country to the other, the curtailment of human rights and excessive weaponisation of the law as an instrument of repression, smear campaigns against activists, the abuse of the criminal justice system by means of political persecution in the name of prosecution and the downright colonial-era intimidation tactics by an assortment of state functionaries and their supporting cast.  
These authoritarians use a common playbook – including the promotion and harvesting of fear, undermining of institutions, blaming outsiders for domestic failure, exploiting religion, rewriting history, dividing and conquering, eroding the truth and doing anything to sustain their repression and get away with their crimes. 
These tactics shrink the space for human rights and civil society. To highlight this problem, the Southern African Human Rights Defenders Network meeting in Lusaka in the last week of November, chose this as the theme of their annual human rights summit! 
Across Africa, authorities have escalated their crackdown on peaceful dissent, including the detention of government critics and opposition leaders for speaking out against injustice. Prominent Zimbabwean opposition leader Job Sikhala has been languishing in detention for more than five months without having been found guilty of any crime, after attending the funeral of a political activist. In September, author and activist Tsitsi Dangarembga and fellow protester Julie Barnes were each convicted of “inciting violence” and handed a six-month suspended sentence after they protested economic hardships in 2020. 
In Angola, authorities tightened their grip on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association by preventing civil society meetings from taking place ahead of the general election in August. 
In the DRC, authorities have continued to use the state of siege, which is similar to a state of emergency, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, as a tool to crush dissent. Military and police authorities have used sweeping powers to silence individuals deemed critical of the state of siege, including members of parliament, pro-democracy activists and human rights workers. In April, a military court in Beni convicted 12 activists from the citizen movement Lutte pour le Changement in a shameful attempt to silence critical voices. 
Human rights gains are never given on a silver platter. They are a function of struggle, of organising, not agonising and of resilience and standing up to human rights abusers. 
Against this backdrop, we have also seen positive signs in 2022 that are encouraging for those fighting to promote and ensure the protection of human rights. The global fight against the death penalty is being won, slowly but surely. While an overwhelming majority of countries in the region have not yet abolished the death penalty for all crimes, some including Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, are not carrying out any executions. 
Meanwhile, Zambia has begun the process of doing away with the death penalty through parliament after President Hakainde Hichilema announced in May that the country would be working to abolish this cruel and inhuman form of punishment. 
In Malawi, justice was served in April when a court convicted 12 men over the 2018 killing of MacDonald Masambuka, a person with albinism. 
In another victory for human rights, in South Africa a constitutional court ruling in November provided new protection for human rights defenders and activists against Strategic Litigation against Public Participation (Slapp) suits designed to silence criticism. The court ruled that Slapp suits target activists, journalists, whistleblowers and everyday people who exercise their constitutional rights, including challenging injustice, masquerading as ordinary lawsuits. 
In the second judgment, the constitutional court held that companies that suffer harm to their reputation as a result of defamation may not claim compensation for non-financial losses if the defamatory speech forms part of “public discourse on issues of legitimate public interest”. 
From Tanzania to Uganda, Russia to Sri Lanka, France to Senegal, and Iran to Zimbabwe, state authorities are implementing an expanding array of measures to suppress organised dissent.  
Protesters across the globe are facing a potent mix of pushbacks, with a growing number of laws and other measures to restrict the right to protest, including the misuse of force; “authoritarian legalism” characterised by use, abuse and non-use of the law; the expansion of unlawful mass and targeted surveillance; internet shutdowns and online censorship; smear campaigns; and abuse and stigmatisation. 
As offline space shrinks, we are seeing greater and more organised mobilisation and reclaiming of civic space online through greater digital activism. This included routine online pushback on falsehoods, misinformation and manipulation by an African population embracing digital tools and spaces for activism and social change. 
This year, Amnesty International launched a new global campaign to confront states’ widening and intensifying efforts to erode the right to peaceful assembly. 
Our “Protect the Protest” campaign will challenge attacks on peaceful protest, stand with those targeted, and support the causes of social movements pushing for human rights change.

“The spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Meta’s pursuit of profit 
The legal action claims that Meta promoted speech that led to ethnic violence and killings in Ethiopia by utilizing an algorithm that prioritizes and recommends hateful and violent content on Facebook. The petitioners seek to stop Facebook’s algorithms from recommending such content to Facebook users and compel Meta to create a 200 billion ($1.6 billion USD) victims’ fund. Amnesty International joins six other human rights and legal organizations as interested parties in the case. 
“The spread of dangerous content on Facebook lies at the heart of Meta’s pursuit of profit, as its systems are designed to keep people engaged. This legal action is a significant step in holding Meta to account for its harmful business model,” said Flavia Mwangovya, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director of East Africa, Horn, and Great Lakes Region. 
One of Amnesty’s staff members in the region was targeted as a result of posts on the social media platform. 
“In Ethiopia, the people rely on social media for news and information. Because of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. I saw first-hand how the dynamics on Facebook harmed my own human rights work and hope this case will redress the imbalance,” said Fisseha Tekle, legal advisor at Amnesty International. 
Fisseha Tekle is one of the petitioners bringing the case, after being subjected to a stream of hateful posts on Facebook for his work exposing human rights violations in Ethiopia. An Ethiopian national, he now lives in Kenya, fears for his life and dare not return to Ethiopia to see his family because of the vitriol directed at him on Facebook. 
Because of the hate and disinformation on Facebook, human rights defenders have also become targets of threats and vitriol. 
Fatal failings 
The legal action is also being brought by Abraham Meareg, the son of Meareg Amare, a University Professor at Bahir Dar University in northern Ethiopia, who was hunted down and killed in November 2021, weeks after posts inciting hatred and violence against him spread on Facebook. The case claims that Facebook only removed the hateful posts eight days after Professor Meareg’s killing, more than three weeks after his family had first alerted the company. 
The Court has been informed that Abraham Meareg fears for his safety and is seeking asylum in the United States. His mother who fled to Addis Ababa is severely traumatized and screams every night in her sleep after witnessing her husband’s killing. The family had their home in Bahir Dar seized by regional police. 
The harmful posts targeting Meareg Amare and Fisseha Tekle were not isolated cases.  The legal action alleges Facebook is awash with hateful, inciteful and dangerous posts in the context of the Ethiopia conflict. 
Meta uses engagement-based algorithmic systems to power Facebook’s news feed, ranking, recommendations and groups features, shaping what is seen on the platform. Meta profits when Facebook users stay on the platform as long as possible, by selling more targeted advertising. 
The display of inflammatory content – including that which advocates hatred, constituting incitement to violence, hostility and discrimination – is an effective way of keeping people on the platform longer. As such, the promotion and amplification of this type of content is key to the surveillance-based business model of Facebook. 
Internal studies dating back to 2012 indicated that Meta knew its algorithms could result in serious real-world harms. In 2016, Meta’s own research clearly acknowledged that “our recommendation systems grow the problem” of extremism. 
In September 2022, Amnesty International documented how Meta’s algorithms proactively amplified and promoted content which incited violence, hatred, and discrimination against the Rohingya in Myanmar and substantially increasing the risk of an outbreak of mass violence. 
“From Ethiopia to Myanmar, Meta knew or should have known that its algorithmic systems were fuelling the spread of harmful content leading to serious real-world harms,” said Flavia Mwangovya. 
“Meta has shown itself incapable to act to stem this tsunami of hate. Governments need to step up and enforce effective legislation to rein in the surveillance-based business models of tech companies.” 
Deadly double standards 
The legal action also claims that there is a disparity in Meta’s approach in crisis situations in Africa compared to elsewhere in the world, particularly North America. The company has the capability to implement special adjustments to its algorithms to quickly remove inflammatory content during a crisis. But despite being deployed elsewhere in the world, according to the petitioners none of these adjustments were made during the conflict in Ethiopia, ensuring harmful content continued to proliferate. 
“Meta has failed to adequately invest in content moderation in the Global South 
Internal Meta documents disclosed by whistle-blower Frances Haugen, known as the Facebook Papers, showed that the US $300 billion company also did not have sufficient content moderators who speak local languages. A report by Meta’s Oversight Board also raised concerns that Meta had not invested sufficient resources in moderating content in languages other than English. 
“Meta has failed to adequately invest in content moderation in the Global South, meaning that the spread of hate, violence, and discrimination disproportionally impacts the most marginalized and oppressed communities across the world, and particularly in the Global South.”

But, amid the gloom, there were plenty of good news stories to celebrate this year.  
Throughout 2022, Amnesty’s ongoing campaigning, media and advocacy work contributed to positive outcomes for people all over the world whose human rights were being violated. Individuals unjustly detained were freed from prison. Human rights abusers were held accountable. Vital legislation and resolutions were passed by governments at national and international level. Progress towards the global abolition of the death penalty continued. And important advances were made both for the rights of women and LGBTI people. 
Here’s a round-up of human rights wins in 2022.  
Amnesty’s ongoing work for individuals helped secure the release of people across the world, delivered justice for families, and held abusers accountable.  
In January, university lecturer Professor Faizullah Jalal was released after being arbitrarily arrested and detained by the Taliban.  
Hejaaz Hizbullah, a Sri Lankan lawyer and Amnesty prisoner of conscience, was granted bail in February after almost two years of pre-trial detention under Sri Lanka’s draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). Two other detainees held under the PTA, Ahnaf  Mohamed Imran and Divaniya Mukunthan, were also released on bail in August and September respectively.  
In Honduras, the “Guapinol eight”, a group of water rights defenders and prisoners of conscience, were unconditionally released in February, after spending more than two years in prison for their human rights work. 
The following month, in neighbouring Guatemala, Indigenous Mayan environmentalist and prisoner of conscience Bernardo Caal Xol was released early after being jailed on bogus charges related to his activism. More than half a million actions were taken on his behalf during Amnesty’s 2021 Write for Rights campaign.  
Elsewhere, Magai Matiop Ngong — for whom more than 700,00 actions were taken during Write for Rights 2019 — was released from prison in South Sudan in March, having been sentenced to death at the age of 15 in 2017.   
August saw the release of schoolteacher Hriday Chandra Mondal, who was detained for discussing the difference between science and religion in his classes. All charges against him were subsequently dropped.  
In May, 18-year-old Palestinian Amal Nakhleh, who suffers from a chronic autoimmune disorder, was released from Israeli administrative detention following 16 months of campaigning by Amnesty and others. 
In July, a Russian court acquitted Yulia Tsvetkova of “production and dissemination of pornographic materials” over her body-positive drawings of vaginas that were published online.  
Following an Urgent Action by Amnesty, Maldivian activist Rusthum Mujuthaba, who was being held on blasphemy charges in relation to a social media post, was released from prison in August.  
Palestinian national Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari was released from prison in Saudi Arabia in October after spending more than three years in arbitrary detention along with his son, Dr. Hani al-Khudari. Both men were handed down prison sentences based on trumped-up charges. Dr. Hani al-Khudari remains in prison despite the expiry of his sentence in February and Amnesty continues to campaign for his release.  
Six Palestinian men who reported that they had been tortured in Palestinian Authority prisons were released on bail within two weeks of Amnesty’s intervention in November.     
Thanks to the support of Amnesty Argentina, a Ukrainian family was able to escape the war and settle in the country in November. A short film documenting their story is available here.  
In Yemen, journalist Younis Abdelsalam was released in December after being arbitrarily detained for over a year for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression.  
In Malawi, justice was served in April when a court convicted 12 men over the 2018 killing of MacDonald Masambuka, a person with albinism.  
In June, partial justice was finally delivered for the 2016 murder of environmental and Indigenous rights activist Berta Cáceres, as David Castillo was sentenced to prison for co-authoring her killing. Amnesty continues its campaign to bring others suspected of responsibility for Berta’s murder to justice.  
After pressure from the US authorities, and following a visit by President Biden to Israel, the Israeli Defense Ministry agreed in October to pay compensation to the family of Palestinian-American Omar As’ad, who died after Israeli soldiers ill-treated him at a checkpoint in January.  
In November, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation informed the Israeli government that it would conduct an investigation into the May killing of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh by an Israeli soldier.    
In December, a Lebanese judge indicted five State Security members on charges of torture in the case of Syrian refugee Bashar Abdel Saud, who died in custody in August.  
Amnesty’s campaign for the global abolition of the death penalty saw further success in 2022, as a string of countries abolished or took significant steps towards abolishing the punishment.   
The abolition of the death penalty for all crimes came into force in Kazakhstan in January. Papua Guinea followed suit in April, repealing the punishment 30 years on from its reintroduction.  
Via social media, Zambia’s President announced in May that the country would begin the process of abandoning the death penalty and, in June, Malaysia’s government initiated the process of removing the mandatory death sentence for 11 offences.  
In September, a new law which removed death penalty provisions from the penal code in Equatorial Guinea came into effect. 
Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that have not yet abolished the death penalty for all crimes, including Kenya, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe, continued to carry out no executions.  
At both national and international level, Amnesty’s work was vital in helping secure the passage of essential legislation and resolutions, as well as ensuring that companies were held accountable for their human rights responsibilities.  
National  
There were important wins on Refugee and Migrants’ Rights in the U.S. For example, in March, the Department of Homeland Security announced the designation of Afghanistan for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The move offers protection from deportation to Afghans without visa status and in the U.S. before March 15, 2022, allaying immediate fears of a return to a Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Amnesty USA is Campaigning for a bill that would provide a path to citizenship for Afghans seeking safety, the Afghan Adjustment Act.  
In a win for the protection and promotion of the right to freedom of expression in May, the Supreme Court of India suspended the 152-year-old sedition law.  
The government of Sierra Leone drafted a new mental health bill in June that is more aligned with international human rights standards than the outdated and discriminatory ‘Lunacy Act’ of 1902. This was a central call in Amnesty’s May 2021 report focusing on the issue.  
In Niger, the country’s parliament adopted amendments to the cybercrime law in June that lifted prison sentences for libel and insults. The law had been routinely used to target and arbitrarily detain human rights defenders, activists and journalists.  
In the US, legislation on gun violence long campaigned for by Amnesty USA and partners was adopted, with the passage of the Safer Communities Act in June. The legislation provides an additional $250 million for community violence interruption (CVI) programs.  
Amnesty saw impact from our work on children in conflict zones in Niger, including increased UN monitoring of the situation. In July, the UN Secretary-General called on his Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict to “promote enhanced monitoring capacity in the Central Sahel region”, which would cover the tri-border region of Niger, which was one of the main recommendations of our September 2021 report.  
Throughout the year, Amnesty also saw some businesses take their human rights obligations more seriously. 
Following Amnesty’s request, the authorities of Sierra Leone asked the Meya mining company operating in Kono district to respond to our concerns about the negative impact of its activities on local people. The company replied that it was engaged in various actions to improve the safety of populations and access to drinking water for communities.   
Amnesty’s investigation into the aviation fuel supply chain linked to war crimes in Myanmar played a role in several companies announcing their withdrawal from jet fuel sales to the country, where shipments risk being used by the Myanmar military to carry out deadly air strikes. The companies included Puma Energy, which announced its exit less than two weeks after being presented with Amnesty’s findings. Thai Oil and Norwegian shipping agent Wilhelmsen also confirmed they would pull back from the supply chain, with more expected to follow.  
International  
Following Amnesty’s report, in March, UN Special Rapporteur (SR) Michael Lynk said that Israel is practising apartheid, followed by UN SR Balakrishnan Rajagopal in July, joining a growing chorus of expert assessments.    
In April, the European Union reached political agreement on the Digital Services Act (DSA), a landmark regulatory framework that will, among other things, require Big Tech platforms to assess and manage systemic risks posed by their services, such as advocacy of hatred and the spread of disinformation.  
Important progress was made on environmental justice, with the passage of a resolution at the UN General Assembly in July recognising the right to a healthy environment. The news followed a similar resolution passed by the UN Human Rights Council at the end of 2021.  
In July, ten European countries: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden rejected the Israeli Defense Ministry designation of seven Palestinian civil society organizations as “terrorist” and “illegitimate”. The US government expressed its concern when the Israeli military raided the offices of the organizations in August, and UN experts condemned the Israeli attacks on Palestinian civil society in October.  
At its 51st session, the UN Human Rights Council released a special resolution on Afghanistan in September. Amnesty suggested the inclusion of a call for the UN Special Rapporteur to prepare a thematic report on the situation of women and girls. Several countries supported the idea, and it was included in the final resolution.   
In October, the UN Human Rights Council renewed the mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela — a key independent international mechanism actively investigating and regularly reporting on past and ongoing international crimes and other human rights violations — until September 2024. And, in November, the Human Rights Council passed a landmark resolution to establish a new fact-finding mission to investigate alleged human rights violations in Iran related to the ongoing nationwide protests that began on 16 September 2022.  
The mandate of the OHCHR’s Sri Lanka Accountability Project was extended for a further two-year period in October. The project has a mandate to collect and preserve evidence for future accountability processes — a key aspect of ensuring pressure remains on the Sri Lankan government to remedy and stop both historical and current human rights violations.  
The year saw a number of victories for women’s rights, with Amnesty at the forefront.  
In the latest progress on sexual and reproductive rights in Latin America, Colombia decriminalized abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy in February. The news followed the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020 and the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico 2021.  
In May, the lower chamber of Spain’s parliament passed a bill containing important measures to prevent and prosecute rape. Finland’s parliament passed similar measures in June, adopting reforms that make lack of consent key to defining rape. Finland also passed reforms in October that eased the strictest abortion laws in the Nordic region.  
September saw the acquittal of Miranda Ruiz, a doctor who had been unjustly prosecuted in Argentina for having guaranteed a legal abortion.    
Amnesty contributed to some notable wins for LGBTI rights throughout 2022.  
In an important affirmation of transgender individuals’ rights to dignity, happiness and family life, South Korea’s Supreme Court ruled that having children of minor age should not immediately be the reason to refuse to recognize the legal gender of transgender persons.  
In July, same-sex marriage became legal in Switzerland, after almost two-thirds of the population voted in favour of it in a referendum. Slovenia followed suit in October, legalising same-sex marriage after a constitutional court ruling.   
A ban on the award-winning film Joyland, which features a transgender person as a central character, was reversed in Pakistan in November.

0,Peru: Crisis in the country must be addressed with full respect for human rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/peru-protests-human-rights/,Amnesty International is calling on Peruvian authorities to respect demonstrators' right to peaceful protest.,"The Peruvian authorities must refrain from using excessive force in response to the demonstrations spreading across the country and guarantee the rights to peaceful protest and freedom of expression, Amnesty International said today, after confirming at least two deaths and dozens of injuries yesterday. 
Romario Quispe Garfias, 18, and another 15-year-old boy were killed yesterday in Andahuaylas, in the context of a political crisis that has generated protests in different areas of the country since 7 December, while the media reported that two more people died in protests today. Dozens of people, including civilians and police officers, have also been injured by firearms and blunt objects. 
In addition, the National Association of Journalists of Peru recorded attacks on 21 journalists in Lima, Apurímac, Huaura, Arequipa and Puno while covering the protests between 7 and 11 December. Amnesty International has received information of other events in which the environment of violence hinders the practice of journalism and puts at risk the work and the right to inform and be informed. The aggressions range from the excessive use of force by the National Police to demonstrators committing aggressions, insults and attempting to strip journalists of their work equipment. 
“State repression against protesters is only deepening the crisis in Peru. The authorities must put an end to the excessive use of force against demonstrations and guarantee the right to peaceful protest, using the legal and proportional means necessary to restore citizen security. Moreover, to prevent further escalation of violence, we urge the authorities to seek dialogue and put human rights at the heart of their response to the crisis,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.   
‘The human rights of all people must come above any political interest. The solution to this crisis cannot involve more violence. The authorities must put the protection of the population before any political interest.’ 
Amnesty International has verified images of police firing tear gas canisters from close range directly at the bodies of protesters in Plaza San Martin in Lima. Force should not be used except when strictly necessary, in a proportional manner and for a legitimate purpose, which should then be subject to a process of accountability. In situations of violence, security forces must individualize the response to those responsible for generating disturbances or endangering the life and integrity of others. 
Amnesty International reminds the authorities that a protest does not lose its peaceful character because of sporadic acts or unlawful behavior by individuals. Therefore, the respect, guarantee and protection of the human rights of those who demonstrate peacefully must not be diminished. State security forces should also prioritize the peaceful resolution of the situation and avoid using force in ways that contravene international standards. 
The Peruvian authorities must promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigate all allegations of human rights violations in the context of the current crisis. Amnesty International is particularly concerned that the Police Protection Law (No. 3110), which has been in force since March 2020, leaves open the possibility for excessive use of force by the National Police to go unpunished, in contravention of Peru’s obligations under international law. 
Amnesty International reiterates its call for unrestricted respect for human rights and for the authorities to deploy all available resources to resolve this conflict through dialogue, listening to all voices and stopping the repression in order to avoid more deaths and human rights violations. 
The authorities must also use all available resources to safeguard the life and integrity of all injured persons, guaranteeing them immediate, timely and adequate medical attention. Likewise, they must provide the necessary support to the families of the deceased. 
“The human rights of all people must come above any political interest. The solution to this crisis cannot involve more violence. The authorities must put the protection of the population before any political interest,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru.

“The horrific public execution of Majidreza Rahnavard today exposes Iran’s judiciary for what it is: a tool of repression sending individuals to the gallows to spread fear and exacting revenge on protesters daring to stand up to the status quo. The arbitrary execution of Majidreza Rahnavard less than two weeks after his only court hearing lays bare the extent of the Iranian authorities’ assault on the right to life and their disregard for even maintaining a façade of meaningful judicial proceedings. 
“We urge the international community to take all necessary measures to pressure the Iranian authorities to stop executions and quash death sentences. 
Amnesty International further urges all states to exercise universal jurisdiction over all officials reasonably suspected of criminal responsibility for crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights.” 
Background 
Majidreza Rahnavard’s unfair trial consisted of just one session before a ‘Revolutionary Court’ in Mashhad, Khorasan-e Razavi province, on 29 November. He was charged with “enmity against God” (moharebeh). 
The authorities accused him of fatally stabbing two Basij agents in Mashhad on 17 November. Before his court session, state media broadcast videos of Majidreza Rahnavard giving forced “confessions”. His heavily bandaged left arm could be seen in a cast, raising serious concerns that he was subjected to torture. 
Amnesty International has identified 20 people at risk of execution in connection with the protests. They include: 
The horrific public execution of Majidreza Rahnavard today exposes Iran’s judiciary for what it is: a tool of repression sending individuals to the gallows to spread fear… 
Thousands have been arrested and indicted, raising fears that many more people could face the death penalty in connection to protests. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the individual, or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

0,Iran: Authorities covering up their crimes of child killings by coercing families into silence,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/iran-authorities-covering-up-their-crimes-of-child-killings-by-coercing-families-into-silence/,"The Iranian authorities’ arbitrary arrest, intimidation and harassment of relatives of children, unlawfully gunned down or beaten to death by security forces in connection with protests, exposes their inconceivable cruelty and sinister attempt to cover up their crimes, said Amnesty International...","The Iranian authorities’ arbitrary arrest, intimidation and harassment of relatives of children, unlawfully gunned down or beaten to death by security forces in connection with protests, exposes their inconceivable cruelty and sinister attempt to cover up their crimes, said Amnesty International today.    
In updated research, Amnesty International has documented how the unlawful killings of children by Iran’s security forces continue unabated, detailing the names and details of at least 44 children and the heartless violence inflicted upon their families.    
The authorities have been killing children in a bid to crush the spirit of resistance among the country’s youth and retain their iron grip on power at any cost. 
“The authorities have not only condemned families of children killed to a lifetime of inconsolable sadness, but they have also inflicted extreme mental anguish upon them through cruel restrictions on burials, commemorations and relentless intimidation aimed at enforcing silence. These practices violate the absolute prohibition on cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The recent establishment of a UN fact-finding mission to collect, consolidate and analyse evidence of such violations sends a clear message to the Iranian authorities that they can no longer commit crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights without fear of consequences. Amnesty International now urges all states to exercise universal jurisdiction to criminally investigate Iranian officials involved in militarized attacks on demonstrators, including children.” 
Amnesty International’s research has shown that Iran’s security forces shot 34 of the identified child victims with live ammunition in the heart, head or other vital organs. At least four were killed by metal pellets unlawfully fired by the security forces at close range. Five other children, four girls and one boy, died from injuries consistent with fatal beatings, and one girl was killed after being struck on the head with a tear gas canister. The recorded child victims include 39 boys, aged between two and 17, and five girls, three of whom were 16 years old, one 17 years old, and one aged six. 
Children represent 14% of overall deaths of protesters and bystanders recorded by Amnesty International, which exceeds 300 since the protests erupted. Our investigations into killings by security forces continue and the number of those killed, including children, is believed to be higher (For more information on the organization’s methodology, see here). 
The Iranian authorities have routinely harassed and intimidated the families of child victims to coerce them into silence or to force them to accept narratives absolving authorities of responsibility for the deaths of their loved ones in written statements or video recordings broadcast on state television. Amnesty International has identified such practices against the relatives of at least 13 child victims. Information obtained by the organization from informed sources indicates that security forces subjected them to coercion including arbitrary arrest and detention, threats to bury the bodies of their loved ones in unidentified location, and threats to kill, rape, detain or otherwise harm bereaved parents and their surviving children. 
The father of Koumar Daroftadeh, a 16-year-old boy killed by live ammunition said on 13 November in an interview with Radio Farda, an independent media outlet: 
“They [security and intelligence agents] summoned me and told me that I should say whatever they dictate to me… The authorities killed my son and must be held accountable. 
Security and intelligence agents often threatened not to return the bodies of child victims for burial unless families commit, in writing, to remaining silent and observing restrictions on funeral and memorial ceremonies. 
In some cases, officials prepared the bodies of victims for burial without notifying families, then handed them the bodies, wrapped in shrouds, minutes before the scheduled burial, denying families their right to wash and prepare their loved ones for burial in accordance with their own religious and cultural traditions. 
Other restrictions included forcing families to bury their loved ones in remote villages, banning the use of word “martyr” and prohibiting relatives from hanging large memorial banners or sharing images of victims and funeral posters on social media. 
The Iranian authorities have publicly denied responsibility for the killing of at least 19 of the child victims. They have blamed 12 of these deaths on attacks by either “hired terrorists” or “unknown persons”, attributed three to suicidal or accidental falls from heights, one to a suicidal or accidental drug overdose, one to a dog bite, one to a motorcycle accident and another to a stampede. 
For nine other children, all from the oppressed Baluchi minority, the authorities have questioned their deaths, claiming in their reports to member states of the UN Human Rights Council that “there is no death record” for the children concerned in the Sistan and Baluchistan province. 
Over 60% of the children killed were from Iran’s oppressed Baluchi and Kurdish minorities. These communities have long suffered from systemic discrimination and persecution by the authorities.  
A family member of a child unlawfully killed in Sistan and Baluchistan told Amnesty International: 
“They did not pay any attention to us. They [Iranian authorities] do not consider us [Baluchis] human. There are many witnesses [to the killings], but their testimonies are worthless against the Islamic Republic because the authorities do not accept them.” 
Of the 44 recorded child victims, 18, which amounts to 40%, belonged to Iran’s oppressed Baluchi minority. Thirteen of them were killed by security forces on 30 September in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan province, during the deadliest day of the authorities’ crackdown on the protests, widely known to Iranians as “Bloody Friday”. 
Ten of the children killed, which amounts to 20%, were from the Kurdish minority and were killed in eight cities or towns in the Kurdish populated provinces of Kurdistan, Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan. 
The remaining 16 child victims were killed in six other provinces across Iran. 
“The authorities have been killing children in a bid to crush the spirit of resistance among the country’s youth and retain their iron grip on power at any cost. And yet despite that, many children have courageously continued to take to the streets in search of a future without political oppression and inequality,” said Heba Morayef.

0,Amnesty International Canada launches 2022 Human Rights Agenda,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/amnesty-international-canada-launches-2022-human-rights-agenda/,The organization’s annual report on the state of human rights in Canada was released one day before UN Human Rights Day.,"Amnesty International Canada released its annual report on the state of human rights in Canada on Friday, one day before UN Human Rights Day. 
In its 2022 Human Rights Agenda, the organization reviews Canada’s domestic performance over the past year against its international human rights commitments and lays out concrete, actionable steps to bring the country’s human rights record in line with its obligations. 
The report is launching at a pivotal juncture for Canada, as the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, and surging anti-rights movements increasingly threaten people’s fundamental rights and their well-being, both in this country and abroad. 
‘Public pledges and investments are insufficient markers of human rights protection. They demand robust, sustained, and measurable implementation. Only the lived experience of those whose rights are most at risk can tell us the full story and whether progress was indeed made.’ 
“Canada’s numerous, eloquent commitments to reconciliation with First Nations, Métis, and Inuit Peoples, ending racial discrimination, climate change, and refugee protection must be commended. But these are far from enough,” Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-speaking Section), wrote in the report’s introduction. 
“Public pledges and investments are insufficient markers of human rights protection. They demand robust, sustained, and measurable implementation. Only the lived experience of those whose rights are most at risk can tell us the full story and whether progress was indeed made.” 
This year’s Human Rights Agenda focuses on five distinct but related priorities highlighted in Amnesty International Canada’s Strategic Plan 2022-2030. They are: the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Discrimination and Racial Justice; Gender Justice; People on the Move: Refugee and Migrants Rights; and Climate Justice and Corporate Accountability. By applying an intersectional lens, the report’s authors champion an approach to policy-making that not only respects but reflectsthe intersecting identities of right-holders, especially people belonging to historically marginalized groups. 
Nivyabandi pointed to climate change as a disproportionate threat to people and groups whose rights are already at risk. “We cannot truly understand climate change without unpacking its heightened impacts on Indigenous communities, women and 2SLGBTQIA+ people, immigrants and refugees, and people with disabilities,” she said on Friday. “Canada’s response to climate change must put their experiences, their interests, and ultimately, their rights first.” 
While the report shines a light on continuing human rights violations, it also recognizes victories that human rights defenders in Canada celebrated in 2022. For example, Canada edged closer to eliminating the cruel, discriminatory practice of immigration detention after four provinces – British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Alberta, and Manitoba – separately announced that they would stop holding migrants detained by the Canada Border Services Agency in provincial jails. 
“Jailing newcomers simply for seeking a better life in Canada is cruel, unnecessary, and it disproportionately targets over-policed groups such as Black men,” said Nivyabandi, echoing the findings of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada’s joint 2021 report “I Didn’t Feel Like a Human in There:” Immigration Detention in Canada and Its Impact on Mental Health. “We thank provincial leaders for stepping back from this abhorrent practice and urge the Canadian government to do the same.” 
The release of the 2022 Human Rights Agenda comes as Amnesty International supporters across Canada gather in person to participate in the global movement’s signature letter-writing event. Centred around UN Human Rights Day on December 10, Write for Rights sees thousands of groups in more than 200 countries and territories take millions of actions in support of people whose rights are under attack. 
In years past, dozens of Write-A-Thons – lively events where activists gather to write letters, sign petitions, enjoy music and refreshments, and listen to inspiring guest speakers – took place in communities across Canada. However, in 2020 and 2021, those gatherings were cancelled or migrated online because of COVID-19 restrictions. 
“Defending human rights, at its core, is about people joining together and harnessing their collective power to counter injustice,” Nivyabandi said. “Gathering online can be an effective tool to spur change, but it is not the same experience as the intimacy and immediacy of getting together in person, sharing stories, and acting as a group. That is where empathy thrives and momentum grows unstoppable.”

Today the Government of Canada released a plan to end new public finance for fossil fuels abroad and instead prioritize clean energy projects. The policy, which comes into effect on January 1, 2023, marks a critical first step towards eliminating Canada’s massive levels of support for oil and gas and aligning federal support with a climate-safe future. 
The new policy applies across all federal departments, agencies and Crown corporations but will predominantly impact Export Development Canada (EDC), a Crown corporation with a long history of funneling billions in support to the oil and gas industry. This new policy will end a significant portion of EDC’s support for fossil fuels and redirect those funds to support the clean energy transition. 
Although the policy contains some exceptions for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the policy lays out a number of robust conditions that projects must meet. Any project receiving support must align with a pathway consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5°C. If applied with integrity, it is unlikely that any fossil fuel project would meet these conditions.  
Unlike most of Canada’s peers, the policy leaves the door open for fossil fuel projects on national security grounds, and further detail is needed on how this will be interpreted. In this year’s World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency was clear that investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy are the solution to the current energy crisis, not new investments in oil and gas. 
The new restrictions will impact support for international fossil fuel projects. However, the bulk of public financing for fossil fuels currently supports domestic activity. The Government of Canada has already committed to ending inefficient fossil fuel subsidies by the end of 2023 and to ending all domestic public finance for fossil fuels. This new policy reiterates those commitments, though it does not include a timeline or process for the latter. Given that the federal government has already provided up to CAD $18 billion in traceable support to oil and gas companies so far this year, it is critical that Canada make good on these commitments and phase out support for all fossil fuels – domestically and abroad, without loopholes.   
With this new policy, Canada joins a group of first movers who have implemented the pledge signed at last year’s UN climate conference (COP26) to end their direct international public financing for fossil fuels by the end of 2022 and fully prioritize their public finance for the clean energy transition. The landmark agreement, known as the Glasgow Statement, is the first multilateral commitment to address public finance for oil and gas. If all signatories follow through on their pledge with integrity, it will directly shift $38 billion a year from fossil fuels to clean energy and help direct even larger sums of public and private money away from investments in climate-harming fossil fuels. As the end of 2022 deadline approaches, the United States, Germany, and Italy are the only major signatories missing updated policies. 
Further detail is needed to ensure these funds are shifted to support renewable energy projects that respect and protect human rights, particularly the rights of Indigenous peoples, and uphold the principle of free, prior and informed consent. 
Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada“We welcome Canada’s important step today to restrict public support for the international fossil fuel sector. To fully protect human rights, Canada must phase out all fossil fuels and prioritize a rapid, equitable transition to renewable energy alternatives which do not violate human rights and Indigenous communities in particular.” 
Claire O’Manique, Public Finance Analyst, Oil Change International 
“Oil and gas is usually the elephant in the room in Canadian climate policy. Today’s guidance is a notable break from this norm, and if applied with integrity — including not misusing the national security loophole — it will make a multi-billion dollar dent in our public support for oil and gas. As Minister Wilkinson signalled, an urgent next step is the federal government keeping their promise to end public support for oil and gas at home as well by the end of 2023. In addition, Canada must start using our public finance to support a worker- and community-led just transition away from oil and gas in Canada.” 
Julia Levin, National Climate Program Manager, Environmental Defence Canada 
“We applaud the Government of Canada for showing much-needed climate leadership today. This new policy, if applied with integrity, should end Canada’s track record as one of the worst providers of international fossil finance in the G20 and shift billions towards climate solutions. Now the government must quickly take the final step and end all fossil financing – without any loopholes for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen or CCUS. This will free up billions of dollars to support a fair transition for workers and communities, and set Canada up to thrive as the world moves beyond oil and gas.” 
Vanessa Corkal, Senior Policy Advisor, International Institute for Sustainable Development 
“With this new policy, Canada has taken a vital step forward to align its financial flows with its climate ambition. The government is sending a clear signal: we cannot continue to pour fuel on the fire. Redirecting this support to clean energy will accelerate the global energy transition and support long-term stability and job creation. The next step is to keep this momentum going with the complete phaseout of fossil fuel subsidies and domestic public finance in the coming year.” 
Karen Hamilton, Director, Above Ground 
“Today Canada took a significant step forward, by ruling out public financing for some types of oil and gas projects abroad. We’re nonetheless concerned to see that Ottawa is exempting projects that use CCUS, a false climate solution promoted by industry at the expense of the millions, if not billions, of vulnerable people suffering most from the climate emergency. We hope the government revisits that decision, and moves forward with a plan to end public financing for domestic oil and gas activity as well.” 
Tamara Morgenthau, Senior Attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law 
“Canada’s policy is a needed step in the right direction — away from bankrolling destructive fossil fuels and toward financing a renewable energy transition. However, the loopholes it carves out for fossil gas, fossil hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage, threaten to undermine this progress and prolong reliance on fossil fuels. To fulfill its human rights and climate change obligations, Canada must follow the science and phase out all fossil fuels, coal, oil, and gas – no exceptions.” 
Eddy Pérez, International Climate Diplomacy Director, Climate Action Network – Réseau action climat Canada“Civil society has been fighting for more than a decade for Canada to end its suicidal support to the industry that is putting us in conflict with nature and making us sicker and poorer. Today’s announcement represents a major milestone, and a win against the destructive corporate interests that too often dominate Canada’s policy and investment decisions. Ending international support for oil and gas means we can instead invest in solutions, justice, and partnership instead, and increase support for climate action and biodiversity conservation in the Global South.” 
Émile Boisseau-Bouvier, Climate Policy Analyst, Équiterre“From 2019 to 2021, Canada supported fossil fuels 11 times more than renewables. We can’t meet our climate goals and achieve a successful energy transition if Canadians’ money is funding the problem rather than the solutions. This announcement is a welcome one, as it marks the beginning of a break with the status quo and should ultimately move the country out of its dual posture of being both the firefighter and the arsonist: fighting climate change while funding oil and gas. We are now eagerly awaiting details on ending fossil fuel subsidies within our borders, another major hindrance to the energy transition.”

“We are horrified that the Iranian authorities have executed Mohsen Shekari, less than three weeks after they convicted and sentenced him to death in a grossly unfair sham trial. With the Iranian authorities brutally acting on their public threats to expedite capital proceedings and carry out executions swiftly, we fear that other protesters under death sentences or charged with capital offences are at imminent risk of being sent to their deaths, said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The shocking way Mohsen Shekari’s trial was fast-tracked through Iran’s judicial system without allowing him the chance of a meaningful trial and appeal process is yet another illustration of the fact that the authorities are resorting to the death penalty as a weapon of political repression. The clear aim is to instil fear among the public in a desperate attempt to cling to power and end the popular uprising.” 
The authorities convicted Mohsen Shekari of the vague and overly broad charge of “enmity against God” (moharebeh) in connection with accusations of “blocking a street in Tehran, creating fear and depriving people of freedom and security, and intentionally wounding a security agent with a cold weapon (knife)”, in contravention of international law which requires that the death penalty be used only in the most serious crimes involving intentional killing. 
Given that the Iranian authorities are adamant on continuing their killing spree, both on the streets and through sham trials, it falls on the international community to urgently take action to stop further executions. 
Amnesty International fears that many others in Iran could face the death penalty in relation to the popular uprising, given the thousands of people arrested and indicted. Amnesty International has identified at least 18 others at risk of execution in connection with the protests and at different stages of the criminal justice process. 
The 12 people under sentence of death are: Sahand Nourmohammad-Zadeh, Mahan Sedarat Madani, Manouchehr Mehman Navaz, Mohammad Boroughani, Mohammad Ghobadlou, Saman Seydi, Hamid Ghare Hasanlou, Akbar Ghafarri, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz, Unnamed – Alborz. 
The six people on trial and/or charged with crimes carrying the death penalty are: Abolfazl Mehri Hossein Hajilou, Mohsen Rezazadeh Gharegholou, Saeed Shirazi, Ebrahim Rahimi, Majidreza Rahnavard, Toomaj Salehi. 
“Given that the Iranian authorities are adamant on continuing their killing spree, both on the streets and through sham trials, it falls on the international community to urgently take action to stop further executions. The international community must go beyond expressions of outrage and condemnation and take all necessary measures to pursue accountability for all officials including those in security, intelligence, prosecutorial and judicial positions involved in crimes under international law and other grave violations of human rights, including the right to life. This should include exercising universal jurisdiction to investigate all those suspected of such crimes and issuing arrest warrants when there is sufficient evidence,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
Background 
Even before the uprising began in mid-September, Amnesty International warned of a horrifying spike in executions in Iran, with the authorities killing at least 251 people in the first six months of 2022. The organization opposes the death penalty without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

A group of 18 countries, led by Vanuatu, is formally presenting a resolution to the UN General Assembly on 9 December asking that the UN Court issue an advisory opinion on the rights and obligations of countries under international law in relation to climate change. The resolution is due to be voted on in coming weeks, with a majority required to pass it. 
Marta Schaaf, Amnesty International’s Director of Climate, Economic and Social Justice, and Corporate Accountability Programme said: 
“The initiative to request an International Court of Justice advisory opinion on state obligations regarding climate change will clarify and strengthen the international legal framework and foster the ambitious action required to match the urgency and gravity of the climate crisis. The past year has been wracked by extreme weather events made much more likely by climate change, and reports from the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and others show immediate action is imperative. 
“A robust advisory opinion from the ICJ can guide this action. The court will not make new legislation but will examine existing international law, particularly environmental law and human rights law, in the light of the scientific consensus on the causes and consequences of climate change. 
By backing the resolution in the UN General Assembly, governments can show their support for tackling the climate crisis and for protecting the human rights of current and future generations.

Their tragic deaths by an alleged serial killer is yet another source of massive grief for Indigenous communities across Canada, whose long-called for end to colonial violence, classism, racism and misogyny is still not met with an adequate government or broader community response. These deaths must not be ignored, nor the reality that they represent the ongoing generational harms and trauma that are rooted in violence against Indigenous women, girls, and Two Spirit people, and we remain firm in supporting First Nations, Metis, and Inuit communities and advocates in their demands to fully implement the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+’s 231 Calls for Justice. Amnesty’s complete joint statement with organizations and advocates across Canada is below. 
Image description: Families of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls and Two Spirit people, and supporters gather for the Sisters in Spirit vigils on unceded Territory of the Anishinaabe Algonquin Nation (Ottawa) on October 4, 2022. 
December 6, 2022 – As we observe the 16 Days of Activism on Gender-Based Violence and the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, the announcement of charges in the murder of four Indigenous women at the hands of an alleged serial killer linked to white supremacist ideology is a tragic indication that the urgent action long called for by Indigenous women, families, and communities to address the ongoing genocide of Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people has not been taken. 
As organizations and advocates working to end violence against women, girls, Two-Spirit and gender-diverse people, we stand in solidarity with the families, friends, and loved ones of Marcedes Myran and Morgan Harris, both of Long Plain First Nation, of Rebecca Contois of Crane River First Nation, and of Buffalo Woman, and we extend our condolences to all those mourning their loss in Winnipeg, Treaty No. 1 Territory, the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dene, and Dakota, and Homeland of the Métis Nation. We echo the calls of Indigenous advocates and organizations for immediate and concrete action to better implement the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+’s 231 Calls for Justice and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. We commit to reflecting this urgent need for action that centers the lives of Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people in our own work. 
Indications that the alleged killer held white supremacist, misogynistic, and anti-semitic beliefs are reminders of the pressing and very real violence with which Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people have contended continues. We join with others in pressing for a full investigation of racism and hate as motivations for these murders. To do so would be to honour and respect the truths many families shared during the National Inquiry about the ongoing and increasingly hostile and extreme forms of intersecting gender and race-based hate and violence they are regularly subjected to, and in keeping with the Calls for Justice. 
As the Final Report of the National Inquiry makes clear all levels of government, as well as all sectors, institutions, organizations, and the general public, particularly those operating from a colonial framework who deliver services to Indigenous women and gender-diverse people, must be actively involved in the implementation of the Calls for Justice. In particular, we want to highlight the clear directions put forward in the Calls for Justice that action and funding must prioritize access to the basic necessities for safety (Calls for Justice, 4.1, 4.2), including affordable food, housing (4.6), and transportation (4.8), shelters (4.7), and transfer of control and resources for the delivery of Indigenous-led services (e.g. 2.5, 3.2). The continued and active exclusion of Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people from such basic human rights and services that many Canadians take for granted enables both individual and systemic violence against them. 
The National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice, along with countless other reports and recommendations put forward over many years, clearly outline the steps that need to be taken to not only commit in principle but to take action and dedicate resources necessary to dismantling colonial systems, policies, practices, and relationships that continue to devalue the lives of Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people. As the families of the four women have expressed over the past months, with their loss also comes the loss of the possibilities the women’s lives held and the contributions they would bring to their families and communities. We grieve these losses, and we commit to doing the difficult and pressing work required to build relationships that prevent violence from continuing to diminish and rob Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit people of realizing these possibilities.

0,Biodiversity: Plan to declare 30% of the world protected areas by 2030 must place Indigenous peoples’ rights at its heart,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/cop15-biodiversity-plan/,The proposal will be a major focus of discussion at COP15 of the Convention of Biological Diversity in Montreal.,"A proposal to commit states to declare 30 percent of the Earth’s land and sea mass protected for conservation and biodiversity by 2030, the so-called “30 by 30” proposal, will be a major focus of discussions at the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD), in Montreal from 7-19 December. 
Amnesty International stresses the urgent need to address the loss of biodiversity as an essential step towards climate justice and of the realization of the right to live in a safe, clean and sustainable environment for all, as recently recognized by the United Nations General Assembly. Failure to address biodiversity loss will have severe repercussions for future generations that will inherit its irreversible results. 
However, Amnesty International insists that any biodiversity commitment, including the so-called “30 by 30” proposal, must place the rights of Indigenous peoples at its heart, including by protecting the livelihoods and rights of subsistence land users. 
‘The so-called ‘30 by 30’ proposal could provide the needed action to slow down and stop biodiversity loss, but in its current form it presents a grave risk to the rights of Indigenous peoples.’ 
Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, who will be in Montreal during COP15, said: “The loss and degradation of biodiversity threatens human and non-human life and is a major source of human rights violations, including the right to life. The so-called ‘30 by 30’ proposal could provide the needed action to slow down and stop biodiversity loss, but in its current form it presents a grave risk to the rights of Indigenous peoples. 
“Current practice in protected areas often follows a model known as ‘fortress conservation’ which requires the complete removal of human presence from the area, usually by force, so that territory can be thrown open to tourists, conservation researchers and, in some cases, big game hunters. 
“There is an overwhelming weight of research showing that Indigenous peoples are the best conservators of biodiversity, which is reflected in the fact that 80 per cent of the world’s biodiversity is to be found on Indigenous-managed lands. 
“Without respect and protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples at the heart of the agreement, coupled with thorough and transparent assessment of the social impacts, the ‘30 by 30’ target is not only bad for human rights, it is bad for conservation, too.” 
Amnesty International urges parties to ensure that any decision on biodiversity protection places Indigenous peoples’ right to their lands at its heart, requiring states to consult with them to obtain their free, prior and informed consent, as currently enshrined in international human rights law. 
The agreement must also guarantee that subsistence land-users have access to land, are protected from forced evictions, enjoy an adequate standard of living, and are consulted on all decisions that impact their rights. Provisions in the proposal which call into question states’ commitments to legally recognized human rights, by making them subject to national legislation, must be removed. 
Indigenous peoples are currently unable to effectively take part in the drafting of the “30 by 30” plans. Their representatives at the convention negotiations have only the right to speak and make suggestions. But despite several drafting sessions, states have not yet committed to guaranteeing the human rights safeguards that Indigenous peoples are demanding. 
Background 
The UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) is the latest meeting to discuss the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity, an agreement adopted in 1992 and ratified by 196 countries that sets out how to safeguard animal and plant species and ensure resources are used sustainably. 
The aim of COP15 is to adopt a globally agreed framework (the ‘Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework’) for halting and reversing biodiversity loss and ‘living in harmony with nature,’ setting specific goals for 2030 and targets to 2050. Despite previously agreed targets for 2020, biodiversity is declining worldwide and is projected to worsen without remedial action. 
The UN Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted following the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, together with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification. COP15 is the biodiversity equivalent of the COP27 climate negotiations, which concluded last month in Egypt.

0,"Ukraine: Older people face heightened risks, unable to access housing in displacement following Russian invasion – new report",Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/ukraine-older-people-face-heightened-risks-unable-to-access-housing-in-displacement-following-russian-invasion-new-report/,Older people killed and injured at higher rates than other groups Older people living in damaged houses and dangerous conditions Russia’s invasion has led to thousands of displaced older people living in overstretched state institutions Older people in Ukraine have been disproportionately...,"Older people in Ukraine have been disproportionately impacted by death and injury during Russia’s invasion and are unable to access housing on an equal basis with others after being displaced, Amnesty International said in a new report today. 
The report, ‘I used to have a home’: Older people’s experience of war, displacement, and access to housing in Ukraine, documents how older people often remain in or are unable to flee conflict-affected areas, exposing them to harm and dangerous living conditions in severely damaged housing. Those who do flee often cannot afford to cover rental costs, while thousands have had to stay in overstretched state institutions, which do not have enough staff to provide the necessary level of care. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has had a devastating impact on civilians of all ages, threatens the physical security of older people and has forced millions from their homes. Ultimately, the most expedient way to protect the rights of older civilians in Ukraine is for Russia to end its unlawful war. 
Russia’s devastating invasion is having a disproportionate impact on older people in Ukraine 
“Russia’s devastating invasion is having a disproportionate impact on older people in Ukraine, with many staying behind in areas where they regularly come in harm’s way from relentless ground and air attacks,” said Laura Mills, researcher on older people and people with disabilities at Amnesty International. 
“Older people are often either staying in unsafe homes or, when they are able to flee, end up in shelters that do not have adequate resources to meet their needs, particularly if they have disabilities. From there, they risk being placed in state institutions. As the harsh grip of winter takes hold, the international community must urgently take action to bolster support for this group.” 
The Ukrainian government has made significant efforts to evacuate people from conflict-affected areas, including by announcing the mandatory evacuation of around 200,000 people from Donetsk region in July. 
The cost and logistics of ensuring housing for older people displaced by the war, however, should not be Ukraine’s alone. Amnesty International is calling on other countries to facilitate the evacuation of older people — with special attention paid to older people with disabilities — to accessible accommodation abroad where possible.International organizations should do more to financially support older people so that they can afford to rent homes and, working together with the Ukrainian authorities, include them among those prioritized for placement in any newly-built accommodation. 
In Ukraine, people over 60 years old comprise nearly one-fourth of the population. Older people are disproportionately vulnerable to attacks: according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which collects data on civilian casualties in Ukraine, people over 60 made up 34% of civilians killed from February to September 2022 for cases in which an age was recorded. 
Older people, who more frequently have health conditions, are also at a greater risk in occupied areas, where Russian forces have severely restricted the access of humanitarian aid, in flagrant violation of international law. 
Svitlana*, 64, who was in a Russian-occupied village near Kharkiv, said that her 61-year-old brother collapsed from a stroke in April 2022. He was hospitalized, but the hospital did not have electricity or running water. He was discharged the next day. 
“They couldn’t do anything, they couldn’t do an electrocardiogram, they couldn’t do an encephalogram, they had no medications,” Svitlana said. Less than a week later, her brother died from a second stroke, according to a death certificate seen by Amnesty International. 
Many displaced older people have struggled to find suitable accommodation. Pushed out of the private market by increased rental prices and pensions that are well below subsistence levels, many older people are at heightened risk of losing access to housing altogether. 
Nina Silakova, 73, who was displaced from Luhansk region, was evicted twice from rental apartments: once in August after she had a heart attack and her landlady feared having to care for her, and again in October. Nina was worried she wouldn’t be able to find a third apartment: “There are no places for that price in the city because there are so many [displaced people]… I don’t know where to turn… Should I go out into the street, stand there and ask people? People will just pass by and think I am an ill old grandmother.” 
Amnesty International found that shelters were often physically inaccessible to older people with disabilities and did not have enough staff to support them. As a result, older people with disabilities often had no choice but to live in a state institution. Between February and July 2022 alone, at least 4,000 older people were placed in state institutions after losing their homes during the conflict, according to statements released by Ukraine’s Ministry of Social Policy. 
They can’t afford to rent housing, to pay for utilities, to eat. And so we have to send them to nursing homes 
Olha Volkova, who runs a shelter for displaced older people with disabilities in Dnipro, said: “About 60% of the people [get sent to institutions]. They can’t afford to rent housing, to pay for utilities, to eat. And so we have to send them to nursing homes.” 
Amnesty International visited seven institutions for older people and people with disabilities in Ukraine, and found these facilities were unable to provide the requisite level of care – particularly for older people with limited mobility – in part because they do not have enough staff to care for them. Independent Ukrainian monitors reported that such conditions were common before the invasion, which has only exacerbated staffing shortages. 
We’re abandoned here 
“They turn me over only once when they change my diaper in the morning, once when they change my diaper in the evening… We’re abandoned here,” said Liudmyla, 76, who lives in an institution in Kharkiv region. 
“In a nursing home there is basically no rehabilitation,” said Olha Volkova. “A person will lie down there until they die.” 
As Russia’s war on Ukraine continues, civilian infrastructure and services have come under intense pressure. However, the Ukrainian government must do all it can to ensure monitors are able to access state institutions, and ensure that older people living in them are among those prioritized for alternative housing as soon as it becomes available. 
Some older people have chosen to stay behind in their homes. Others told Amnesty International that they were unable to flee because information about evacuations was less accessible to them. 
Liudmyla Zhernosek, 61, lives in Chernihiv with her 66-year-old husband, who uses a wheelchair. She said: “I saw every day younger people walking alongside my building with backpacks on. Only later I found out from others in the stairwell that they were going to the centre of the city, there were still evacuations from there. But that would have been 40 minutes on foot, I couldn’t get there with my husband. Nobody told us about evacuations, I always found out only afterwards.” 
 Nobody told us about evacuations, I always found out only afterwards 
Amnesty International also documented older people living in housing without electricity, gas or running water. Windows or roofs damaged during the conflict no longer provided protection from rain, snow or cold temperatures. 
When Amnesty International interviewed Hanna Selivon, 76, in Chernihiv, only the bathroom, where volunteers had put a mattress in the bathtub to allow her to sleep, had covering overhead. 
Hanna said: “Everyone on our street left. The only people left were me and two other older women… One had a disability. We just had nowhere to go. I would hide in a hole in my cellar… On 29 March, there was a lot of shelling, and when I came out [from the cellar] I just saw that flames were flying… that [my house] was burning. My legs wouldn’t move.” 
Amnesty International is calling on governments and international organizations to step up support for older people in Ukraine by facilitating the voluntary evacuation of older people abroad, ensuring that older people are among those prioritized in cash assistance, and by supporting the creation of physically accessible housing for older people with disabilities. 
Older people must be evacuated to accessible shelters, and the repair of their homes must be prioritized 
“As the freezing winter months have arrived, older people must be evacuated to accessible shelters, and the repair of their homes must be prioritized,” said Laura Mills. 
Amnesty International interviewed 226 people for this report, including during in-person visits to seven state institutions. The research was carried out between March and October 2022, and included a four-week trip to Ukraine in June and July 2022. 
Amnesty International has been documenting war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs are available here.  
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for the aggression against Ukraine and for violations of international law to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.

0,Iran: International community must not be deceived by dubious claims of disbanding ‘morality police’,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/iran-international-community-must-not-be-deceived-by-dubious-claims-of-disbanding-morality-police/,The Iranian authorities’ vague and conflicting statements on the supposed disbanding of Iran’s so-called “morality police” must not deceive the international community about the continuing violence against women and girls embedded in compulsory veiling laws and fuelled by ongoing impunity...,"The Iranian authorities’ vague and conflicting statements on the supposed disbanding of Iran’s so-called “morality police” must not deceive the international community about the continuing violence against women and girls embedded in compulsory veiling laws and fuelled by ongoing impunity for those violently enforcing them, said Amnesty International today. 
During a press conference on 3 December 2022, Iran’s Prosecutor General, Mohammad Jafar Montazeri, said: “The ‘morality police’ (gasht-e ershad) has nothing to do with the judiciary and it was closed by whichever [body] that established it in the past.” He then qualified his statement, adding: “The judiciary will continue to regulate people’s behaviour in society,” indicating that the policing of women’s bodies under compulsory veiling laws will continue. State media outlets reported the next day that “No official authority in the Islamic Republic of Iran has confirmed the closure of the morality police”. 
Until the day all these laws and regulations are scrapped, the same violence that resulted in the arrest and death in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini will continue against millions of other women and girls. 
“The Prosecutor General’s statement was deliberately vague and failed to mention the legal and policy infrastructure that keeps the practice of compulsory veiling against women and girls firmly in place. To say that the ‘morality police’ has nothing to do with the judiciary distorts the reality that, for decades, the criminalization of women and girls under abusive and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws has been rubber-stamped by judiciary. In the face of outrage in Iran and globally over this extreme form of gender-based discrimination and violence, the Iranian authorities are simply passing the buck to each other to evade responsibility,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The international community and global media must not allow the Iranian authorities to pull the wool over their eyes. Compulsory veiling is entrenched in Iran’s Penal Code and other laws and regulations that enable security and administrative bodies to subject women to arbitrary arrest and detention and deny them access to public institutions including hospitals, schools, government offices and airports if they do not cover their hair. Until the day all these laws and regulations are scrapped, the same violence that resulted in the arrest and death in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini will continue against millions of other women and girls.” 
Iran’s “morality police” is a sub-branch of the country’s police force, which falls under the mandate of the Ministry of Interior. Despite the Prosecutor General’s statement attempting to distance the judiciary from the “morality police”, under Iran’s Code of Criminal Procedure, police officials are considered “judicial officials” (zabetan-e qazai) who may carry out arrests and interrogations under the supervision and instruction of the Prosecutor. 
The “morality police” place the entire female population under surveillance, but the policing of women’s bodies is not confined to the state. Iran’s abusive, discriminatory and degrading forced veiling laws enable not only state agents but also vigilantes, who are non-state actors, to harass and assault women and girls on a daily basis in public. 
Forced veiling laws violate a whole host of rights, including the rights to equality, privacy and freedom of expression and belief. They also degrade women and girls, stripping them of their dignity, bodily autonomy, and self-worth. 
Under Article 638 of Iran’s Islamic Penal Code, any act that is deemed “offensive” to public decencies is punished with an imprisonment term of 10 days to two months, or 74 lashes. An explanatory note to the article states that women who are seen in public without veiling are to be punished with an imprisonment term of 10 days to two months or a cash fine. The law applies to girls as young as nine, which is the minimum age of criminal responsibility for girls in Iran. In practice, the authorities have imposed compulsory veiling on girls from the age of seven when they start elementary school. 
“It is important to remember that protesters in Iran are not calling just for the dismantling of the ‘morality police’ but for the transition of Iran to a new political and legal system that would respect their basic human rights and freedoms. The popular uprising taking place across Iran reflects nationwide rage over decades of oppression against the people of Iran, many of whom continue to be unlawfully killed on a daily basis simply for wanting freedom, democracy and human rights,” said Heba Morayef.

0,Amnesty International Canada target of sophisticated cyber-attack linked to China,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/news-releases/cyber-breach-statement/,The organization is speaking out to warn other human rights defenders about the rising threat of digital security breaches.,"Amnesty International Canada (English-speaking Section) revealed today it was the target of a sophisticated digital security breach, believed to be sponsored by the Chinese state. 
The human rights organization first detected the breach on October 5, 2022, when suspicious activity was spotted on Amnesty’s IT infrastructure. Amnesty International Canada engaged a highly skilled team of forensic investigators and cyber security experts who took immediate action to protect the organization’s systems and investigate the source of the attack.  
The investigation’s preliminary results indicate that a digital security breach was perpetrated using tools and techniques associated with specific advanced persistent threat groups (APTs). Forensic experts with leading international cyber-security firm Secureworks later established that “a threat group sponsored or tasked by the Chinese state” was likely behind the attack. The forensic audit’s conclusion is based “on the nature of the targeted information as well as the observed tools and behaviors, which are consistent with those associated with Chinese cyberespionage threat groups.” 
‘As an organization advocating for human rights globally, we are very aware that we may be the target of state-sponsored attempts to disrupt or surveil our work. These will not intimidate us and the security and privacy of our activists, staff, donors, and stakeholders remain our utmost priority.’ 
Amnesty International Canada is speaking publicly about the attack to caution other human rights defenders on the rising threat of digital security breaches and strongly condemns state and non-state actors intent on interfering with the work of human rights and other civil society organizations. 
“As an organization advocating for human rights globally, we are very aware that we may be the target of state-sponsored attempts to disrupt or surveil our work. These will not intimidate us and the security and privacy of our activists, staff, donors, and stakeholders remain our utmost priority,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. 
“This case of cyberespionage speaks to the increasingly dangerous context which activists, journalists, and civil society alike must navigate today. Our work to investigate and denounce these acts has never been more critical and relevant. We will continue to shine a light on human rights violations wherever they occur and to denounce the use of digital surveillance by governments to stifle human rights,” she added. 
Amnesty International Canada has taken swift and robust action to strengthen its digital security and restore systems back online securely. 
To date, the investigation has uncovered no evidence that any donor or membership data was exfiltrated. Appropriate law enforcement authorities as well as staff, donors, and other stakeholders have been notified of the breach. Amnesty International Canada will continue to work with security experts to mitigate against potential future risks.

0,Write for Rights 2022: Canada celebrates world’s largest human rights event with first in-person Write-A-Thons in three years,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/news-releases/write-for-rights-2022/,Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign sees advocates in more than 200 countries and territories take millions of actions in support of people whose human rights are under attack.,"For the first time since 2019, Amnesty International supporters across Canada will gather in person around International Human Rights Day – December 10 – to take part in the world’s largest annual celebration of human rights. 
Now in its 22nd year, Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign sees thousands of groups in more than 200 countries and territories take millions of actions in support of people whose human rights are under attack. In years past, dozens of Write-A-Thons – lively events where activists gather to write letters, sign petitions, enjoy music and refreshments, and listen to inspiring guest speakers – took place in communities across Canada. However, in 2020 and 2021, those gatherings were cancelled or migrated online because of COVID-19 restrictions. 
‘Defending human rights, at its core, is about people joining together and harnessing their collective power to counter injustice.’ 
“Defending human rights, at its core, is about people joining together and harnessing their collective power to counter injustice,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-speaking Section). “Gathering online can be an effective tool to spur change, but it’s not the same experience as the intimacy and immediacy of getting together in person, sharing stories, and taking action as a group. That’s where empathy thrives and momentum grows unstoppable.” 
So far, more than 60 Write-A-Thons have been scheduled for December, with events confirmed for Halifax, Toronto, Regina, Saskatoon, Edmonton, and Vancouver. Community, student, religious, and workplace groups may register their events on Amnesty International Canada’s 2022 Write for Rights portal. There, visitors will also find letter-writing toolkits, online actions, and information about the cases Amnesty International is profiling this year. 
This year’s featured human rights defenders, lining up with Amnesty International’s new global Protect the Protest campaign, are 13 individuals who have been targeted for their protest activities. They are: 
“Over the last 12 months alone, from Iran to Cuba and beyond, we’ve seen a host of protest movements met with repressive government responses,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. “Everywhere you look across the world, the right to protest is coming under attack.” 
Background 
Every December, people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts, and postcards in support of those who are unjustly persecuted. Write for Rights has helped transform the lives of more than 100 people since 2001, freeing them from torture, harassment, or unjust imprisonment. In 2021, more than 4.5 million actions were taken, making Write for Rights the world’s largest human rights event.

Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Heba Morayef, said:  
“Salah Hammouri has already spent nine months in administrative detention without charge or trial this year, in retaliation for his tireless campaigning for an end to Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians. These latest plans are not only a shameless attempt to hinder Salah’s human rights work, they are also an expression of the Israeli authorities’ chilling long-term policy aim of reducing the number of Palestinians in East Jerusalem.   
“Unlawful deportation from the Occupied Palestinian Territories constitutes a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a war crime. Deportation carried to maintain a system of apartheid constitutes a crime against humanity. These crimes are all in the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court, whose Prosecutor has opened an investigation into the situation in Palestine. We reiterate our call for the crime of apartheid to be included in that investigation; Israeli authorities must be held accountable.    
This is an expression of Israeli authorities’ chilling long-term policy aim of reducing the number of Palestinians in East Jerusalem.   
“Over the past two decades, Salah Hammouri has faced many of the inhumane acts which Israeli authorities use to enforce and maintain their system of apartheid. He has been subjected to prolonged administrative detention on various occasions, as well as harassment, family separation, surveillance, and constant threats of residency revocation. This persecution must end now. Israeli authorities must release Salah Hammouri, restore his residency status in Jerusalem, and allow him to continue his human rights work without fear of reprisals.”  
Background 
Salah Hammouri was notified on 30 November that he will be deported to France on Sunday 4 December 2022 – the date his current administrative detention order expires. Salah has been detained without charge or trial since 7 March, under a three-month administrative detention order that has been repeatedly renewed.  
The deportation of Salah Hammouri would set a dangerous precedent. It is based on an amendment to a law which authorizes the Israeli Ministry of the Interior to deport permanent residents (the legal status held by most Palestinian-Jerusalemites) if they are found to have “breached” allegiance to the state of Israel. This is at odds with international law: allegiance to the occupying power is not required from an occupied population.  
Under Israeli law, Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem are not Israeli citizens and are not residents of the West Bank. Instead, they are granted fragile “permanent residency status” which allows them to reside and work in the city, and which may be revoked on a number of discriminatory grounds.

0,Colombia: Guaranteeing justice in cases of gender-based violence during repression of National Strike must be central to any police reform,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/colombia-police-reform/,A new Amnesty International report documents sexual and other forms of gender-based violence committed by Colombian police during the repression of the 2021 National Strike.,"Women and LGBTIQ+ protesters, journalists and human rights defenders suffered sexual violence and other forms of gender-based violence at the hands of Colombia’s National Police and its Mobile Anti-Riot Squad (ESMAD) during the repression of the National Strike in 2021, Amnesty International said today in a new report. 
The police do not protect me: Sexual violence and other gender-based violence during the 2021 National Strike documents 28 cases of gender-based violence that took place in seven cities against women and LGBTIQ+ people in the context of the protests. The report details an array of violent behaviour by state agents, particularly National Police officers, ranging from the use of sexist, misogynist and abusive language to sexual violence, which can constitute a form of torture. 
“Gender-based violence, and particularly sexual violence, have a painful history in the context of the Colombian armed conflict – a history that authorities have yet to overcome. We received hundreds of reports of gender-based violence during the National Strike in 2021 detailing psychological violence, discrimination, threats, touching, sexual harassment, forced nudity, torture and sexual violence. Having documented 28 of these incidents in depth, it’s clear that gender-based violence was a tool of repression that the National Police used to punish those who dared to speak out and protest,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary General at Amnesty International. 
The cases documented took place in the cities of Cali and Palmira (Valle de Cauca), Popayán (Cauca), Soledad (Atlántico), Tunja (Boyacá), Manizales (Caldas) and Bogotá. Women protesters were broadly targeted, with Afro-descendant and Indigenous women, human rights defenders, journalists, healthcare workers, and mothers among the survivors. 
‘The Colombian authorities must also address the root causes of this violence and work with women and LGBTIQ+ people to develop and adopt effective measures to guarantee a life free from institutional discrimination and gender-based violence.’ 
The report reveals how the violence against women and LGBTIQ+ people was inextricably linked with other factors of discrimination, such as race, ethnicity and sexual orientation. Testimonies from Indigenous, Afro-descendant and Trans women reveal how their identities became additional motives for repression, exacerbating the risks of violence. Further, women and LGBTIQ+ journalists and human rights defenders experienced attacks marked by machismo, homophobia and other forms of hatred, and stigmatization. 
The human rights violations mainly took place in two instances: during the action the National Police took to disperse the protests and during detentions following the initial intervention. In both situations, acting in official capacity, members of the National Police committed acts ranging from sexist insults and threats to sexual violence. The common factors in all these cases were the intent with which the violence was carried out: the perpetrators were seeking to punish the protesters for challenging social gender norms and taking to the streets to exercise their right to freedom of peaceful assembly. 
Amnesty International also received information regarding how the justice system – and particularly the Attorney General’s Office – either failed to respond or responded inadequately to the complaints that survivors of gender-based violence filed. Several survivors also said they decided not to file complaints before the Attorney General’s Office out of fear and mistrust. 
“As the ultimate head of the National Police, President Gustavo Petro must issue an order condemning all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and demand they stop. Each complaint from the National Strike in 2021 must be investigated and those responsible must be held to account. The Colombian authorities must also address the root causes of this violence and work with women and LGBTIQ+ people to develop and adopt effective measures to guarantee a life free from institutional discrimination and gender-based violence. This is the bare minimum to begin paving a road to justice and accountability,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Prior to this new report, Amnesty International published several statements and reports documenting other serious human rights violations in the context of the National Strike, including disproportionate restrictions on peaceful demonstrations, urban paramilitarism, arbitrary detentions and torture and ill-treatment of peaceful demonstrators in the city of Cali, and eye injuries caused by ESMAD agents as a result of the unlawful use of less lethal weapons.

This system has become increasingly violent and oppressive over the past year – in the West Bank, Israeli forces have killed 127 Palestinians since January and injured hundreds more, and there has also been a surge in assaults and violence against Palestinians by state-backed settlers. 
Israeli authorities have ramped up their use of administrative detention to hold Palestinians without charge or trial, and intensified their attacks on Palestinian civil society organizations. In Gaza, the Israeli military’s August offensive exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis generated by Israel’s ongoing illegal blockade. 
Today and every day, Amnesty International stands with Palestinians as they demand their rights in the face of Israel’s relentless attacks. 
“Today and every day, Amnesty International stands with Palestinians as they demand their rights in the face of Israel’s relentless attacks. We call on our supporters around the world to demonstrate their solidarity by speaking out, however they can, to demand an end to Israel’s apartheid,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“With violations by Israeli authorities mounting and Palestinian civil society under unprecedented assault, Palestinians need international support now more than ever. We are urging the international community to suspend any form of support – whether direct or indirect, whether through action or inaction – to Israel’s apartheid system.” 
Amnesty International spokespeople are available for interviews on: 
Israeli forces have ramped up military activity in the West Bank this year, carrying out hundreds of violent raids and imposing several new closures tightening movement restrictions to a chokehold. According to the UN, 2022 is the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since at least 2005. Israeli forces have killed 127 Palestinians so far this year, including many children. 
Israeli settlers carried out hundreds of violent attacks on Palestinians during the recent olive harvest season – physically assaulting people, uprooting or torching thousands of olive trees, and smashing up cars and homes under the protection of the Israeli military. 
In 2022 so far, the Israeli authorities have issued 1,789 administrative detention orders, according to Palestinian organization Addameer, continuing a sharp upward trend. As of 26 November, there are 820 Palestinians being held indefinitely in Israeli prisons, without charge or trial, on the basis of undisclosed “secret” information. Administrative detainees include Salah Hammouri, a French-Palestinian human rights defender and lawyer who has been detained since 7 March 2022. 
In August 2022, Israeli forces killed, injured and displaced yet more civilians in apparent war crimes in the besieged Gaza Strip, as documented in an Amnesty International briefing. 
In August 2022, Israeli forces raided the offices of Addameer, Al-Haq, Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Health Work Committees, and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees, and confiscated files and equipment. They issued military orders to close the offices and welded shut their doors. Last year, these organizations were designated as “terrorist” under Israeli law. 
In Masafer Yatta in the West Bank, 1150 people are at risk of forced displacement by Israeli authorities. Last week, Israeli forces demolished a school in the area, robbing 23 children of their right to education. If Israel goes ahead with planned demolitions and expulsions in Masafer Yatta it will amount to forcible transfer, a crime against humanity. Also last week, Israeli authorities demolished the unrecognized Palestinian Bedouin village of al-Araqib in the Negev/Naqab for the 209th time. These are just two recent examples, among thousands.

“The tragedy of the Urumqi fire has inspired remarkable bravery across China. Peaceful protesters are holding blank pieces of paper, chanting slogans, and engaging in many forms of creative dissent. It is virtually impossible for people in China to protest peacefully without facing harassment and prosecution. Authorities have shown zero tolerance to opposition especially in the last 10 years under President Xi, but this has not stopped the protests.” 
“Instead of penalising the people, the government should listen to their calls. Authorities must let people express their thoughts freely and protest peacefully without fear of retaliation.” 
Authorities must let people express their thoughts freely and protest peacefully without fear of retaliation. 
“Unfortunately, China’s playbook is all too predictable. Censorship and surveillance will continue, and we will most likely see police use of force and mass arrests of protesters in the coming hours and days. Long prison sentences against peaceful protesters are also to be expected.” 
“People have been incredibly patient with lockdown measures but authorities must not abuse emergency policies. These unprecedented protests show that people are at the end of their tolerance for excessive Covid-19 restrictions.” 
“The Chinese government must immediately review its Covid-19 policies to ensure that they are proportionate and time-bound. All quarantine measures that pose threats to personal safety and unnecessarily restrict freedom of movement must be suspended.” 
“The government also needs to promptly, effectively and thoroughly investigate the Urumqi fire, to avoid a reoccurrence, bring justice to the victims and their families, and show the people they are responsive to their grievances.” 
Background 
On Thursday, 24 November, a fire broke out in an apartment building in Urumqi killing at least 10 people according to government sources. Many blamed Covid-19 restrictions for the deaths but local authorities have disputed this claim. This did not stop protests from breaking out in Urumqi, the capital of the western region of Xinjiang. The next morning, the government declared that Covid outbreak is under control and the city will ease lockdowns, following more than 100 days of severe restriction on inhabitants’ movement. 
Since 25 November, videos shared on social media show protests breaking out across universities and cities throughout China, including in Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai and Wuhan. Peaceful protesters commemorated victims of the Urumqi fire and called for the easing of lockdown measures. Many also demanded censorship to end and some called for President Xi to step down. 
Amnesty international is not able to independently verify all the online videos now being circulated from multiple cities. 
At least one woman was arrested in Urumqi for “spreading rumours” according to official sources. Dozens were arrested on Urumqi Road in Shanghai evening of November 26 according to online sources. Protests are ongoing.

Stop Paving Over Our Rights: How to have fewer cars, less pollution, and better transportation for all follows Andy and Samira as they organize against a highway expansion project in their neighbourhood. 
The focal point is a middle school next to a highway the government is planning to widen at a cost of $1.2 billion. The fact that governments are spending billions on projects that worsen the climate crisis because they deepen reliance on fossil fuels, and violate the right to a healthy environment, is a key focus. 
The title of the comic reflects Amnesty International’s current climate justice policy document Stop Burning Our Rights: What governments and corporations must do to protect humanity from the climate crisis, which states that“The climate emergency is a human rights crisis of unprecedented proportions. Climate change threatens the enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of present and future generations and, ultimately, the future of humanity” (P 6). The focus of the comic is also based on recommendations in Stop Burning Our Rights, specifically that governments must stop spending public funds on “urban highway expansion, and instead promote the development of low-carbon transport infrastructure” (p 87). 
Transportation is the second largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in Canada, and emissions have been climbing relentlessly. Globally, GHG pollution from transport has more than doubled since 1970 and is increasing at a faster rate than any other energy end-use sector. Highway expansion is a serious threat to the futures of young people. 
There are about 1.3 billion cars in operation globally, and the manufacturing of automobiles of all types, including electric vehicles, is still mainly powered with climate-disrupting fossil fuels. And the concrete and steel used to build parking structures and urban highways also have a massive greenhouse gas footprint. If the rapid increases in the number of vehicles in Canada and globally were to continue, the climate impact would be catastrophic. The impact of mining minerals for electric car batteries is explored in the first comic in this series. 
Describing a problem isn’t much use if it isn’t connected to solutions, so the comic follows our heroes through organizing a local rally on a global day of action against highway expansion and shows photos and social media of the other actions around the world. 
And after years of organizing, our heroes get to enjoy the changes in their neighbourhood with far fewer cars and cleaner air. 
The final panel shows how cities can be transformed when road space is reallocated from cars to public transit, walking, rolling and cycling. This vision may seem ambitious, but as the definitive IPCC Sixth Assessment Report on climate mitigation states “transformative changes in the transport sector… are needed to meet climate targets” (p 10-4). 
Governments must redesign our road networks and public spaces to make walking, cycling, and public transport convenient and pleasant, and reduce the number of cars on the road. Numerous studies show that when road space is reallocated to public transit lanes, protected bicycle lanes, and space for walking, traffic ‘evaporates’ and traffic speeds usually stay about the same (and sometimes traffic even moves quicker). With fewer cars, cities can become healthier, cooler, more inclusive, and more pleasant.

“The Taliban continue to ignore widespread criticism as they flagrantly flout basic human rights principles in an alarming slide into what looks like a grim reminder of their rule three decades ago. These outrageous punishments are just another step in the legalization of inhuman practices by the Taliban’s cruel justice system and expose the de-facto authorities’ complete disregard for international human rights law. 
“The criminal practice of public flogging and all other forms of corporal punishments must be immediately and unconditionally stopped and a formal justice mechanism with fair trials and access to legal remedies must be put in place. The international community must immediately intensify its efforts to ensure the de-facto authorities in Afghanistan abolish all cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments.” 
The Taliban continue to ignore widespread criticism as they flagrantly flout basic human rights principles in an alarming slide into what looks like a grim reminder of their rule three decades ago. 
Background: 
On Sunday 14 November, the Taliban Supreme leader gave an obligatory order for full implementation of sharia law in Afghanistan. 
Since then, the Taliban have carried out several public floggings on women and men accusing them of adultery, theft, same-sex sexual conduct or kidnapping, in different provinces in Afghanistan. 
This interpretation of Islamic law includes public executions, public amputations and stoning – which were carried out during the Taliban’s first rule that ended in late 2001. 
As the Taliban captured power in August 2021, they promised a more moderate rule in the country including respect to women’s rights. 
Amnesty International has documented the Taliban’s continued escalation of human rights violations and abuses since they took control of Afghanistan in August 2021. This includes extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, torture, disappearances, repression of women and girls, and censorship on media and other restrictions of freedom of expression.

“The Ethiopian authorities must urgently allow unfettered access to the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (ICHREE) and the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights to enable investigations to take place, and ultimately to ensure those responsible for atrocities in Ethiopia’s two-year conflict face justice.” 
On 2 November 2022, Amnesty International launched a campaign which highlights the atrocities committed by all sides to the conflict. It also called on the international community to stand in solidarity with survivors and victims of sexual violence during the conflict. 
The Ethiopian authorities must allow unfettered access to the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia and the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights to enable investigations to take place

“This important and long overdue step shows that the cries of people in Iran for justice have finally been heard. We hope the establishment of this fact-finding mission marks a fundamental shift in the international community’s approach to tackling the crisis of systematic impunity that has long fueled crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations in Iran. The resolution not only enhances international scrutiny of the dire situation in Iran, but also puts in place a process to collect, consolidate and preserve crucial evidence for future prosecutions. 
This important and long overdue step shows that the cries of people in Iran for justice have finally been heard. 
“Amnesty International has been working towards the establishment of an international investigative and accountability mechanism on Iran for years. While the fact-finding mission should have come far sooner, today’s vote sends a clear message to the Iranian authorities that they can no longer commit crimes under international law without fear of consequences. 
“States must now ensure that the mandate is made operational and sufficiently resourced without delay and call upon the Iranian authorities to cooperate fully with the mission and allow unhindered access to the country. Today’s vote must also serve as a wake-up call for the Iranian authorities to immediately end their all-out militarized attack on demonstrators.” 
Background 
As the resolution was being negotiated in Geneva, the Iranian authorities continued to reject the findings of UN experts and human rights organizations. In the meantime, at home they persisted in their widespread use of unlawful lethal force and sought the death penalty for protesters.  
The fact-finding mission has a mandate to “collect, consolidate and analyze evidence of such violations and preserve evidence, including in view of cooperation, in any legal proceedings.” 
The Iranian authorities’ deadly repression of the ongoing popular uprising in Iran, which erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini on 16 September 2022, is the latest in the cycle of violent attacks waged by the authorities against people expressing their legitimate grievances since December 2017-January 2018. 
Amnesty International has consistently documented crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed by the Iranian authorities in the context of protests, including unlawful killings following unwarranted use of lethal force, mass arbitrary arrests and detentions, enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment, and the sentencing of individuals to lengthy prison terms or death following grossly unfair trials. The Iranian authorities have ignored repeated calls by the international community to open criminal investigations into such crimes. Instead, they have sought to destroy evidence of their crimes while persecuting survivors and victims’ relatives calling for truth, justice and reparation.

Their family is one of some 180 Palestinian families living in Masafer Yatta, in the south of the West Bank in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. At least 1,150 Palestinians, half of whom are children, live in nine villages that have been earmarked for demolition. After 23 years of legal procedures, the Israeli Supreme Court on 4 May 2022 gave the greenlight for the planned eviction of inhabitants of Masafer Yatta. Israeli military activity in the area has increased since the court’s decision in May 2022, leading to fears that the demolition could happen soon. Israel’s execution of this large-scale expulsion would amount to forcible transfer, which is a war crime and crime against humanity.  
The Israeli army said that it needed to conduct training in the area, and so declared it a “firing zone”. The villagers appealed against this plan, because they have lived in Masafer Yatta for generations, and they need the space for raising livestock. However, the villagers have now exhausted their legal remedies since the Supreme Court rejected their request for a further hearing on 2 October. The demolition of homes, schools and roads is a violation of Masafer Yatta villagers’ right to an adequate standard of living, including housing, under international human rights law.  
In the region of Masafer Yatta, meanwhile, several Israeli settlements and outposts are expanding: Mitzpe Yair to the south, East Susya to the west, Avigayil, Havat Maon and Maon to the north. The settling of an occupying state’s civilians in occupied territory and the forcible transfer of protected persons are serious violations of international humanitarian law and war crimes. These forcible transfers are carried out to maintain Israel’s system of oppression and domination over Palestinians, and therefore also constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid.

Masafer Yatta comprises of 19 villages and hamlets, of which nine are at imminent risk of demolition. The Israeli authorities have issued orders to demolish almost all homes, as well as animal shelters, cisterns, primary and secondary schools, and community infrastructure in Masafer Yatta villages al-Fakhit, al-Majaz, al-Markaz, Halawa, Jinba, Khallet al-Dab‘a, Isfay al-Fawqa, Isfay al-Tahta, and al-Tabban, on the grounds that they were built without official permits in an area designated as a military zone. Building permits are, however, almost impossible to obtain for Palestinians in the context of a systematically discriminatory land and housing regime.  
Since the Supreme Court’s decision on 4 May 2022 that demolitions could proceed, the Israeli army’s civil administration’s bulldozers have demolished Jamila Abu Sabha’s home twice, on 11 May 2022 and 1 June 2022. The army conducted tank manoeuvres next to her children’s school in September 2022. She told Amnesty International that her youngest children, who are two, three and four years old, have become terrified since the demolitions. Jamila Abu Sabha, a cheese manufacturer and homemaker, had to rearrange her home-based artisan and caring work to fit in one tent. Photos of their home before the demolitions show a small, neat breeze-block house with herb pots. Muhammad Abu Sabha, who owns and cares for 200 sheep, has cleared and furnished a cave that was previously used for shepherding equipment, in order to accommodate his family in case the tent is demolished like the home before it. Their fourteen-year-old daughter Fatima, who studies in al-Fakhit’s secondary school, showed the cave to Amnesty International researchers and commented: “I do not want to live in this.”   
On 23 November 2022, the civil administration’s bulldozers demolished the primary school in Isfay al-Fawqa in the morning of a school day. The Israeli army had destroyed the few paved roads and water pipes connecting the villages in June 2021. The water pipes have since been repaired but remain at risk. Residents told Amnesty International on 14 October 2022 that new and unpredictable military checkpoints occasionally prevented teachers from reaching the five local schools (now four) in June and September 2022. On 15 July, an unexpected checkpoint by Halawa prevented Muhammad Ali Abu Aram, 62 years old, from reaching medical treatment for blood clotting for 10 hours, according to his nephews. The Israeli army repeatedly confiscated residents’ and commuting teachers’ vehicles, on the grounds that they entered a closed zone. Four vehicles belonging to teachers in Jinba’s primary school and al-Fakhit’s secondary school were confiscated in May 2022. The Jinba school bus, which serves children of 50 families, was confiscated at the start of the school year on 31 August 2022. On Saturday 8 October, the villagers in Khallet al-Dab‘a organized a festival with children’s performances, music and food stalls. Residents described to Amnesty International that they had decorated the village, prepared meals, and rehearsed activities; however only a dozen visitors attended because Israeli checkpoints had prevented access.  
The Masafer Yatta villages are located in the South Hebron Hills in Area C of the occupied West Bank. Area C covers 60% of the West Bank, where the Israeli authorities retain exclusive control over planning and zoning. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, between 2018-2022, 4,323 Palestinian West Bank residents were forcibly evicted, and some 3,500 buildings demolished due to discriminatory zoning and planning in Area C. More than 5,000 other Palestinians are at imminent risk of forced eviction, particularly in Masafer Yatta and in the Jordan Valley’s shepherding communities such as Humsa and Hadidiya. At the same time, Israeli authorities provided subsidies, tax incentives and low-cost utilities to encourage Jewish Israelis to live in 279 illegal settlements on roughly 40% of the West Bank (excluding East Jerusalem), home to over 465,400 Israeli settlers, according to Israeli organization Peace Now’s statistics. In 2018-2022, the Israeli government approved plans for building 10,294 housing units in Israeli settlements in Area C. In the same period and area, the Israeli government approved construction permits for just 27 Palestinian housing units, also according to Peace Now.  
Israel has arbitrarily designated large areas of Palestinian land as military zones, state land, archaeological sites or national parks to maximize control over Palestinian land in both Israel and the OPT. A recent investigation into classified documents from 1979 revealed that Israel’s creation of “firing zones” in the OPT that cover approximately 20% of the occupied West Bank, was “for the sole purpose of eventually handing the land over to Israeli settlers”. These and other policies that violate international law form key elements of Israel’s institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination of Palestinians.

In the letter, Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Ketty Nivyabandi called on Canada Soccer to, by kickoff of Canada’s first match of the tournament, endorse Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and FairSquare’s call for FIFA to create a compensation fund for workers and families who experienced harms in the build-up to the Qatar World Cup. 
To: Earl CochraneGeneral Secretary, Canada Soccer237 Metcalfe St.Ottawa, ON, K2P 1R2 
From: Ketty NivyabandiSecretary General, Amnesty International Canadian Section (English Speaking)312 Laurier Ave. EOttawa, ON, K1N 1H9 
18 November 2022 
Dear Canada Soccer: 
Congratulations on the Canadian national men’s team’s return to the FIFA World Cup after a 36-year absence. Competing internationally at the highest level in the world’s most popular sport takes extraordinary courage, perseverance, and leadership. Canada Soccer deserves credit for fielding a squad whose thrilling play and rich cultural diversity has already ignited the imagination of the next generation of Canadian sports leaders. 
However, Canada Soccer’s leadership should not be limited to the pitch or the boardroom. Sports fans across the country are looking to our national soccer federation to not to shy away from addressing the serious, widespread harms experienced by those who made this World Cup a reality. Your organization’s deafening silence on fair compensation for affected migrant workers and their families is a failure of leadership and could leave a lasting stain on Canada’s re-emergence on soccer’s biggest stage. 
When FIFA awarded Qatar the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, there were inherent and foreseeable risks in holding the tournament in Qatar due to its poor human rights record, heavy reliance on migrant workers, and an exploitative labour system.[i]  Amnesty International has documented that thousands of workers, predominantly from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, have been subjected to labour abuses, abysmally low pay, and other exploitation.[ii] Qatar’s ‘Kafala’ system of sponsorship-based employment legally bound migrant workers to their employers, preventing them from changing jobs or leaving the country without their employer’s permission.[iii] Moreover, the deaths of thousands of migrant workers – most purportedly connected to extreme heat, including on World Cup-related projects – remain uninvestigated.[iv] 
Despite recent changes to Qatari labour law, migrant workers still experience delayed or unpaid wages, denial of rest days, unsafe working conditions, barriers to changing jobs, and limited access to justice.[v] On top of the country’s labour record, homosexuality is outlawed in Qatar – for example, sexual acts between men are punishable by a prison sentence of up to seven years – and Qatari law continues to treat women as second-class citizens in employment, education, and health care.[vi] 
‘Leadership requires more than treating workers’ rights as a procedural “box to be ticked.” Fortunately, it is not too late for Canada Soccer to step out from the sidelines, join other international teams on the human rights field, and become the global player it asserts it is.’ 
Your leadership is aware of these concerns. As Canada Soccer acknowledged in its October 28 statement on “Workers’ Rights and Inclusivity in Qatar,” representatives from the Canadian federation met in July with members of Amnesty International’s global Migrant Labour working group to discuss Qatar’s human rights record. However, Canada Soccer has apparently failed to follow up, raising questions about your stated commitment to upholding Canada’s “global reputation as a defender of human and LGBTQ2S rights.” According to May Romanos and Ella Knight, two researchers with Amnesty International’s Migrant Labour working group:           
As part of a wider outreach targeting all football associations, Amnesty and other organisations reached out and wrote to Canada Soccer urging them to support the call for a remedy for workers and use their leverage to push FIFA to commit to such a programme. However, unlike some other football associations where this led to new or increased engagement with them on these issues, Canada Soccer did not respond to our letter and since the one meeting in July we had no further engagement with them. 
Leadership requires more than treating workers’ rights as a procedural “box to be ticked.” Fortunately, it is not too late for Canada Soccer to step out from the sidelines, join other international teams on the human rights field, and become the global player it asserts it is. As a result, Amnesty International Canada urges your leadership to take the following steps by 2 pm ET on 23 November – kickoff time for the Canadian men’s team’s first match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup: 
Whatever success our men’s team nets on the playing field, you can make Canada proud this World Cup by taking concrete action on workers’ rights. For Amnesty International Canada’s part, it would be an honour to help you achieve that goal. 
To close, I would like to point to Canada Soccer’s Values statement, which guides your federation’s approach and activities (capitalizations are Canada Soccer’s): 
We LEAD with unwavering INTEGRITY. HONESTY guides our actions. Our decisions are FAIR and ETHICAL. We thrive with EXCELLENCE. Our PASSION fuels our performance on and off the field of play. We are ACCOUNTABLE to our stakeholders. TRANSPARENCY directs our communication. We RESPECT and INCLUDE all. 
We ask that you consider your own wise words as you reflect on your next steps. Leaders check their performance against their goals, and correct course if necessary. That is what Canada Soccer expects of its players and coaches, and it is what Canadians demand of you. 
Sincerely, 
Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General,Amnesty International Canadian Section (English Speaking)

0,Canada: Former cabinet ministers join Amnesty International in calling for end to immigration detention in provincial jails,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/news-releases/canada-former-cabinet-ministers-join-amnesty-international-in-calling-for-end-to-immigration-detention-in-provincial-jails/,Lloyd Axworthy and Allan Rock highlighted the serious human rights violations posed by imprisoning migrants in facilities build for the criminal justice system.,"Two prominent former federal cabinet ministers joined Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking Section) and Human Rights Watch on Monday in admonishing the Trudeau government to end the Canada Border Service Agency’s (CBSA) practice of incarcerating refugee claimants and migrants in provincial jails on administrative immigration grounds. 
At a press conference on Parliament Hill, the Hon. Lloyd Axworthy and the Hon. Allan Rock highlighted the serious human rights violations posed by allowing the CBSA to imprison refugee claimants and migrants in jails built for the criminal justice system. 
“Too many migrants and asylum seekers are detained pending the determination of their legal status,” said Rock, a former justice minister, referencing the findings of a joint Human Rights Watch-Amnesty International report published in 2021. “And too many of them are locked up in places meant to punish and deter, even though none are held on criminal charges. 
“Well, the facts are now out. The stories are public. The record is there for all to see. Now we must decide what we’re going to do about it.” 
Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada, echoed the need for Ottawa to put an immediate stop to immigration detention in provincial jails. “Canada has incarcerated tens of thousands of people, including children and refugee claimants, in immigration detention over the past decade,” said Nivyabandi. “None were held on criminal charges or convictions. This structural violence is not only abusive, but it disproportionately hurts communities of colour, and in particular, people of African descent.” 
Monday’s press conference kicked off 12 Days of Action by human rights organizations and advocates from across Canada who are urging Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to end the practice of immigration detention in provincial jails country-wide. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are working with a coalition of Canadian social justice, academic, and grassroots organizations, as well as individuals with lived experience in immigration detention, to amplify pressure on the federal government. 
Over the 12 days, several community-based organizations across the country, including Matthew House, Kinbrace, and the Halifax Refugee Clinic, will host events to highlight the compassionate care and support services available to migrants and refugee claimants as alternatives to immigration detention. The campaign will also include statements, open letters, and other actions by organizations that provide services to, and protect the rights of, migrants and refugee claimants. 
‘The verdict from not one but four different provinces – British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, and Alberta – in the span of four months is clear: they want nothing to do with this. It now falls on the federal government to abolish this abusive and discriminatory practice.’ 
The use of provincial jails for immigration detention is inherently punitive, is inconsistent with international human rights standards, and has devastating effects on people’s mental health. In their 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented that racialized people, and in particular Black men, are often confined in provincial jails rather than in dedicated immigration holding centres. Persons with disabilities also experience discrimination while in immigration detention. 
The 12 Days of Action come at a time when provincial governments across Canada are rethinking their participation in the practice of immigration detention. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch launched their #WelcomeToCanada campaign in October 2021, calling on provinces to end their complicity in this rights-abusing and harmful system. In July 2022, British Columbia announced it would cancel its agreement with the CBSA, which allows its provincial jails to be used for immigration detention, citing human rights concerns. Three provinces have since followed suit in cancelling their agreements. 
“The verdict from not one but four different provinces – British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, and Alberta – in the span of four months is clear: they want nothing to do with this,” Nivyabandi said. “It now falls on the federal government to abolish this abusive and discriminatory practice.” 
The press conference, organized by Amnesty International Canada and Human Rights Watch, featured heartrending testimony from two human rights activists who have experienced the horrors of immigration detention firsthand. Abdelrahman Elmady, who sought refugee protection in Canada in 2017 after fleeing his native Egypt, was held in three different B.C. jails over a span of two months – without having been charged with a crime or given a clear timeline for his release. 
“I spent most of my time in jail in silence because I was only provided with one hearing-aid battery at a time, and only for CBSA meetings and hearings,” said Elmady, who has a hearing disability. “The batteries would run out after a few hours. I was repeatedly handcuffed and strip-searched. This was absolutely humiliating and terrifying, and I had no idea why I was there. I just cried.” 
To this day, Sara Maria Gomez Lopez doesn’t know why she was held in a B.C. jail for three months in 2012 after she claimed refugee status in Canada. “I never understood why the CBSA incarcerated me in the Allouette Correctional Centre for Women in Maple Ridge – a maximum-security provincial jail,” the Mexican-born activist and community worker said. “No one explained the rules and there was no interpretation support in jail. I was expected to automatically know and abide by the rules or risk punishment. I turned into an inmate, a number, a faceless nobody.” 
She said the suicide of Lucia Vega Jimenez, a Mexican refugee claimant who died in immigration detention mere months after Gomez Lopez was released, is a major inspiration for her ongoing advocacy. 
“When I heard about B.C.’s decision in July to stop jailing immigration detainees, I was overjoyed. It felt like one of the most difficult chapters of my life finally closed,” Gomez Lopez told reporters on Monday. “I thought about Lucia. I thought about my cellmates who were with me in immigration detention. And I thought about all the people that will never be jailed in B.C. simply for seeking safety or a better life in this country. 
“I hope the federal government will stop this harmful practice across the country, and finally give way to the humane welcome that has helped heal so many who found refuge in this country.”

On 21 August, authorities issued a Detention Order under the draconian anti-terror law, the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain them for 90 days, amidst an ongoing crackdown on protesters by the authorities. Their families are concerned about their safety and worsening health as they continue to be detained without charge or trial under suspicion of acts of “terror” for over 75 days. All anti-terror charges must be dropped against Galwewa Siridhamma Thero and Wasantha Mudalige and stop the detention order from being extended. 
Detaining protesters using terror charges is a clear violation of the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed by the Constitution of Sri Lanka and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Sri Lanka is a state party. 
Using a draconian law—which the government itself has committed to reform—to crackdown on protesters is against Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations, especially relating to the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. This points to the environment of systematic crackdown and stifling of dissenting voices against the background of the current economic hardship in the country. 
As people in Sri Lanka face the brunt of the ongoing economic crisis, they have the right to express their opinions and call for accountability including through peaceful protests.

Wasantha Mudalige, the convener of the Inter-University Student Federation (IUSF), and Galawewa Siridhamma Thero, the convener of the Inter-University Bhikku Federation (IUBF), were arrested along with other 18 protesters after dispersing a protest in Colombo on 18 August 2022. While others who were arrested following the protests have been released since, Wasantha Mudalige and Galawewa Siridhamma have been detained further. On 21 August, President Ranil Wickremesinghe in his capacity as Defense Minister approved the detention order of 90 days under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). They were transferred to Tangalle Detention Center in the Southern Province of Sri Lanka. On 26 October, The Tangalle Magistrate Court ordered the Director of Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) to appear before the court for not reporting facts about the two student leaders. 
Their family members and lawyer have raised concerns about the safety and deteriorating health while in detention. After multiple public requests from their family members, Galawewa Siridhamma Thero was admitted to Colombo National Hospital on 25 October after suffering from severe rash. He was diagnosed with Dengue fever. 
The Sri Lankan authorities have fiercely clamped down on protests and demonized protesters during a period of economic crisis in the country. The government responded to largely peaceful protests with excessive and unnecessary force and emergency laws which gave sweeping powers to the police and the armed forces, in an effort to curb further demonstrations. Since President Ranil Wickremesinghe came into power on 21 July, over 200 protesters and protest organizers have been arrested, many under draconian anti-terror laws, with authorities routinely flouting due process, creating a chilling effect on the protest movement. President Ranil Wickremesinghe has also publicly labelled protesters as “terrorists” and “fascists”, in a bid to demonize protesters. 
The PTA violates international human rights law and Amnesty International has repeatedly called for its repeal. The PTA, which allows for detention of suspects for up to a year without charge, has been weaponized to stifle dissenting voices, in contravention of Sri Lanka’s international human rights obligations, especially the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Despite the Sri Lankan government’s multiple assurances that the PTA would be reformed in line with international human rights standards, to date no adequate reforms have taken place and the PTA continues to be used as a tool to arbitrarily arrest and detain people, violate fair trial rights, and put detainees at risk of torture and other ill-treatment, amongst other violations. 
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), in its 2016 submission to the UN Committee against Torture, highlighted the use of torture in Sri Lanka with “torture being routinely used in all parts of the country regardless of the nature of the suspected offence for which the person is arrested.” Another study conducted by the Commission, published in December 2020, found that PTA detainees faced a continuum of violence. The study documented that “violence in police custody was found to be an inherent element of the investigation process, whereby torture is inflicted to extract information, confessions, and evidence from detainees.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called on the Sri Lankan government to establish a moratorium on the use of the PTA for new arrests until it is replaced by legislation that adheres to international best practices.

0,Amnesty International Canada welcomes repeal of ‘chilling’ Ontario anti-strike bill,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/news-releases/ontario-bill-28/,"Violating workers' right to strike goes against Canada's international human rights obligations, Amnesty International Canada says.","Amnesty International Canada welcomes the Ontario government’s announcement that it will repeal Bill 28 and resume bargaining with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). 
On Thursday, November 3, Ontario’s provincial parliament passed Bill 28, a law that unilaterally imposed new contracts on 55,000 educational assistants, school custodians, early childhood educators, secretaries and other professionals represented by CUPE and made it illegal for them to proceed with a planned strike. Facing outcry from the public and civil society organizations, the government announced on Monday it would walk back Bill 28 if CUPE agreed to end a walkout that had begun on Friday.  
‘By forcing through this legislation, the province sent a chilling message to rights-holders in Canada and abroad: that it is acceptable for their governments to trample upon people’s rights when it is politically expedient to do so. It should never have been invoked to silence workers in the first place.’  
“The right to strike is enshrined in international human rights and labour treaties that Canada and Ontario have a duty to respect,” Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Ketty Nivyabandi said on Monday. 
“By forcing through this legislation, the province sent a chilling message to rights-holders in Canada and abroad: that it is acceptable for their governments to trample upon people’s rights when it is politically expedient to do so. It should never have been invoked to silence workers in the first place.”   
International law guarantees fundamental human rights such as the rights of peaceful assembly, freedom of expression, and freedom of association with others, including the right for trade union members to strike. Canada has international obligations to uphold these rights and to refrain from impairing or interfering with them. 
The right to strike is constitutionally protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, the Ontario government invoked the notwithstanding clause to impose new contracts on the CUPE workers and quash their planned strike. A rarely used and highly controversial constitutional override, the notwithstanding clause allows the state to pass laws and policies that infringe some of the rights outlined in the Charter. 
By targeting some of the lowest-paid workers in Ontario’s education system, the province’s actions may also conflict with Canada’s international treaty obligations guaranteeing the social, cultural, and economic rights of all persons equally. People belonging to historically marginalized groups, Nivyabandi noted, are disproportionately represented among those affected by Bill 28. According to CUPE, more than 70 per cent are women; more than half work at least one additional job to make ends meet; and 60 per cent are laid off every summer. 
“Targeted but not silenced, these courageous workers, mostly women facing intersecting systemic barriers, have spoken out for themselves,” Nivyabandi said. “They must be heard.”

The Egyptian authorities continue to deny her access to her family and adequate healthcare despite her serious health problems including kidney failure and a heart condition, and her history of hospitalization. She must be immediately and unconditionally released. 
After spending 35 months in pre-trial detention, the Supreme State Security Prosecution referred her to trial in front of an Emergency State Security Court (ESSC). She is charged with joining, financing and supporting a “terrorist group” and disseminating news on social media in order to incite violence against state institutions in relation to accusations of human rights violations by security forces published on a Facebook page titled “the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms”. Proceedings by the ESSCs, which are special courts activated when there is a state of emergency, are inherently unfair as their verdicts are not subject to appeal. Her right to adequate defence has also been violated, as she is banned from meeting with her lawyer except in court. The trial began on 11 September and is still ongoing. During a court hearing held on 15 October, Hoda Abdelmoniem briefly told her husband about her worsening conditions of detention but had no opportunity to provide further details. 
On 23 August 2022, Hoda Abdelmoniem’s husband and daughters were allowed to visit her in prison for the first time since her arrest. The visit, which lasted 25 minutes, took place in the presence of security officers which prevented her from speaking freely. She has a heart condition, kidney disease, arterial thrombosis, and high blood pressure, and said in court in October 2021 that a prison doctor recommended for her to have a cardiac catheterization. Despite this, officials at the al-Qanater Prison for women, where she is held, continue to refuse her transfer to an outside hospital for treatment and deny her relatives, access to her medical records, further raising their anguish about her health.

On 1 November 2018, National Security Agency forces (NSA) broke into the house of Hoda Abdelmoniem in Cairo at 1:30 am, ransacked it, and took her away blindfolded. She was subjected to enforced disappearance for three weeks after her arrest until she was brought to the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) for investigation. She was then taken back to an undisclosed location. Her family briefly saw her again on 24 and 28 November 2018 at the SSSP office. She was subjected to enforced disappearance again between 2 December 2018 and 14 January 2019, as authorities refused to disclose her whereabouts to relatives and lawyers. 
On the day of Hoda Abdelmoniem’s arrest, 1 November 2018, the Egyptian authorities launched a series of raids, arresting at least 31 human rights defenders and lawyers; 10 women and 21 men. The Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), which documents enforced disappearances and the use of the death penalty, and provides legal aid to victims of human rights violations, was particularly targeted by the crackdown. In a statement published on 1 November 2018 announcing the suspension of its human rights work, ECRF cited the situation in Egypt as incompatible with human rights work and demanded the UN Human Rights Council to intervene. 
On 30 November 2020, Hoda Abdelmoinem’s family learned from other prisoners’ relatives that she was taken to the prison hospital before being transferred to an external hospital after suffering from severe pain. While her loved ones have been denied access to her medical records by prison authorities and therefore don’t have detailed information about her condition, they were informed by other prisoners’ families that one of her kidneys had failed, while the other was functioning poorly. On 1 December 2020, the interior ministry publicly claimed that she has been provided with health care and does not suffer from serious medical conditions. 
On 23 August 2021, the SSSP referred Hoda Abdelmoniem as well as human rights defender and founder of the ECRF, Ezzat Ghoniem, Aisha al-Shater, daughter of Muslim Brotherhood leader Shairat al-Shater, and lawyer Mohamed Abu Horira, as well as 27 other defendants to trial in front of an Emergency State Security Court (ESSC). The SSSP indicted them on various charges, including membership in a terrorist group (the Muslim Brotherhood), disseminating false news about human rights abuses by security forces through a Facebook page titled “the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms”, funding a terrorist group and possession of pamphlets to promote the terrorist group’s objectives. During a court hearing held on 11 October 2021, Hoda Abdelmoniem told the judges that the prison doctor said she required a cardiac catheterization, and requested her release on medical grounds. She reported also being told by the prison doctor that transfers to external hospitals were suspended because of Covid-19. Amnesty International is aware of the transfer of other prisoners to external hospitals since the Covid-19 outbreak, including Hoda Abdelmoniem’s brief transfer on 30 November 2020 for treatment for suspected kidney failure. 
On 25 October 2021, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi announced that he would not extend the state of emergency, in force since 2017, which allowed for the creation of ESSCs. Article 19 of the law governing the state of emergency stipulates that ongoing trials are to continue even after the state of emergency is no longer in force. In the three months preceding the decision not to renew the state of emergency, the Egyptian authorities referred at least 20 human rights defenders, activists and opposition politicians to trial before emergency courts. 
Proceedings in front of ESSCs are inherently unfair. Defendants are denied the right to appeal their convictions and sentences to a higher tribunal. Only the president retains the power to authorize, quash or commute sentences or to order a retrial. Other documented fair trial violations include the right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence, right to communicate with counsel of their own choosing and right to a public hearing. In addition, judges at the ESSC routinely deny requests by lawyers to photocopy casefiles, which in some cases exceed 2,000 pages, instead instructing them to review them in court. Prosecutors and judges have also failed to provide copies of indictment orders to defendants and their lawyers, undermining their right to be informed of the exact nature and cause of charges against them. 
Hoda Abdelmoniem volunteered as a consultant for the ECRF and had been active in documenting human rights violations including cases of enforced disappearances. She is a former member of the National Council for Human Rights and of the Egyptian Bar Association. She had been banned from travelling outside of Egypt since late 2013 without being charged with any offence. On 27 November 2020, the Council of Bars and Law Societies of Europe granted its 2020 Human Rights Award to Hoda Abdelmoneim and six other detained lawyers in Egypt.

The human rights defender has faced persistent harassment by...,"French-Palestinian lawyer Salah Hammouri remains held without charge or trial in Israel after suspending his 19-day-long hunger strike in protest at the renewal of his administrative detention. The human rights defender has faced persistent harassment by the Israeli authorities since 2002, including action to revoke his Jerusalem residency status and ongoing administrative detention since March 2022. He spent 15 days in solitary confinement in a dirty, small and windowless cell without contact with the outside world as punishment for going on hunger strike, together with 29 other Palestinian detainees. The Israeli authorities must immediately release Salah Hammouri unless he is promptly charged and ensure that he is allowed to keep his residency status in Jerusalem and continue his human rights work without fear of reprisals.  
On 7 March 2022 he was arrested and on 10 March 2022, the Military Commander of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the occupied West Bank issued a three-month administrative order, extending his detention without charge or trial until 6 June 2022 and without any means to effectively challenge the detention. The detention order was renewed twice since then, most recently on 4 September 2022, merely hours before Salah Hammouri’s expected release, and is now set to expire on 4 December 2022.  
During this period, on 26 July 2022 the Israeli Prison Services forcibly transferred Salah Hammouri to Hadarim prison after classifying him as a high-risk security prisoner (also known as “Sagav” in Hebrew). The transfer occurred shortly after he wrote an open letter to French President Emmanuel Macron, raising concern that he was being punished for his peaceful activism. On 25 September 2022, Salah Hammouri went on hunger strike together with 29 Palestinian administrative detainees to protest Israel’s widespread and systematic use of this cruel and unjust form of detention. As punishment for his hunger strike, on 28 September 2022, he was moved into solitary confinement in a dirty isolation cell measuring only four-square metres, without access to open air or light for 15 days and deprived of any contact with the outside world.Salah Hammouri faces a real risk of deportation following Israeli authorities’ actions since September 2020 to revoke his permanent residency status, with his administrative detention order being used against him to expedite actions towards his forcible deportation. According to his lawyer, while Salah Hammouri was in solitary confinement, he was pressured by Israeli prison officials, who told him that if he accepted to leave Jerusalem and go to France, he would be released.Write to the Minister of Defense urging him to:• immediately release Salah Hammouri and all others who have been placed under administrative detention, unless they are promptly charged with an internationally recognizable crime and tried in proceedings that adhere to international fair trial standards• ensure that he is allowed to keep his residency status in Jerusalem and continue with his human rights work without fear of reprisals

Salah Hammouri is a French-Palestinian lawyer who lives in the neighbourhood of Kufr Aqab in East Jerusalem. He holds a Jerusalem residency permit and works as a field researcher for Addameer, a legal aid and prisoners’ rights NGO that, together with five other civil society groups, was baselessly declared by the Israeli government a “terrorist organization” in October 2021. UN human rights experts condemned this move as a misuse of counterterrorism measures and a “frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights movement, and on human rights everywhere”. The Israeli authorities have persistently harassed and targeted Salah Hammouri. Since 2000, Israeli authorities have detained Salah Hammouri multiple times, including twice when he was placed under administrative detention – for five months in 2004 and for 13 months in 2017 and 2018. 
Israeli authorities have also violated his rights to freedom of movement and to family. He is also at risk of forcible deportation as the Israeli authorities have taken action to revoke his Jerusalem residency status. On 3 September 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Interior notified Salah Hammouri of its intention to revoke his permanent residency status on the grounds of “breach of allegiance” to the State of Israel. Salah Hammouri awaits a final ruling by the Israeli High Court, after exhausting the appeals process. According to his lawyer, there is concern that this most recent administrative detention order will be used against him to expedite actions towards his forcible deportation. On 26 July 2022, he was moved to a high-security prison – Hadarim – and was classified as a “high-security risk” prisoner. On 25 September 2022, he joined a mass hunger strike by 30 Palestinian administrative detainees to protest Israel’s unjust and cruel practice of administrative detention. He was placed in punitive solitary confinement as a result. He was detained in a dirty and pest-infested isolation cell measuring approximately four-square metres, without access to open air or natural light for 15 days. He was deprived of any contact with the outside world and was under permanent video surveillance during that time. In addition, he faced pressure by Israeli prison officials, who told him that if he accepted to leave his hometown – Jerusalem – and go to France, this detention would end. 
In 2021, Salah Hammouri—along with five other Palestinian human rights defenders—was hacked with Pegasus, a spyware developed by Israeli cyber-surveillance company NSO Group. 
Under administrative detention, individuals are detained by Israeli state authorities without intent to prosecute them in a criminal trial. Orders can be renewed indefinitely, and evidence is kept secret, meaning that detainees are not able to effectively challenge their detention and do not know when they will be released. From 1 January 2022 until 1 July 2022, hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention, including Salah, have boycotted Israeli military courts in protest at their detention without charge or trial. 
Evidence collected by Amnesty International and other human rights groups over decades indicates that administrative detention is used as an intentional Israeli policy to detain individuals, including prisoners of conscience held solely for the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association and to punish them for their views and activism challenging the policies of occupation. According to Addameer, as of 10 October 2022, there were around 800 Palestinian administrative detainees, including three Palestinian Legislative Council members, held indefinitely in Israeli prisons without charge or trial. There were two women and six children amongst the total number of those held in administrative detention; the rest were men.

At the UN General Assembly today, Special Rapporteur Balakrishnan Rajagopal presented a report on housing rights worldwide which states that the system of racial oppression and discrimination that has led to the destruction of Palestinian homes “is nothing short of apartheid”.  
Military incursions, closures, state-backed settler attacks, home demolitions, and destruction of property are all manifestations of Israel’s apartheid system 
Amnesty International welcomed the Special Rapporteur’s report, which comes amid an escalation in attacks on Palestinians and their property across the occupied West Bank. In recent weeks Palestinian families participating in the annual olive harvest have been subjected to violent attacks by Israeli settlers, who have the direct backing of the Israeli military. Meanwhile the military has imposed a closure on the city of Nablus and surrounding villages since 12 October, severely disrupting the daily lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The closure – ostensibly a response to several shooting attacks targeting Israeli soldiers – amounts to unlawful collective punishment. 
“Israeli authorities’ domination and control of the Palestinian population, including through discriminatory land, planning and housing policies, is well documented, and extends to Palestinians wherever Israel has control over their rights,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa.   
“There is growing recognition among human rights experts that Israel is committing apartheid, and the presentation of this report today could not be more timely. As well as the ongoing threat of forced eviction, demolition, and forcible transfer, there has recently been an alarming escalation in attacks on Palestinians in their homes and towns throughout the occupied West Bank. Military incursions, closures, state-backed settler attacks, home demolitions, and destruction of property are all manifestations of Israel’s apartheid system.”  
In his report, the Special Rapporteur cites several examples of Israeli government laws and policies which are used to confiscate Palestinian land and property, such as the Absentee Property Law and land registration procedures.   
Israeli authorities also use the designation “firing zone” or “closed military zone” to confiscate Palestinian lands. Approximately 20% of the occupied West Bank has been designated as “firing zones”, and Palestinian presence is banned there without permission from the Israeli army. This affects more than 5,000 Palestinians from 38 communities, who are hit with eviction orders, threatened with displacement, or forced to leave their homes while the military conducts training exercises. In the community of Masafer Yatta in the occupied West Bank, more than 1,000 people are facing forcible eviction due to this policy.   
I watch the army jeeps drive up twice a day and I dread that they are coming to demolish again 
On 13 October, Amnesty International researchers visited Palestinian shepherding communities in the northern Jordan Valley, including the hamlet of Humsa which is in a designated “firing zone”. Nitham Abu Kbash, a shepherd from the community, told Amnesty International how his home and animal pens were destroyed repeatedly by the Israeli army last year.  
Three families were made homeless, and had to move to another area that was also officially forbidden. Since then, the Israeli military has carried out regular patrols and confiscated humanitarian aid donated to make the families’ homes more stable.  
“I watch the army jeeps drive up twice a day and I dread that they are coming to demolish again,” said Nitham Abu Kbash. “Not even the European diplomats could protect us – the military confiscated the aid from under their noses.”  
In the nearby community of Makhul, Amnesty International spoke to two brothers who described their fear whenever settlers approach in tractors and 4-wheel-drive vehicles:  
“The children are terrified because these men shine strong lights into our homes at night, set their dogs on us and on the sheep, and they drive all over our yard,” said Yusef Bisharat. “Some of the ewes miscarried their lambs this season, from the stress.”  
The right to housing is also under attack inside Israel. On 24 October, Israeli forces demolished the Palestinian Bedouin village of Al-Araqeeb in the Negev/Naqab for the 208th time.  
ACT NOW 
In Gaza, thousands of houses destroyed by Israeli air strikes in previous offensives have not been rebuilt because of the Israeli blockade and restrictions on entry of construction material.   
Palestinian farmers in the occupied West Bank have recently faced a surge of Israeli military incursions, restrictions on access to land and water, and the destruction of their crops by Israeli settlers in line with patterns documented in previous years during the annual olive harvest.  According to Israeli human rights organization Yesh Din, a group of settlers last week attacked olive farmers in villages including Burin and Kisan in the northern West Bank. 
The olive harvest is a time when Palestinian families should be celebrating[…] This year, once again, it has been violently disrupted by Israeli military closures and state-backed settler violence.  
On 19 October, a group of settlers attacked international and Israeli activists who had come to support the Palestinian farmers. According to the UN, 194 Palestinians have been injured as a result of settler attacks so far in 2022, and three Palestinians have been killed. The Israeli authorities have failed to bring those responsible to justice – for example, in August Israeli police dropped their investigation into the killing of Ali Hassan Harb, who was stabbed to death in his olive grove on 21 June 2022.  
Many Palestinian farming communities have come to expect such violence every harvesting season. The military’s evictions and the settlers’ violence take place in a culture of impunity and act in tandem to displace Palestinians to benefit illegal Israeli settlements.   
“Israeli authorities are violating Palestinians’ right to housing in every way imaginable – bulldozing homes, making it impossible for Palestinians to build on their own land, and protecting settlers who burn the ancestral olive groves of Palestinian families,” said Heba Morayef.  
“The olive harvest is a time when Palestinian families should be celebrating and reaping the fruits of their labour after carefully tending their crops for a year. But this year, once again, it has been violently disrupted by Israeli military closures and state-backed settler violence.”  
More than 175,000 people around the world have so far signed Amnesty International’s Demolish Apartheid Not Palestinian Homes petition, which calls on the Israeli government to immediately end home demolitions and forced evictions.  
In a research briefing released earlier this week, Amnesty International highlighted how 1,700 Palestinian homes were destroyed or damaged during Israel’s August 2022 offensive on Gaza, leading to the internal displacement of some 450 Palestinians.

In a detailed statement, the organization lists the names and circumstances surrounding the killing of 23children as a result of unlawful force during protests from 20 September to 30 September 2022. Thevictims included 20 boys aged between 11 and 17; and three girls, two of whom were 16 years old andone 17 years old. Most of the boys were killed by security forces unlawfully firing live ammunition atthem. Two boys died after being shot with metal pellets at close range, while three girls and a boy diedafter fatal beatings by security forces. 
Children represent 16% of overall deaths of protesters and bystanders recorded by AmnestyInternational. The organization has so far recorded the names and details of 144 men, women andchildren killed by Iran’s security forces between 19 September and 3 October. The victims recorded arelimited to those whose names the organization has been able to identify thus far. The organization iscontinuing its investigations into reported killings and believes the death toll is higher. 
Iran’s security forces have killed at least two dozen children in an attempt to crush the spirit ofresistance among the country’s courageous youth. If the international community were a person, howwould it look these children and their parents in the eye? It would lower its head in shame over itsinaction against the pervasive impunity enjoyed by the Iranian authorities for their systematic crimesand gross violations of human rights. 
“The Iranian authorities have repeatedly ignored all calls to cease the unlawful use of force and toprosecute those responsible for unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment of protesters, bystanders and of people deprived of their liberty. The price of this systematic impunity is being paid with human lives, including children’s. Member states engaging at the UN Human Rights Council should urgently hold a special session and adopt a resolution to establish an international independent investigative and accountability mechanism on Iran.”Ten of the recorded child victims belonged to Iran’s oppressed Baluchi minority and were killed bysecurity forces on the deadliest day of the crackdown, 30 September, in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistanprovince. Evidence gathered by Amnesty International shows at least seven of the children killed inZahedan were shot in the heart, head or other vital organs.According to informed sources and audio-visual evidence examined by the organization, one of them,Javad Pousheh, aged 11, was shot in the back of his head with live ammunition fired by security forcesduring a violent crackdown on a protest taking place after Friday prayers outside a police station andnear a large prayer site. The bullet exited through his right cheek leaving a large gaping hole.The remaining 13 children were killed in the provinces of Tehran (5), West Azerbaijan (4), Alborz (1),Kermanshah (1), Kohgilouyeh and Bouyer Ahmad (1), and Zanjan (1). Two of the children killed were ofAfghan nationality – a 14-year-old boy, Mohammad Reza Sarvari, and a 17-year-old girl, Setareh Tajik.Authorities spreading false narrativesOn 7 October, the lawyer of Mohammad Reza Sarvari who was shot dead by security forces duringprotests in Shahr-e Rey, Tehran province, on 21 September, published online a copy of the child’s burialcertificate, which listed the cause of death as “bleeding and shattered brain tissue” caused by “being hitwith a fast-moving projectile”. The lawyer wrote that he felt obliged to share the official document giventhe propagation of false narratives by the authorities in state media and through statements by officialsincreasingly attributing the death of children killed by security forces to “suicide”.Security forces fired both metal pellets and live ammunition at Amir Mehdi Farrokhipour, aged 17,during protests in Tehran on 28 September. According to informed sources, he died from gunshotwounds in his chest, while intelligence officials forced his father to record a video statement stating thathis son died during a car accident, threatening to kill or otherwise harm his daughters if he refused.Other examples of state cover up efforts include the cases of two 16-year-old girls, Nika Shakarami andSarina Esmailzadeh, who were killed after security forces fatally beat them on their heads. Intelligenceand security forces have subjected the girls’ families to intense harassment and intimidation to coercethem into recording video statements reiterating the official narrative that their children committed“suicide” by jumping off a roof.The latest wave of protest killings is rooted in a deep crisis of systemic impunity for the most seriouscrimes under international law that has long prevailed in Iran and which, given the scale and severity ofpast and ongoing human rights violations, has not been sufficiently addressed by the UN Human RightsCouncil. An international investigative and accountability mechanism is urgently needed to collect,consolidate, preserve, and analyze evidence of the most serious crimes under international lawcommitted in Iran and other serious violations of human rights in a manner that meets generalstandards of admissibility in criminal proceedings and to assist in the investigation and prosecution ofthose suspected of criminal responsibility.“The Iranian authorities are systematically harassing and intimidating victims’ families to hide the truththat they have the blood of children on their hands. These despicable methods further underline thescale and depravity of the Iranian authorities’ crackdown and provide further proof that all avenues fortruth and justice are closed at the domestic level,” said Heba Morayef.BackgroundAmnesty International has revealed that Iran’s highest military body instructed the commanders ofarmed forces in all provinces to “severely confront” protesters who took to the streets following thedeath in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini at the hands of Iran’s morality police. The organization hasdocumented widespread, unwarranted use of lethal force and firearms by Iranian security forces whoeither intended to kill protesters or should have known with a reasonable degree of certainty that theiruse of firearms would result in deaths.Iranian authorities have previously reacted to protests with similar patterns of unlawful use of force,including lethal force, which, for example, resulted in the death of hundreds of protesters andbystanders, including at least 21 children, during the protests of November 2019.

“Russia must immediately stop its war of aggression. All those responsible for the aggression and war crimes, including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers, and heads of state should be held criminally responsible for their actions.” 
Background 
In the early hours and morning of 10 October, Russian forces carried out massive missile strikes on Kyiv and several other Ukrainian cities, including Dnipro, Zaporizhzhya, and Zhytomyr, among others. According to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, around 40 rockets fired by Russian forces hit targets in Ukraine. 
Critical infrastructure facilities like power plants and power substations in eight regions of Ukraine and in Kyiv seem to be the main targets of the attacks, which led to mass power shortages across the country and many train delays. According to Ukraine’s national police, out of 117 buildings damaged throughout the country 29 were critical infrastructure facilities, four were multi-storey buildings and 35 private residential houses. 
While Kyiv was one of the first targets at the start of the of the full-scale invasion by Russia, this is the first time its historic centre has been hit. Four Kyiv city districts came under attacks that damaged, among others, one of the buildings of the Kyiv National Shevchenko University, a pedestrian bridge and a playground in Shevchenko Park. 
While Kyiv was one of the first targets at the start of the of the full-scale invasion by Russia, this is the first time its historic centre has been hit 
According to the State Service of Emergency Situations, today’s attacks killed 11 people (five in Kyiv) and injured 89 across the country. 
Russia’s President Vladimir Putin welcomed the attacks, claiming them to be targeting “energy facilities, military administration and communications of Ukraine.” 
Accountability for war crimes  
Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and other violations of international human rights and humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here.   
Amnesty International has called repeatedly for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for the aggression and violations to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.

Vladimir Kara-Murza is a man of courage and conviction who believes that human rights and dignity should prevail over fear 
“Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian authorities enacted a witch-hunt against politicians, activists and journalists who dared to condemn the Kremlin and its war of aggression. Vladimir Kara-Murza was among the first state critics targeted under this vicious campaign. 
“Vladimir Kara-Murza should be immediately and unconditionally released, as should all those who have been prosecuted and convicted for peacefully criticizing the Russian armed forces”. 
Background 
In April 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was arrested for sharing “fake news” about the actions of the Russian military in Ukraine (Article 207.3 of Russia’s Criminal Code), after having served arbitrarily 15 days’ detention for “disobeying a police officer.” 
He was charged after giving a speech at the Arizona House of Representatives in March, in which he criticized Vladimir Putin’s policies, denounced the West’s “appeasement” of the Kremlin, and highlighted the importance of the protest movement in Russia. 
In July, he was also charged with “organizing the activities of an undesirable organization” (Article 284.1(1)) over his alleged involvement with Otkrytaya Rossiya (Open Russia) and Foundation Free Russia, two NGOs that are labelled by the Russian authorities as ‘undesirable.’ 
On 6 October, the Russian authorities charged Vladimir Kara-Murza with “high treason” (Article 275). According to their investigation, the activist cooperated with a NATO country, as “proven” by his critical public speeches in Lisbon, Helsinki and Washington, DC.

This blog was originally published in Spain’s El Diario 
The Chilean Attorney General’s Office is continuing investigations, seemingly now very seriously, into several current and former Chilean public officials including the former president Sebastián Piñera, the former General Director of the Carabineros (Chilean National police), Mario Rozas, and the current General Director under the administration of President Boric, Ricardo Yáñez, for their alleged actions or omissions during the police violence in the mass protests in 2019. 
The inquiries are based on three charges: one for crimes against humanity and two others for generalized torture (unlawful coercion) against protesters during the period of social unrest. These investigations are in line with the findings of Amnesty International’s report Eyes on Chile: Police violence and command responsibility during the period of social unrest. At the time, Chile made world news for holding, in record time, the grim title of country with the highest number of people with eye injuries caused by police officers. 
Chile could be the example that the Americas needs, proving that demanding rights is worth the effort and worthy of respect. 
What started as isolated protests in Santiago very quickly turned into mass demonstrations throughout the whole country demanding quality education and public health, social security, and decent work. Social unrest that had been building up for decades exploded in an unexpected way. However, the actions of the police were even more unexpected. 
Carabineros and the government of then President Sebastián Piñera made every effort to portray the demonstrations as acts of vandalism that warranted the use of force due to “serious breach of the peace” and “attacks on public and private property”. The use of Molotov cocktails or stones against the police, despite the fact that these were isolated incidents, was the straw that the authorities grasped at in order to justify their repression. Social media was flooded with images of police violence that was clearly excessive. 
Between 18 October and 30 November alone, at least three people were killed by state agents and the number of people treated in emergency departments reached 12,500, according to the Ministry of Health. 
The Carabineros and the government decided to ignore the fact that international human rights law and Chilean national law prioritize the protection of people over the protection of material objects for one simple reason: the value of life is greater than the value of objects, which, unlike life, can be restored. 
Disregarding that premise led to disaster, and the Attorney General’s Office and the Judicial Branch may now consider this criminal conduct on the part of National Police commanders who allowed it to happen. 
Among the most serious conduct attributed to the Chilean police, the use of shotguns loaded with highly injurious ammunition and concealed by the official narrative as ‘rubber bullets’ stood out. These were cartridges containing 12 pellets consisting of a rubber and metal alloy that penetrates the skin, which are impossible to aim and which the Carabineros fired indiscriminately. Rubber bullets, the use of which should be exceptional, must always be directed at a single person and only if that person puts the life or safety of another person at risk. 
Despite the evidence and the number of injuries increasing day by day, the authorities, including Carabinero commanders, wasted their breath insisting that the bullets they used were made of rubber, because that is how they appeared in the purchase orders. This is akin to claiming that a tiger is a cat simply because the person selling it says that it is. 
One of the greatest tragedies was the number of people who suffered eye injuries, mostly due to this ammunition fired from Hatsan Escort shotguns. In a month and a half, almost 350 people, most of them young people, unjustifiably acquired a lifelong disability. 
In a continent that has seen numerous outbursts of public unrest over the last five years as a result of disillusionment with leaders and their policies due to impunity, corruption, and lack of opportunity in the face of the wealth of the few, Chile could be the example that the Americas needs, proving that demanding rights is worth the effort and worthy of respect. 
No society can move in the right direction without justice. To do so at the expense of the suffering of the victims would be to build change on shaky foundations. This is why, as part of this change, it is essential to make progress in the investigations and subsequent criminal proceedings against all those who may be responsible for the injuries, aftereffects, and the pain of so many others who fought to make Chile a better country. 
In the report Eyes on Chile, Amnesty International called for the investigation of Carabinero strategic commanders, at least the then General Director, Deputy General Director and Director of Order and Security. The time has come for the Attorney General’s Office to decide whether to apply, with sufficient and admissible evidence to do so, for indictment, and for justice to move forward.

The adoption of the UN Human Rights Council’s resolution underscores the critical need to continue documenting crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses 
“The adoption of the UN Human Rights Council’s resolution to extend the mandate of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia underscores the critical need to continue to document crimes under international law and human rights violations and abuses, and preserve the evidence of crimes that are currently being committed in the country. 
“This decision gives hope to the victims of the ongoing human rights violations in Ethiopia that someone is standing with them and that all those suspected of criminal responsibility are being watched to ensure justice, truth and reparation for victims. 
The Ethiopian government must give full access to the Commission and fully support its work 
“The Ethiopian government must give full access to the Commission and fully support its work. The United Nations General Assembly must support the mandate given to the ICHREE, including with the resources and staffing it needs. Additionally, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and Ethiopian Human Rights Commission should fully support and cooperate by facilitating access to information and evidence held in their custody.” 
Background 
For decades, Amnesty International has documented gross human rights violations and abuses that amount to crimes under international law in Ethiopia. In the ongoing conflict in northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International has documented crimes committed by all parties to the conflict, including war crimes. 
Gaps in Ethiopian criminal laws impede justice, truth and reparation for gross human rights violations, both past and present. Impunity is exacerbated by the fact that the government is not able to exercise jurisdiction over some of the forces, including the Eritrean Defence Forces and the Tigrayan forces, suspected of responsibility for violations and abuses in northern Ethiopia.Amnesty International recalls that all states are permitted to exercise jurisdiction over crimes under international law, regardless of where the crimes were committed, or the nationality of the suspect or the victims.

Under Vladimir Putin’s leadership, the country has seen its political opposition crushed, grassroots NGOs and activists outlawed, independent media shuttered, and civil society as a whole scorched to the ground. Russia’s unlawful aggression in Ukraine could not be a clearer demonstration of Vladimir Putin’s longstanding disregard for life and human rights.”

We call on all states to support the swift establishment of this monitoring and reporting mandate, and to fully support victims of human rights and humanitarian law violations committed by the national authorities. We call on the Russian authorities to heed the clear message that the Human Rights Council sends with the establishment of this mechanism, and to fundamentally change course to cease its violations at home and abroad. 
“The successful vote today does not draw the sting from yesterday’s failure of the Human Rights Council to schedule a debate on the situation in Xinjiang China, but it does show that the Council has the capability to address grave situations based on their merits.

The leaks obtained by the Guacamaya collective from various servers belonging to the armed forces in different countries in the region have revealed monitoring of the activities of civil society organizations, including Amnesty International, by the military in Mexico and Peru so far, showing the deterioration of respect for human rights, Amnesty International said today. 
“The undue monitoring of civil society organizations identified in the Guacamaya collective leaks is an example of the hostile context in which we work as organizations defending human rights in the Americas. If the military in countries like Mexico and Peru have been unduly monitoring our work, undermining the defence of victims of human rights violations, we are even more concerned about the attacks that our partner organizations and human rights defenders through the region could face,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“Instead of monitoring the activities of civil society organizations, the military and other authorities in the region should be ensuring a favourable environment for the defence of rights and acknowledging the important role played by human rights defenders. The monitoring revealed is unacceptable. Amnesty International strongly condemns this and demands full clarification of these actions.” 
The undue monitoring of civil society organizations identified in the Guacamaya collective leaks is an example of the hostile context in which we work as organizations defending human rights in the Americas. If the military in countries like Mexico and Peru have been unduly monitoring our work, undermining the defence of victims of human rights violations, we are even more concerned about the attacks that our partner organizations and human rights defenders through the region could face. 
In Mexico, the media outlet Proceso published a Ministry of Defense document containing multiple references to Amnesty International’s observations on the enforced disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students in 2014. Among the recommendations in the document, it is proposed to “avoid the participation of Amnesty International” in a visit by the parents of the students to the barracks of the 27th Infantry Battalion in Iguala, Guerrero. In addition, references are made to statements made by Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, in relation to the failures in the investigation into the possible responsibility of the armed forces for the enforced disappearance of the students, indicating the monitoring was carried out in order to cover up the already dismantled “historical truth”. 
According to Peruvian media outlet La Encerrona, Amnesty International, together with partner organizations in Peru such as IDL, Derechos Humanos sin Fronteras and CooperAcción, were also mentioned in Peruvian military documents leaked, in which their activities to defend human rights are linked to the social conflict in Cusco and Apurímac. Amnesty International has not had access to the full documents but believes that the state must protect and guarantee the defence of human rights. Amnesty International has repeatedly documented how organizations defending human rights in Peru are working in hostile contexts, facing constant stigmatization and criminalization.

“Today’s vote protects the perpetrators of human rights violations rather than the victims – a dismaying result that puts the UN’s main human rights body in the farcical position of ignoring the findings of the UN’s own human rights office. 
“The recent report on Xinjiang by the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights was an important step forward in addressing crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations committed by the Chinese government in Xinjiang, yet today the UN has taken two steps back. 
For Council member states to vote against even discussing a situation where the UN itself says crimes against humanity may have occurred makes a mockery of everything the Human Rights Council is supposed to stand for. 
“Member states’ silence – or worse, blocking of debate – in the face of the atrocities committed by the Chinese government further sullies the reputation of the Human Rights Council. Political and economic interests should not trump serious human rights concerns, and no state should be shielded from scrutiny at the Human Right Council. 
“The UN Human Rights Council has today failed the test to uphold its core mission, which is to protect the victims of human rights violations everywhere, including in places such as Xinjiang. 
“Despite the deeply disappointing result of this vote, the fight for justice and truth for those victims and their families continues. The decision was rejected by a slim margin and it is critical for UN Human Rights Council member states to revisit this vote and continue efforts to highlight the human rights situation in Xinjiang at the earliest. 
“Amnesty International will continue to demand accountability even when multiple governments fail to, and we look forward to continued scrutiny of the situation by UN experts as well as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.”   
Background 
Despite the findings of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in August that crimes against humanity may have occurred in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) member states today voted against adopting a decision to discuss the human rights situation in Xinjiang (17 votes for, 19 votes against, 11 abstentions). The debate would have taken place at the UNHRC’s next regular session in March 2023. 
The OHCHR report documented patterns of torture or other ill-treatment as well as incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, among a catalogue of human rights violations, finding that the “extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups … may constitute … crimes against humanity.” 
Since 2017, there has been extensive documentation of China’s crackdown against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, carried out under the guise of fighting terrorism. In 2021, a comprehensive  report by Amnesty International demonstrated that the systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution perpetrated by Chinese authorities amounted to crimes against humanity.  
Amnesty International’s Free Xinjiang Detainees campaign has, to date, profiled 126 individuals who are among the perhaps one million or more people in arbitrary detention in internment camps and prisons in Xinjiang.

Since then, another 16 people were killed in separate incidents in Zahedan amid an ongoing clampdown on protests. Evidence gathered from activists, victims’ families, eyewitness testimonies, and images and videos of the protests suggest the real death toll from Zahedan is likely to be higher. 
Widely referred to by Iranians as “bloody Friday”, the onslaught on 30 September marked the deadliest day on record since protests started spreading across Iran nearly three weeks ago, after Mahsa Amini died in custody following her arrest by Iran’s “morality” police.  
“The Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown utter disregard for the sanctity of human life and will stop at nothing to preserve power. The callous violence being unleashed by Iran’s security forces is not occurring in a vacuum. It is the result of systematic impunity and a lacklustre response by the international community,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
The Iranian authorities have repeatedly shown utter disregard for the sanctity of human life and will stop at nothing to preserve power 
“It is particularly abhorrent that nearly three years after the November 2019 protests, in which hundreds of people were unlawfully killed, the Iranian authorities have shamelessly continued their ruthless assault on human life. The only way to break the impunity that empowers such actions is for UN member states to urgently establish an independent investigative and accountability mechanism for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Iran”.  
A calculated plan to crush protests at any cost 
Protests in Zahedan, Sistan and Baluchistan province, populated by the long-oppressed Baluchi ethnic minority, were scheduled to take place after Friday prayers on 30 September as a show of solidarity with nationwide protests and to demand accountability for the reported rape of a 15-year-old girl by a police commander in the province. 
On 30 September, as a group of people finished praying in the Great Mosalla of Zahedan, a large prayer site near the city’s main mosque, and gathered outside the police station across the road to protest and chant, security forces fired live ammunition, metal pellets and tear gas at them from the police station rooftop.  
Simultaneously, plain-clothed security forces fired at protesters and bystanders from the rooftops of several nearby houses, as corroborated by photographs shared by activists. 
Security forces also unlawfully fired live ammunition, metal pellets and teargas directly into the vicinity of the Mosalla, where hundreds of people, including children and older people, were still performing Friday prayers. 
Amnesty International has documented an alarming escalation in the use of force and firearms since 21 September, when the country’s top military body issued an order to commanders in all provinces instructing them to “severely confront troublemakers and anti-revolutionaries”.  
Shots fired at the head and hearts 
Evidence gathered by Amnesty International shows that the majority of victims were shot in the head, heart, neck and torso, revealing a clear intent to kill or seriously harm. 
On 1 October, Mawlana Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi, the outspoken Sunni leader of Friday prayers in Zahedan, recounted the crackdown in a video testimony.  He stated that more than 40 people were killed after security forces standing on rooftops fired live ammunition towards a group of young protesters outside the police station as well as directly into the Mosalla towards men and women performing prayers.  
Amnesty International has recorded the names of 66 people killed during the Mosalla incident on 30 September, but believes the real death toll is higher. The organization has also recorded the names of 16 people killed in relation to separate protests in other parts of Zahedan since 30 September and is continuing its investigations into these deaths. Those killed include at least three children, two of whom were killed during the Mosalla incident on 30 September and another who was killed in a separate incident the same day. The organization is investigating reports of at least another four children killed in Zahedan since 30 September. 
The number of deaths recorded by Amnesty International concerns only victims whose names the organization has identified through information from primary sources directly impacted by the deaths or through Baluchi human rights activists. The organization has spoken to the families of 21 victims killed in Zahedan.  
Amnesty International previously recorded the names of 52 people killed across the country by Iran’s security forces between 19 September and 25 September.  
State denial and cover-up  
Consistent with their previous pattern of denial and cover-up, the authorities have under-reported the number of fatalities, announcing that 19 people, including bystanders and several members of the security forces, were killed during the protests in Zahedan on 30 September. 
In an attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility for the deaths, the authorities have shared false narratives blaming the deaths on “terrorists”, “rioters” and “separatists” whom they claim were acting for foreign governments. 
Propaganda videos broadcast on state media after 30 September have shown detainees, whom authorities allege were involved in armed attacks against security forces in Zahedan, with sacks over their heads. One video shows a detainee being asked leading questions by a TV presenter and being forced to make self-incriminating statements without a lawyer present over his alleged involvement in shootings on 30 September. Given the Iranian authorities’ well-documented patterns of producing and broadcasting coerced statements from detainees to cover-up human rights violations, Amnesty International is concerned that such statements have been extracted under duress. 
Callous justification for unlawful use of force 
The authorities have claimed that protesters committed acts of looting and arson on public property. However, beyond a minority of protesters throwing stones towards the police station, Amnesty International has found no evidence that, more generally, protesters and bystanders engaged in acts of violence during the Mosalla incident on 30 September that would pose a threat to life or serious injury to security forces or others and would justify the use of lethal force used against them. 
Evidence also reveals that many victims killed during the incident at the Mosalla were shot in the back of their heads or torso, indicating that they were facing away from the security forces and posed no imminent threat to life or serious injury.  
Under international human rights law and standards, the use of firearms is only considered lawful in response to an imminent threat of death or serious injury, and only when less dangerous means have proven to be insufficient. Even if some protesters engage in acts of violence, law enforcement officials must ensure that peaceful protests are allowed to continue without facing undue interference or intimidation by security forces. The use of any force is only permitted as a last resort in response to violent protests, must be legal, necessary and proportionate, with law enforcement officials clearly distinguishing between those engaged in acts of violence and those who are not.

Despite their initial promise to respect women’s rights within the Islamic framework, women and girls’ rights have been under attack in deeply intertwined ways while they have also borne much of the burden of an ongoing economic crisis. These attacks on the rights of women and girls to education, work, free movement and peaceful assembly, and the enforced disappearances, and torture and other ill-treatment of women protestors and other rights violations have severely restricted the ability of women and girls to act freely in political, social and economic spheres. 
Since the Taliban seized power in August 2021, the policies, regulations and decrees of the de facto authorities have denied and violated the human rights of women and girls in the country, including rights related to public participation, education, free movement, peaceful assembly and expression. Enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment by members of the de facto authorities, along with economic and social conditions that directly undermine the rights of women and girls, ranging from a crumbling economy to increased rates of child, early and forced marriage, contribute to the challenges that women and girls face. This has been worsened, in part, due to some decentralized discretionary decisions and directives by Taliban leadership, the uneven enforcement of regulations and the random violence of Taliban officials and soldiers, all of which have contributed to a culture of fear where women and girls are afraid to act and participate even in the most ordinary aspects of daily life.

Nationwide protests sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa (Zhina) Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, are being met with a brutal and deadly crackdown. 
Leaked official documents reviewed by Amnesty International outlined the Iranian authorities’ plan to systematically crush the protests at any cost. Security forces have fired live ammunition at close range, misused tear gas and water cannons, and severely beaten people. 
Over fifty men, women and children have been killed and hundreds injured on the streets.  Without determined collective action by the international community, countless more face the reality of being killed, maimed, tortured, sexually assaulted or thrown behind bars solely for their participation in protests.   
On September 13, 2022, Mahsa Amini was arrested in Tehran by Iran’s so-called “morality” police for not complying with the country’s abusive, degrading and discriminatory compulsory veiling laws. Eyewitnesses reported seeing her being violently beaten in a police van. Within hours, she was taken to hospital in a coma. Three days later she died.  
Mahsa’s death sparked widespread protests across Iran. “Jin, jiyan, azadi!” was the chant soon heard on the streets of Iran by marching protestors for “women, life, freedom” and an end to patriarchal control by the state. While the protests now include broader demands for justice,  human rights in Iran, and for the regime to go, the call to “Say her name: Mahsa Amini” echoes loudly around the world. 
The people of Iran are bravely defying security forces even in the face of Iranian authorities who continue to mobilize their machinery of repression to thwart any challenge to the establishment. And despite the cover of deliberate ongoing internet disruptions, reports and images of the deadly crackdown continue to reach us. 
Last Saturday, hundreds of thousands of people around the world – including in cities across Canada – marched in solidarity with the protesters in Iran who are risking their lives to demand change. This global outpouring of rage and empathy must now translate into concrete actions. 
Sign and share the global petition calling on the United Nations to set up an independent mechanism to investigate and ensure accountability for the most serious crimes under international law in Iran. 
Show your solidarity on social media. Despite the government’s disruption of the internet and forced blackouts, social media (particularly Twitter and Instagram) is vital as an alternative to state controlled media in countries like Iran. Share Amnesty’s latest press releases, social media graphics, images of local demonstrations and your personal messages of solidarity. Take a selfie or group photo holding a sign or record a video saying “Women, Life, Freedom”. Use the hashtags #MahsaAmini #مهسا_امینی (the second one is her name in Persian).

On 2 August 2022, Hamshahri Daily news, which is operated by the municipality of Tehran, reported that three separate blinding sentences were referred to Branch 3 of Tehran’s Office for Implementation of Sentences. The article specified that among them was a woman sentenced by a criminal court in Kermanshah, Kermanshah province, to being blinded in her right eye, a prison term and payment of “blood money” (diyah) after being convicted of blinding the right eye of her neighbour with acid in 2011. Her conviction and sentence were upheld by the Supreme Court. The newspaper also reported that a man in Fars province was sentenced to being blinded in connection to the blinding of another person with a knife during a fight in 2017, while a second man in Qom province was sentenced to being blinded for the blinding of a person with a bullet in 2018. Without providing further details, the article stated that the two men’s convictions and sentences “were upheld”. According to the article, all three were sentenced under the principle of qesas (retribution-in-kind), which is a theory of equivalent retaliation, and referred to Tehran for implementation as Kermanshah, Qom and Fars provinces are not equipped to carry out these sentences.  
In recent months, Amnesty International has documented an alarming spike in the implementation of corporal punishment and death sentences. For instance, on 27 July 2022, Iranian authorities used a guillotine machine to amputate the fingers of Pouya Torabi, who had been convicted of theft. Prior to this, on 31 May 2022, the fingers of Sayed Barat Hosseini were amputated without anaesthetic. Both were transferred to Tehran’s Evin prison from provincial prisons for the implementation of their amputation sentences. Corporal punishments constitute torture, a crime under international law, and which is prohibited under Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a state party.

The news on the order to implement the blinding sentences against the woman and two men emerged against the backdrop of a spike in executions and corporal punishments being carried out in Iran in 2022. Concerns over the Iranian authorities’ plans to accelerate the use of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments were further heightened after Iran International, a Persian language media outlet based in the UK, broadcasted on 5 August 2022 a segment about a leaked confidential letter, dated 19 April 2022, and signed by the deputy head of the judiciary, Mohammad Mossadegh Kahnemoui. In the letter, he orders heads of judiciaries across the country to expedite the implementation of all qesas sentences, including against those sentenced to death and to corporal punishments such as amputation and blinding. The letter further instructs provincial judiciaries to refer qesas cases involving amputation to courts in Tehran for the sentences to be carried out centrally. The letter instructs provincial judiciaries to report on their progress in the implementation of qesas sentences.   
Amnesty International has documented an alarming rise of executions and corporal punishments in 2022. In late July 2022, Abdorrahman Boroumand Centre and Amnesty International raised the alarm about Iranian authorities embarking on an execution spree, killing at least 251 people in the first six months of 2022 and warned that “if executions continue at this horrifying pace, they will soon surpass the total of 314 executions recorded for the whole of 2021” (more information can be found here). Between May and September 2022, the Iranian authorities amputated the fingers of five men at Tehran’s Evin prison using a guillotine machine. According to an informed source interviewed by Amnesty International, amputation sentences were carried out at a clinic inside Evin prison in the presence of multiple officials, including the prosecutor of Tehran, the associate prosecutor (dadyar) of Evin prison, the judge overseeing the implementation of sentences in Evin prison, the head of Evin prison and the chief doctor at the prison medical clinic (more information can be found here). At least eight other men, including Hadi Rostami, Mehdi Sharfian and Mehdi Shahivand are at risk of having their finders amputated (more information can be found here). According to the Abdorrahman Boroumand Centre, since January 2000, the Iranian authorities have amputated the fingers of at least 135 men.  
On 3 March 2015, the Iranian authorities forcibly blinded a man in his left eye after he was sentenced to qesas (retribution-in-kind) for throwing acid on the eyes of another man in the city of Qom in August 2009. The blinding of his right eye was not implemented based on the victim’s request. In addition to this punishment, he was ordered to pay “blood money” (diyah) and sentenced to 10 years in prison (more information can be found here). Since then, no information has been made publicly available on judicially-sanctioned blinding being carried out, while courts continued to issue blinding sentences.   
Under international law, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as punishing them for an act that they have committed or are suspected of having committed, or intimidating them or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind. The UN General Assembly has consistently condemned torture and other ill-treatment and has called on states to investigate and prosecute them. In 1975, it adopted a Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, setting out the obligations of all states to investigate allegations of torture and prosecute those responsible, as well as provide redress to victims. Article 10 of the ICCPR also states that all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated “with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.”  
Iran is a state party to ICCPR and as such is legally obliged to prohibit and punish torture in all circumstances and without exception. Despite this, Iran’s Islamic Penal Code continues to provide for corporal judicial punishments amounting to torture, including amputation, flogging, blinding, crucifixion and stoning. Iranian law requires that a physician be present during the implementation of corporal punishments, in direct violation of ethical guidelines and international standards which expressly prohibit health providers’ involvement in torture.

Since his transfer to Prison No.8 on 19 August 2022, he has been subjected to severe and constant punishments, such as being placed in punishment isolation cell (“Shizo”) and being transferred to a prison facility with a stricter regime, purportedly for “malicious violation” of internal regulations. Moreover, according to information obtained by Amnesty International, the prison administration has purposefully exposed Sergey Tihanovski to serious risks to his safety and refused to address them by denying him protection measures he has requested. The conditions Sergey Tihanovski faces amount to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and must urgently stop.

Sergey Tihanovski is a popular blogger and prominent political activist. In Spring 2020, after he announced his intention to stand in the forthcoming presidential election, he was arbitrarily arrested and given “administrative detention” which prevented him from filing his candidacy before the deadline. His wife Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya filed her candidacy instead.   
On 29 May 2020, at an election picket in support of Svyatlana Tsikhanouskaya as a presidential candidate, Sergey Tihanovski was arbitrarily arrested once again, alongside seven fellow activists. An unfounded prosecution was launched against them. Meanwhile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya emerged as a leading opposition candidate in the election. The incumbent Alyaksandr Lukashenka claimed victory, despite numerous well-documented and compelling reports of electoral fraud. Independent media reported testimonies by members of several local electoral who alleged that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya received several times more votes than Alyaksandr Lukashenka. Mass protests against the disputed election outcome were crushed by police, with tens of thousands peaceful protesters arrested, and countless detainees suffering torture and other ill-treatment. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya went into exile, for fear of prosecution. Many of her close associates, including her closest companion during the election campaign Maryia Kalesnikava were jailed. Hundreds of people have since been prosecuted and imprisoned following unfair trials, for their role in these protests and other peaceful dissent. Among them is Sergey Tihanovski who, on 14 December 2021, was given 18-year prison sentence under trumped up charges, one of the harshest sentences against peaceful dissenters. He has since been targeted with particularly harsh treatment in prison, including penalties for purported violations.  
As part of the penalties imposed on him by the penitentiary administration, Sergey Tihanovski is not allowed family visits and telephone calls. He is not allowed to meet with his lawyer confidentially, read, send letters as well as receive letters and parcels. He is also not allowed to be receive warm clothes, while the cell is very cold, which put his health at further risk. As of 30 September, he had continuously spent 40 days in a punishment isolation cell (“Shizo”) in these conditions, and the term of his placement there had been repeatedly prolonged.   
Amnesty International calls for Sergey Tihanovski ‘s immediate and unconditional release.

0,Canada: Leading human rights groups challenge Safe Third Country Agreement at Supreme Court,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/canada-leading-human-rights-groups-challenge-safe-third-country-agreement-at-supreme-court/,"In effect since 2004, the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) prevents most people arriving at Canada’s land ports of entry from claiming refugee protection.","Three leading Canadian human rights organizations, the Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International Canada, and The Canadian Council of Churches, together with eight individual applicants, will appear before the Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday, October 6 to call for an end to a policy that cruelly bars many people from seeking refugee protection in Canada. 
In effect since 2004, the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) prevents most people arriving at Canada’s land ports of entry from claiming refugee protection. However, as the organizations will argue, the practice of barring refugee claimants from seeking protection violates Canada’s human rights obligations under boththe Charter of Rights and Freedoms and international law. 
“The Safe Third Country Agreement is built on a false premise,” said Aleks Dughman-Manzur, President of the Canadian Council for Refugees. “The United States is not a safe place for refugee claimants escaping persecution. Despite the change in administration in the U.S., people sent back to the U.S. under the STCA continue to be at high risk of detention in abhorrent conditions. And some, including people facing gender-based persecution, are unfairly denied protection in the U.S. and sent back into danger in their countries of origin – a clear violation of their basic human rights.” 
‘Withdrawing from the STCA is one of the most impactful steps Canada can take to end irregular border crossings, allowing people to make refugee claims in a humane, safe, and orderly manner.’ 
The ban imposed by the STCA applies to refugee claimants entering Canada at official land ports of entry. As a result, scores of people attempt dangerous border crossings into rural and remote areas of Canada. “Because of the STCA, vulnerable migrants are forced to cross into small border communities, at times in the dead of winter, risking frostbite, hypothermia, or worse, simply to have their claims for refugee protection heard,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking). “Withdrawing from the STCA is one of the most impactful steps Canada can take to end irregular border crossings, allowing people to make refugee claims in a humane, safe, and orderly manner.” 
The Canadian Council for Refugees, Amnesty International Canada, and The Canadian Council of Churches have twice challenged the legality of the STCA, once in 2007 and beginning again in 2017. In both cases, the challenges were successful at the Federal Court but were later overturned on technical grounds by the Federal Court of Appeal. It wasn’t until 2021 that the Supreme Court announced it would weigh in on the constitutionality of the STCA – a significant breakthrough in the campaign for the just, compassionate, and orderly treatment of people seeking refuge in Canada. 
“We are our sister’s and our brother’s keeper,” said Pastor Peter Noteboom, General Secretary of The Canadian Council of Churches. “Canadians want Canada to live up to its human rights responsibilities and to be generous in welcoming refugees.” 
Supporters of refugee rights will stage rallies on Thursday calling for Canada to withdraw from the Safe Third Country Agreement. A Toronto rally will take place outside the courthouse at 361 University Ave. (in front of the Pillars of Justice sculpture) starting at 1 p.m. ET. A Vancouver rally outside the Vancouver Art Gallery (750 Hornby St.) will commence at noon PT.

He was arrested on 13 October 2020, charged with endangering international state security, and convicted on 15 June 2021 for “collaborating with rebels who attacked Burundi.” However, the evidence presented against him indicates that his prosecution is motivated by his former human rights work. The hearing of his appeal of the Court of Appeal of Ngozi’s decision is scheduled on 7 October. Amnesty International continues to call for Tony Germain Nkina’s immediate and unconditional release.  
He was arrested on 13 October 2020 in Kayanza province, northern Burundi, and accused of collaborating with the armed opposition group, RED-Tabara while visiting a client in Kabarore commune and advising him on a land dispute case. He remains held in Ngozi prison in northern Burundi.  
During the appeal hearing, the prosecution failed again to substantiate allegations that Tony Germain Nkina was linked in any way to RED-Tabara or produce any witness to support their case against the lawyer.  
In a statement issued on 8 October 2021, Amnesty International and five other human rights organizations denounced the decision of the Court of Appeal and pointed to the fact that Burundi continues on a sad path of shrinking civic space despite your multiple promises of a positive change in upholding its human rights obligations since your inauguration in June 2020.

Additional Information  
Tony Germain Nkina worked with APRODH, one of Burundi’s most active and best-known human rights organizations, until it was closed down by the government in 2015. His prosecution and unlawful detention are based on the unfounded accusation that he collaborated with the armed opposition group, RED-Tabara (Resistance for the Rule of Law). Since the Burundi 2015 crisis, following the late President Pierre Nkurunziza’s decision to seek a third term in office, the government has accused RED-Tabara of being responsible for a series of armed attacks across the country, including attacks that had occurred in Kayanza province in early October 2020.  
Burundi’s civil society and media organizations were among the first targets of the government’s repression in 2015. The government suspended or closed most independent human rights organizations and media outlets and drove them into exile. Despite some overtures by President Ndayishimiye towards the media in 2021, the Burundian government continues to view human rights work with suspicion, and severe restrictions on human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, remain in place.  
Most independent human rights organizations have been unable to resume their activities in Burundi, especially as the Burundian authorities have issued arrest warrants for many of their leading activists in exile. 12 human rights defenders and journalists were among a group of 34 people sentenced to life in prison in absentia in June 2020 on accusations of involvement in an attempted coup in May 2015; the Supreme Court judgment was not made public until February 2021.  
Arrest or detention as punishment for the peaceful exercise of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, is arbitrary and violates the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which Burundi is a state party. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has determined that those detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights must be immediately released.

0,Canada: Construction of pipeline on Indigenous territory endangers land defenders,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/canada-construction-of-pipeline-on-indigenous-territory-endangers-land-defenders/,Land defenders are at risk of serious human rights violations as the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline has reportedly begun under the Wedzin Kwa (Morice River).,"Wet’suwet’en land defenders in Canada are at risk of serious human rights violations as the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline has reportedly begun under the Wedzin Kwa (Morice River), said Amnesty International today.  
‘The decision to allow the construction of the Coastal Gaslink pipeline on Wet’suwet’en lands without the free, prior, and informed consent of the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs is a brazen violation of the community’s right to self-determination and a lamentable step backwards in Canada’s journey toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.’ 
“The decision to allow the construction of the Coastal Gaslink pipeline on Wet’suwet’en lands without the free, prior, and informed consent of the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs is a brazen violation of the community’s right to self-determination and a lamentable step backwards in Canada’s journey toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Moreover, expansion of fossil fuels extraction and infrastructure is against Canada’s obligation to protect human rights from the worst impacts of the climate crisis,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking). “Amnesty International Canada calls on the governments of Canada and B.C. to halt pipeline construction in the traditional, unceded territories of the Wet’suwet’en.” 
Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs – the traditional authorities of the Nation according to Wet’suwet’en Law as well as the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1997 Delgamuukw ruling – have never consented to the Coastal GasLink pipeline project, even though some elected First Nations governments have signed benefit agreements with the company. The Wedzin Kwa (Morice River) is one of the last remaining clean sources of drinking water and salmon spawning grounds in the territory, and Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs have raised concerns that the pipeline project would damage the river. 
Peaceful protestors and land defenders occupied the drill pad site in September 2021. British Columbia’s Minister of Public Safety authorized militarized police forces to arrest and forcibly remove land defenders from the territory in order to enforce an injunction obtained by the company. Wet’suwet’en and other land defenders faced three raids by heavily armed police, and 19 people are currently facing criminal contempt charges for defying a court injunction that authorizes the police to remove people occupying permitted work sites.   
Wet’suwet’en land defenders say they are harassed, intimidated, forcibly removed, and criminalized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the company’s private security guards solely for peacefully defending their traditional lands over which they have title. In May, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination issued a third letter to Canada noting its concern over the escalating use of force, surveillance, and criminalization of land defenders and peaceful protestors by the RCMP, its Community-Industry Response Group and private security firms.  
“The Canadian government must immediately withdraw security and policing forces from Wet’suwet’en territory and investigate all allegations of harassment, intimidation, threats and forced evictions of land rights defenders and others peacefully protesting against the pipeline. Continuing with the construction of this pipeline in Indigenous territory will further endanger human rights defenders, Wet’suwet’en communities and ultimately our planet,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Chief Na’Moks said, “Even though they have started to illegally drill with illegal permits from the government of BC, the Hereditary Chiefs have never been supportive nor have given consent for this project. We will continue to oppose this pipeline using all means necessary, as it is our Traditional law. No elected official nor an industry can overrule nor ignore our decisions as a nation who have never ceded, surrendered nor signed a treaty.”

“Today’s horrific attack is just the latest in a series of attacks in areas dominated by the minority Hazara Shiite population and a shamefaced reminder of the inaptitude and utter failure of the Taliban, as de-facto authorities, to protect the people of Afghanistan. Urgent steps must be taken to ensure the safety of all people under the Taliban’s rule, especially the members of minority communities.” 
Today’s horrific attack is… a shamefaced reminder of the inaptitude and utter failure of the Taliban to protect the people of Afghanistan. 
“Since their takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban have done little to put in place any measures for the protection of the public, especially of Shia-Hazaras who have been systematically targeted largely by the Islamic State (IS) in schools, mosques, training centers and public places. Instead, their actions of omission and commission have only further aggravated the risk to the lives of the people of Afghanistan especially those belonging to ethnic and minority communities.” 
“It is essential that the de-facto authorities immediately carry out an effective, thorough, and independent investigation into the attacks, which should be conducted in line with international law and standards. Those suspected of criminal responsibility for the suicide bombing must face justice in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts and without recourse to death penalty.” 
[Taliban’s] actions of omission and commission have only further aggravated the risk to the lives of the people of Afghanistan especially those belonging to ethnic and minority communities. 
The bomb blasts took place in the early morning hours on Friday at Kaaj Educational Center in west Kabul where students in packed classrooms were given mock tests in order to prepare for their college entrance exam. According to initial local media reports around 100 students and employees of this center were killed and injured, among whom at least 21 were girls. Meanwhile the Police in Kabul have reportedly said at least 19 were killed and many more injured in the attack at the time of publication of this press release. 
Earlier, in April this year, bomb blasts targeted schools in the same Hazara Shiite community area of Dasht-e-Barchi in west Kabul. Amnesty International has repeatedly documented the targeted killing of ethnic minority Hazara Shiite community members following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021 
According to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) report (Human rights in Afghanistan: 15 August 2021 – 15 June 2022) 2106 civilian casualties (700 killed, 1406 wounded) were recorded in the country in the one year since the takeover by the Taliban.

“The fact that a humanitarian convoy was struck in this horrendous attack is further proof of Russia’s utter disregard for civilian lives in Ukraine. People delivering humanitarian aid are not military targets, and it is devastating to see more lives ruined by wanton death and destruction. All those responsible for Russia’s repeated unlawful attacks in Ukraine must be held accountable for their actions.” 
The convoy was struck as it was preparing to go a Russian-occupied part of the region to deliver humanitarian aid. Intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, material, units or vehicles involved in a humanitarian assistance mission is a war crime. 
The fact that a humanitarian convoy was struck in this horrendous attack is further proof of Russia’s utter disregard for civilian lives in Ukraine 
By analysing photos and video from social media, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab confirmed that the strike hit the line of civilian vehicles as it gathered at the Avtorynok car scrapyard market on the southern outskirts of Zaporizhzhia, approximately 27.5 kilometres from the front line. A crater near the convoy measured approximately five meters wide and 2.5 metres deep, which is consistent with the warhead of a large guided missile. 
According to media reports, at least 25 people were killed and 50 wounded – all of them civilians. Amnesty International was able to confirm 23 individual deaths of women and men by analysing photos and videos to identify unique clothing and distinctive features on the victims’ bodies. 
Ukrainian authorities reported that 16 missiles were fired at or near Zaporizhzhia during the attack, and online records indicate that the alarm sirens of the civil defence warning system sounded at 7.11am local time, nearly simultaneously with the strike. Based on the distance inside Ukrainian controlled territory, the warning sirens, the size and type of crater, and the number of weapons simultaneously fired, Amnesty International believes this was almost certainly an attack by Russian military forces. 
The strike comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin today announced the annexation of four Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian forces in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions. Amnesty International has previously declared the so-called referenda that preceded the announcement illegal, and their results a “sham”, and warned that Russia’s annexation of occupied territory would violate international law. 
Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here.  
Amnesty International has called repeatedly for members of Russian forces and officials responsible for violations to be held to account, and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.

The crackdown has left at least 52 identified victims dead and hundreds injured to date. 
In a detailed analysis issued today, Amnesty International divulges evidence of the Iranian authorities’ plot to brutally crush the demonstrations by deploying the Revolutionary Guards, the Basij paramilitary force, the Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran, riot police, and plainclothes security agents. The organization also shares evidence of the widespread use of lethal force and firearms by Iranian security forces who either intended to kill protesters or should have known with a reasonable degree of certainty that their use of firearms would result in deaths. 
“The Iranian authorities knowingly decided to harm or kill people who took to the streets to express their anger at decades of repression and injustice. Amid an epidemic of systemic impunity that has long prevailed in Iran, dozens of men, women and children have been unlawfully killed in the latest round of bloodshed,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Without determined collective action by the international community, which needs to go beyond mere statements of condemnation, countless more face being killed, maimed, tortured, sexually assaulted or thrown behind bars solely for their participation in protests. Leaked documents obtained by Amnesty International bring into sharp focus the need for an international independent investigative and accountability mechanism.” 
Based on eyewitness accounts and audio-visual evidence reviewed by Amnesty International, none of the 52 identified victims posed any imminent threat of death or serious injury that could warrant the use of firearms against them. 
State denial and coverup after a week of unlawful killings 
Amnesty International has obtained a leaked copy of an official document which states that, on 21 September 2022, the General Headquarters of Armed Forces issued an order to commanders in all provinces instructing them to “severely confront troublemakers and anti-revolutionaries”. Later that evening, the use of lethal force across the country escalated with dozens of men, women and children killed that night alone. 
The Iranian authorities knowingly decided to harm or kill people who took to the streets to express their anger at decades of repression and injustice. 
Another leaked document shows that, on 23 September, the commander of the armed forces in Mazandaran province ordered security forces in all towns and cities in the province to “confront mercilessly, going as far as causing deaths, any unrest by rioters and anti-Revolutionaries”. 
Amnesty International has so far recorded the names of 52 people, including five women and at least five children, killed by Iran’s security forces between 19 September and 25 September. Two thirds of the recorded deaths (at least 34) are from 21 September. The organization believes the real death toll is far higher and is continuing its efforts to identify victims. 
Amnesty International has reviewed photos and videos showing that most victims were killed by security forces firing live ammunition. At least three men and two women were killed due to security forces firing metal pellets at close range, while a 16-year-old girl Sarina Esmailzadeh died after being severely beaten in the head with batons. 
In an attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility for the deaths, the Iranian authorities have shared false narratives about victims, attempting to portray them as “dangerous”, “violent individuals” or claiming that they had been killed by “rioters”. The authorities have been also intimidating and harassing victims’ families into silence or promising them financial compensation if they recorded videos attributing responsibility of their loved ones’ deaths to “rioters” working for “enemies” of the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Protesters tortured and otherwise ill-treated 
Amnesty International has documented widespread patterns of torture and other ill-treatment by security forces, including severe beatings of protesters and bystanders. The organization has also documented sexual assault and other forms of gender-based and sexual violence, including cases where security forces grabbed women’s breasts or violently pulled their hair after they removed their headscarves in protest. 
On 28 September, a protester from Esfahan told Amnesty International: “I have seen protesters beaten. The night before, my friends recounted how they saw one woman [protester] was yanked from her hair along the ground. Her clothes were coming off her body and the security forces kept pulling her by the hair…” 
“Two nights ago”, the protester added, “several of my friends were beaten with batons. One of them, who has now got bruises on her forearm and legs, told me that security forces cornered them in an alley and beat them with batons. One member of the security forces then said, ‘let’s also shoot them in the leg’ and another security agent said, ‘no, let’s go’. They are so brutal”. 
Amnesty International has seen footage and reports suggesting that some protesters have engaged in acts of violence. However, Amnesty International stresses that violent acts by a minority of protesters do not justify the use of lethal force. 
According to international human rights law and standards, even if some protesters engage in violence, law enforcement officials must ensure that those who remain peaceful can continue protesting without facing undue interference or intimidation by security forces. Any force used in response to such violence must at all times comply with the principles of legality, necessity and proportionality in accordance with international law. Security forces must not use firearms except to defend themselves or others against an imminent threat of death or serious injury, and only when less extreme and harmful means are insufficient to protect life.

From the 17th century until 1996 when the last school was closed, more than 150,000 First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children were forced to attend residential schools. By design, these largely church-run and state-supported facilities deliberately separated Indigenous children from their families and communities and tried to strip them of their cultures, languages, and identities. Physical, sexual, and emotional abuse was rampant. Authorities are still counting the number of children who died at residential schools today – more than 5,000 young lives are believed to have been lost. 
This is not a story unique to Canada; it is the truth of colonization and empire across ourglobe, in the Americas, in Africa, Asia and Oceania. ‘Residential schools’” are one part of this largercolonial project. We have the choice to wake up tomorrow and place the meaning of this day behind us.Indigenous peoples on this land do not. This difference is the truth we must accept and pledge to undoevery day, individually and collectively. 
This shameful history must never be forgotten. Our work to undo the legacies of colonialism, racism, and white supremacy which led to the kidnapping and torture of so many children, and their ongoing stigma and harm must continue everyday.  
Truth and reconciliation are meaningless without action. In the words of our Secretary General, Ketty Nivyabandi, “This is not a story unique to Canada; it is the truth of colonization and empire across our globe, in the Americas, in Africa, Asia and Oceania. ‘Residential schools’” are one part of this larger colonial project.

The Social Atrocity: Meta and the right...","Facebook owner Meta’s dangerous algorithms and reckless pursuit of profit substantially contributed to the atrocities perpetrated by the Myanmar military against the Rohingya people in 2017, Amnesty International said in a new report published today. 
The Social Atrocity: Meta and the right to remedy for the Rohingya,details how Meta knew or should have known that Facebook’s algorithmic systems were supercharging the spread of harmful anti-Rohingya content in Myanmar, but the company still failed to act. 
“In 2017, the Rohingya were killed, tortured, raped, and displaced in the thousands as part of the Myanmar security forces’ campaign of ethnic cleansing. In the months and years leading up to the atrocities, Facebook’s algorithms were intensifying a storm of hatred against the Rohingya which contributed to real-world violence,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
Meta must be held to account. The company now has responsibility to provide reparations to all those who suffered the violent consequences of their reckless actions. 
“While the Myanmar military was committing crimes against humanity against the Rohingya, Meta was profiting from the echo chamber of hatred created by its hate-spiralling algorithms. 
“Meta must be held to account. The company now has a responsibility to provide reparations to all those who suffered the violent consequences of their reckless actions.” 
Sawyeddollah, a 21-year-old Rohingya refugee, told Amnesty International: “I saw a lot of horrible things on Facebook. And I just thought that the people who posted that were bad… Then I realized that it is not only these people – the posters – but Facebook is also responsible. Facebook is helping them by not taking care of their platform.” 
The Rohingya are a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority based in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine State. In August 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine when the Myanmar security forces launched a targeted campaign of widespread and systematic murder, rape and burningof homes. The violence followed decades of state-sponsored discrimination, persecution, and oppression against the Rohingya that amounts to apartheid. 
Meta uses engagement-based algorithmic systems to power Facebook’s news feed, ranking, recommendation and groups features, shaping what is seen on the platform. Meta profits when Facebook users stay on the platform as long as possible, by selling more targeted advertising. The display of inflammatory content – including that which advocates hatred, constituting incitement to violence, hostility and discrimination – is an effective way of keeping people on the platform longer. As such, the promotion and amplification of this type of content is key to the surveillance-based business model of Facebook.   
In the months and years prior to the crackdown, Facebook in Myanmar had become an echo chamber of anti-Rohingya content. Actors linked to the Myanmar military and radical Buddhist nationalist groups flooded the platform with anti-Muslim content, posting disinformation claiming there was going to be an impending Muslim takeover, and portraying the Rohingya as “invaders”. 
In one post that was shared more than 1,000 times, a Muslim human rights defender was pictured and described as a “national traitor”. The comments left on the post included threatening and racist messages, including ‘He is a Muslim. Muslims are dogs and need to be shot’, and ‘Don’t leave him alive. Remove his whole race. Time is ticking’. 
Content inciting violence and discrimination went to the very top of Myanmar’s military and civilian leadership. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the leader of Myanmar’s military, posted on his Facebook page in 2017: “We openly declare that absolutely, our country has no Rohingya race.” He went on to seize power in a coup in February 2021. 
In July 2022, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that it has jurisdiction to proceed with a case against the Myanmar government under the Genocide Convention based on Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya. Amnesty International welcomes this vital step towards holding the Myanmar government to account and continues to call for senior members of the Myanmar military to be brought to justice for their role in crimes against the Rohingya. 
In 2014, Meta attempted to support an anti-hate initiative known as ‘Panzagar’ or ‘flower speech’ by creating a sticker pack for Facebook users to post in response to content which advocated violence or discrimination. The stickers bore messages such as, ‘Think before you share’ and ‘Don’t be the cause of violence’. 
However, activists soon noticed that the stickers were having unintended consequences. Facebook’s algorithms interpreted the use of these stickers as a sign that people were enjoying a post and began promoting them. Instead of diminishing the number of people who saw a post advocating hatred, the stickers actually made the posts more visible. 
The UN’s Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar ultimately concluded that the “role of social media [was] significant” in the atrocities in a country where “Facebook is the Internet”. 
Mohamed Showife, a Rohingya activist, said: “The Rohingya just dream of living in the same way as other people in this world… but you, Facebook, you destroyed our dream.” 
The Rohingya just dream of living in the same way as other people in this world…but you, Facebook, you destroyed our dream. 
The report details how Meta repeatedly failed to conduct appropriate human rights due diligence on its operations in Myanmar, despite its responsibility under international standards to do so. 
Internal studies dating back to 2012 indicated that Meta knew its algorithms could result in serious real-world harms. In 2016, Meta’s own research clearly acknowledged that “our recommendation systems grow the problem” of extremism. 
Meta received repeated communications and visits by local civil society activists between 2012 and 2017 when the company was warned that it risked contributing to extreme violence. In 2014, the Myanmar authorities even temporarily blocked Facebook because of the platform’s role in triggering an outbreak of ethnic violence in Mandalay. However, Meta repeatedly failed to heed the warnings, and also consistently failed to enforce its own policies on hate speech. 
Amnesty International’s investigation includes analysis of new evidence from the ‘Facebook Papers’ – a cache of internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen. 
In one internal document dated August 2019, one Meta employee wrote: “We have evidence from a variety of sources that hate speech, divisive political speech, and misinformation on Facebook… are affecting societies around the world. We also have compelling evidence that our core product mechanics, such as virality, recommendations, and optimizing for engagement, are a significant part of why these types of speech flourish on the platform.” 
Our recommendation systems grow the problem 
Amnesty International is today launching a new campaign calling for Meta Platforms, Inc. to meet the Rohingya’s demands for remediation. 
Today marks the first anniversary of the murder of prominent activist Mohib Ullah, chair of the Arakan Rohingya Society for Peace and Human Rights. Mohib was at the forefront of community efforts to hold Meta accountable. 
Rohingya refugee groups have made direct requests to Meta to provide remedy by funding a USD $1 million education project in the refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The funding request represents just 0.002% of Meta’s profits of $46.7 billion from 2021. In February 2021, Meta rejected the Rohingya community’s request, stating: “Facebook doesn’t directly engage in philanthropic activities.” 
Showkutara, a 22-year-old Rohingya woman and youth activist, told Amnesty International: “Facebook must pay. If they do not, we will go to every court in the world. We will never give up in our struggle.” 
There are at least three active complaints seeking remediation for the Rohingya from Meta. Civil legal proceedings were filed against the company in December 2021 in both the United Kingdom and the USA. Rohingya refugee youth groups have also filed an OECD case against Meta which is currently under consideration by the US’ OECD National Contact Point. 
“Meta has a responsibility under international human rights standards to remediate the terrible harm suffered by the Rohingya that they contributed to. The findings should raise the alarm that Meta risks contributing to further serious human rights abuses, unless it makes fundamental changes to its business model and algorithms,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Urgent, wide-ranging reforms to their algorithmic systems to prevent abuses and increase transparency are desperately needed to ensure that Meta’s history with the Rohingya does not repeat itself elsewhere in the world, especially where ethnic violence is simmering.” 
“Ultimately, States must now help to protect human rights by introducing and enforcing effective legislation to rein in surveillance-based business models across the technology sector. Big Tech has proven itself incapable of doing so when it has such enormous profits at stake.” 
On 20 May 2022, Amnesty International wrote to Meta regarding the company’s actions in relation to its business activities in Myanmar before and during the 2017 atrocities. Meta responded that it could not provide information concerning the period leading up to 2017 because the company is “currently engaged in litigation proceedings in relation to related matters”. 
On 14 June 2022, Amnesty International again wrote to Meta regarding the relevant allegations contained in the report, and to give the company the opportunity to respond. Meta declined to comment.

These include use of live ammunitions, birdshot and other metal pellets, heavy beatings of protesters and gender-based violence, including sexual violence against women. Responding to the increasingly brutal crackdown under the cover of deliberate ongoing internet and mobile disruptions, Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said: 
“We see the images of Iranian people from across the country bravely standing up to security forces, of women cutting off their hair and setting their scarves on fire. Dozens of people, including children, have been killed so far and hundreds injured. The voices of the courageous people of Iran desperately crying out for international support must not be ignored.” 
Iran’s discriminatory laws, decades of repression of any form of dissent, and systemic impunity for unlawful killings during protests and behind prison walls, have triggered this unprecedented nationwide outrage. 
“We ask all the people of the world to sign our global petition and demand decisive action from their leaders. An independent investigative and accountability mechanism must be established by the UN Human Rights Council for the most serious crimes under international law committed by the Iranian authorities. People in Iran deserve more than empty words. The crisis of systemic impunity that has long prevailed in the country must end, and it must end now.” 
Security forces in Iran have unlawfully and deliberately fired live ammunition and birdshot and other metal pellets to violently quash largely peaceful protests. The protests have been sparked by the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa (Zhina) Amini on 16 September, days after her violent arrest by Iran’s “morality police” for not complying with the country’s discriminatory compulsory veiling laws. 
Amnesty International has recorded the deaths of dozens of men, women and children killed by the security forces. The organization believes the real death toll is higher and is continuing its efforts to identify victims. 
One eyewitness present at the protests taking place in Sattar Khan Street in Tehran on 25 September told Amnesty International: “The security forces did not show mercy to anyone. They fired shoguns at people and subjected people to beatings with batons, punching and kicking.” 
Amnesty International has documented gender-based violence, including sexual assaults by security forces, including grabbing women’s breasts and violently pulling women by the hair because they removed their headscarves. 
The organization is also investigating the authorities carrying out mass arrests of protesters and bystanders, as well as journalists, political activists, lawyers and human rights defenders, including women’s rights activists and those belonging to oppressed ethnic minority groups. 
There are reports that some protesters have engaged in acts of violence. The organization stresses that the use of violence by a small group of people does not justify the use of lethal force against people who are not posing an imminent threat of death or serious injury to members of security forces or others. According to international law and standards, even if some protesters engage in violent actions, law enforcement officials must ensure that those who remain peaceful can continue protesting without undue interference and intimidation from security forces.

“There is no legitimacy whatsoever in the results of these sham “referenda” announced by the Russian authorities. It is absurd that the Russian authorities would think these so-called votes, which took place at gunpoint in the presence of Russian soldiers and their proxies, are in any way credible. The whole exercise, which is illegal under international law, is nothing more than another deplorable act in Russia’s strategy of aggression against Ukraine.”   
“The “referenda results” do not change the legal status under international law of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia, no matter what Russia chooses to declare next. As with Crimea, any moves towards annexation will be illegal, and constitute yet another flagrant violation of international law by Russia. 
The “referenda results” do not change the legal status under international law of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia 
“Amnesty International reiterates its call on Russia to respect its obligations as the occupying power under international humanitarian law. We also call for the immediate cessation of all unlawful actions by Russia, including its war of aggression against Ukraine and accompanying human rights violations. All those responsible for crimes under international law, including war crimes, must face justice.”Background 
On Tuesday, the Russia-backed “administrations” of occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine and the de facto authorities of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk “People’s Republics” announced the results of the unlawful “referenda” on joining Russia. The organizers claimed very high turnout and majorities of between 87% to 99.2% in favour of joining Russia. This “voting” and any other measures by Russia or its proxies to change the status of occupied territory is a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. 
The head of the Council of Federation (the Russian Parliament’s upper house), Valentina Matvienko, said the chamber – which is required to approve annexation under Russian law – may consider the formal incorporation of territories on 4 October. 
The “referenda” were hastily arranged, taking place over five days with voting organized at so-called polling stations only on the last day, 27 September. Apart from the last day, “ballots” were collected from residents at their home by organizers who went door to door. According to reports in the media and on social media, “voting” at home and at polling stations was often carried out in the presence of heavily armed uniformed men. 
Amnesty International has received reports of brutal reprisals by the occupying authorities against local people who displayed or were suspected of disloyalty to Russia and its occupying forces. These reprisals include abductions, unlawful deprivation of liberty and torture as well as unlawful killings. The organization has documented such cases in territories liberated by Ukrainian forces.

0,Amnesty International Canada decries anti-Black racism in federal public service in letter to UN Special Rapporteur,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/amnesty-international-canada-decries-anti-black-racism-in-federal-public-service-in-letter-to-un-special-rapporteur/,Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking) announced its support for the Black Class Action Secretariat’s complaint to the United Nations.,"Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking) announced Wednesday its support for the Black Class Action Secretariat’s (BCAS) complaint to the United Nations condemning anti-Black hate, anti-Black racism, and systemic discrimination faced by Black workers in the federal public service. 
On Tuesday, the BCAS sent a formal complaint to the UN Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, and related intolerance. Amnesty International Canada has submitted a letter supporting the BCAS’s complaint and elaborating on how the treatment of Black workers in the federal public service contravenes Canada’s international obligations to uphold human rights. The letter pays special attention to the gender-based dimensions of racial discrimination in the federal public service, including unequal job opportunities, hiring and promotional practices, and instances of racism, sexism, and sexual harassment. 
‘These experiences are not only an affront to the inherent dignity of the people who uphold the government’s functions daily. They are contrary to Canada’s obligation under international law to eliminate discrimination in employment.’ 
“Black women make up 70 per cent of federal employees who have come forward with allegations of discrimination in the public service,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English-Speaking) on Wednesday. “These experiences are not only an affront to the inherent dignity of the people who uphold the government’s functions daily. They are contrary to Canada’s obligation under international law to eliminate discrimination in employment. We unequivocally support the Black Class Action’s call for justice and urge the government not to wait for the UN’s response to start enacting much-needed change. Federal workers, and millions of Canadians who rely on their efforts, cannot wait.” 
The complaint to the UN is the latest in a series of measures advanced by the BCAS to underscore and eliminate anti-Black racism and sexism in the federal public service. Since the launch of the Black Class Action in December 2020, 1,500 Black employees have courageously shared deeply personal stories of their experiences working for the Canadian government. They describe how they were denied promotions, mentorship, and other opportunities that were available to non-Black colleagues and were confined to low-level positions. 
These dehumanizing experiences send the message that Black employees are not fit for public service in Canada and perpetuate stereotypes and biases about Black people’s worth and capabilities. As a result, current and former employees continue to suffer deeply painful and significant harms. For Black employees who are members of other marginalized groups, such as Black women, Black people with disabilities, and Black LGBTQ2S+ individuals, the impacts of discrimination are even greater. 
“On behalf of all Black workers we are elevating Canada’s past and ongoing failures to the United Nations,” Nicholas Marcus Thompson, Executive Director of the BCAS, said on Wednesday. “Black Canadians are suffering, and we will be relentless in our pursuit of justice on their behalf.” 
Amnesty International Canada notes the importance of recognizing the distinct and intersecting forms of racism and discrimination that Black employees are subject to. For example, while all “visible minorities” are underrepresented at the executive level, Black employees are disproportionately underrepresented, reflecting 3.8% of federal public service workers but only 1.9% of those at the executive level. 
Despite calls to address anti-Black racism from Black employees, the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, and the Prime Minister, discrimination persists across the federal public service. Black employees continue to face denials of their rights under Canadian and international human rights law, including the right to be free from discrimination and the right to have equal promotion opportunities based only upon seniority and competence. 
On Wednesday, Amnesty International Canada reiterated its support for the efforts of the Black Class Action Secretariat in pressing the Government of Canada to implement long-term solutions that address systemic racism and discrimination in Canada’s public service. This includes the establishment of a fund to compensate Black employees for the harms experienced because of workplace discrimination; the establishment of a Black Equity Commission to investigate and address systemic barriers and to create a framework for Black employees to be heard; and the establishment of a designated category for Black employees under the Employment Equity Act. It also includes the immediate establishment of culturally sensitive, trauma-informed counselling and mental-health supports for current, former, and future Black employees.

Amnesty International expresses grave concern over the recent events that have taken place in relation to the investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Training College. The resignation of the head of the Special Investigation and Litigation Unit for the Ayotzinapa Case (UEILCA), due to visible conflicts between the Unit and the Attorney General’s Office (FGR), puts the progress achieved at risk and threatens to further delay the families’ access to truth, justice, and remembrance. 
UEILCA prosecutor Omar Gómez Trejo resigned on 27 September 2022, condemning undue interference in the investigation after it was made public that the FGR withdrew 21 arrest warrants requested, 16 of which were against military personnel accused of having participated in the events of eight years ago. 
“The problems that have arisen leave the families of the missing students, and Mexican society in general, in a situation of total uncertainty. The serious differences between the different authorities must be resolved in order to avoid perpetuating impunity in this case which is so emblematic for Mexico. It is also imperative that the students’ families be kept fully informed and at the centre of the decision-making process, not only in terms of the transparency that must be maintained, but also to guarantee their right to the truth and to full reparation for the enormous damages they have suffered over the last eight years,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“We cannot tolerate any further setbacks in the investigation. The Mexican state must create the conditions necessary to progress with investigations, respect the autonomy and independence of the work of the Special Investigation Unit, and ensure that it has the necessary human and material resources to carry out its work. In addition, it must guarantee due process in order to avoid any error that could prevent legal proceedings from progressing and could jeopardise the right to justice and the punishment of those responsible for this atrocious crime,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, executive director at Amnesty International Mexico. 
Progress and setbacks 
This 26 September marked eight years since the disappearance of the 43 students from the Raúl Isidro Burgos Rural Training College, yet to this day the families have still been unable to find out the truth of what happened and to access justice. 
In the last four years, the Mexican state has made various efforts to shed light on what happened to the 43 students from the Isidro Burgos Rural Training College such as the creation of the Commission for Truth and Access to Justice in the Ayotzinapa Case (Covaj-Ayotzinapa) and the UEILCA, under the FGR. 
Recently, Covaj-Ayotzinapa unveiled significant advances in the case, such as the acknowledgement that the events in Iguala were a state crime, as well as the probable participation of the Mexican military in the disappearance of the students. 
This is in addition to the revelations made at the end of September 2022 by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) about communication between members of a criminal group and members of the army, navy, and local police in Iguala and Cocula before the disappearance of the young students. 
These links, in addition to other events in which the Mexican military has been involved, raise questions about the appropriateness of the armed forces continuing to carry out public security tasks in the country, independently of other activities that are the direct responsibility of state institutions created specifically for this purpose. 
The UEILCA has succeeded in arresting high-level authorities who could be responsible for the disappearances and has issued several arrest warrants against other authorities, including military personnel. 
The conflicts between the UEILCA and the FGR were made public following the latter’s decision to cancel 21 of the 83 arrest warrants requested last August against former officials possibly involved in the disappearance of the 43 Ayotzinapa students. The information released also indicates the probable involvement of military forces in the disappearance of the students. 
The advances in the investigation of the case were achieved thanks to the independence with which the UEILCA worked, in addition to the fact that it was made up of a team of people dedicated exclusively to the case, led by a prosecutor who was trusted by the students’ families, and was supported by the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI). Progress was also made in the case because care was taken in the way information was communicated so as not to affect any legal process and the due confidentiality that must be maintained in any type of legal investigation was respected. 
Therefore, Amnesty International believes that state institutions must, as a matter of urgency, guarantee the autonomy and independence of the UEILCA and deal with the reported interference, as this, in addition to once again slowing down the investigation, serves to increase the anxiety and despair of the families of the 43 disappeared students facing constant stumbling blocks in the investigation, which increasingly delays access to the truth, justice and full reparation for the damages that we all yearn for. In addition, Amnesty International calls on the Mexican state not to retaliate against or criminalize the Special Prosecutor or the UEILCA officials who worked independently on the case. 
Official figures show the close link between the increased presence of the armed forces in public security tasks and the increase in enforced disappearances in the country: 97% of the 105,000 cases of people disappeared in Mexico have been registered in the last 16 years. 
According to CNDH figures, from 2019 to 2022, 58 cases of enforced disappearance were reported, of which 55% were filed against military forces. 
16 years after the establishment of a policy of militarization of public security in the country, the figures show that the human rights crisis is not abating. 
Amnesty International also calls on the Mexican state to urgently develop and implement a plan for the orderly, progressive, and demonstrable withdrawal of military forces from public security tasks, with a view to ensuring non-repetition of events such as those that took place in Ayotzinapa.

“The details of Artyom Kamardin’s arrest and torture are horrific even against the abysmal human rights standards of today’s Russia. It seems that Russian law enforcement officers believe they have complete impunity for all sorts of human rights violations against people who oppose Russia’s war in Ukraine. The world must not look away but rather remind the Russian leadership:  those responsible will be brought to justice for all crimes under international law, including war crimes committed in Ukraine and human rights violations committed in Russia. 
It seems that Russian law enforcement officers believe they have complete impunity for all sorts of human rights violations against people who oppose Russia’s war in Ukraine 
“The police did not hide the fact that they tortured Artyom Kamardin and forced him, visibly beaten, to apologize on camera for publishing a video recital of an anti-war poem. They then shared his forced “apologies” through Kremlin-friendly social media.” 
“The Russian authorities must urgently launch an independent, impartial and effective investigation into reports of torture and other ill-treatment of Artyom Kamardin and other activists. Their refusal to do so should be a further signal to the international community of the need to deploy every applicable international, regional and national mechanism to ensure that those responsible for these violations and for other crimes under international law face justice in fair trials. Artyom Kamardin and all those tortured or otherwise ill-treated must be provided with all necessary health care and the charges against them must be dropped.” 
Background 
On 26 September 2022, armed police broke into the home of Artyom Kamardin and his girlfriend Aleksandra Popova. They apprehended them and their friend Aleksandr Menyukov. During the search, which their lawyer was not allowed to attend, police officers reportedly beat Kamardin and raped him with a dumbbell. According to Aleksandra Popova, law enforcement officers filmed this and forced her to watch the video. 
Artyom Kamardin was then put on his knees and forced to record an “apology” video for posting a mock recital of the anti-war poem “Glory to Kievan Rus; Novorossiya sucks.” 
According to Aleksandra Popova, she was also physically and verbally assaulted by police officers, who allegedly stuck stickers to her face with superglue, pulled out her hair, and threatened her with gang rape. She was later diagnosed with head injuries and bruises. 
Artyom Kamardin was diagnosed with concussion, multiple bruises and other injuries, according to his lawyer. The authorities refused to hospitalize him and his health condition remains unknown at the time of writing.Artyom Kamardin was named a suspect in a case of “inciting hatred or enmity with the threat of violence” (Article 282(2) of the Russian Criminal Code) together with activists Nikolai Dayneko and Yegor Shtovba. If convicted, they face up to six years in prison.

The Iranian authorities must also urgently repeal laws that impose compulsory veiling on women and girls, perpetuate violence against them and strip them of their right to dignity and bodily autonomy, and abolish the “morality” police which enforces these abusive and discriminatory laws. 
Two weeks after Mahsa Amini’s arbitrary arrest in Tehran, and 10 days following her death, the Iranian authorities have failed to properly investigate the circumstances surrounding her death in custody and take steps to bring those responsible to justice. Instead, they have repeatedly denied responsibility for her death, concealed vital evidence, and threatened her family and others questioning the official narrative and calling for justice. 
Given the persistent refusal of the Iranian authorities to effectively investigate and provide accountability for the most serious crimes under international law, UN member states must urgently support the establishment of an international investigative and accountability mechanism by the UN Human Rights Council to address the prevailing crisis of impunity in Iran. Support for such a mechanism would send a message to the Iranian authorities that the most serious crimes under international law and other human rights violations, such as unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment, including against women for not complying with compulsory veiling laws, will not be tolerated.

Nasta Loika was arbitrarily detained on 6 September 2022 as she was leaving the Minsk City Court after attending the hearing where human rights defenders Marfa Rabkova, Andrei Chapyuk and their eight co-defendants were handed lengthy prison sentences on fabricated charges. On 7 September, Nasta Loika was sentenced to 15 days in detention, purportedly for “petty hooliganism”, a violation under Article 19.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences. Nasta Loika has committed no crime and she is being targeted in retaliation for her work. On 22 September, the Frunzenski District Court of Minsk sentenced her again to 15 days in detention on the same charges.  
The hearing on 22 September was online, and Nasta Loika was not allowed to attend. She has also been denied access to her lawyer. The authorities have also refused her medical treatment that she needs, and basic necessities, including warm clothes and drinking water.

0,Russia/Ukraine: So-called referenda in the occupied territories are in blatant breach of international law ,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/russia-ukraine-so-called-referenda-in-the-occupied-territories-are-in-blatant-breach-of-international-law/,"Reacting to news that “voting” has begun in the Russian-occupied areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine on whether to join the Russian Federation, Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said: ...","Reacting to news that “voting” has begun in the Russian-occupied areas of the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine on whether to join the Russian Federation, Denis Krivosheev, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said:  
“These so-called ‘referenda’ are a ruse for Russia to illegally annex occupied Ukrainian territory, which would be another escalation of Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and further evidence of the Kremlin’s profound disregard for international law and the rights of people in the territories under its occupation. The Fourth Geneva Convention expressly prohibits annexation of occupied territory and other acts by the occupying power to deprive the occupied population of the protection of the Convention.”  
These so-called ‘referenda’ and any annexation by Russia that follows have no validity under international law, and, whatever Russia claims as a result, such actions will not change the legal status under international law of the territories Russia occupies. 
“Russia must respect its obligations as the occupying power under international humanitarian law and cease immediately all unlawful actions. It must also immediately end its aggression against Ukraine. All those responsible for crimes under international law, including war crimes, must face justice.”  
Background  
Earlier this week, Russian authorities and their proxies in the Russian-occupied parts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions in Ukraine, announced their intention to hold “referenda” on accession to the Russian Federation.   
On 23 September, representatives of the occupying authorities started making home visits to collect “ballots” from residents. The “referenda” are expected to take five days. Occupying Russian authorities have said that on the fifth and final day of the “referenda” on 27 September so-called polling stations would be open, but not before for security reasons.   
Any attempt by Russia to change the legal status of the territories it controls in Ukraine through occupation, including in the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia regions as well as Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, are a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, and a violation of the right of their population under international humanitarian law.   
Article 47 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states: “Protected persons who are in occupied territory shall not be deprived, in any case or in any manner whatsoever, of the benefits of the present Convention by any change introduced, as the result of the occupation of a territory, into the institutions or government of the said territory, nor by any agreement concluded between the authorities of the occupied territories and the Occupying Power, nor by any annexation by the latter of the whole or part of the occupied territory.”

At the time of being charged, Wan hosted his own show on an independent radio station, in which he commented on current affairs. He also hosted a fundraiser for the education of Hong Kong young protesters in Taiwan. Wan was targeted merely for exercising his right to freedom of expression through peaceful means. Charges against him must be dropped, and he must be released immediately.   
Wan was targeted simply for his political comments about Hong Kong and mainland China, as well as for hosting a fundraiser for sponsoring the education of Hong Kong youths in Taiwan. Peaceful expression of opinion and public fundraising are permissible under international human rights law and standards and must not be criminalized or otherwise restricted through the use of vague national security offences.   
Hong Kong authorities are weaponizing colonial-era charges that have not been used since 1967 to target dissidents. Just this July, the UN Human Rights Committee in its Concluding Observations on the Fourth Periodic Report of Hong Kong have expressed concern over the government using sedition charges to prosecute journalists and representatives of civil society exercising their right to freedom of expression. The prosecution of Wan violates international human rights laws and standards. The Committee urged the repeal of the sedition provisions in the Crimes Ordinance and the discontinuation of all cases against individuals charged for exercising their freedom of expression. The Hong Kong authorities should implement these recommendations immediately.

Edmund Wan, better known as “Giggs”, is a veteran internet radio host and public affairs commentator. Prior to his arrest, he was the host of four shows on a local independent online radio station in Hong Kong. Wan also commented on current affairs on his social media platforms and paid membership platform. Other than comments critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese central authorities, he started a fundraiser for sponsoring the education of Hong Kong youths in Taiwan in February 2020. These youths fled the city for Taiwan as the Hong Kong government arrested tens of thousands of young people who took part in the 2019 protests.   
On 21 November 2020, Wan was arrested under Article 21 of the Hong Kong National Security Law for providing financial assistance for the commission by other persons of secession. However, on 8 February 2021, Wan was officially charged with four counts of ‘doing an act with a seditious intention’. He was further charged on 10 May 2021 with an additional five counts of money-laundering and one count of conspiring to commit an act with a seditious intention. In May 2022, the prosecution reached a plea deal with Wan, under which six of the ten charges he was facing would be kept on file if he pleaded guilty to the remaining charges and agree to the prosecution’s application to confiscate the crowdfunding proceeds. His sentence will be handed down on 7 October 2022.   
The colonial-era sedition charges in Hong Kong have only been resuscitated by the government since 2020. No one has been prosecuted under these charges since 1976. The authorities weaponized these charges to prosecute political activists, journalists and authors who exercised their right to freedom of expression. In December 2021, executives and board members of the defunct media outlet Stand News were arrested for “seditious publications”. On 6 April 2022, national security police arrested six people on sedition charges because they “caused nuisance” during a court hearing. Two were subsequently charged with sedition for clapping and chanting slogans in court. On 10 April 2022, a journalist was arrested for allegedly publishing “seditious materials”. On 20 April 2022, a political activist was convicted of “uttering seditious words” and sentenced to 40 months’ imprisonment for chanting popular protest slogans such as “Down with the Communist Party” and “Five demands, not one less” in public.  
The recent UN Human Rights Committee’s Concluding Observations on the Fourth Periodic Report of Hong Kong, China, has rightly noted that the Hong Kong government has invoked the sedition provisions in the Crimes Ordinance, after decades of disuse, to suppress freedom of opinion and expression. Moreover, sedition provisions are additionally problematic because they are construed as a national security offence, therefore is investigated by special police in the newly established national security department, which have been granted excessive investigatory powers.

0,Iran: World must take meaningful action against bloody crackdown as death toll rises,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/iran-world-must-take-meaningful-action-against-bloody-crackdown-as-death-toll-rises/,"The bravery of protesters facing a spiralling deadly response by the Iranian security forces over the past days after the death of Mahsa Amini reveals the extent of outrage in Iran over abusive compulsory veiling laws, unlawful killings, and widespread repression, Amnesty International said today....","The bravery of protesters facing a spiralling deadly response by the Iranian security forces over the past days after the death of Mahsa Amini reveals the extent of outrage in Iran over abusive compulsory veiling laws, unlawful killings, and widespread repression, Amnesty International said today. 
Evidence gathered by the organization from the past two nights of fresh violence in 20 cities and 10 provinces across Iran points to a harrowing pattern of Iranian security forces deliberately and unlawfully firing live ammunition at protesters. With the death toll reaching at least 30 people, four of them children, the organization reiterated its calls for urgent global action, warning of the risk of further bloodshed amid a deliberately imposed Internet black out. 
On the night of 21 September alone, shootings by security forces left at least 19 people dead, including at least three children. Amnesty International has reviewed photos and videos showing deceased victims with horrifying wounds in their heads, chests and stomachs. 
“The rising death toll is an alarming indication of just how ruthless the authorities’ assault on human life has been under the darkness of the internet shutdown. There is no such thing as “an impartial investigation” within Iran. UN member states must go beyond toothless statements, hear the cries for justice from victims and human rights defenders in Iran and urgently set up an independent UN investigative mechanism,” said Heba Morayef, Middle East and North Africa Director at Amnesty International 
The anger expressed on the streets has also shown how Iranians feel about the omnipresent so-called ‘morality police’ and compulsory veiling laws. It is high time for these discriminatory laws and the security forces enforcing them to be completely removed from Iranian society, for once and for all. 
“The anger expressed on the streets has also shown how Iranians feel about the omnipresent so-called ‘morality police’ and compulsory veiling laws. It is high time for these discriminatory laws and the security forces enforcing them to be completely removed from Iranian society, for once and for all.” 
Amnesty International has recorded the names of 19 people including three children shot dead by security forces on 21 September. The deaths of a further two people, including a 16-year-old bystander, have also been confirmed on 22 September. Further deaths are being investigated. 
Echoing growing frustration at the international community’s failure to take meaningful action to address successive waves of protest killings in Iran, the father of Milan Haghigi, a 21-year-old man killed by security forces on 21 September, told Amnesty International: “People expect the UN to defend us and the protesters. I, too, can condemn [the Iranian authorities], the whole world can condemn them but to what end this condemnation?” 
According to eyewitness accounts, security forces involved in the deadly shootings include Revolutionary Guards agents, paramilitary Basij forces and plainclothes security officials. These security forces have fired live ammunition at protesters with the intention of dispersing, intimidating and punishing them or preventing them from entering state buildings. This is prohibited under international law which restricts the use of firearms to instances where their use is necessary in response to an imminent threat of death or serious injury, and only when less extreme means are insufficient. 
In addition to the 19 people killed on 21 September, Amnesty International has recorded the names of two other people killed by security forces in Dehdasht, Kohgilouyeh and Bouyer Ahmad province on 22 September, including a 16-year-old bystander. 
Since nation-wide protests were triggered by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa (Zhina) Amini after being violently arrested by Iran’s “morality police” in connection with discriminatory and degrading compulsory veiling laws, Amnesty International has recorded the names of 30 people killed by security forces: 22 men, four women and four children. The organization believes the real death toll is higher and investigating further. 
Deaths were recorded in Alborz, Esfahan, Ilam, Kohgilouyeh and Bouyer Ahmad; Kermanshah; Kurdistan, Manzandan; Semnan; Tehran, West Azerbaijan provinces. 
West Azerbaijan province 
This province had one of the highest tolls on the night of 21 September with the death of at least three men and two children. They include Sadrodin Litani, Milan Haghighi and 16-year-old Amin Marefat in Oshnavieh; and Danesh Rahnama and 17-year-old Abdollah Mahmoudpour in the village of Balou. 
A human rights defender shared with Amnesty International the written account of a protester from Ohshnavieh who described how on 21 September, Revolutionary Guards agents randomly fired live ammunition at protesters while they were attempting to enter the Office of the Governor. The protester said: “Revolutionary Guards agents attacked people and as a result of shooting directly [towards protesters] with firearms, three people lost their lives… They included Sadroddin Litani, who was shot in his stomach and neck from a distance of several metres and Amin Marefat who was shot in his heart … the bullet exited through his back.” 
Amnesty International reviewed a corroborating video showing a bullet hole in the back of Amin Marefat’s dead body. 
The father of the third victim from Oshnavieh, Milan Haghighi, told Amnesty International that he died from fatal gunshot wounds including in his leg and torso. 
According to information shared with Amnesty International by human rights defenders with contacts on the ground, the deadly shootings in the village of Balou took place in front of the Basij headquarters there. The organization obtained a voice message from an eyewitness saying: “They [security forces] are directly killing us.” 
Kohgilouyeh and Bouyer province 
Two eyewitnesses from Dehdasht told Amnesty International that 16-year-old bystander, Pedram Azarnoush, was shot dead on 22 September after Revolutionary Guard agents began repeatedly randomly firing live ammunition to disperse protesters. The same night, locals said security forces had killed a second man identified as Mehrdad Behnam Vasl. 
One of the two eyewitnesses told Amnesty International: “The young boy was leaning on a wall and he was only looking at people. The protesters were fleeing, and he did not realize that bullets could come in his direction as well … The security forces were repeatedly firing their weapons in all directions, and everyone was at risk of being shot or not, it was sheer luck whether they [escaped] being hit by a bullet or not.” 
The eyewitnesses said the Revolutionary Guards forces had hidden among trees in a square in Deshdasht and faced no threat when they began shooting at chanting protesters. 
Witnesses said several people also sustained serious gunshot wounds from security forces firing live ammunition, including a 13-year-old boy, Amirali Douhandeh, who was shot in the leg. They reported that security and intelligence officials have established a strong presence at Emam Khomeini hospital in Dehdasht, heavily guarding a section where injured protesters are being treated. 
Semnan province 
Information gathered about Garmsar, Semnan province points to a similar pattern of reckless shooting by security forces resulting in the death of at least one young protester, Mehdi Asgari, on 21 September in front of a police station. 
In video footage purportedly of the incident, which was circulated online, protesters are seen coming under fire while throwing stones at the police station and kicking its entrance door. Amid the sound of gunfire, two protesters are seen falling to the ground. A second video from the same incident reviewed by Amnesty International shows one protester lying lifeless and bleeding on the ground. 
Mazandaran province 
At least six men and one woman are recorded as having been killed in this province. Their names are Mohsen Mohammadi killed in Ghaemshahr; Hannaneh Kia, Hossein Ali Kia and Mehrzad Avazpour killed in Noshahr; Mohammad Hosseinikhah killed in Sari; Milad Zare killed in Babol; and Amir Norouzi killed in Bandar-e Anzali. 
A journalist reported that according to two friends of Hannaneh Kia, she was fatally shot on her way from a doctor’s visit. 
Methodology 
To investigate the ongoing protest crackdown, Amnesty International has so far spoken to and received audio-visual evidence from 30 individuals including 10 eyewitnesses, six protesters and one victim’s relative as well as four human rights defenders and nine journalists outside in Iran who were in turn in contact with primary sources on the ground.

“As President Vladimir Putin seeks to boost the dwindling supply of troops for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, thousands of Russians across the country have peacefully marched on the streets protesting against mobilization and the war. They are raising their voices even amid the stifling of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and as new repressive laws criminalize all forms of anti-war activity. 
“Everyone has the right to freely express their opinions and protest peacefully, including in response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine. All those detained solely for peacefully protesting against mobilization and the war must be immediately and unconditionally released, and all reprisals against dissenting voices in Russia should end. 
“The international community must step up its efforts to end Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, including by supporting those who are peacefully protesting against the invasion or conscientiously objecting to participate in the conflict.” 
Everyone has the right to freely express their opinions and protest peacefully, including in response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine 
Background 
While arresting demonstrators, police officers extensively resorted to unnecessary and excessive force against peaceful protesters, including by beating them with batons and putting them into chokeholds. In Saint Petersburg, one person suffered a broken arm after being beaten by police. 
According to the independent human rights organization OVD-Info, police handed summons to enrol at military enlistment centres to several yesterday’s male detainees in Moscow and Voronezh, Central Russia. The detainees are also at risk of administrative or criminal prosecution. 
Amnesty International is currently undertaking a global campaign to counter the unprecedented attacks against peaceful protesters across the world. Among other things, the campaign is urging governments to stop misusing the criminal, civil and administrative legal systems to silence and deter protesters.

Their urgent need for action was demonstrated most recently by the death in custody of 22-year-old Mahsa (Zhina) Amini, and the barrage of gunfire unleashed on protesters which has left at least eight people dead and hundreds injured, Amnesty International said today. 
Iranian security forces are violently quashing largely peaceful protests sparked by Mahsa Amini’s death on 16 September, days after her violent arrest by the “morality police” for not complying with discriminatory compulsory veiling laws. Amnesty International collected evidence on the security forces’ unlawful use of birdshot and other metal pellets, teargas, water cannon, and beatings with batons to disperse protesters. 
“The global outpouring of rage and empathy over Mahsa Amini’s death must be followed by concrete steps by the international community to tackle the crisis of systemic impunity that has allowed widespread torture, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings by Iranian authorities to continue unabated both behind prison walls and during protests,” said Diana Eltahawy, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“The Iranian authorities’ latest brutal crackdown on protests coincides with Ebrahim Raisi’s speech at the UN. He has been given a platform on the world stage, despite credible evidence of his involvement in crimes against humanity, in a stark reminder of the devastating impact of the repeated failure of UN member states to tackle impunity for grave crimes in Iran.” 
Amnesty International has recorded the deaths of six men, one woman and one child during protests on 19 and 20 September in the provinces of Kurdistan (4), Kermanshah (2) and West Azerbaijan (2). Of these, at least four died from injuries sustained from security forces firing metal pellets at close range. 
At least two other people have lost sight in one or both eyes. Hundreds more, including children, have sustained painful injuries amounting to torture or other ill-treatment due to the unlawful use of birdshot and other munitions against them. 
Shooting to kill and harm  
Amnesty International has gathered eyewitness accounts and analysed images and videos of the protests, which reveal a harrowing pattern of Iranian security forces unlawfully and repeatedly firing metal pellets directly at protesters. 
Eyewitnesses reported that at least three men (Fereydoun Mahmoudi in Saqqez, Kurdistan province; Farjad Darvishi in Urumieh, West Azerbaijan province; and an unidentified man in Kermanshah, Kermanshah province) and one woman (Minou Majidi in Kermanshah, Kermanshah province) died from fatal injuries caused by metal pellets during protests on 19 and 20 September. Four other victims, Reza Lotfi and Foad Ghadimi in Dehgolan, Kurdistan province; Mohsen Mohammadi in Divandareh, Kurdistan province; and a 16-year-old boy Zakaria Khial in Urumieh were killed. Human rights defenders told Amnesty International that according to their sources on the ground, they were shot by security forces but did not have any additional information on the types of munitions used. 
Authorities have confirmed the death of three people in Kurdistan province on 19 September and two people in Kermanshah province on 20 September, but, consistent with widespread patterns of denial and cover-up, they attributed responsibility for their deaths to “enemies of the [the Islamic Republic]”. 
Consistent eyewitness accounts and video footage leave no doubt that those firing weapons during the protests belonged to Iran’s security forces. Extensive video evidence indicates that protesters in Kermanshah, Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan provinces, where protester deaths were recorded, were mostly peaceful. In some places, some protesters engaged in stone-throwing and damaged police vehicles.* This in no way justifies the use of metal pellets, which is prohibited under all circumstances. 
Horrific injuries inflicted on protesters 
According to a primary source interviewed by Amnesty International, on 16 September, the first day of protests, security forces in Saqqez fired birdshot at 18-year-old Nachirvan Maroufi at a distance of about 10 metres, resulting in him losing sight in his right eye. The source said security forces also fired birdshot at another young man, 22-year-old Parsa Sehat, who consequently lost sight in both eyes. 
On 19 September, mass protests spread from Saqqez to other cities populated by Iran’s oppressed Kurdish minority including Baneh, Dehgolan, Divandareh, Kamyaran, Mahabad, and Sanandaj. Protesters, victims’ relatives, and journalists on the ground told Amnesty International that on that day alone, security forces injured hundreds of men, women, and children by repeatedly firing metal pellets at their heads and chests at close range, indicating intent to cause maximum harm. 
An eyewitness to the crackdown in Kamyaran told Amnesty International: “Riot police were repeatedly firing towards people from about 100 metres away… I myself witnessed at least 10-20 people who were shot with metal pellets… Most of them were injured in their backs as they were running away.” 
A protester from Mahabad described a similar pattern. He said: “In response to people chanting ‘Women, Life, Freedom’ and ‘Death to the Dictator’, security forces fired weapons loaded with metal pellets, often from a distance of about 20-30 meters… They particularly targeted people in their head.” 
A journalist from Baneh similarly told Amnesty International: “Security forces directly shot people in their stomachs and backs at close range… Many of those initially shot at and injured were women because women stood in the front.” 
Eyewitness accounts of the security forces’ extensive use of metal pellets are corroborated by videos and photos reviewed by Amnesty International in which sounds of repeated firing are heard and classic spray patterns of birdshot are seen on injured protesters and bystanders.  
Gruesome images and eyewitness testimonies obtained by Amnesty International further indicate that in Divandareh, Saqqez and Dehgolan, security forces also fired unidentified munition, causing gaping wounds on protesters’ legs, chests and abdomens. 
They include Zana Karimi, a 17-year-old boy who sustained severe leg injuries after being shot in Divandareh, which may require his leg to be amputated and Ehsan Ghafouri who suffered severe kidney injuries after being shot in Dehgolan. 
Amnesty International has learnt that most injured protesters and bystanders are not seeking hospital treatment for fear of arrest, which puts them at risk of infection and other medical complications. 
Security forces violently arrested several hundred demonstrators, including children, both during the protests of 19 September and subsequent raids carried out during the night. An eyewitness reported seeing scores of arrested protesters in Kamyaran with fractured heads, noses or arms and bloodied bodies. 
“Iran’s security forces, will continue to feel emboldened to kill or injure protesters and prisoners, including women arrested for defying abusive compulsory veiling laws, if they are not held accountable. With all avenues for accountability closed at the domestic level, the UN Human Rights Council has a duty to send a strong message to the Iranian authorities that those responsible for crimes under international law will not go unpunished,” said Diana Eltahawy. 
Background  
On 13 September 2022, Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini was arrested in Tehran by Iran’s so-called “morality” police, who routinely subject women and girls to arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other ill-treatment for not complying with the country’s discriminatory veiling laws. 
According to eyewitnesses, Mahsa Amini was violently beaten while being forcibly transferred to Vozara detention centre in Tehran. Within hours, she was transferred to Kasra hospital having fallen into a coma. She died three days later. Iranian authorities announced investigations while simultaneously denying any wrongdoing. The promised investigation does not meet the requirements of independence as it is due to be carried out by the Ministry of Interior. 
* End Note – This press release is focused on the provinces of Kurdistan, Kermanshah and West Azerbaijan where protesters were killed. Amnesty International is investigating the crackdown of protests that have taken place in other cities across Iran since 19 September including Hamedan, Rasht, Shiraz, Tabriz, and Tehran.

0,Canada: Nova Scotia to end immigration detention in provincial jails,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/nova-scotia-to-end-immigration-detention-in-provincial-jails/,Nova Scotia's decision to cancel its contract with the CBSA is a win for migrant and refugee rights.,"#WelcomeToCanada campaign celebrates second province to terminate federal contract 
Nova Scotia’s confirmation that it will terminate its immigration detention contract with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is another win for migrant and refugee rights, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International Canada said today. The move follows a landmark decision by British Columbia on July 21 to terminate its own contract with the border agency.“Nova Scotia’s decision is a momentous human rights victory that upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “With two provinces now canceling their immigration detention contracts within weeks, the federal government should show leadership by canceling the remaining agreements, which are at the heart of so many rights violations.” 
‘There is now clear pressure to end this harmful practice across the country. We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit.’ 
Over the past five years, CBSA has incarcerated thousands of people on immigration grounds in dozens of provincial jails across the country. In Nova Scotia, they are held in provincial jails by default because the province has no dedicated immigration holding center. According to information accessed under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, as of April 2021 the federal government pays Nova Scotia one of the highest rates in the country, CAD $392.30 per day, for each immigration detainee.“As a result of Nova Scotia’s decision, immigration detainees will soon be spared the corrosive, human rights-impairing conditions of the province’s jails, where solitary confinement, mass lockdowns and other forms of routine institutional violence have only intensified since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Sheila Wildeman, Co-Chair of East Coast Prison Justice Society and associate professor of law at Dalhousie University. “We call on the federal government to use the resources devoted to maintaining this brutal practice to instead invest in sustainable immigration settlement supports in the community.”In a June 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented that people in Canadian immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. Canada is among only a few countries in the global north with no legal limit on the duration of immigration detention, meaning people can be detained for months or years with no end in sight.The border agency has full discretion over where people in immigration detention are held, with no legal standard guiding the agency’s decision to hold a person in a provincial jail rather than an immigration holding center. In the year following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the agency relied more heavily on provincial jails, holding 40 percent of immigration detainees in those facilities, at least double the percentage in each of the three previous years.People with psychosocial disabilities (mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the immigration detention process. For example, CBSA policy indicates that  immigration detainees with psychosocial disabilities may be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated federal immigration holding centers in order to access “specialized care.” People from communities of colour, and Black people in particular, appear to be incarcerated for longer periods in immigration detention and often in provincial jails instead of immigration holding centers.“Across the Atlantic provinces and throughout the country, migrants and refugee claimants too frequently face abusive, open-ended immigration detention – especially traumatic for those fleeing war or persecution in search of a safe haven,” said Julie Chamagne, Executive Director of the Halifax Refugee Clinic. “Nova Scotia’s decision is an important step forward for human rights. We call on the federal government to enact robust legislative and regulatory changes to stop rights violations in this system across the country.”Nova Scotia’s decision is building powerful momentum to end immigration detention in provincial jails, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Since the start of the #WelcomeToCanada campaign in Nova Scotia six months ago, approximately 4,600 people have called on the province to take this step.“We commend Nova Scotia for its decision to stop locking up refugee claimants and migrants in the province’s jails solely on immigration grounds,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “There is now clear pressure to end this harmful practice across the country. We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit.”

During elections, candidates have a forum that amplifies their statements and so too their repercussions, for better or worse. At these crucial moments, the public must have access to reliable, objective and evidence-based information. In any context, the right to freedom of expression must be protected, including the right to seek and disseminate information, ideas and opinions of all kinds. But in the context of an election this is of vital importance as individuals need to have information in order to exercise their right to participate in public affairs, as well as to express their opinion of candidates. 
In Brazil, this right to information is under attack when one of the candidates – the current President – has consistently used an anti-human rights discourse ever since the previous elections. It is even more at risk given that Jair Bolsonaro is running for re-election and has not only persisted in making such speeches, but has intensified the impact through his actions in government and has used a discourse that questions the legitimacy of other fundamental public institutions in ensuring people’s rights and the guarantees of due process, such as the Federal Supreme Court and the Superior Electoral Court. 
Candidates are free to express their ideas and mobilize those who support them, but this freedom of expression carries obligations and has limits and this is particularly important in the case of senior public officials. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, for example, has determined that when senior public officials issue statements with regard to matters of public interest, they are “submitted to certain limitations since they must verify in a reasonable, but not necessarily exhaustive, manner the facts on which they base their opinions”. Therefore, those who hold public office “should do so with a diligence even greater to the one employed by individuals due to their high investiture, the ample scope and possible effects their expressions may have on certain sectors of the population, and in order to avoid that citizens and other interested people receive a manipulated version of specific facts.” 
In addition, the Court has stated that those who hold public office must take into consideration that “as public officials they have a position of guarantor of the fundamental rights of people and, therefore, their statements cannot ignore those rights or constitute forms of direct or indirect interference or harmful pressure on the rights of those who seek to contribute with public deliberation through the expression and diffusion of their thoughts. This duty of special care is specifically true in situations of greater social conflict, alterations of public order or social or political polarization, precisely because of the set of risks they may imply for certain people or groups at a given time.” 
In the highly polarized context, which is clearly present in Brazil, it is therefore the responsibility of all candidates, and especially those who currently hold the office of president, to live up to this responsibility. They must ensure that both their government proposals and their public discourse are in line with human rights and set out advances – never setbacks – in this area. 
We continue to accompany human rights defenders, activists and journalists who have paid a high price for defending human rights in recent years, as well as people who, in one way or another, have been the victims of hate speech and anti-rights statements. And we call on the current President and other candidates not to waste time on controversies and attacks, but to take this opportunity to focus their efforts on discussing human rights issues that will be key for the country in the next four years, such as measures for a just recovery from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, police violence, the rights of Indigenous peoples, urgent measures to guarantee climate justice and ensure freedom of expression for all people, as well as the protection of human rights defenders and environmentalists. 
The elections must not be used as a pretext for carrying out or promoting human rights violations.

0,China: UN Human Rights Council must ensure accountability for ongoing atrocities in Xinjiang,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/china-un-human-rights-council-must-ensure-accountability-for-ongoing-atrocities-in-xinjiang/,Council must mandate an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes People who recently fled Xinjiang tell Amnesty International of abuses they suffered Free Xinjiang Detainees campaign now profiles 126 women and men believed to be arbitrarily detained  The UN Human Rights...,"The UN Human Rights Council must end its years of inaction and establish an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes under international law in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Amnesty International said today.The Council session, which began on 12 September, is the first since the UN High Commissioner’s recent report on government atrocities in Xinjiang. The long-overdue assessment corroborates extensive evidence of serious human rights violations against Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority communities, documented by Amnesty International and other credible organizations.People who recently fled Xinjiang and family members of detainees continue to tell Amnesty International that people in the region are still being persecuted and arbitrarily detained purely on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.     
“The Human Rights Council has consistently failed to protect the human rights of millions of Muslims in Xinjiang who have suffered countless atrocities over the past five years. Many member states of the Council used the former High Commissioner’s long-standing silence to justify their own,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard.   
The time for half-measures has passed now that the High Commissioner’s office has confirmed that the atrocities documented may constitute crimes against humanity and require immediate attention. 
“But the time for half-measures has passed now that the High Commissioner’s office has confirmed that the atrocities documented may constitute crimes against humanity and require immediate attention. The Council must issue a response commensurate with the scale and gravity of the violations.”Amnesty International is calling on Council members to take concrete steps towards halting the Chinese authorities’ abuses and ensure accountability. The Council must table a resolution during this session and mandate an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations in Xinjiang, with a view to ensuring accountability, including through the identification of suspected perpetrators. 
Member states must also, immediately and unequivocally, demand that the Chinese government release all those arbitrarily detained in internment camps, prisons or other facilities, as well as commit to returning no one to China who is at risk of persecution or other serious human rights violations. 
Chinese authorities have attempted to block investigations by the High Commissioner for Human Rights and others, and have pressured UN member states to minimize or ignore the evidence available. As a result, UN investigators were not permitted to go to Xinjiang and the scope of the High Commissioner’s investigation was limited.By speaking to UN or other investigators or journalists, people living in or with family ties to Xinjiang have risked detention, arrest, imprisonment, torture and enforced disappearance, for themselves and their family members.“Internally, China continues to use severe violence, unlawful restrictions and intimidation, while also employing diplomatic strong-arming on the world stage to cover up its atrocities in Xinjiang. Council members must see China’s attempts to delegitimize the report’s findings for what they are – nothing less than an attempt to hide crimes against humanity and deter criticism,” said Agnès Callamard. “If Council members fail to act now, they will become complicit in the Chinese government’s cover-up. It would send a dangerous message to Chinese authorities that member states can be bullied into ignoring credible evidence of serious human rights violations, and that powerful states are beyond effective scrutiny. 
“This would be an unforgivable betrayal to the millions of victims, survivors and their family members. This includes the many hundreds of thousands of people still believed to be arbitrarily detained.” 
Between January and June 2022, Amnesty International visited Central Asia and Turkey to interview people who recently fled Xinjiang and family members of those arbitrarily detained.Overwhelmingly, those who fled recently were too terrified to speak openly about their experiences, fearing retaliation against family members still in Xinjiang.However, six people who fled Xinjiang between late 2020 and late 2021 agreed to speak to Amnesty International on the condition of anonymity. They described a life of relentless oppression in Xinjiang, stemming from Chinese policies to severely restrict the freedoms of predominantly Muslim ethnic groups. These include grave violations of the rights to liberty and security of person; to privacy; to freedom of movement; to opinion and expression; to thought, conscience, religion, and belief; to take part in cultural life; to equality and non-discrimination; and to freedom from forced labour.An ethnic Kazakh man who left Xinjiang in early 2021 told Amnesty International how people in his town were still unable to practice their religion. “The religious restrictions remain [in 2021]… There were five mosques [in my town] – four were destroyed… The remaining one is guarded and monitored… Nobody goes! … Maybe [people pray] in the dark of night with the window closed, in silence,” he said. 
Amnesty International interviewed the mother of Erbolat Mukametkali, an ethnic Kazakh man. Erbolat was arrested in March 2017, spent a year in internment camps, and was then given a 17-year prison sentence. Erbolat’s mother believes he was arrested solely because of his religious practices. “I miss my son… I’m old, my dream is to die when my son is with me,” she said.Amnesty International also interviewed a male relative of Berzat Bolatkhanm, an ethnic Kazakh, who was arrested in April 2017 after being accused of being a “state traitor”. The relative believes that Berzat was arrested because of his ethnicity and because he was planning to move to Kazakhstan. After a year in an internment camp, Berzat was given a 17-year prison sentence. “He was just doing his job. He was a farmer. Suddenly, because he wanted to move to Kazakhstan… police arrested him… He is not an extremist, not a terrorist,” Berzat’s relative told Amnesty International. 
The religious restrictions remain… There were five mosques [in my town] – four were destroyed… The remaining one is guarded and monitored. 
Among Amnesty International’s more recent interviewees was a woman who now lives in Turkey. Her sister Muherrem Muhammed Tursun, a primary school teacher, disappeared in August 2021 after posting a video on her WeChat profile about her family celebrating Eid. Her family believes she was detained due to her Uyghur ethnicity and because her son went to Turkey to study religion before going back to Urumqi to study dentistry. He was taken away in early 2017 while Muherrem’s mother, Tajinisa Emin, was taken to an internment camp in 2020. When their relatives in Turkey tried to find out more details, a relative still in the region simply replied: “don’t ask questions, they are gone.”These individuals are only a fraction of the likely hundreds of thousands of people arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang, 126 of whom Amnesty International has profiled in its Free Xinjiang Detainees campaign. The Council’s failure to act now would be tantamount to abandoning the survivors and families of victims who have jeopardized their safety by speaking out. 
“In 2022, Muslim ethnic groups continue to face widespread and systematic persecution in Xinjiang. China’s crimes against humanity and other serious violations violate their basic rights and threaten to erase their religious and cultural identities,” said Agnès Callamard.“The international community’s failure to take meaningful action has only empowered China to continue the ongoing violations and cover-up. The Council must mandate an international investigative mechanism now, to end the Chinese authorities’ longstanding impunity.”

0,TUNISIA: Reinstate Revoked Judges and Prosecutors,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/ua-urgent-action/tunisia-reinstate-revoked-judges-and-prosecutors/,"DOWNLOAD A PDF OF UA 83/22 BELOW On 1 June, the President Kais Saied arbitrarily dismissed 57 judges and prosecutors on vague grounds that included obstructing terrorism-related investigations, financial corruption, “moral corruption,” “adultery”, and participation in “alcohol-fueled...","On 1 June, the President Kais Saied arbitrarily dismissed 57 judges and prosecutors on vague grounds that included obstructing terrorism-related investigations, financial corruption, “moral corruption,” “adultery”, and participation in “alcohol-fueled parties.” On 10 August, the Tunis Administrative Tribunal issued an emergency ruling ordering the reinstatement of 49 of the 57 magistrates, but the government has thus far failed to comply with the tribunal decision. The Ministry of Justice must immediately reinstate all arbitrarily removed judges and prosecutors and respect the tribunal’s decision.  
In the Tunis Administrative Tribunal’s ruling on the cases of the 49 judges and prosecutors on 10 August, the tribunal found that the government had “made the contested decision without informing the judges of the allegations against them, which is a serious breach of defense rights, the presumption of innocence and fair trial guarantees set forth in the Tunisian constitution and laws.” The tribunal further stated that the dismissal amounts to a “Damocles sword for judges, undermines the independence of the judiciary …and seriously violates their reputation and right to work….”  
Among the 49 judges and prosecutors, whose dismissal was suspended by the administrative tribunal, are Hamadi Rahmani, magistrate counselor at the Court of Cassation; Mohamed Taher Kanzari, juvenile affairs judge in the Court of Siliana; and Ramzi Bahria, assistant prosecutor in the Mahdia First Instance Tribunal. On 22 June, the three went on hunger strike (Hamadi Rahmani and Ramzi Bahria for 15 days and Mohamed Taher Kanzari for 36 days) to protest their arbitrary dismissal. They told Amnesty International that the Ministry of Justice had not at any point informed them of the grounds for their dismissal and they had not had access to review any official document or evidence against them or challenge it. All three said they were shocked when they heard the news of their dismissal which they learned through social media or colleagues. The authorities did not provide them with a written reasoned decision, access to their disciplinary or judicial files to review any evidence against them, or a means of appeal the denial of these rights. The dismissed judges and prosecutors have been denied their right to work, and have been without their salaries, and medical coverage for over three months.

Since his power grab on 25 July 2021, President Kais Saied has launched repeated attacks on fair trial rights and the independence of the judiciary. On 1 June 2022, President Kais Saied issued Decree-Law 2022-35 giving himself the authority to summarily dismiss judges and prosecutors, based on reports by unspecified “relevant bodies” that they are a threat to “public security” or “the supreme interests of the country” and for acts that “impinge on the reputation, independence or proper functioning of the judiciary”. The same day he dismissed 57 judges whose names were published on the Official Gazette.  He announced their dismissal on a videotaped speech citing accusations that included obstructing terrorism-related investigations, financial corruption, “moral corruption” and “adultery” among other misdeeds and later that day the names of 57 dismissed judges and prosecutors appeared in the Official Gazette.  
This was not President Saied’s first attack on the judiciary. On 12 February 2022, he adopted Decree-Law 2022-11 in which he dissolved the High Judicial Council, a body of magistrates and legal, financial, tax and accounting experts elected mostly by their peers that was set up after Tunisia’s 2011 revolution to supervise the judiciary and shield it from interference by the executive branch. President Saied replaced the Council with a temporary body, partly appointed by him, and granted himself powers in the same Decree-Law to intervene in the appointment, career tracks and dismissal of judges and prosecutors.  
On 14 August 2022, the Tunis Administrative Tribunal issued its emergency decision finding that 49 of the 57 judges and prosecutors arbitrarily dismissed should be reinstated immediately in their jobs. The tribunal’s decision in favour of the judges and prosecutors is not subject to appeal and should be enforced immediately according to article 41 of Law n.72-40 on the Administrative Tribunal. Yet, the Ministry of Justice has thus far refused to comply with the decision. Nearly a month after the tribunal’s decision, the judges and prosecutors have not been reinstated, in complete disregard of the court ruling and the rule of law.  
Subsequent to the Administrative Tribunal’s decision, on 14 August, the Ministry of Justice issued a statement on its Facebook page stating that the judges revoked by Decree-Law 2022-35 on 1 June were being investigated in criminal proceedings. On 20 August, the Ministry of Justice issued a second statement giving more details on the criminal proceedings initiated against them saying the public prosecution seized 109 files related to financial and economic crimes as well as terrorism crimes among others. However, according to one of the lawyers of the 57 judges interviewed by Amnesty International, none of them were officially notified of the judicial proceedings against them and they still have no access to their files in those proceedings. The Ministry of Justice should in any case reinstate the judges, and in the event of credible allegations of wrongdoings that amount to serious misconduct or criminal offences, only initiate disciplinary or judicial proceedings against them in full compliance with international standards.  
The United Nations Human Rights Committee, the body of experts who provide the definitive interpretation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is binding on Tunisia, in their clarification of the state obligation to ensure the right to a fair trial (General Comment 32) has stressed: “Judges may be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence, in accordance with fair procedures ensuring objectivity and impartiality set out in the constitution or the law. The dismissal of judges by the executive, e.g., before the expiry of the term for which they have been appointed, without any specific reasons given to them and without effective judicial protection being available to contest the dismissal is incompatible with the independence of the judiciary.”  
According to the Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Fair trial and Legal Assistance in Africa, adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2005, “[judicial] officials facing disciplinary, suspension or removal proceedings shall be entitled to guarantees of a fair hearing including the right to be represented by a legal representative of their choice and to an independent review of decisions of disciplinary, suspension or removal proceedings.”

“Back in March, Amnesty International sounded the alarm bell over the fate of civilians in Izium which had been under relentless attack by Russian forces since day four of Russia’s all-out invasion of Ukraine. These newly reported discoveries confirm our darkest fears. The people of Ukraine and the world deserve to know how exactly those buried in the forest near Izium have died. For every unlawful killing or other war crime, there must be justice and reparation for victims and their families and a fair trial and accountability for suspected perpetrators. 
The people of Ukraine and the world deserve to know how exactly those buried in the forest near Izium have died 
“We reiterate our call for the international community to provide resources to assist Ukraine in securing evidence and conducting the necessary investigations into how these people died and who was responsible. Those who commit or order crimes under international law should remember: there is no statute of limitation, and justice will catch up with them. To ensure justice and reparation for victims, trials of those suspected of war crimes must adhere to international standards for fair trial.” 
Background 
After retaking control of Izium in Kharkiv region, the Ukrainian authorities announced that they had discovered an improvised grave site in a nearby forest where they counted more than 440 recent burials. According to Oleh Kotenko, Ukraine’s Commissioner for Missing Persons, the grave site was hastily dug to deal with numerous casualties, including from heavy shelling of the town by the Russian forces in February and March 2022. Photographs and testimonies sourced by journalists from the area are consistent with this report. 
Journalists reported that several wooden crosses on the graves bear names of those presumed to be buried beneath, while most have only numbers, including one on a mass grave indicating that 17 Ukrainian soldiers are buried there. 
Since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, Amnesty International has documented numerous serious violations of international humanitarian law (the law of war) by Russian forces, including unlawful attacks on civilians, residential buildings and civilian infrastructure, unlawful killings and other war crimes.

“We have received deeply disturbing information about Aleksei Navalny’s increasingly harsh treatment in the strict regime penal colony where he is currently locked up. This includes severe penalties for purported offences, and repeated efforts to ostracize him from other prisoners who are reportedly not allowed to speak with or even look at him. In gross violation of his rights as well as Russia’s own laws, Aleksei Navalny is not allowed confidential meetings with his lawyer. His health and wellbeing are at grave risk, and this is tantamount to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.”  
“Russian prison authorities are using the cruel methods they have been refining for years to try and break the spirit of Aleksei Navalny by making his existence in the penal colony unbearable, humiliating and dehumanizing. We demand the immediate and unconditional release of prisoner of conscience Aleksei Navalny and accountability for all those who are responsible for his unlawful imprisonment and ill-treatment.”  
Aleksei Navalny was transferred from penal colony IK-5 (Pokrov, Vladimir region) to another colony, with a stricter security regime, IK-6 (Melekhovo, Vladimir region) on 14 June where his treatment by the administration and colony guards has become harsher, according to his lawyers.   
Since 15 August, the colony administration has placed Aleksei Navalny in a punishment cell (shtrafnoy izolyator, or SHIZO, in Russian) four times, either citing minor infringements of prison rules, such as an unbuttoned button on his prison shirt or giving no explanations at all. While in SHIZO, Aleksei Navalny is denied family visits, parcels and letters. The prisoner of conscience has also reportedly been labelled a “malicious violator” of the penal colony’s regime and put in “strict conditions of detention.” It means, among other things, that he is allowed only four visits by relatives per year instead of six.  
In addition to the disciplinary measures against Aleksei Navalny, the colony’s administration told him that they were stripping him of his right to have confidential communications with his lawyer. As a result, Aleksei Navalny must now communicate with his lawyer across an opaque plastic sheet, which makes it impossible for them to exchange or examine any documents.  
Aleksei Navalny’s communication with other prisoners has reportedly been severely restricted: they are allegedly forbidden from talking to or even looking at him.

0,Afghanistan: Taliban torture and execute Hazaras in targeted attack – new investigation,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/afghanistan-taliban-torture-and-execute-hazaras-in-targeted-attack-new-investigation/,"Six people killed during a night raid on a family home in Ghor province, including a 12-year-old girl Ongoing Taliban killings indicate a pattern of attacks on ethnic minorities and members of the former security forces Taliban fighters killed six Hazara people in a deliberate attack on the...","Taliban fighters killed six Hazara people in a deliberate attack on the ethnic minority group in Afghanistan’s Ghor province, Amnesty International said today following a new investigation. 
On 26 June 2022, the Taliban detained and unlawfully executed four men during a night raid operation in search of a former security official. The body of at least one of those executed showed signs of torture. A woman and a 12-year-old girl were also killed during the raid. 
The attack is part of a wider pattern of unlawful targeted killings of people whom the Taliban perceives as adversaries, in this case being both members of the Hazara community and those who were associated with the former Afghan government. 
These violent deaths are further shocking proof that the Taliban continue to persecute, torture and extrajudicially execute Hazara people. 
“The Taliban must immediately end this cruel pattern of targeted killings and, as the de facto authorities, ensure the protection of all Afghans,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The Taliban must investigate these killings and ensure that those responsible are prosecuted in accordance with international human rights obligations and standards. If the de facto authorities cannot provide justice, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should immediately open full investigations into all cases of extrajudicial executions. In addition, along with the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation in Afghanistan, Amnesty International calls for an independent accountability mechanism in and for Afghanistan.” 
Amnesty International documented similar extrajudicial executions of Hazara people in Ghazni province in July 2021, and Daykundi province in August 2021. Despite publicly promising not to target former government officials, the Taliban have still not investigated or prosecuted anyone for the killings. 
Amnesty International conducted eight remote interviews, including with witnesses to the June 2022 attack, analyzed 38 photos and three videos that were taken in the aftermath of the attack, consulted a forensic pathologist to review the images of the bodies, and reviewed satellite imagery of the area to confirm the location of one of the killings. Several of the photos analyzed were published online by Taliban media, including the Ghor Province Governor Media Office, which deleted the post soon after publication. 
On the night of 26 June 2022, Taliban forces raided the home of Mohamad Muradi, a Hazara man and security official under the former government who had also previously led a People’s Uprising Program force – a local militia – against the Taliban in 2020 and 2021. 
Muradi had recently returned to his home in Chahar Asyab, in the Lal wa Sarjangal district in Ghor province, after failing in an attempt to flee to Iran, and then hiding in other cities around the country. Like many who had been involved in Taliban opposition, Muradi had not taken up the offer of a personalized ‘amnesty letter’ – often issued to former security and government officials, offering permission to return home in exchange for a promise to lay down arms – due to the fear of reprisal attacks by the Taliban. 
Witnesses told Amnesty International that, on the night of the attack, Taliban forces fired rifles and rocket-propelled grenades at Muradi’s home, killing Taj Gul Muradi, his 22-year-old daughter, who had studied medicine and had been providing health care in the community. The attack wounded Muradi and two of Muradi’s other children, a son and his 12-year-old daughter. The girl suffered severe stomach injuries and died the next day. 
Muradi’s left leg was injured, and he surrendered to Taliban forces through the intervention of local elders. However, the Taliban then dragged him outside of the house and shot him dead. An analysis of photos of Muradi’s body shows damage to the front of his shirt, indicating a likely chest wound, and an exit wound in his forehead.  
Amnesty International reviewed photos and videos that show damage to Muradi’s home consistent with witness testimony. The images were also geolocated by analyzing visible features – including vegetation, nearby pavements and the buildings’ layout – and satellite imagery. 
Three other men who had been staying at Muradi’s home were detained and then extrajudicially executed. Two of them, like Muradi, had previously been members of the People’s Uprising Program force, though none had taken part in fighting with the militia for some time. 
Ghulam Haider Mohammadi, Muradi’s nephew, had been visiting relatives. Photos of Mohammadi’s body indicate that he was executed with at least one gunshot to head, while kneeling and with his hands bound behind him. Locals found his body approximately 50 meters from Muradi’s home, left between some rocks in a tree-covered area. 
Witnesses told Amnesty International that the other two victims – named Asif Rezayee and Arif Sangaree – were put in a vehicle and driven away to be killed in a separate location. The bodies of the two men were later discovered in an uninhabited part of Takeghal, more than 30 minutes’ drive from where they were initially detained. 
Asif Rezayee had been living in Kabul but had returned to his home village a few days prior to visit family members. Rezayee was executed by gunfire while his hands were cuffed behind his back. Photos and a video of his body show four distinct gunshot wounds, to the head, chest, right thigh, and left hand. Based upon the nature of the wounds, apparent bullet trajectory, and gun powder stains, the wounds to the leg and hand were done at close range prior to execution. Such intentional infliction of pain on a bound detainee constitutes torture, a crime under international law. 
Photos indicate that Arif Sangaree was also executed while bound and detained, with at least one close range shot to the head. One of the photos posted by the Taliban to Facebook, claiming credit for the successful operation, shows Sangaree with a significant facial wound surrounded by fresh bright red arterial blood, indicating the Taliban took the photo immediately after his death. In contrast, photos provided by people who discovered the body show Sangaree with the identical wound, but the blood dark and dried, meaning time had passed. 
The Taliban news sources that posted the image of Arif Sangeree’s body described the night raid as a “targeted operation” that culminated in a fight between “rebels” and “Mujahideen”, or the Taliban. The account claimed seven rebels had been killed, detained and wounded, and that one Taliban member was killed, with two others wounded. 
To justify the deaths, the statement went on to say that the raid had occurred after fighters associated with Mawlavi Mahadi, the Hazara leader of a Taliban defector group, had attacked the Taliban in Balkhab district of Sar-e-Pul province, and then fled and established themselves in the village of Chahar Asyab. This Taliban statement is incorrect. While this fighting has been documented by the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation in Afghanistan in his 6 September 2022 report, which includes cases of Taliban executions of fighters hors de combat, Muradi and his family members were not members of Mahadi’s group or taking part in this round of attacks. Rather, Amnesty International believes the Taliban justification is a pretext for targeting ethnic minorities and soldiers associated with the former government.Bilal Guler/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

Background 
The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan following the collapse of the government in mid-August 2021. Amnesty International has called for the protection of thousands of Afghans at serious risk of Taliban reprisals. There have been numerous cases of raids and extrajudicial executions targeting those the Taliban perceives as adversaries – those affiliated with the former government particularly Hazaras/Shias or those fighting with the National Resistance Front (NRF).

Iranian LGBTI rights defender Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani and another woman, Elham Choubdar, were sentenced to death for “corruption on earth”. The women were targeted due to their real or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity and their social media activities in support of LGBTI communities.    
Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) rights defender Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani, 31, known as Sareh, and another woman, Elham Choubdar, 24, were sentenced to death after the Revolutionary Court in Urumieh, West Azerbaijan province, tried them in early August 2022 and subsequently convicted them of “corruption on earth.” Official statements, state media reports, and statements made by prosecution officials to Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani since her arrest in October 2021 indicate that she was targeted for discriminatory reasons tied to her real or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity, as well as her peaceful LGBTI rights activism, including on social media, and her association with LGBTI asylum seekers in Iraq.   
On 18 July 2022, state media affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards aired a homophobic video portraying Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani as a “criminal” for publishing online content which “promoted homosexuality” and “challenged the stigma around religiously forbidden [namashrou] sexual relations”. The propaganda video linked Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani’s peaceful online LGBTI rights activism to unfounded accusations of “gambling” and “smuggling women and girls from Iran to Erbil [Iraq]” in a bid to vilify her. Court documents and other information reviewed by Amnesty International indicate that Elham Choubdar was similarly targeted for discriminatory reasons related to her real or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity, LGBTI supportive activities on social media, and association with Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani.  
The proceedings leading to the women’s convictions and sentences were grossly unfair. Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani was forcibly disappeared for 53 days following arrest. During this time, she was subjected to abusive interrogations without access to a lawyer, prolonged solitary confinement, homophobic insults, death threats and threats to take away the custody of her children, which violate fair trial rights and the absolute prohibition on torture and other ill-treatment. Amnesty International understands that Elham Choubdar was pressured to make “confessions”. Moreover, the offence of “corruption on earth” fails to meet requirements for clarity and precision needed in criminal law and breaches the principle of legality and legal certainty. Officials told the two women of their sentences on 1 September 2022 in Urumieh prison, where both are held. Their cases have been appealed to the Supreme Court.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei:  
Additional Information:  
The HENGAW Organization for Human Rights reported on 4 September 2022 that Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani and Elham Choubdar were sentenced to death. Following widespread media coverage, Iran’s judiciary confirmed the news on 5 September 2022, announcing that Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani and Elham Choubdar were sentenced to death in connection with “smuggling women and girls”. Prior to this, on 6 November 2021, the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards had claimed they caught “through a complex, multi-layered and extraterritorial intelligence operation, the leader of a network involved in smuggling Iranian girls and women to neighbouring countries for the purpose of corruption and directing and supporting homosexual groups that work under the protection of [foreign] intelligence agencies.” Amnesty International believes that the allegations of smuggling are spurious and baseless and stem from the women’s real or perceived sexual orientation and/or gender identity and in the case of Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani, association with other Iranian LGBTI asylum seekers fleeing systematic persecution in Iran.   
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards arbitrarily arrested Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani in late 2021 near Iran’s border while she was attempting to seek international protection in Türkiye. Elham Choubdar was arrested sometime afterwards. The authorities charged both women with “inciting people to corruption and prostitution” and “spreading corruption on earth” (efsad-e fel arz). They further charged Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani with “illegally entering the country”. As per Iranian criminal law, the charges of “inciting people to corruption and prostitution” and “illegally entering the country” were referred to Branch 111 of Criminal Court 2 in Urumieh for trial, and the charge of “corruption on earth” to the Revolutionary Court in Urumieh. In July 2022, the criminal court convicted Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani of “illegally entering the country” and imposed a cash fine. In the same ruling, the court dismissed, with respect to both women, the charge of “inciting people to corruption and prostitution” on the grounds that the two women were already being prosecuted before the Revolutionary Court in Urumieh on the charge of “corruption on earth” for the same activities and therefore fell outside the jurisdiction of Criminal Court 2. The verdict of Branch 111 of Criminal Court 2 in Urumieh, which has been reviewed by Amnesty International, states that the women were charged with “corruption on earth” based on their “activities in the online environment”, but does not provide more information.    
In mid-January 2022, Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani was told by the lead investigator of Branch 6 of the Office of the Revolutionary and Public Prosecutor in Urumieh that she was accused of “spreading corruption on earth” including through “promoting homosexuality”, “communication with anti-Islamic Republic media channels” and “promoting Christianity”. The first two accusations stem from her public defence of LGBTI rights, including on her social media platforms such as Telegram and Instagram, and during an appearance in a BBC documentary aired in May 2021 about the abuses that LGBTI people suffer in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KR-I). According to information obtained by Amnesty International, the latter accusation is for wearing a cross necklace and attending a house church in Iran several years ago.  
Prior to embarking on the hazardous segment of her journey across the Iran-Türkiye border, Zahra Sedighi-Hamadani recorded a video message and asked a trusted contact to release it if she does not make it to Türkiye safely. In the video circulated by the Iranian Lesbian and Transgender Network (6Rang) on 7 December 2021, she says, “I want you to know how much pressure we LGBT people endure. We risk our lives for our emotions, but we will find our true selves… I hope the day will come when we can all live in freedom in our country… I am journeying toward freedom now. I hope I’ll arrive safely. If I make it, I will continue to look after LGBT people. I will be standing behind them and raising my voice. If I don’t make it, I will have given my life for this cause.”   
Iran’s penal code criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults, as well as between children, prescribing corporal punishments, such as flogging, which constitute torture, and the death penalty, which is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty International’s research consistently shows that Revolutionary Courts lack independence and impose harsh sentences on human rights defenders and others under the influence of security and intelligence bodies and following grossly unfair, summary and predominantly secret processes which undermine the right to a fair trial. Human rights defenders and lawyers in Iran have repeatedly said Revolutionary Courts lack constitutional basis and should be abolished. Amnesty International has also previously documented the Iranian authorities’ criminalization of human rights defenders which takes place against the backdrop of ongoing smear campaigns against human rights defenders, particularly on the internet, in a bid to undermine their human rights work.

‘We heartily congratulate the winners and thank them for their extraordinary efforts to spotlight injustice and celebrate people and communities building a more equitable world.’ 
To be presented in a virtual ceremony on October 12, 2022, the awards recognize excellence in human-rights reporting by Canada-based journalists and Canadian journalists working abroad. This year’s winners are: 
“We heartily congratulate the winners and thank them for their extraordinary efforts to spotlight injustice and celebrate people and communities building a more equitable world,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada (English Section). “Because of their journalism, we have a clearer view of the human-rights challenges — and opportunities — emerging in Canada and how they connect with the global movement for freedom, dignity, and justice for all.” 
A former journalist herself, Nivyabandi said the winning pieces stood out because they explore complex issues through the prism of human stories. “At its best, human-rights journalism is deeply personal. On their own, hard-won facts and savvy analysis may engage the audience’s mind, but it is the appeal to one’s own human experience that ultimately sparks people to act.” 
The honoured works, both individually and as a group, reveal important connections between human-rights issues and people’s intersecting identities, Nivyabandi added. “To fully measure the human impact of climate change, anti-LGBTQ2S+ discrimination, and gender-based violence, we must connect them with poverty, racism, or corporate accountability. Without an intersectional lens, journalists and human-rights defenders alike are powerless to make sense of the most pressing issues of our time.” 
The winners will accept their awards during a virtual ceremony at 7:30 pm ET/4:30 pm PT on Wednesday, October 12, to be streamed on Amnesty International Canada’s Facebook page. Hosting the festivities will be Emily Mills, the Toronto-based founder of How She Hustles, a social network connecting tens of thousands of diverse professional women in Canada and beyond.   
This year’s panel of judges featured a diverse group of experts in Canadian media: 
“We thank the judges for the time and effort they invested in reviewing the submissions,” said Nivyabandi. “The Media Awards would not be possible without their expertise and their commitment to celebrating the best of what Canadian human-rights journalism has to offer.”

“As Ukraine regains control of land occupied by Russian forces, it must prioritize securing evidence of their alleged war crimes. Gathering such evidence is extremely resource-intensive, and so we are calling on the international community to provide resources that will assist Ukraine’s efforts. All ongoing and future trials over alleged war crimes must meet fair trial standards.” 
As Ukraine regains control of land occupied by Russian forces, it must prioritize securing evidence of their alleged war crimes 
“In what appears to be a response to Ukraine’s military gains, Russia has launched attacks that caused significant damage to critical civilian infrastructure, including a power plant strike that led to power and water outages and disrupted civilian activities. We remind Russia that deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure may amount to war crimes. These strikes must be investigated with a view to ensuring that anyone suspected of criminal responsibility is brought to justice.” 
Background 
In recent days, Ukrainian forces have reportedly regained control of over 3,000 square kilometres of territory previously occupied by Russia, including Izyum and Kupiansk, two key towns in Kharkiv oblast. 
As Russian forces retreat, evidence of alleged war crimes committed by them and Russia-backed armed groups is emerging in the form of testimonies, video footage and photographs. 
On 10 September, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies reported that police officers had exhumed the bodies of two men allegedly tortured and killed by Russian forces in Hrakove village, Kharkiv oblast, in March. 
On 11 and 12 September, Russian military strikes damaged critical energy infrastructure, resulting in major disruptions to electricity and water supplies as well as train services.

We welcome the Special rapporteur’s report which is a critical addition to the existing documentationof the ongoing crisis the people inAfghanistan are facing. 
“We welcome the Special rapporteur’s report which is a critical addition to the existing documentation of the ongoing crisis the people in Afghanistan are facing. The Special Rapporteur highlights the significant reversal of gains made in Afghanistan when it comes to women’s rights, girls’ education, protection of minorities, access to justice, freedom of expression and association among other critical rights. We are deeply concerned that these human rights violations and abuses continue with impunity in the absence of a mechanism to hold the Taliban de- facto authorities accountable,” said Yamini Mishra, South Asia Regional Director at Amnesty International. 
Despite the promises made by the Taliban at the Doha Peace Negotiations and in subsequent announcements as they gained Afghanistan control in August 2021, the Taliban have not adhered to their own announced ‘general amnesty’. Enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests, extra judiciary killings, revenge killings of different groups especially of former Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) and government officials, targeting of communities based on ethnic and religious identity such as Hazaras, and targeted killings of members of the National Resistance Front (NRF) and members of Islamic State of Khorasan Province (IS-KP) with near blanket impunity has continued in the last 12 months. These gross human rights violations are documented both by the Special Rapporteur and in independent investigations by Amnesty International which highlight the urgent need to investigate and prosecute the alleged perpetrators of these crimes. 
“The Taliban have broken their promises to the people in Afghanistan and the international community time and again. Amnesty International emphasizes that the findings in the Special Rapporteur’s report on targeted killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations, particularly in Panjshir province against civilian population must serve as enough evidence to the member states at Human Rights Council to start time bound plans of actions to pressurize the Taliban de-facto authorities for an immediate end of these human rights abuses and violations,” said Yamini Mishra. 
Amnesty International emphasizes that the findings in the Special Rapporteur’s report… must serve as enough evidence to the Human Rights Councilto start time bound plans of actionsto pressurize the Taliban for an immediateend of the human rights abuses and violations. 
As member states meet today at Human Rights Council 51 session, over 850,000 girls above grade six in Afghanistan are being denied their right to education. As elders and communities in Paktia province decided to re-open secondary schools for girls, the Taliban de-facto authorities once again closed these schools, used violence against girl student protestors and detained journalists reporting the girl students’ protest. This is in addition to exclusion of women from work, traveling, political and public participation and much more. Musicians, artists and those associated with cultural sites are at risk too according to the report, despite assurances by the Taliban one year ago, that the country would not lapse into the violations of cultural rights that were seen twenty years ago. All of these have been documented by the Special Rapporteur as well as Amnesty international in its various reports in since the Taliban takeover on 15 August 2021. 
Reports of shrinking civic space, arrest and beating of protestors including women, targeting of journalists and silencing of media which have also been documented by the Special Rapporteur, further underscores previous Amnesty documentation of these human rights violations in the country. This reflects the continued indifference of the Taliban to their legal obligations to respect and protect the rights of Afghan people under international human rights law. 
The international community must seize the opportunity presented by the Special Rapporteur’s report to the human rights council and action upon his recommendations. 
“Afghanistan stands at crossroads one year after the Taliban forcibly took control of the country. The need for further supporting the mandate of the Special Rapporteur as well as the need for more concerted efforts to close the accountability gap is clear. The international community must seize the opportunity presented by the Special Rapporteur’s report to the human rights council and action upon his recommendations. Without an inclusive government and adequate legal frameworks, protections and institutions, the rights of the Afghan people will continue to be trampled upon,” said Yamini Mishra. 
Since the return of the Taliban to power in August 2021, there have been widespread human rights violations documented by Amnesty International including rights of minorities and women and girls, enforced disappearances, torture, unlawful killings and arbitrary arrests particularly in areas such as the Panjshir, attack on freedom of speech and expression and persecution of ethnic and religious minorities. 
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in Afghanistan was appointed during the 49th session of the Human Rights Council in April 2022 and presented his first report on 12 September 2022 at the 51st session of the Human Rights Council.

I invite you to read this powerful blog post written by Bernardo Caal Xol, an Indigenous Maya Q’eqchi’ leader, environmental and human rights defender, and teacher who spent over 4 years as a prisoner of conscience in Guatemala.  
Over the summer, we’ve seen that the governments of BC and Canada, alongside pipeline companies, police, and banks, continue to prioritize profits over the rights, safety, and dignity of Wet’suwet’en and Secwepemc land defenders. Police are subjecting land defenders to aggressive treatment including surveillance, arbitrary detention, and excessive use of force. This is all despite repeated recommendations and strongly worded letters of concern from the United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which continues to call on Canada to stop pipeline construction and to guarantee the rights of land defenders.  
TAKE ACTION! Check out this summer blog post, where you can find information, a quick e-action, an urgent letter-writing action, and many more actions and resources. 
Canada is also responsible for environmental and human rights violations in other countries. For one example (among many, many others), Export Development Canada (EDC) is one of the financiers of a hydroelectric dam megaproject, Hidroituango, which nearly collapsed in Colombia. EDC was repeatedly warned of the risks of financing the dam. Four years after the disaster, communities continue to speak up about the human rights abuses, environmental destruction, and other violence caused by the dam. It’s long past time for EDC to take responsibility for its role in the harm done.  
TAKE ACTION! Above Ground Program Officer Georgina Alonso and Amnesty Canada campaigner Kathy Price wrote a blog post about this injustice. Take a look at the post and sign our e-action. 
What do these and so many other environment-related human rights violations have in common? Their direct connection to Canada’s relentless fossil fuel financing may be the clearest answer. Canada’s fossil fuel exports are among the world’s largest, and the use of public money for this makes Canada a key perpetrator of the devastating harms caused by burning fossil fuels. This, together with the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)’s financing of the Coastal Gaslink pipeline, which is violating the rights of Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and land defenders, is a deeply troubling display of where Canada’s spending is leading our planet.

“We deeply regret the Senate’s decision. We have already seen the disastrous results of the militarization of public security forces in Mexico over the last 16 years. Instead of continuing along this path, we call on the executive branch to design a plan for the progressive withdrawal of the armed forces from the streets, prioritizing the strengthening of civilian police forces and the development of public prevention policies aimed at guaranteeing public safety. Enough of human rights violations and impunity!” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, executive director of Amnesty International Mexico. 
On 27 May 2019, Mexico established the National Guard as its main public security institution, under the civilian control of the Secretariat of Public Security and Citizen Protection. Since its establishment, the National Guard has been criticized for operating in an increasingly militaristic manner and the fact that more than 70% of its personnel come from the army or navy. In parallel, the National Guard has been criticized for the numerous human rights violations that are rightly attributed to it. Between 2020 and 2022, more than 1,100 complaints against this institution were presented before the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) regarding crimes under international law including enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, unlawful killings and torture, among others. 
On 31 August 2022, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador proposed legislative reforms to increase the militarization of the National Guard even further. The proposed reforms: 1) formally place the National Guard under the military control of the Secretary of National Defence; 2) allow active military personnel to serve in the institution without leaving their military posts; 3) require high-level National Guard commanders to come from military posts; 4) allow crimes, including crimes under international law and human rights violations, perpetrated by National Guard personnel to be tried before military, not civilian, courts; and 5) institute military training for all National Guard personnel. 
Militaristic proposal 
The reforms approved by the Senate today are the latest in a series of laws and proposals relinquishing control to the military over public security functions in Mexico since 2006, in the context of the so-called “war on drugs”. This militaristic approach to public security has had disastrous consequences for human rights. There are more than 100,000 disappeared people in Mexico, while the army and the navy have been accused of generalized human rights violations. SEDENA has been the subject of more than 4,000 complaints of human rights abuses to the CNDH since 2014. 
The members of congress and senators have decided to infringe on international norms stipulating that military involvement in public security activities should be exceptional and only apply under certain conditions. In light of these standards, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and other UN bodies have repeatedly expressed their concern over the use of militarized army and police forces in public security activities in Mexico. These concerns and recommendations have today been dismissed. 
In its report on Mexico in April 2022, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances urged the Mexican state to “abandon the militarized approach to public security”, as it has been insufficient and inadequate in terms of protecting human rights. It also recommended strengthening civilian forces and establishing a plan for an orderly, immediate and demonstrable withdrawal of military forces from public security tasks. 
The reality in figures 
Amnesty International, together with civil society organizations, has warned that the militarized public security strategy has been a failure. Mexico is a much more dangerous country today than it was 16 years ago. Killings have increased 218% between 2006 and 2022; in 16 years more than 100 journalists have been killed (15 of these in the first eight months of this year) and over 97% of the more than 105,000 cases of disappeared people in the country occurred after December 2006. 
Members of the Mexican military have committed frequent crimes under international law and serious human rights violations with impunity. From 2014 to date, the CNDH has received at least 6,661 complaints of human rights violations committed by SEDENA, SEMAR (the Ministry of the Navy) and the National Guard. In all those years, SEDENA has been among the 10 institutions with the most complaints, and that list includes the National Guard.

He remains at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.   On 27 July 2021,...","Iran’s prosecution authorities and security and intelligence agents in West Azerbaijan Province have forcibly disappeared an Iranian Kurdish dissident, Edris Feqhi, since July 2021. He remains at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.   
On 27 July 2021, Revolutionary Guards announced an armed ambush on members of the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), a Kurdish opposition group, in Boukan, West Azerbaijan province. Edris Feqhi was subsequently identified as one of the men fired upon. His family initially thought that he had died based on state media reports. However, in August 2021, eyewitnesses informed the family that he was injured and arrested shortly after escaping the initial site of the shooting in Elm Abad village. Between September and November 2021, two former detainees reported to the Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) having seen him alive in a Revolutionary Guards detention centre in Almahdi barracks in Urumieh, West Azerbaijan province. They said he was in dire health due to torture and lack of medical care.    
After strenuous efforts by Edris Feqhi’s family, an official at the Prosecutor’s Office in Urumieh verbally confirmed his detention on 29 September 2021 but refused to disclose his whereabouts and said he will call his family once the investigation stage ends. However, in November 2021, a senior official at Branch 6 of the Prosecutor’s Office in Urumieh denied this information. Over the past year, officials at Almahdi barracks have generally told the family that they cannot provide any information but sometimes advised the family to seek written authorization for a family visit from the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards, indicating that Edris Feqhi is in their custody. At the public relations office of the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards in Urumieh, officials have on occasion said that Edris Feqhi will call his family “upon the completion of administrative processes”. At other times, they have said he is dead, provided contradictory accounts about the circumstances surrounding his supposed death and burial, or claimed that a death certificate will soon be issued. In late July 2022, the Ministry of Intelligence (MOI) summoned Edris Feqhi’s mother after she posted a video online asking human rights groups for support. MOI agents first said that Edris Feqhi had died but then suggested that he was undergoing criminal proceedings and the family should hire a lawyer. The same month, a MOI agent informally told a source interviewed by KHRN that Edris Feqhi had been moved to a MOI detention centre in Urumieh.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei:  
On 27 July 2021, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards announced in a statement covered by state media outlets that they had “identified and destroyed … a terrorist team in the area of Boukan, which consisted of three individuals and was on a mission to carry out destructive and anti-security actions.” The statement added that two members of the team were killed and another was injured. On 6 August 2021, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK) issued a statement identifying the two men killed as Edris Feqhi and Mohsen Ghaderi. Edris Feqhi’s family subsequently held a funeral for him without the body. According to a witness interviewed by Amnesty International, Ministry of Intelligence agents raided the funeral, interrogated several mourning relatives, and detained one for several days. In August 2021, Edris Feqhi’s family travelled from Sanandaj, Kurdistan province, where they live, to the village of Elm Abad and other nearby villages in West Azerbaijan province to obtain more information about the circumstances surrounding the reported killing of Edris Feqhi and Mohsen Ghaderi. They also approached several government offices and military bases in the area in search of Edris Feqhi’s body. During this process, they learned from several eyewitnesses that Mohsen Ghaderi survived the shooting and fled Iran, and that Edris Feqhi had been arrested, taken to Arefian hospital in Urumieh, West Azerbaijan province, and then moved to an unidentified location. At Arefian hospital, medical staff told the family that they were not allowed to provide any information.   
The family intensified their search after Kurdistan Human Rights Network( KHRN) reported in September 2021 that a former detainee had seen Edris Feqhi in a Revolutionary Guards detention centre in Almahdi barracks in Urumieh. They went to Almahdi military barracks several times to seek information but they were told by Revolutionary Guards agents that Edris Feqhi was not held in the barracks or advised to seek written authorization for a visit from the public relations office of the Intelligence Organization of the Revolutionary Guards known as No. 114 or Branch 6 of the Prosecutor’s Office, both in Urumieh. In November 2021, the family managed to secure a meeting with the lead investigator (bazpors) at Branch 6 of the Prosecutor’s Office. The official denied the confirmation given earlier in September 2021 about Edris Feqhi’s detention and said prosecution authorities have no information about him.   
On 21 February 2022, Edris Feqhi’s relatives gathered peacefully in front of No. 114. Throughout the day, Revolutionary Guards agents gave them various contradictory accounts about the fate and whereabouts of Edris Feqhi. First, they took the phone number of the family and said they would call in an hour. Then they promised to provide the family with a death certificate. After several hours, they said providing a death certificate was not an option but they could show the family a picture of Edris Feqhi’s body. They added that Revolutionary Guards had shot Edris Feqhi dead and buried him in an unspecified location which they described as “la’nat abad” (a derogatory term meaning damned land in Persian, which has been used by the authorities since 1979 for remote grave sites where victims of politically-motivated executions are buried in unmarked individual or mass graves). Later in the afternoon, agents yet again changed their narrative saying they had no involvement with the case of Edris Feqhi and he had been killed during an armed confrontation between two Kurdish armed opposition groups. Distressed with these contradictory accounts, Edris Feqhi’s mother threatened to immolate herself. Revolutionary Guards agents then took her and Edris Feqhi’s brother inside No.114 and told them that after they shot Edris Feqhi dead, Mohsen Ghaderi carried away the body and buried it in an unidentified location. They then put Edris Feqhi’s mother and brother in a car and drove them to a nearby police station where they were put under pressure to sign a statement undertaking not to gather in front of No. 114 again. Other relatives who were standing outside No. 114 were also escorted to the police station and pressured to sign the same undertaking. In response to the continued insistence by Edris Feqhi’s relatives for information, a Revolutionary Guard agent approached the family at the police station and said outside of earshot of other agents that Edris Feqhi was detained in Almahdi barracks.  
Amnesty International has learned that Edris Feqhi was a civil society and environmental activist in Kurdistan province for many years. A statement issued by the PJAK on 6 August 2021 suggests that, in the face of intensified attacks on civil society activists, Edris Feqhi decided to join the political wing of PJAK and move to its base in northern Iraq. PJAK has both armed and political wings. Those joining its political wing may carry arms, including when crossing into Iran for recruitment or political organizing purposes, but they are not tasked with waging armed attacks on state bodies. A local journalist who investigated the circumstances surrounding the shooting on 24 July 2021, including by speaking to local witnesses, told KHRN in August 2021 that Edris Feqhi and Mohsen Ghaderi were not armed at the time of the ambush. According to the journalist, the Revolutionary Guards identified the men after the individual with whom they were staying in Iran reported them. The right to freedom of expression includes the right to peacefully advocate for any political visions so long as the ideas espoused do not advocate hatred constituting incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence. The right to freedom of expression is protected under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified.

Background 
Under the STCA, most refugee claimants who arrive at an official land port of entry seeking protection in Canada are denied entry and turned back to the US, where many suffer serious rights violations in detention. Because the agreement only applies at official border crossings, many refugees have been forced to cross the border in between ports of entry, sometimes in perilous conditions. Withdrawing from STCA would ensure that Canada meets is legal obligations under the Charter and international law, and would end the need for irregular crossings.   
The legal challenge has a long history; twice the Federal Court has found the STCA violated refugee claimants’ Charter rights and twice the Federal Court of Appeal has overturned the decision on technical grounds. Canada’s highest court will be reviewing the rights-violating Agreement for the first time.

Gender-based violence is one of the worst societal ills, and prevalent instances of sexual violence, misogyny, transphobia, and rampant rates of violence all point to gender-based violence being an endemic. 
This kind of violence takes more forms than only physical, and its effects can be cerebral and have both immediate and long-term detrimental impacts on social, political, and economic rights, all which contribute to the failure of fully upholding the lives of women and girls. We’ve seen this manifest in the worst forms of domestic violence against women like Sania Khan and Mandeep Kaur, the recent doxxing, swatting, and unjust arrest at gunpoint of Clara Sorrenti, and horrifying incidents of sexual violence against women and girls during conflict in Ethiopia. 
In the global context, this is true for Afghan women and girls who, for over one year have collectively experienced some of the greatest degrees of violence. The detrimental ban on schools for girls will have long-term consequences but is not the only pressing issue for Afghans, who are suffering from both a political and humanitarian crisis under the rule of the Taliban. Mass hunger, economic precarity, brain drain, reprisals for protests, and the removal of legal protections for women are only some of the many issues making up the reality of living conditions for millions in the country. Since August 2021, the Taliban have issued 28 verdicts and decrees that abuse the livelihoods of women and girls, and these are each verdicts and decrees that must be undone for the full restoration of their rights. 
Act Now to Support Afghans in Need and Show Your Solidarity 
MMIWG2S and Sisters in Spirit Vigils 
Since the release of the 2021 Nation Action Plan: Ending Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ People, Indigenous partners and jurisdictions at the provincial, territorial, and federal levels have been working on the implementation plans for the different chapters of the NAP. In June 2022, together they produced a NAP Progress Report that monitored the implementation, challenges in the process and recommendations for the ongoing work. 
While this process continues, incidents of MMIWG2S keep happening, and investigations have been fraught with discrimination and negligence. The disappearances and deaths of Tatyanna Harrison, Chelsea Poorman, and Noelle ‘Ellie’ O’Soup are evidence of this, and greater accountability from police forces are an ongoing demand. Survivors and their families need to be supported. 
Abortion Rights 
This summer, the overturning of Roe V. Wade ended federal protections for abortion rights in the United States, reversing nearly 50 years of essential protections of the rights of women, girls, and those who can become pregnant. Many US states moved swiftly to implement standing or new laws to ban or severely curtain abortion. As of August 2022, abortion is totally or near-totally banned in 17 states with more coming; in total, abortion is under serious threat in 26 of 50 states. States are also moving rapidly to impose travel bans and to criminalize “aiding” abortion. Some have already started the prosecution of those who have sought abortion. 
The political and grassroots resistance to this overturning, both in the US and globally, has been significant, with massive protests taking place and with activists mobilizing both online and offline. The implications of the ruling in the US could affect countries in the region and the world, with other countries taking being influenced by the US to regress on abortion rights, or to justify their already-repressive policies. 
CONTINUE THE RESISTANCE 
SUPPORT WOMEN’S RIGHTS ACTIVIST SALMA AL-SHEHAB 
Protests have always been a powerful tool for change. But governments around the world are cracking down on all forms of protests and those who engage in them. On 9 August, the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, sentenced Salma al-Shehab, a Saudi activist and student to 34 years in prison with a consecutive 34-year travel ban. She was accused, among other things, to “disturbing public order” simply for using Twitter and retweeting activists who support women’s rights. In addition to a grossly unfair trial, she was detained in solitary confinement for 285 days before she was brought to court. She was also denied access to legal representation throughout her pre-trial detention, including during interrogations. The Saudi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Salma al-Shehab and quash her conviction. Digital spaces like social media are increasingly becoming more accessible and necessary platforms for protestors to engage in their activism and political discourse, and for civil society to further their messages. The crackdown on those with visible profiles and notable activity are targeted, and this has become a newer form of violence and suppression of rights. A prevailing fear of reprisals deters people from speaking out about these cases on social media or with the media.

“The abusive and humiliating process known as ‘filtration’ is a shocking violation of international human rights and humanitarian law. Our research shows that many displaced Ukrainians end up inside Russia or Russia-occupied territories involuntarily, even if they are not physically forced to move. Deportation and forcible transfer of civilians in occupied territory are prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity.  Putting these forcibly displaced civilians through the abuses of ‘filtration’ is both cynical and cruel. 
Deportation and forcible transfer of civilians in occupied territory are prohibited by international humanitarian law and can constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity 
“We are also concerned for vulnerable groups, including unaccompanied, separated, or orphaned children, older people, and people with disabilities, some of whom were prevented from fleeing towards Ukrainian-controlled territory by Russian soldiers. Many found themselves unable to leave Russia or Russian-occupied areas once transferred to such locations.” 
“The Russian authorities must urgently allow the international community to access and monitor temporary placement shelters for Ukrainian civilians and evacuation procedures for civilians trapped in the conflict. They must also immediately ensure that Ukrainian civilians are able to safely leave warzones and enter Ukrainian-controlled territories. Those in Russia must be able to access resources that enable them to leave the country for Ukraine or a third country.” 
Background 
Amnesty International has documented several cases of Russian soldiers abusing detained Ukrainian civilians going through the ‘filtration’ procedures while exiting the warzone or crossing the border into or out of Russia. 
Some unaccompanied, separated, and orphaned children, as well as civilians from Mariupol-based institutions that care for older people and people with disabilities, were forcibly transferred to Donetsk. Some of the children and civilians were in the process of being evacuated to Ukrainian-controlled areas at the time. 
Older people in particular are at a greater risk of getting trapped in Russian-controlled areas or in Russia, due to a lack of information, funds and mobility issues. 
There appear to be no systems in place to facilitate the return of older people or people with disabilities from Russia or Russian-occupied territories to territories controlled by the government of Ukraine.

In October 2021, without evidence, Israeli Defense Ministry issued a military order declaring six groups as “terrorist” organizations: Addameer, al-Haq, Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, Bisan Center for Research and Development, and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees. A few months earlier, a seventh organization — the Health Work Committees – was targeted separately as an “illegitimate” entity. 
The designation effectively outlawed the organizations from operating and allowed Israeli authorities to close their offices, seize their assets and arrest or jail their staff members. It also prohibited publicly expressing support for their activities or funding the organizations. This designation was widely condemned, including by Amnesty and other international NGOs, European and other third-party governmental offices and representatives, and UN experts.  
Ongoing attacks on the organizations culminated in mid-August 2022 when Israeli armed forces raided their offices in Ramallah, and confiscated files and equipment. They also issued military orders to close them down and welded shut their office doors. 
One of the seven organizations, the Health Work Committees, has decided lowered its public profile, while the other six have chosen to raise their profile and appeal for international solidarity and protection. Amnesty International is responding to this appeal. 
The occupying army has failed to silence our voice in defence of human rights. The army uses military law against human rights law. The raids show that Israel rejects the position of the EU and the international community, and rather invests in continuing the occupation and the human rights violations that it causes.

French-Palestinian human rights defender Salah Hammouri, who works with the prisoner support and human rights organization Addameer, has been repeatedly harassed and detained for his human rights work. 
Salah Hammouri has been held since March on a series of three-month administrative detention orders, the latest of which was renewed in early September. Under administrative detention in Israel, individuals are detained by state authorities without the intent to prosecute them in a criminal trial. Orders can be renewed indefinitely, and evidence is kept secret, meaning that detainees are not able to effectively challenge their detention and do not know when they will be released. 
Salah Hammouri should be immediately released, or promptly charged with an internationally recognizable offence. He should be allowed to keep his residency status in Jerusalem and continue his human rights work without fear of reprisals.

After four years of research in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and building on decades of human rights advocacy in the region, Amnesty International launched a new report, Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians, on February 1st, 2022. The report sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law.  
The government of Israel has an obligation under international law to dismantle this system of apartheid, and to repeal or amend all laws, regulations, policies, and practices that discriminate on racial, ethnic, or religious grounds to bring them into line with international human rights law and standards.  
Amnesty’s human rights concerns have always been directed at the policies, laws, and actions of the government of Israel, not the Jewish people. It is crucial not to conflate legitimate criticism of crimes under international law committed by the government of Israel with antisemitism. To do so is inaccurate and dangerous.

Governments around the world are buying and allowing the sale of sophisticated and intrusive surveillance technology that can compromise anybody’s digital devices and monitor their activity. They claim these surveillance tools are only used to target “criminals and terrorists”, but human rights defenders, journalists and many others have been unlawfully targeted with spyware. 
Before the Palestinian organizations described above were designated either “terrorist” or “Illegitimate”, six Palestinian human rights defenders in these organizations – including Salah Hammouri — had their phones monitored using Pegasus, a form of spyware developed by Israeli cyber-surveillance company NSO Group.

This article was originally published in El Pais  
El Salvador’s gangs have inflicted nothing but misery on the population. For 30 years, people have lived in fear of being extorted, kidnapped, raped, or murdered by members of MS-13 or Barrio 18 – rival groups that were founded in Los Angeles and later exported to El Salvador through mass deportations. 
It is no surprise then that President Nayib Bukele’s “war on gangs” has proven so popular. The authorities have imprisoned over 50,000 alleged gang members since declaring a state of emergency in response to a spate of gang-related killings in late March and the murder rate has dropped dramatically – although official figures exclude those killed by security forces and Reuters recently uncovered discrepancies over the number of bodies recovered from mass graves. 
But public security should not come at the expense of massive human rights violations. As Amnesty International has documented, the authorities have dismantled judicial independence and committed torture and thousands of arbitrary detentions and violations of due process. Meanwhile, at least 73 detainees have died in state custody. 
With over 1% of its population behind bars – some just for looking “suspicious” or “nervous” – El Salvador has surpassed the United States to claim the world’s highest incarceration rate. This is not the answer to a complex problem with deep-rooted socioeconomic causes. 
Nor is President Bukele’s security strategy as innovative or sustainable as he would have people believe. The state of emergency, recently extended for a sixth month, bears close resemblance to the “iron fist” crackdowns of past governments in 2003 and 2004, which brought an initial drop in homicides followed by a sharp spike from 2004 to 2006. 
One significant difference is that while judges swiftly released many people who were wrongly detained during past operations, the current government has seized control of the judiciary, enabling it to carry out its strategy of arbitrary arrests and mass illegal incarceration unencumbered by checks or balances. 
Instead of eviscerating human rights and judicial independence, the authorities should address the longstanding inequalities that leave children from El Salvador’s most marginalized communities vulnerable to gang recruitment. 
The only way to protect the population and deliver justice for the gangs’ victims is to guarantee robust investigations, due process, and fair trials, while simultaneously tackling the root causes of violent crime and facilitating rehabilitation and social reintegration. President Bukele must change course … 
As José Miguel Rodríguez, a former MS-13 member, told me: “repression doesn’t change a gang member”. He believes young people from poor neighborhoods would be much less likely to join gangs if they had genuine educational and employment opportunities. Similarly, older gang members would be more inclined to retire if it were not almost impossible for them to find dignified employment or avoid constant police harassment. 
Attempts to address El Salvador’s gang problem through rehabilitation and social reintegration have mostly been limited to the modest efforts of a handful of evangelical churches, but even these have become untenable under the current crackdown. One pastor, who requested his name be withheld for fear of reprisal, told me the state of emergency has undone years of work, with the authorities arresting all the former gang members who were undergoing rehabilitation at his church, along with many others who had previously done so and successfully reintegrated into society. 
In another case, the wife of a former MS-13 member from Honduras told Amnesty International that he left the gang in 2018 upon completing a prison sentence for robbery in California. Deported to his homeland that year, he moved to El Salvador where he worked in call centers to support her and their children. On 30 March police raided their home in search of drugs or guns. They found neither but arrested the man upon confirming he had gang tattoos. 
His wife shared police and employment records with Amnesty International confirming there were no prior or current charges against him in El Salvador as of July 2021 and proving he had worked in call centers from 2019 to 2022. Despite him showing the police these documents, she says he was placed in pretrial detention for alleged membership of an illegal group, alongside hundreds of other defendants in one of the opaque mass hearings that have become the norm in recent weeks. 
President Bukele, who jokingly calls himself “the world’s coolest dictator”, has sought to shape public perception of his policies by limiting access to information and stigmatizing critical journalists, forcing some into exile. He has repeatedly attacked Juan Martínez, a journalist and anthropologist who specializes in covering the gangs, calling him “trash” on Twitter in April and prompting an avalanche of threats and attacks from his zealous social media followers and a swathe of senior government officials. 
Martínez, who was forced to leave El Salvador, told me the authorities are trying to discredit all those who pose a threat to the government’s carefully crafted narratives. This includes his brothers Óscar and Carlos, who recently published shocking evidence in the digital outlet El Faro that the collapse of a secret government pact with MS-13 was behind the outbreak of violence in March and the subsequent “war on gangs”. 
Many journalists have had Pegasus spyware used against them and the government recently passed a vaguely worded law permitting 15-year prison sentences for those who “reproduce or transmit messages or statements originating or presumably originating” from gangs, if those messages “could generate anxiety and panic”. 
Another local journalist who works the gang beat told me he noticed men photographing him, following his car and surveilling his home last year – something he had never experienced under previous governments. He fears being criminalized under the new gag law and worries the president’s verbal onslaughts could encourage physical violence against journalists. He too has considered leaving the country but does not want to uproot or abandon his family. 
El Salvador must not continue down this pathway of contempt for human rights. 
The only way to protect the population and deliver justice for the gangs’ victims is to guarantee robust investigations, due process, and fair trials, while simultaneously tackling the root causes of violent crime and facilitating rehabilitation and social reintegration. 
President Bukele must change course immediately.

“By occupying the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Russian forces are not only endangering those in the plant and its surroundings, but also heightening the risk of a nuclear catastrophe across the region. 
“By placing its forces on the territory of the plant and in its immediate vicinity, Russia bears primary responsibility for the potentially devastating consequences of a nuclear accident. Amnesty International calls for full demilitarization of the power plant and its immediate surroundings. 
“On top of the obvious dangers of militarizing the power plant, a local resident told Amnesty that Ukrainians, including staff who Russian forces suspect of documenting their activities near the plant, have reportedly been subjected to brutal reprisals. Some were abducted and tortured in the basement of the building previously used by the Security Service of Ukraine.” 
In August, Amnesty was also informed by a local resident and a member of ZNPP staff that Russian military personnel at the plant were restricting the movement of staff and also subjecting them to intrusive personal searches. Amnesty International was not able to verify these worrying allegations from other sources. However, the IAEA findings confirm the presence of Russian troops on the plant and restrictions of staff movement. 
IAEA has also reported physical damage to the ZNPP’s facilities resulting from the military activities in the vicinity, including shelling. Amnesty International’s local sources said that the damage was the result of Russian forces firing mortars from occupied Ukrainian territory, allegedly to blame the Ukrainian forces. Amnesty has been unable to verify these claims but is concerned to hear that IAEA confirms the damage resulting from shelling, including on dates specifically described by our local sources. 
IAEA stopped short of naming either side as responsible for the shelling and has demanded that both sides cease all such military activity.

The IAEA reported its team observed “the presence of Russian military personnel, vehicles and equipment at various places at the ZNPP, including several military trucks on the ground floor of the Unit 1 and Unit 2 turbine halls and military vehicles stationed under the overpass connecting the reactor units”. It called for “the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone”.

After his arrest (aged 13) in 2015, he was subjected to ill-treatment and denied the right to a fair trial. He suffers from severe mental health conditions which developed during his detention and worsened in prolonged solitary confinement, which amounts to torture. Court hearings in summer 2022 rejected his appeals to be removed from solitary confinement and be out on parole. His ongoing detention will lead to “irreparable damage” according to independent psychiatrists.  
Evidence from Ahmad Manasra’s interrogation after his arrest in 2015 (aged 13 at the time, below the minimum age of criminal responsibility recommended by international law) shows he was subjected to ill-treatment and interrogated without his lawyer or parent’s presence, in violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and international fair trial standards.  
Ahmad Manasra suffers from serious mental health conditions. On 24 October 2021, he was diagnosed by an independent Israeli clinical psychologist with serious psychiatric conditions – schizophrenia, psychosis, and severe depression – that he developed since his detention. Approximately ten days after that diagnosis, the Israel Prison Service placed him in solitary confinement, which continues until today. Psychiatrists said that his incarceration, and especially his solitary confinement since early November 2021, continues to put his health in acute danger. Nevertheless, on 17 April 2022, the Israel Prison Service renewed his solitary confinement for a further six months, until 16 October 2022. On 13 June 2022, the prison doctor rushed Ahmad Manasra to the prison hospital following life-threatening deterioration in his mental health. He was discharged from prison hospital on 19 July 2022 and put straight back in solitary confinement. His solitary confinement for more than 15 days is a violation of the absolute prohibition on torture.  
Ahmad Manasra has now served almost seven years of his 12-year sentence, which qualifies him to be considered for release on parole according to Israeli law. Court hearings in summer 2022 rejected his appeals to be removed from solitary confinement and to be eligible for release on parole. On 1 September 2022, the District Court in Beersheba heard Ahmad Manasra’s latest appeal for early release, on the grounds of medical necessity. This appeal too was rejected.

Solitary confinement of more than 15 days amounts to a violation of the absolute prohibition on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Ahmad Manasra’s mental ill-health aggravated by his treatment in detention is a pressing human rights concern and a medical emergency, and yet the Israel Prison Service persists in keeping him in solitary confinement. Ahmad Manasra was diagnosed by an independent Israeli clinical psychologist affiliated with ‘Physicians for Human Rights – Israel’ (PHRI) on 24 October 2021 with serious psychiatric conditions – schizophrenia, psychosis, and severe depression – that he developed since his incarceration. Approximately ten days after that diagnosis, the Israel Prison Service placed him in solitary confinement, which continues until today. On 13 April 2022, PHRI published their psychiatrists’ assessment that Ahmad’s continued imprisonment would lead to “irreparable damage”. Nevertheless, the Israel Prison Service renewed Ahmad Manasra’s solitary confinement for a further six months on 17 April 2022. On 13 June 2022, the prison doctor rushed Ahmad Manasra to the prison hospital following life-threatening deterioration in his mental health. He was discharged from prison hospital on 19 July 2022 and put straight back in solitary confinement.  
Ahmad Manasra was 13 years old when he was arrested in 2015 in relation to the stabbing and injury of two people in Pisgat Zeev, which is below the minimum age of criminal responsibility recommended by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (General Comment No. 24). At the time, Israel’s Youth Law did not allow imprisonment under the age of 14, and the court proceedings were delayed until he had reached 14 years of age. A month after Ahmad Manasra’s arrest in November 2015, footage of his interrogation was made public. The 10-minute video, reviewed by Amnesty International, shows him being interrogated by three men, without the presence of his lawyer or parent, in violation of international standards. He appears increasingly distressed as his interrogators continue to shout at him, directing insults and threats. This video is evidence of several violations of Ahmad Manasra’s rights as a child and as a detainee. To Amnesty International’s knowledge, there have been no investigations into the conduct of police and security officers. Despite being found by the courts not to have participated in the stabbings, he was convicted of attempted murder in 2016 and sentenced to 12 years in prison, which the Supreme Court reduced to nine and a half years in August 2017.  
The treatment of Ahmad Manasra fits a wider pattern of discrimination against Palestinian children in the criminal justice system. According to Amnesty International’s records, some 170 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel as of June 2022 were arrested when they were children, and twelve children are held as administrative detainees. In many of the cases, children were denied fair trials in line with international standards and furthermore were discriminated against on racial grounds as Palestinians. Evidence collected by Amnesty International, and by human rights organizations B’Tselem, HaMoked and Defence for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), shows Israeli authorities implement the law in a discriminatory manner by denying Palestinian children in East Jerusalem basic rights to a fair trial and to be protected from torture and other ill-treatment. This denial of fair trial rights to Palestinian children and their associated ill-treatment contributes to and forms part of the cruel system of oppression and domination (or apartheid) perpetrated by Israel against all Palestinians. A report released by DCIP in April 2016 found three out of four Palestinian children endured some form of physical violence following arrest, and 97 per cent of children had no parent present during interrogation, or access to legal counsel.

“The harsh sentences meted out to human rights defender Marfa Rabkova and her co-defendants are as shameful as the arrests and countless reports of torture and other ill-treatment of protesters that preceded today’s judgement. This trial, which brought charges for fictitious ‘mass riots’, was nothing more than a mockery of justice representative of the broader crushing of Belarussian civil society. 
The harsh sentences meted out to human rights defender Marfa Rabkova and her co-defendants are as shameful as the arrests and countless reports of torture and other ill-treatment of protesters that preceded today’s judgement 
“There were no mass riots in Belarus. Marfa Rabkova and Andrei Chapyuk should never have been charged in the first place, nor any of their co-defendants. The Belarusian authorities must urgently end their campaign of repression against civil society activists. All others who have already been thrown behind bars simply for peacefully exercising their human rights must also be released immediately and unconditionally.” 
Background 
On 6 September, the Minsk City Court sentenced Rabkova, a coordinator of the volunteer service of the Human Rights Center Viasna, a banned human rights organization in Belarus, to 15 years in prison, while Chapyuk, a volunteer for Viasna in Minsk, was handed a 6-year sentence. 
Rabkova and Chapyuk were arbitrarily detained on 17 September and 2 October 2020, respectively, for documenting human rights violations that occurred following the August 2020 disputed presidential election. After the vote, thousands of overwhelmingly peaceful protesters took to the streets but the authorities labelled the demonstrations as “mass riots” in their efforts to crush all forms of dissent. 
Marfa Rabkova was found guilty of “organizing, participating in and training others to participate in mass riots”, “inciting social hostility towards the government” and “involvement in a criminal organization”, among other charges. Andrei Chapyuk was found guilty of “participating in mass riots” and “involvement in a criminal organization”. 
Their co-defendants, Akihiro Haeuski-Hanada, Alyaksandr Frantskevich, Alyaksei Galauko, Alyaksandr Kazlyanka, Pavel Shpetny, Mikita Dranets, Andrei Marach and Daniil Chul, were dealt between five and 17 years in prison.

Police blinded the psychology student when they shot at people participating in massive, inspiring demonstrations that continued for months, demanding an end to increasing inequality in the South American country. Our messages ensured that this crime could not be swept under the carpet. Chilean authorities were put on notice that the eyes of the world were watching and that everyone has the right to protest injustice without fear of harm from state security forces. 
Since then, Amnesty published a rigorous report entitled Eyes on Chile: Police Violence and Chain of Command Responsibility During the Period of Social Unrest. It concludes that Chilean police perpetrated widespread human rights violations against people exercising their right to peaceful protest, and that commanders failed to stop the violent repression, which resulted in thousands of injuries and dozens killed. Our report also concludes that the actions and omissions of the General Director of the police at the time of the events, and the current General Director of the police, who was Director for Order and Security at the time, should be investigated. 
This fall, due to the appointment of a new, highly respected prosecutor, there is a possibility for advances towards previously unthinkable accountability for the police and their commanders. This is incredibly important! It would provide justice for Gustavo. It would also create a precedent that will protect the right to protest in Chile. That’s why we are asking you to take action once again. 
Note: this action can take place right away. Or you could time it around the following important dates: October 18 – the third anniversary of the start of the protests that were brutally repressed AND November 8 – the date that Gustavo Gatica was shot by police.  
Your letter should be short, respectful, personalized (feel free to add comments to the main points below), and help increase pressure for investigations into command responsibility.

Gustavo Gatica is a recently graduated psychology student in Santiago, Chile. On 8 November 2019, he attended a protest in the context of mass demonstrations across the country over rising inequality. These protests made the headlines the world over as an inspiring and unexpected upsurge of people power, the so called ‘estallido social’. 
Police violently repressed the protest that Gustavo attended, as well as many others over the following months, indiscriminately opening fire on demonstrators with riot shotguns. Shotguns were loaded with rubberized buckshot, in violation of international standards for the use of force. Gustavo was struck with this buckshot in both eyes and was left permanently blind. Thousands of others were injured. Dozens were killed. 
Following Gustavo’s shooting, Chilean police opened an internal investigation into the events but concluded that no-one in the institution could be held responsible in the case. The investigation went so far as to suggest Gustavo could have been injured by the demonstrators themselves! 
At the beginning of 2022, the Chilean Attorney General’s Office appointed a new prosecutor to lead three ongoing investigations involving command responsibility in the context of the 2019 protests: one into crimes against humanity and two related to command responsibility for widespread torture and serious injuries. She is a well-respected prosecutor, also in charge of Gustavo Gatica’s case, and who already investigated G-3, mid-ranking commander likely involved in the attack on Gustavo. 
This prosecutor considers that our report, Eyes on Chile, supports her own findings of widespread and systematic harm caused mainly by shotguns and buckshot, due to the deliberate omissions of Police commanders. Gustavo’s case is extremely strategic to ensuring lawsuits on command responsibility move forward, as the use of highly damaging ammunition is key to proving criminal responsibility of those commanders in charge of police operations. 
The Attorney General’s Office is currently investigating command responsibility for these events and could be formally charging commanders and high-ranking officials in September 2022, in what would be a historic step towards justice and accountability for police violence. 
This is why it is an important moment to raise our voices again and call on prosecutors to ensure justice for Gustavo and thousands of other victims of violations to their physical integrity. This requires identifying and prosecuting the direct perpetrators of the attacks, as well as the senior officials whose responsibility was to control the forces under their command and prevent human rights violations from occurring. 
Thank you for your activism! Together we can achieve change!

He was sentenced to death in December 2004 for killing his nine-month-old daughter in December 2002. He has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and brain damage. Throughout the years his lawyers have described an individual who has been unable to assist them in his case, both at trial and during appeals. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board is due to hold a clemency hearing and vote on the case on 27 September 2022. We urge the members of the Board to recommend to Governor Kevin Stitt that he commute Benjamin Cole’s death sentence.  
Lawyers representing Benjamin Cole have long had serious doubts about his mental competence – to stand trial, to assist in his appeals, and in recent years for execution – arising from a long-standing psychosocial (mental) disability. Since the outset of this case, they have described a client who has been unable to communicate in a rational and coherent manner with them.   
In 2008, Benjamin Cole was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and over the years on death row his condition is reported to have deteriorated and to have remained untreated. Additionally, according to a physician who is also a neuroradiologist, a lesion on his brain, first spotted in a scan in 2004 could be exacerbating his mental disability and explain his deteriorating motor functions, possible Parkinsonism, and need for a wheelchair.

Benjamin Cole was charged with the first-degree murder of his nine-month-old daughter, who died on 20 December 2002, with the official cause of death recorded as fracture of the spine with aortic laceration. In a videotaped statement to the police, Benjamin Cole said he had been trying to get the child, who was lying on her stomach, to stop crying. He had pushed her forcefully by the ankles, causing her to flip over on to her back. This action resulted in the fatal injuries. The prosecution offered Benjamin Cole a plea deal to avoid the death penalty – if he pled guilty, he would receive a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. He rejected the deal, and the case went to trial in late 2004. He was convicted as charged and sentenced to death.   
Lawyers representing Benjamin Cole have described a client unable to engage in rational and coherent communication with them. For example, in 2003, his trial lawyers questioned his “ability to understand the nature of the charges against him and meaningfully assist his attorneys”, and in 2004, they reported that his “responses to questions pertaining to his defense are unrelated and unresponsive to what was asked and appear to be based on unrealistic and irrational thoughts and ideas.” He was twice found competent to stand trial.   
In 2008, Benjamin Cole’s appeal lawyers retained a psychiatrist to reassess their client’s mental status. The psychiatrist concluded that Benjamin Cole was incompetent to assist his appeal attorneys and that this was “not based on rational thought” but stemmed from “schizophrenia, paranoid type”, manifesting in “hyper-religiosity” and “persecutory and grandiose delusions”. The psychiatrist opined that this mental disability existed “long before” the crime (and may have contributed to it). He pointed to the possibility of post-traumatic stress disorder, and to a family history of mental disability and a childhood of substance abuse, incest, and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. Because his report was not part of appeals in state court, the federal courts have not taken it into account under the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act which limits federal review of state court decisions.   
Benjamin Cole received an execution date in 2015 (eventually stayed under lethal injection litigation). In this context, a psychologist retained by the defence concluded that Benjamin Cole “presents as a classic example of a severely regressed chronic schizophrenic patient (with catatonic features), whose condition is likely further compromised by the previously detected brain disorder captured by neuroimaging studies.” The psychologist described the mental disability in this case as “chronic”, “persistent” and “severe”. He further noted that the effect of the “brain lesion located in the deep white matter of the frontal-parietal region of the left hemisphere of his brain that was discovered by neuroimaging studies in September 2004”, but not followed up, was unknown. The psychologist concluded in 2016 that Benjamin Cole was not competent to be executed. In April 2022, he accompanied Benjamin Cole’s lawyers to death row and reported that he did not observe any behaviour on the part of Benjamin Cole that he would consider “rational or coherent”, and that his “current clinical presentation is consistent with his diagnosis of severe and chronic schizophrenia with catatonia, as well as MRI-documented organic brain damage”.   
In 2022, a physician qualified in neuroradiology conducted a review of the 2004 MRI scan and concluded that it revealed “markedly abnormal” detail and “demonstrates multiple pathologic findings”. He concluded that the location of the brain lesion “may be exacerbating” Benjamin Cole’s schizophrenia, and that his need for and use of a wheelchair may relate to this brain damage and possible Parkinsonism.  
Executing someone who lacks a rational understanding of their punishment violates the US Constitution. International human rights law prohibits the use of the death penalty against people with psychosocial (mental) and intellectual disabilities. The UN Human Rights Committee, established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to oversee its implementation, has said that “States parties must refrain from imposing the death penalty on individuals who face special barriers in defending themselves on an equal basis with others, such as persons whose serious psychosocial or intellectual disabilities impede their effective defence, and on persons who have limited moral culpability. They should also refrain from executing persons who have a diminished ability to understand the reasons for their sentence”. The USA ratified the ICCPR in 1992. The treaty body for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has similarly clarified that the CRPD prohibits the imposition of the death penalty on people whose mental and intellectual disabilities have impeded their effective defence. The USA has not ratified the CRPD, but in signing it in 2009 bound itself under international law not to do anything that would undermine its object or purpose.  
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases, unconditionally. There have been 10 executions in the USA in 2022, three in Oklahoma. Oklahoma accounts for 117 of the 1,550 executions carried out in the USA since the US Supreme Court approved new capital statutes in 1976, second only to neighbouring Texas. Combined, Texas and Oklahoma account for 10% of the USA’s population and 45% of its executions since 1976.

The result of the vote means that the Constitution originally enacted under the government of Augusto Pinochet, which for decades has worked to the benefit of some and not others, exacerbating inequalities and precariousness, will continue to remain in place in the country. Although the public did not approve the proposal drafted by the Constitutional Convention, it has been proved on countless occasions that the Constitution hinders the changes necessary to achieve a more just Chile and it is therefore essential to continue the efforts to change it. 
“We regret that the result of the referendum resulted in the rejection of a new Constitution, which had the opportunity to improve the living conditions of all people in Chile and move towards greater levels of justice. However, we celebrate the efforts that have been made to build a more just and free country, and we trust that this process will continue until Chile has a constitutional framework that meets the needs of all people in the country. We will never stop fighting until this dream becomes a reality,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“Social movements and citizens have raised their voices to demand better living conditions, but it is difficult to see how the root causes of this situation can be addressed while an inherently unjust Constitution that originated in a painful period in Chile’s history remains in place. This is why almost 80% of the population voted in favour of having a new Constitution in 2020,” said Rodrigo Bustos, executive director of Amnesty International Chile. 
Keeping the 1980 Constitution means that addressing the abuses and situations of vulnerability experienced by a large part of Chilean society, which would have found effective answers in the new Constitution and the regulations flowing from it, is no longer a possibility in the short to medium term. 
“From today we must focus special attention on the future of the country and continue pushing for new spaces that will allow us to move forward and build a state capable of embracing and protecting all its people. That is why we will continue working to make progress in changing the text of the Chilean Constitution, and we call on all those who promoted the choice to reject to continue to commit to the constitutional process, to live up to this commitment and ensure that the new text maintains all the advances in human rights that the rejected Constitution contained,” said Rodrigo Bustos.

Indigenous rights defender Bruno Pereira and environmental journalist Dom Phillips were murdered in June during a fact-finding trip to a region of the Brazilian Amazon where Indigenous peoples’ lands and rights are under vicious attack. As Amnesty Brazil’s Jurema Werneck observes: “Brazil is one of the world’s most lethal countries for human rights defenders and environmentalists, and this reality is the consequence of state policy that promotes attacks.” 
RAISE YOUR VOICE FOR MUCH NEEDED ACTION 
Ecuador signed the landmark Escazú Agreement that enshrines the right to a healthy environment, access to environmental justice and protection of environmental human rights defenders. Yet Patricia Gualinga (above, who spoke out our Earth Day webinar in April), and other women defenders of the Mujeres Amazónicas coalition, have yet to see authorities deliver on their commitments under the agreement. They have failed to provide effective protection. Nor have they brought to justice those who threatened and attacked the women as they sought to stop harms from resource extraction. 
TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ENVIRONMENT DEFENDERS 
Attacks on defenders of rivers, forests and Indigenous territory in Honduras skyrocketed following a coup in 2009, which cleared the way for the perpetrators of such crimes to escape justice. That’s why our campaign in collaboration with the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) is so important. It’s a campaign to press for the truth and justice in the iconic case of beloved COPINH coordinator Berta Cáceres, murdered in 2016 to silence her leadership of efforts by Lenca Indigenous communities to stop the damming of the Gualcarque River. 
In June, we hailed a victory when an executive of the company building the dam was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison as a co-author of the murder of Berta. But there is evidence that other powerful people were involved.

He has been arbitrarily detained since 14 February 2018 in Mazraet Tora Prison, Egypt, over unfounded charges in relation to media interviews and sentenced by an emergency court to 15 years imprisonment on 29 May 2022. The Egyptian authorities must grant his immediate and unconditional release.  
On 25 August 2021, two months before lifting the state of emergency, the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP) referred him to trial in front of an Emergency State Security Court (ESSC). On 29 May 2022, the Third Terrorism Circuit of the Cairo Criminal Court, acting as an emergency court, sentenced Abdelmoneim Aboulfotoh to 15 years in prison for “spreading false news” and “incitement against state institutions”.  
The Egyptian authorities have subjected Abdelmoneim Aboulfotoh to torture by holding him in prolonged solitary confinement for more than four years and deliberately denying him access to adequate healthcare, even though he has a serious and potentially life-threatening health condition. His family said that on 1 July, 6 July and 3 August 2022 the prison authorities transferred him to the poorly equipped prison medical center and provided him with first aid through a medicine that expands the arteries which is not a curative procedure. They refused to share the results of his medical condition with his family and his lawyers. They just informed Abdelmoneim Aboulfotoh orally that he suffered a heart attack. Most recently, his family received a letter from him in which he states that he had a fourth heart attack on 25 August 2022. His family said that he requires an emergency scan, ultrasound and catheterization of the arteries that are not available in the prison hospital. He is also in urgent need of prostate surgery as he was scheduled for this prior to his detention. Abdelmoneim Aboulfotoh’s family stated that he also suffers from episodes of apnea due to poor ventilation and conditions of detention, and he uses a device to regulate his breathing.  
Amnesty International considers Abdelmoniem Aboulfotoh’s prolonged solitary confinement for more than 22 hours a day in abusive conditions since his detention in February 2018, and the deliberate denial of health care, to be in contravention of Egyptian and international law and may amount to torture.

Abdelmoniem Aboulfotoh was a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood until he resigned to run for presidency in 2012. He was arrested in February 2018 after giving interviews that were sharply critical of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a month before al-Sisi was re-elected.  
Abdelmoniem Aboulfotoh suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and an enlarged prostate, according to medical records predating his detention. The prison administration has routinely delayed or denied his requests for medical assistance inside or outside the prison, and access to his private doctors inside the prison at his own cost. In 2021, the prison administration also refused to transfer him to an external hospital for prostate surgery despite medical advice by his private doctor and his relatives’ willingness to cover the costs.  
On 8 August 2022, his family submitted a complaint to the National Council for Human Rights, regarding the medical negligence he suffers in detention. They asked that he be given the necessary medical care to preserve his life. In it, they provided a detailed explanation of his health condition and latest developments, and the most urgent medical needs that are not available to him in prison, in order to determine the accurate diagnosis and the necessary course of treatment. They also required his transfer to an external hospital as soon as possible, at the expense of his family. On 9 August 2022, the family submitted a statement to the Public Prosecutor indicating the serious and potentially life-threatening health condition after his exposure to four heart attacks that occurred suddenly, accompanied by severe pain that lasts for longer periods, and without any physical effort before it. The statement mentions his impaired ability to make physical effort, which they surmise indicates a blockage in some of the arteries of the heart.  
According to credible sources, he has been detained in Mazraet Tora Prison in solitary confinement in a cell measuring 2m x 3m that is hot in summer and cold in winter and does not have a bed. Until mid-2021, the prison administration has limited his access to exercise to an alley inside the ward for no more than one hour a day. Then he is now allowed to exercise alone for one hour and a half outside of the ward.  
On 25 October 2021, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi announced that he would not extend the state of emergency, in force since 2017, which allowed for the creation of ESSCs. Article 19 of the law governing the state of emergency stipulates that ongoing trials are to continue even after the state of emergency is no longer in force. In the three months preceding the decision not to renew the state of emergency, the Egyptian authorities referred at least 26 human rights defenders, activists and opposition politicians to trial before emergency courts. Proceedings in front of ESSCs are inherently unfair. Defendants are denied the right to appeal their convictions and sentences to a higher tribunal. Only the president retains the power to authorize, quash or commute sentences or to order a retrial. Other documented fair trial violations include the right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence, right to communicate with counsel of their own choosing and right to a public hearing. In addition, judges at the ESSC routinely deny requests by lawyers to photocopy casefiles, which in some cases exceed 2,000 pages, instead instructing them to review them in court. Prosecutors and judges have also failed to provide copies of indictment orders to defendants and their lawyers, undermining their right to be informed of the exact nature and cause of the charges against them.  
On 29 May 2022, an ESSC sentenced 25 political opponents, including politician Mohamed al-Kassas to 10 years in prison, after convicting him of trumped-up terrorism-related charges and spreading false news. In recent months, dozens of political opponents and critics have been convicted of bogus charges following grossly unfair trials by ESSCs. Among them are politicians Zyad el-Elaimy who was sentenced in November 2021 to five years in prison, following an unfair trial by an ESSC simply for criticizing Egypt’s human rights record and economic policies. Security forces arrested him in June 2019, shortly after he discussed running in the 2020 elections and detained him without trial for over two years.

In a new report, They don’t treat us like humans, the organization also documents numerous instances – mostly at the Iranian border – where security forces have shot directly at people as they climbed over walls or crawled under fences. Afghans who do manage to enter Iran or Turkey are routinely arbitrarily detained, and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment before being unlawfully and forcibly returned.  
Amnesty International researchers visited Afghanistan in March 2022, and conducted interviews in Herat City and Islam Qala border town. They interviewed 74 Afghans who had been pushed back from Iran and Turkey, 48 of whom reported coming under fire as they attempted to cross the borders. None of the people Amnesty International spoke to had been able to register an asylum claim in either country, and the majority were returned to Afghanistan in violation of international law.  
One year after the end of airlift evacuations from Afghanistan, many of those left behind are risking their lives to leave the country. 
“One year after the end of airlift evacuations from Afghanistan, many of those left behind are risking their lives to leave the country – Afghans who have travelled to the Iranian and Turkish borders over the past year, in search of safety, have instead been forcibly returned under fire. We documented how Iranian security forces have unlawfully killed and injured dozens of Afghans since last August, including by firing repeatedly into packed cars. Turkish border guards have also unlawfully used live ammunition against Afghans, firing into the air to repel people, and also shooting at them in some cases,” said Marie Forestier, Researcher on Refugee and Migrants Rights at Amnesty International.  
“The dangers don’t end at the borders. Many Afghans we spoke to had spent time in arbitrary detention, either in Turkey or in Iran, where they were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment before being unlawfully returned. We are calling on Turkish and Iranian authorities to immediately end all pushbacks and deportations of Afghans, end torture and other ill-treatment, and ensure safe passage and access to asylum procedures for all Afghans seeking protection. Security forces must immediately end the unlawful use of firearms against Afghans at the borders, and perpetrators of human rights violations, including unlawful killing and torture, must be held accountable.”  
Amnesty International also calls on the international community to provide financial and material support to countries which host large numbers of Afghans, including Iran and Turkey. They must ensure that this funding does not contribute to human rights violations – this is critical, as the European Union has already provided funds for Turkey’s new border wall, as well as for the construction of several ‘removal centres’ where Amnesty International documented Afghans being detained. Other countries must also increase resettlement opportunities for Afghans who need international protection.  
Hundreds of thousands of Afghans have fled their country since the Taliban took power in August 2021. Afghanistan’s neighbouring countries have closed their borders to Afghans without travel documents, leaving many people with no choice but to travel irregularly. This means entering Iran through informal border crossings – such as through crawling under a fence near an official crossing in Afghanistan’s Herat Province, or climbing over a two-metre-high wall in Nimroz province.   
My nephew arrived at the wall of the border, climbed it and he raised his head up over the top. [Iranian forces] shot him in the head. 
Those who are not immediately detained by Iranian border guards then travel on to various cities in Iran, or to the Turkish border nearly 2000 km away in north-western Iran. At both the Afghan-Iranian and Turkish-Iranian borders, Afghans are subjected to violent and unlawful pushbacks – from Iran back into Afghanistan, or from Turkey into Iran.   
Amnesty International researchers travelled to Afghanistan and Turkey in March and May 2022. They interviewed doctors, NGO workers and Afghan officials, as well as 74 Afghans who had attempted to cross into Turkey or Iran. Some people had made multiple attempts, and some had travelled in groups; based on their accounts, Amnesty International documented a total of 255 instances of unlawful return between March 2021 and May 2022.   
Amnesty International interviewed the relatives of six men and a 16-year-old boy who were killed by Iranian security forces as they attempted to cross into Iran between April 2021 and January 2022. 
In total, the organization documented 11 killings by Iranian security forces, though the true death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The lack of comprehensive reporting procedures means there are few publicly available statistics, but humanitarian workers and Afghan doctors told the organization they recorded at least 59 deaths and 31 injuries between August and December 2021 alone.    
I saw that my son was dead. I was next to his body in a taxi. 
Ghulam* described how his 19-year-old nephew was shot and killed in August 2021:  
“He arrived at the wall of the border, climbed it and he raised his head up over the top. They shot him in the head, in the left temple. He fell to the ground on the [Afghan] side of the border.”  
Some of the documented shootings took place inside Iranian territory. Sakeena, 35, told Amnesty International how her 16-year-old son was shot dead as they walked away from the Iranian border:   
“I heard my son screaming for me. He had been hit by two bullets in his ribs. I don’t know what happened after I fainted […] When I gained consciousness, I was in Afghanistan. I saw that my son was dead. I was next to his body in a taxi.”   
Amnesty International interviewed 35 people who had attempted to cross into Turkey, 23 of whom reported coming under fire. Researchers interviewed one Afghan man who said he had witnessed the killings of three teenage boys by Turkish security forces. Other witnesses described the injury of six men and three boys by Turkish security forces, and Amnesty International interviewed two men who had sustained gunshot wounds at the Turkish border.   
A two-year-old child was shot in the kidney, and a six-year-old child was shot on his hand. I was very scared. 
Aref, a former Afghan intelligence officer who fled after receiving death threats from the Taliban, said he witnessed young children being injured by Turkish security forces:  
“They shot directly at us, not in the air (…) I witnessed a woman and two children who were injured. A two-year-old child was shot in the kidney, and a six-year-old child was shot on his hand. I was very scared.”  
None of those killed or injured appear to have represented any imminent threat to security forces or others – let alone a threat of death or serious injury -meaning the use of firearms would have been unlawful and arbitrary. In some cases, Iranian security forces appear to have used firearms in a manner that demonstrated an intention to kill, for example by shooting directly at individuals from close range.  
“Any killings resulting from deliberate and unlawful use of firearms by agents of the state must be investigated as potential extrajudicial executions,” said Marie Forestier.  
A crisis of systemic impunity for widespread patterns of torture, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings prevails in Iran. Amnesty International therefore reiterates its call on the UN Human Rights Council to establish an independent investigative and accountability mechanism to collect and analyze evidence of the most serious crimes under international law committed in Iran, including against Afghans in the context of pushbacks, to enable future prosecutions.  
Almost all interviewees who were intercepted once inside Iran or Turkey, and not immediately pushed back, were arbitrarily detained. Detention time ranged from one or two days to two-and-a-half months. Twenty-three people described treatment that would amount to torture or other ill-treatment while in detention in Iran, as did 21 people detained in Turkey.   
The policeman sat on my friend, as if he was sitting on a chair. He sat there and lit a cigarette. 
Hamid described how Turkish security forces beat him and his friend in detention:   
“One of the policemen beat my friend with the butt of his gun, and then the policeman sat on my friend, as if he was sitting on a chair. He sat there and lit a cigarette. Then he hit me on my legs with his gun as well.”  
Several people Amnesty International interviewed were detained in Iran after sustaining gunshot wounds.   
Amir was injured when a bullet fired by Turkish security forces grazed his head. After being pushed back to Iran, Amir was detained by Iranian security forces who beat him on his head:  
“They would beat me directly on the wound, and it would start bleeding again… One time I said, ‘please don’t beat me on my head,’ and the guard [at the detention facility] said, ‘Where?’ When I showed him, then he beat me in that same spot,” Amir said.  
If the EU continues funding detention centres where Afghans are held before being unlawfully returned, it risks being complicit in these violations.  
Eleven Afghans unlawfully returned by Turkish authorities had been detained in one of the six removal centres in Turkey whose construction the EU has partially funded.  
“The European Commission must ensure that migration and asylum related funding to Turkey does not contribute to human rights violations. If the EU continues funding detention centres where Afghans are held before being unlawfully returned, it risks being complicit in these appalling violations,” said Marie Forestier.   
None of the Afghans interviewed by Amnesty International was able to register a claim for international protection, either in Iran or in Turkey. Interviewees said they attempted to tell authorities they would be at serious risk of human rights violations if returned to Afghanistan, but their fears were dismissed.  
Iranian security forces transferred detainees by bus to the Afghan border, while Turkish security forces usually transferred them back to Iran at irregular crossings. Ten of those deported from Turkey were sent straight back to Afghanistan by plane. Turkey resumed charter flights to Afghanistan in late January 2022. At the end of April, the Turkish migration authority announced on its websites that charter flights had already returned 6805 Afghan citizens.   
They beat me, pushed me to the wall. Two men held my legs and one was sitting on my chest. Two others [made me sign] the paper.  
All interviewees who had been returned said that Turkish and Iranian authorities coerced them to leave. Amnesty International heard how detainees sobbed and fainted when they heard they were being returned to Afghanistan, and how a man attempted to take his own life by jumping out of a window.  
Eight people detained and then deported on charter flights from Turkey said Turkish authorities pressured them to sign documents stating they were leaving voluntarily. One man said:   
“I told [security forces] that I was at risk in Afghanistan. They didn’t care. They beat me, pushed me to the wall. I fell down on the ground. Two men held my legs and one was sitting on my chest. Two others put my fingers on the paper.”  
This is consistent with previous Amnesty international research on “voluntary” returns from Turkey.   
“The international legal principle of non-refoulement prohibits states from returning anyone to a territory where they are at risk of persecution and other serious human rights violations. We urge the Turkish and Iranian authorities to abide by this obligation and stop forcing people back to danger in Afghanistan,” said Marie Forestier.  
“The international community must also arrange safe passage and evacuations for Afghans who are at risk, and step up with a coordinated response to share the responsibility of hosting Afghan refugees.”

It was a crime that opened the eyes of the world to terrifying realities in Mexico. Students from a rural teachers’ college in Ayotzinapa, travelling on buses to take part in a demonstration in the capital, were suddenly ambushed in Iguala on September 26, 2014. As the students fled the buses to escape the gunfire, 43 of them were taken away by local police. They were never seen again. 
Failure to find the missing students ignited massive demonstrations across Mexico. Indignation only increased when Mexico’s then Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam announced the results of his investigation, stating that corrupt municipal police officers had arrested the students, then turned them over to an organized crime group, who killed them and burned their remains at a garbage dump. Yet, respected independent experts, brought in by the students’ families, investigated the dump site and said there was no evidence to support the government’s claims. Other experts agreed that the official version was not credible. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, expressed concern about a cover-up and “confessions” obtained with torture. 
In Canada, Amnesty activists joined public protests and sent thousands of messages to Mexican authorities in support of the families and classmates of the missing 43, echoing their calls for the truth. 
Those calls fell on deaf ears until Andrés Manuel López Obrador became President in December 2018 and immediately created a Truth Commission to reopen investigation into what really happened. 
Now, more than 3 years later, the commission has released its final report. It concludes what the families of the disappeared students and human rights organizations have long alleged; that the disappearance of the students was a “state crime” that involved high ranking federal and state authorities, and army commanders.  
President López Obrador promised the families of the 43 that there will be no impunity for those responsible. A day after release of the Truth Commission’s report, there was an unprecedented development. Mexico’s former Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam was arrested on charges of forced disappearance, torture and obstruction of justice. Arrest warrants were also issued for 20 soldiers and army officers, 33 local police officers, 11 state police officers, 5 state officials and 14 gang members.  
“The recent advances are the result of the tireless struggle of the mothers, fathers and families of the Ayotzinapa students, and the exceptional, painstaking work of human rights organizations that have supported them,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, Executive Director of Amnesty International Mexico. “The government of President López Obrador has shown a willingness to clarify the facts about the students’ enforced disappearance, as well as to strengthen the state bodies responsible for investigating this appalling crime.” 
Amnesty’s Americas Director Erika Guevara-Rosas also recognized the importance of the Truth Commission’s report: “Authorities in the government of then President Enrique Peña Nieto pursued a deliberate policy of concealment and obstruction of justice. The Truth Commission’s devastating report, which concludes that the persecution and enforced disappearance of the students was a state crime, must open the way for continued clarification of the facts, establishing their whereabouts and guaranteeing non-repetition.” 
Indeed, yet to be answered is the most important question of all for the families: where are their children? 
Alejandro Encinas, the government official leading the Truth Commission, has spoken out about evidence they collected that suggests six of the Ayotzinapa students may have been held for days, and then handed over to an army commander who gave the order for them to be killed.  
Families of the students had pressed from the start for a search of army facilities in the area and investigation of their role in the enforced disappearances. 
Hilda Legideño Vargas, whose son Jorge Antonio was studying to be a teacher when he was forcibly disappeared with 42 of his classmates in September 2014, had this to say in a message to Amnesty Canada: “We, the families, will not stop until we know what happened, with scientific evidence, and until those who damaged our children are brought to justice for what they did. Our experts continue their investigation. Thanks to them it has been possible to make progress but there is still so much to clarify. Thank you to everyone who has offered their solidarity and stood by us, helping us to endure this journey in search of our children.” 
The enforced disappearance of the 43 students of Ayotzinapa has attracted considerable attention both inside and outside Mexico. But it is no isolated case. There are now more than 100,000 people reported disappeared in Mexico. It’s a staggering number! Amid indifference, lack of resources, or collusion of authorities with organized crime, family members of the missing have experienced resistance to their requests for timely searches and investigation of alleged perpetrators. Truth and justice for the Ayotzinapa students must herald a determined commitment on the part of authorities across Mexico to confront the epidemic of disappearances.

NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
In a statement from the Governor’s office said that “After thoroughly reviewing arguments and evidence presented by all sides of the case, Governor Kevin Stitt has denied the Pardon and Parole Board’s clemency recommendation for James Allen Coddington”. Family members of the murder victim, and the state Attorney General, had opposed clemency. One of James Coddington’s lawyers said that his legal team were “profoundly disheartened” by the Governor’s decision, saying that in recommending clemency, the Board had “acknowledged James’s sincere remorse and meaningful transformation during his years on death row”.   
This was the third execution in Oklahoma in 2022, and the 117th since 1976 when the US Supreme Court allowed executions to resume in the USA under new capital statutes. There have been 10 executions in the USA this year, bringing to 1,550 the total across the country since 1976.

0,Ukraine: Russian sham trials of prisoners of war in Mariupol ‘illegal and unacceptable’,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/ukraine-russian-sham-trials-of-prisoners-of-war-in-mariupol-illegal-and-unacceptable/,"Any moves by Russian-backed armed groups to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in a so-called ‘international tribunal’ in Mariupol are illegal and abusive, and a further act of cruelty against a city that has already suffered extensively under Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Amnesty...","Any moves by Russian-backed armed groups to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in a so-called ‘international tribunal’ in Mariupol are illegal and abusive, and a further act of cruelty against a city that has already suffered extensively under Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Amnesty International said today. 
In recent days, concerns have mounted after several reports and pictures shared on social media appear to show cages being built inside the Mariupol Philharmonic Hall to allegedly restrain prisoners who will be put on trial. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab confirmed that pictures posted on Facebook by Mariupol City Council were consistent with the interior of the Mariupol Philharmonic Hall. 
International law prohibits a detaining power from prosecuting prisoners of war for having participated in hostilities, or for lawful acts of war committed in the course of armed conflict. Under the Third Geneva Convention, prisoners of war charged with crimes are entitled to due process and a fair trial, which can only take place in a regularly constituted court. 
By staging such sham ‘trials’, Russia – as the occupying power – is making a mockery of justice 
“Any attempts by Russian authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in so-called ‘international tribunals’ set up by armed groups under Russia’s effective control in Mariupol are illegal and unacceptable,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. 
“International humanitarian law prohibits courts being set up solely to try prisoners of war. Wilfully stripping fair trial rights from prisoners of war, which is precisely what Russia’s action will do, amounts to a war crime. The Geneva Conventions also state clearly that prisoners of war are protected from prosecution for taking part in hostilities. 
“By staging such sham ‘trials’, Russia – as the occupying power – is making a mockery of justice and a public theatre of courts, transforming them into vehicles for propaganda. 
“To choose Mariupol as host of these ‘tribunals’ is particularly cruel and shocking, given Russia’s recent relentless attacks and siege which turned the city into a wasteland before its capture in May. Amnesty International investigated a Russian air strike on the Donetsk Regional Academic Drama Theatre in Mariupol and concluded that Russian forces had deliberately targeted civilians, an attack amounting to a clear war crime.” 
Russian forces and Russian-backed armed groups must give independent monitors full access to Ukrainian prisoners of war. Amnesty International shares concerns raised by the UN’s human rights agency (OHCHR) that Ukrainian prisoners of war have been held without access to independent monitors, “exposing them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession”. 
Amnesty International also shares OHCHR’s concern that public statements by Russian officials deeming Ukrainian prisoners of war to be ‘war criminals’ directly undermines the presumption of innocence, a fundamental fair trial guarantee. 
In recent years, Amnesty International has consistently documented the violation of the right to a fair trial in Russia, including endemic use of torture, fabrication of evidence, and politically-motivated prosecutions. These concerns are substantially increased when it comes to ‘trials’ by armed groups in Russian-occupied territories. 
Amnesty International has also previously documented numerous human rights abuses by such groups since they took control over parts of eastern Ukraine under Russian patronage, including abductions, killings, unlawful deprivation of liberty, torture and other ill-treatment, and suppression of dissent. 
Amnesty International is also calling for an immediate international investigation into other alleged war crimes, including the 29 July explosion in Olenivka village that killed more than 50 Ukrainian prisoners of war held by forces of the so-called ‘Donetsk People’s Republic’ in eastern Ukraine. It is imperative that Russian authorities allow international investigators to visit the site to launch a comprehensive probe. 
Protections for prisoners of war facing criminal proceedings are contained in Articles 82 to 108 of the Third Geneva Convention (GCIII). As Article 84 provides, they may only be tried by courts that offer “the essential guarantees of independence and impartiality as generally recognized”. 
In addition, Article 13 of GCIII states: “Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.”  
Since the beginning of the conflict, Amnesty International has been documenting Russian war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law committed during Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, reports, briefings and investigations – can be found here.  
Amnesty International has called repeatedly for Russian forces responsible for violations to be held to account and has welcomed the ongoing International Criminal Court investigation in Ukraine. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine will require the concerted efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction.

On 25 August 2017 Myanmar’s military began carrying out violent operations against the Rohingya population in northern Rakhine State, which resulted in grave crimes under international law, whole villages torched, and forced hundreds of thousands to flee into Bangladesh. 
“This solemn anniversary is a haunting reminder that not a single high-ranking Myanmar military official has been prosecuted for the egregious campaign of violence against the Rohingya,” said Amnesty International’s Ming Yu Hah, Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns. 
“Amnesty International stands in solidarity with the Rohingya people who are in Rakhine State and the estimated one million refugees living across the border in Bangladesh. Real justice is essential to ending the spiraling cycle of impunity engulfing Myanmar for many years.” 
This solemn anniversary is a haunting reminder that not a single high-ranking Myanmar military official has been prosecuted for the egregious campaign of violence against the Rohingya. 
Five years later, Rohingya in Rakhine State still lack freedom of movement and other basic rights such as access to adequate food, healthcare and education, problems compounded by the rising insecurity brought on by the 2021 military coup in Myanmar. Across the border in Bangladesh, Rohingya refugees are living in limbo with neither the opportunity to safely return to their homes in Myanmar nor a way to live peacefully in Bangladesh, where violence has been on the rise in refugee camps. 
“We face enormous hardship in the refugee camps,” San thai Shin, a Rohingya refugee in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar camp, told Amnesty International in June. “We do not know how we can ever return to our homes. We are neither safe in the refugee camps nor in Arakan [Rakhine State in Myanmar].”  
“Our people are losing their lives to gang violence in the refugee camps, in environmental calamity, or by taking dangerous attempts to migrate to other countries through the deadly seas and other means.”  
Importantly, some international justice efforts are moving forward. In July 2022, the International Court of Justice dismissed Myanmar’s objections and decided that it has jurisdiction to continue proceedings instituted by the government of The Gambia against the government of Myanmar in 2019 on the basis of the Genocide Convention. 
“The International Court of Justice’s decision is a vital step in ongoing efforts to hold Myanmar’s government to account,” Amnesty’s Ming Yu Hah said.  
The International Criminal Court is also investigating crimes committed in 2016 and 2017 against the Rohingya population. Although Myanmar has not ratified the ICC’s Statute, the Court is examining alleged crimes committed partly in the territory of Bangladesh or other states. Amnesty International has called for the United Nations Security Council to refer the full situation in Myanmar to the International Criminal Court Prosecutor, so that an investigation of all crimes committed in Myanmar can be conducted. 
An investigation into other crimes in Myanmar is also being conducted in Argentina under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which permits national authorities to investigate crimes under international law committed anywhere in the world on behalf of the international community. The case, which was filed by the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), hopes to hold senior military leaders to account for alleged responsibility in crimes against the Rohingya people.  
These efforts should be supported and other states should also take measures to investigate and prosecute the crimes before their national courts.   
“The Association of Southeast Asian Nations must also play a more forceful, decisive and leadership role in standing up for the Rohingya people and pushing for accountability in Myanmar,” Amnesty’s Ming Yu Hah said.  
“We reiterate our call on authorities to respect and ensure the participation of Rohingyas in the decisions that affect them in order to protect their human rights.”  
Background: 
More than 740,000 Rohingya women, men and children fled northern Rakhine State to neighboring Bangladesh, when in August 2017 Myanmar security forces launched a widespread and systematic assault on Rohingya villages, including extrajudicial killings, destruction of properties and sexual assault. The onslaught came in the wake of a series of what the military claims were insurgent attacks on police posts. 
Taking into account previous decades of violence against the Rohingya, an estimated one million Rohingya refugees now live in Bangladesh, while many of their homes in Rakhine State have been destroyed without a trace. 
The UN Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar previously called for Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and other top military officials to be investigated and prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Min Aung Hlaing assumed the role of Chairman of the State Administration Council following the February 2021 coup. 
In a report published earlier this month, since the coup Amnesty International documented the crackdown and arbitrary detention of those who exercise their right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly as well as enforced disappearances, torture and other inhuman treatment in detention.  
More than 2,000 people have reportedly been killed since the coup, and Myanmar arbitrarily executed four people after grossly unfair trials, the first use of capital punishment in the country in decades.  
A report by Amnesty International published in July showed that the Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying banned landmines in and around villages in Kayah (Karenni) State, while a report in May showed how the military uses air strikes and shelling as a form of collective punishment against civilians.

Since 31 July 2022, the authorities have raided dozens of Baha’i houses, detained at least 30 people, and subjected many more to interrogations, electronic ankle bracelets and threats of imprisonment in relation to their Baha’i faith. They have also ramped up confiscation and demolition of Baha’i properties.   
Iranian authorities are escalating their attacks on the human rights of Iran’s persecuted Baha’i minority. Since 31 July 2022, the authorities have raided and seized valuable belongings from dozens of Baha’i houses, arbitrarily detained at least 30 people, and subjected many more to interrogations, electronic ankle bracelets and threats of imprisonment solely due to their Baha’i faith. The Ministry of Intelligence announced on 1 August that those arrested were “core members of Baha’i espionage party” who “propagated Baha’i teachings” and “sought to infiltrate … the educational sector across the country, especially kindergartens.” According to the Baha’i International Community (BIC), at least 68 individuals are currently imprisoned on account of their faith including those in prison from as early as 2013. According to the UN, over 1000 Baha’i individuals are currently at risk of imprisonment, including 26 people in Shiraz who were sentenced to up to five years in prison in June 2022 after an unfair mass trial.   
The authorities have also ramped up confiscation of Baha’i properties. On 2 August, authorities bulldozed six Baha’i houses and confiscated over 20 hectares of land owned by 25 Baha’i individuals in Roshankouh village, Mazandaran province. As a result, at least 18 Baha’i farmers have been denied their source of livelihood. According to state media, the demolitions were carried out in the presence of several senior prosecution and executive officials. Three victims told Amnesty International that over 200 security officials, including plainclothes intelligence agents and riot police, sealed off the village and its access road from 6am to 4pm. Victims said security forces confiscated the mobile phones of villagers to prevent filming, and beat and/or pepper sprayed over 20 people, including several older men, who had peacefully gathered to protest the bulldozing. Security forces fired into the air to disperse crowds and detained two men for several hours after beating them severely. Since 2016, authorities have been attempting to appropriate Baha’i properties in Roshankouh under the false pretext that they have encroached on protected landscapes. In another case, an appeal court upheld a verdict on 25 June, authorizing the confiscation of 18 Baha’i properties in Semnan province on grounds that the owners are leading figures of the “Baha’i sect” which “engages in illegal activities and espionage to the advantage of foreigners.”

Of the 30 Baha’i individuals arbitrarily arrested by Ministry of intelligence officials since 31 July 2022, nine were subsequently released on heavy bail amounts and another nine were subjected to electronic ankle bracelets restricting their freedom of movement. The remaining 12 continue to be detained. The arrests were carried out in various cities including Ghazvin, Karaj, Mahshahr, Roshankouh, Sari, Shiraz, Tehran and Yazd. Those arrested on 31 July include prominent members of the Baha’i community and former prisoners of conscience Mahvash Sabet, Fariba Kamalabadi and Afif Naimi, who remain detained.   
The names of the 26 Baha’i men and women in Shiraz who are at risk of unjust imprisonment after a court convicted them on charges related to their identity as Baha’i adherents are Saeed Hasani, Shadi Sadegh Aghdam, Shamim Akhlaghi, Sahba Farahbakhsh, Parisa Ruhizadegan, Esmail Rusta, Bahareh Norouzi, Behnam Azizpour, Samareh Ashnaie, Farbod Shadman, Farzad Shadman, Ramin Shirvani, Rezvan Yazdani, Soroush Iqani, Sahba Moslehi, Ahdieh Enayati, La’la Salehi, Mozhgan Gholampour, Marjan Gholampour, Maryam Eslami Mahdiabadi, Mahyar Sefidi Miandoab, Nabil Tahzeeb, Noushin Zanhari, Yekta Fahandej Saadi, Varga Kaviani and Nasim Kashaninejad.   
According to state media, state entities involved in the demolitions of 2 August 2022 included the   
Office of the Prosecutor of Sari in Mazandaran province, the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad, the Natural Resources Organization, the Department of Justice, and the Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran. According to victims interviewed by Amnesty International, for decades, the village of Roshankouh had around 70 Baha’i houses and less than 10 houses which are owned by Muslim families. In 2016, local authorities defined the boundaries of the village and ruled that over half of the 70 Baha’i houses were within protected landscapes belonging to the state, despite property deeds and aerials maps showing the contrary. Since then, the authorities have repeatedly denied building permits to families who own land within the village’s historic residential area and want to either construct new houses or renovate and extend their old derelict homes. The authorities have also refused to connect between 30 and 40 Baha’i homes to the gas network. In October 2020, local authorities marked as protected forests around 12 hectares of land, which sustained the livelihood of about eight Baha’i farmers, and erected a sign which warned that any cultivation of the lands concerned was banned and offenders would be prosecuted. In August 2021, the authorities demolished two Baha’i houses that were under construction. In November 2021, they confiscated about one hectare of land, which was the source of livelihood for two farming Baha’i families.  
In a separate case, Branch 1 of the Revolutionary Court in Semnan issued a verdict on 30 January 2022 that approved a request by the Headquarters for the Execution of Imam Khomeini’s Order, an institute controlled by Iran’s Supreme Leader, to confiscate 18 properties in Semnan province, which belong to six Baha’is. The verdict, which has been reviewed by Amnesty International, justified the confiscation on grounds that the owners were prominent Baha’i figures who intended to sell or rent the properties to financially support “the unlawful organizational objectives … of the perverse Baha’i sect.” Branch 54 of the Appeal Court in Tehran province upheld the verdict on 25 June 2022. Over the past decade, local authorities in Semnan have forcibly closed at least 20 Baha’i stores, shut down and confiscated the equipment of two Baha’i manufacturing units and confiscated or blocked access to the lands of two Baha’i businesses involved in agriculture and animal faming.   
For decades, Iranian authorities have laid unfounded accusations of espionage for Israel against members of the Baha’i community solely due to the fact the Baha’i World Centre is near Haifa in Israel, where the shrines of the founders of the Baha’i faith are located. Confiscation of Baha’i properties and forcible closure of Baha’i businesses are carried out pursuant to an official policy, adopted by the Supreme Revolutionary Cultural Council and approved by the Supreme Leader in 1991, which provides “regarding the Baha’i question … that the government’s dealings with them must be such that their progress and development are blocked”. The policy adds that individuals “shall be denied employment if they identify as Baha’is” and “denied any position of influence, such as in the educational sector.”

Unless this decision is reversed, they will not be able to represent clients in criminal proceedings and in court, nor take new qualification exams for a year. This sends a warning to other lawyers in Crimea, at the time when politically motivated reprisals against activists are on the rise.  
The three lawyers were members of the Bar Association “Nizam” (Chechen Republic), which on 15 July disbarred them in response to a complaint made against them by the Ministry of Justice Directorate in Chechnya. According to the lawyers, they had no prior notice about the complaint and disciplinary hearing against them. While the Ministry of Justice Directorate alleged professional infringements by them, there is little doubt that this is retaliation for their human rights work in Crimea, where they represented clients in politically motivated cases. The lawyers plan to appeal the decision, both via the courts and the Federal Bar Association. Unless the decision is immediately reversed, they will not be able to represent clients in criminal proceedings and in court, nor take new qualification exams for a year.  
Members of the legal community in Crimea have faced growing reprisals in recent years and months, thus, the disbarment of the three lawyers sends yet another chilling warning. Representatives of the legal community have been subjected to searches and arbitrary arrests by members of law enforcement agencies, and some have received excessive fines or so-called administrative detention for “offences” that consisted in exercising their human rights to freedom of expression and/or peaceful assembly.

The human rights situation has been deteriorating in Crimea ever since its occupation and unlawful annexation by Russia in 2014. Noticeable further worsening occurred since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. This has included severe reprisals against those who have attempted to exercise the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, including civic activists, independent journalists, individuals with pro-Ukrainian views and members of faith-based groups, amongst others. Prominent members and activists of the Crimean Tatar community in particular, which the de facto authorities have always regarded as disloyal to Russia as the occupying power, have borne the brunt of ongoing reprisals.  
The Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People, a self-governing organization that had played a leading role in promoting Crimean Tatar culture, identity, and traditions, was arbitrarily banned under Russian anti-extremist legislation in 2016. Its leaders and activists have either been exiled or prosecuted and imprisoned. Also facing the same persecution are activists from grassroots movements that emerged subsequently in an attempt to protect members of the Crimean Tatar community against further reprisals. Many of these have been arrested under unfounded terrorism-related charges and imprisoned in Russia following unfair trials by military courts.  
Earlier this month, Russian law enforcement agencies detained six Crimean Tatar men on allegations of membership of Hizb-ut Tahrir, a religious movement banned in Russia (but not in Ukraine) as “terrorist”, following at least 82 such arrests in previous years that resulted in convictions of between 10 and 20 years.  
To represent victims of politically motivated prosecution in Crimea, local lawyers have had to demonstrate particular courage despite facing constant reprisals themselves, including unlawful searches, arbitrary arrests, hefty fines and jail in the form of “administrative detention” and constant threat of disbarment.  
Following the occupation and illegal annexation of Crimea, Russia imported wholesale its laws into the peninsula, which is in itself a violation of international humanitarian law governing occupation. As a result, local lawyers were no longer formally recognized as members of the legal profession and had to seek membership of bar associations in Russia in order to enable them to represent clients in criminal proceedings and in courts in Crimea. A bar association was also instituted in Crimea, under Russian law. However, several human rights lawyers have been prevented from becoming its members. Both Rustem Kyamilev and Lilya Gemedzhi have requested that their membership be transferred to the Crimean Bar Association, but the latter has repeatedly failed to consider their request on flimsy grounds, such as restrictions imposed in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic (in Russia and occupied Crimea, such restrictions and related penalties were often applied selectively, to restrict government critics and opponents).

The recent report of the Commission for Truth and Access to Justice, created by the government of President López Obrador three years ago, concludes that the disappearance of 43 Ayotzinapa teacher training students was a “state crime”. The recent arrest warrants issued at the request of the Attorney General’s Office against the former Public Prosecutor, military commanders and municipal and state police, among others, are significant advances in the search for truth and justice for this appalling crime, said Amnesty International. 
The Truth Commission’s devastating report, which concludes that the persecution and enforced disappearance of the young students was a state crime, must open the way for continued clarification of the facts, establishing the whereabouts of the young students and guaranteeing non-repetition with comprehensive policies aimed at addressing the profound crisis of disappearances in Mexico. 
Almost eight years after the enforced disappearance of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teacher Training School, the killings of three more people and the torture and persecution of students, the Mexican authorities have made progress in the investigations into the cover-up policy of Enrique Peña Nieto’s government which established “historical truth”, an investigation plagued by irregularities, human rights violations and other crimes, reflecting an absolute determination to hide the facts instead of guaranteeing truth, justice and reparation for the victims and their families. 
“After almost eight years of struggling for truth and justice in the case of the Ayotzinapa students, the progress shown confirms, once again, that the authorities under the government of Enrique Peña Nieto pursued a deliberate policy of concealment and obstruction of justice. The Truth Commission’s devastating report, which concludes that the persecution and enforced disappearance of the young students was a state crime, must open the way for continued clarification of the facts, establishing the whereabouts of the young students and guaranteeing non-repetition. with comprehensive policies aimed at addressing the profound crisis of disappearances in Mexico,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The government of President López Obrador created a special commission to pursue the case, as well as a special unit in the Attorney General’s Office. In addition, Mexico accepted the competence of the Committee on Enforced Disappearances to examine cases of disappearance in Mexico. On 19 August, at the request of the Attorney General’s Office, arrest warrants were issued against the former Public Prosecutor, Jesus Murillo Karam, who was in charge of the initial investigations, for the crimes of enforced disappearance, torture and contrary to the administration of justice, in the ‘Ayotzinapa’ case, and against 20 military commanders and military personnel from the 27th and 41st battalions in the city of Iguala, as well as five administrative and judicial officials from the state of Guerrero; 26 police officials from Huitzuco; six from Iguala and one from Cocula; plus 11 state police officials from Guerrero and 14 members of the criminal group Guerreros Unidos. 
The recent advances are the result of the tireless struggle of the mothers, fathers and families of the young Ayotzinapa students and the exceptional and painstaking work of the human rights organizations that have supported them. The government of President López Obrador has shown a willingness to clarify the facts about the students’ enforced disappearance, as well as to strengthen the state bodies responsible for investigating this appalling crime.  
“The recent advances are the result of the tireless struggle of the mothers, fathers and families of the young Ayotzinapa students and the exceptional and painstaking work of the human rights organizations that have supported them. The government of President López Obrador has shown a willingness to clarify the facts about the students’ enforced disappearance, as well as to strengthen the state bodies responsible for investigating this appalling crime, and this has made a positive contribution to addressing the obligations owed, after almost eight years. It is also time to adopt comprehensive policies to address the grave crisis of disappearances, which has already exceeded 100,000 people, in a country beset by injustice and impunity,” said Edith Olivares Ferreto, Executive Director of Amnesty International Mexico. 
Background 
The 43 Ayotzinapa Rural Teacher Training College students were forcibly disappeared on the night of 26 September 2014 after they had been arrested by municipal police as they were preparing to take part in a demonstration in Mexico City to commemorate a massacre of students on 2 October 1968. 
Despite strong pressure, internationally, nationally and from the families of the disappeared students, their whereabouts are still unknown and the facts of these grave human rights violations remain under investigation. 
Various reports from national and international organizations, as well as from the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (GIEI), appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, always questioned the official version of events at the time and presented exhaustive criticisms of the investigations carried out. The then government insisted on a single line of investigation (that the students had been arrested by the municipal police and handed over to a criminal gang and their bodies burned at a local landfill site). The theory that the students had been cremated was flatly rejected by the GIEI on the grounds that it was impossible in the circumstances described by the Mexican authorities and was not supported by the evidence. 
Amnesty International also denounced for years the shortcomings in the investigation and the political decision to hide the truth, and thereby hinder efforts to obtain justice in the case of the enforced disappearance of the students. In several reports, Amnesty International confirmed that the investigations were inadequate and did not seek at even a minimal clarification of command responsibility. Crime scenes were not protected or properly documented with photographs or video recordings. Ballistic evidence was collected, but it was not examined for traces of blood or fingerprints, nor was critical evidentiary material processed correctly. The continuing allegations of the torture and ill-treatment of detainees in connection with the disappearances, violations of due process, evidence tampering and the protection of officers suspected of involvement, were among the other human rights violations documented during the first years of the investigations.

She was accused, among other things, to “disturbing public order” for using Twitter and retweeting activists who support women’s rights. According to court documents reviewed by Amnesty International, she was detained in solitary confinement for 285 days before she was brought to trial. She was also denied access to legal representation throughout her pre-trial detention, including during interrogations. The Saudi authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Salma al-Shehab and quash her conviction.  
On 14 January 2021, Salma al-Shehab was arrested at the General Directorate of Investigations after she was called in for interrogation a few days before she was due to go back to the United Kingdom to continue her PhD studies at the University of Leeds.  
Salma al-Shehab’s trial began on 25 October 2021, and according to court documents reviewed by Amnesty International, she was detained in solitary confinement for 285 days before she was brought to trial, in violation of international standards and Saudi Arabia’s own Law on Criminal Procedures. She had no access to legal representation throughout her pre-trial detention, including during interrogations.  
In mid-2022, Salma al-Shehab was initially sentenced to six years in prison under the counter-terrorism law. At her appeal trial, the prosecution demanded a harsher punishment. Her sentence was increased to 34 years based on the discretion of the judge, after her initial sentence was overturned and she was convicted of “supporting those who seek to disrupt public order, destabilize security and the stability of the state” and publishing tweets that “disturb public order, destabilize the security of society and the stability of the state” under the counterterrorism and anti-cybercrime laws.

Amnesty International has documented 30 cases of Saudi Arabian activists and human rights defenders who were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms to be followed by arbitrary travel bans; as well as 39 unofficial travel bans which have affected relatives of activists. Travel bans have significant consequences on the lives of impacted individuals, causing them to lose educational or professional opportunities abroad, restricting their ability to seek healthcare outside the Kingdom, affecting their mental health and forcibly separating family members for years.  
Targeting activists and human rights defenders has created a climate of fear and repression with a chilling effect on Saudi activists living abroad or exiled, as they avoid returning to their own country in fear of reprisals, including being placed on arbitrary travel bans that would lock them in the Kingdom and prevent them from travelling back to their countries of residence. Many activists have also expressed fear of seeing members of their family that have remained in the country being targeted in retaliation for their activism abroad.  
Amnesty International has also documented a pattern of repression targeting the Shi’a community in Saudi Arabia, namely through the Specialized Criminal Court that has issued harsh prison and death sentences following grossly unfair trials, marred by allegations of torture and other ill-treatment during detention which the prosecution has systematically failed to investigate.

This dismissal – which comes months after several witnesses retracted their allegations against Leila in relation to her drug-related charges – adds to growing proof of concerted efforts to persecute her and fabricate evidence against her. We call on the government to urgently and impartially review her remaining charges, with a view to dropping these and ensuring her immediate release.   
The continued detention of Leila clearly violates her right to presumption of innocence and other fair trial guarantees. For over five years, she has been a victim of vicious attacks and political persecution for her human rights work. She should not have been detained in the first place, but her immediate release is the least that the Philippine government could do to correct this grave injustice and demonstrate that it is serious about restoring respect for human rights under the new administration.

Additional Information  
Prisoner of conscience and former Senator Leila de Lima, who has been detained at the headquarters of the Philippine National Police (PNP) since her arrest on 24 February 2017, was one of the staunchest critics of the human rights violations under the administration of President Duterte. In the last five years since Leila’s arrest, Amnesty International has repeatedly said that the charges against her were fabricated, and that the supposed testimony by witnesses against her was manufactured.  
In its dismissal on 9 August 2022 of the 2018 direct and indirect bribery complaints against Leila and her former aide Ronnie Dayan – filed by a special team within the Philippines’ Office of the Ombudsman – the Ombudsman itself highlighted inconsistencies in witnesses’ testimonies on how the alleged bribe money was delivered to Leila, including what the tranches of delivery were and whether or not she personally received the money. The complaints – which are separate from the drug-related charges for which Leila is on trial and in detention for five years now – stem from the allegation that she and Dayan received money from former state witness and self-proclaimed drug trader Kerwin Espinosa, in exchange for the protection of his illegal activities,  
Prior to this, in April 2022, Espinosa recanted his previous testimony where he claimed that he gave a total of P8 million (about USD $152,000) in drug payoffs to Leila when she was Justice Secretary, through Dayan. At a 2016 Senate hearing, Espinosa alleged that Dayan called him in 2015 to solicit money as campaign funds for Leila, in exchange for protection given his own involvement in the illegal drug trade.   
Rafael Ragos, a former acting chief of the Bureau of Corrections, also recanted his statements against Leila in April 2022 and said he was forced to “manufacture lies” by former Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre and other senior officials. Ragos previously testified that in 2012, he delivered money from prisoners in New Bilibid Prison (NBP) to Leila’s residence on two occasions, while she was Secretary of Justice, for her bid to become Senator. Ragos was previously an accused alongside Leila and Dayan, but the charges against him were dropped after he agreed to act as a witness against her. Aguirre has since denied Ragos’s accusation.   
On 13 May 2022, Dayan likewise recanted his testimony in 2016 that he collected drug money from Espinosa for his then employer Leila when she was still the Justice secretary. A co-respondent in one of the two remaining cases against her, Dayan said former Oriental Mindoro Representative Rey Umali, who passed away in January 2021, coerced him to testify against Leila during the 2016 Congressional inquiries into the illegal drug trading in NBP.  
Before the start of the Marcos administration, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said that the dropping of the charges against Leila is possible, adding that retractions by witnesses are a “red flag” that valid concerns exist regarding the judicial process for Leila.   
In July 2022, the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) filed murder complaints against 22 police officers for the deaths of eight high-profile drug convicts inside the New Bilibid Prison from May to June 2020. Those who died included Jaybee Sebastian, a key witness in the charges against Leila. The NBI said the inmates were murdered, contrary to records of the Bureau of Corrections that they died from Covid-19.   
Leila’s arrest in 2017 came after she attempted to investigate abuses committed in the context of the so-called “war on drugs”, which has resulted in the extrajudicial execution of thousands of suspected drug offenders and other human rights violations, in what amount to crimes against humanity. As in the case of Leila, there has largely been no justice or accountability for the victims of these abuses and their families.

Salma al-Shehab was initially sentenced to six years behind bars in mid-2022. Following an appeal at the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) on 9 August 2022, a judge raised her sentence to 34 years in prison after a grossly unfair trial, to be followed by a 34-year travel ban from the date of her release.  
“It is outrageous that Salma al-Shehab, a PhD student and mother of two from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority, has been handed down such a cruel and unlawful punishment simply for using Twitter and retweeting activists who support women’s rights,” said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International’s Acting Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
Salma al-Shehab should never have been convicted in the first place, but to have her sentence increased from six to 34 years following an unfair trial shows that the authorities intend to use her to set an example amid their unrelenting crackdown on free speech. 
“Salma al-Shehab should never have been convicted in the first place, but to have her sentence increased from six to 34 years following an unfair trial shows that the authorities intend to use her to set an example amid their unrelenting crackdown on free speech. She must be immediately and unconditionally released. The Saudi authorities must allow her to reunite to her family and to continue her studies in the UK.” 
Salma al-Shehab has been targeted for using Twitter to follow, write about and support women’s rights activists, including Loujain al-Hathloul, who was jailed after a grossly unfair trial at the SCC for “spying with foreign parties” and “conspiring against the kingdom.” Loujain was conditionally released in 2021, yet remains arbitrarily banned from travelling.   
Prolonged solitary confinement 
According to activists with knowledge of the case, Salma al-Shehab was arrested in January 2021 at the General Directorate of Investigations after she was called in for interrogation a few days before she was due to fly back to the UK to continue her studies. She was held in prolonged solitary confinement for 285 days before she was brought to trial, which violated international standards and Saudi Arabia’s Law of Criminal Procedures. She was also denied access to legal representation throughout her pre-trial detention, including during interrogations. 
At her appeal trial, the prosecution demanded a harsher punishment. The court sentenced her to 34 years based on the discretion of the judge for “supporting those who seek to disrupt public order, destabilize security and the stability of the state” and publishing tweets that “disturb public order, destabilize the security of society and the stability of the state” citing Articles 34, 38, 43, and 44 of the counter-terrorism law and Article 6 of the anti-Cyber Crime Law. The sentence against Salma al-Shehab marks an alarming escalation in the use of Saudi Arabia’s counter-terrorism law to criminalize and unduly restrict the right to freedom of expression.  
Other women’s rights activists also detained over Twitter activity 
Amnesty International has learned from activists with knowledge of Salma’s case that several other women’s rights activists have been detained over their comments on Twitter since Salma’s detention. A prevailing fear of reprisals in Saudi Arabia, however, deters people from speaking out about these cases on social media or with the media.   
“Saudi Arabi must end its relentless crackdown on women’s rights activists and any others who dare to speak their mind freely. Women like Salma must be recognized and protected, not targeted for expressing their opinions. The authorities must also stop equating free speech with “terrorism”.  They should repeal or substantially amend Saudi’s counter-terrorism and anti-cybercrime laws, which criminalize dissent, and enact new laws that are fully compatible with international human rights law and standards,” said Diana Semaan.

0,Israel/OPT: The stifling of Palestinian civil society organizations must end,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/israel-opt-the-stifling-of-palestinian-civil-society-organizations-must-end/,"The Israeli authorities must end their campaign of repression against Palestinian civil society and let organizations carry out their work free from harassment, Amnesty International said after Israeli forces today closed the offices of seven Palestinian civil society organizations in the West Bank...","The Israeli authorities must end their campaign of repression against Palestinian civil society and let organizations carry out their work free from harassment, Amnesty International said after Israeli forces today closed the offices of seven Palestinian civil society organizations in the West Bank of the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 
Before dawn, Israeli armed forces raided the Ramallah offices of Addameer, al-Haq, Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), the Union of Agricultural Work Committees, Bisan Center for Research and Development, Health Work Committees, and the Union of Palestinian Women Committees, and confiscated files and equipment. They also issued military orders to close them down and welded shut their office doors. 
“These organizations have contributed enormously to human rights in the OPT and across the globe, yet Israeli army boots trample all over their work. Amnesty International stands proudly in solidarity with our Palestinian partners and calls on all governments to condemn the Israeli army’s attack on Palestinian civil society,” said Amna Guellali, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
“The international community needs to work together not only to reopen the offices of these seven organizations, but also to honour their calls to support the International Criminal Court’s investigation into the Palestine situation and for international condemnation of Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians.” 
Amnesty International spoke to partners at three of the seven organizations, who conveyed their shock at the raids and closures. 
These organizations have contributed enormously to human rights in the OPT and across the globe, yet Israeli army boots trample all over their work. 
“The occupying army has failed to silence our voice in defence of human rights. The army uses military law against human rights law. The raids show that Israel rejects the position of the EU and the international community, and rather invests in continuing the occupation and the human rights violations that it causes,” Khaled Quzmar, director of DCIP, told Amnesty International.  
Amnesty’s researchers examined the military orders posted on the office doors of three of the organizations. In all cases, the order to close the offices was based on the 1945 Defence (Emergency) Regulations, which were issued by the British to quash resistance to their rule, and never repealed. Since 1967, the Israeli military authorities have used these regulations extensively to demolish hundreds of Palestinian homes, deport residents and hold tens of thousands of Palestinians from the OPT in administrative detention. Israeli authorities had also used the regulations against Palestinian citizens of Israel until 1966, but not against Jewish citizens. 
These practices, which amount to grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention and violate numerous articles of human rights conventions to which Israel is a party, form part of the system of apartheid that oppresses the Palestinians. 
“Amnesty International calls on all states to recognize that Israel is committing internationally recognized crimes, including the crime of apartheid, against Palestinians in Israel and the OPT. Governments must ensure that human rights considerations are integrated into all agreements with the Israeli authorities, and exercise due diligence to refrain from contributing to the system of apartheid,” said Amna Guellali. 
Background  
On 19 October 2021, Israel’s Defense Ministry issued a military order declaring six Palestinian civil society organizations as “terrorist” entities (all excepting the Health Work Committees, who have been targeted separately). The designation effectively outlawed them from operating and allowed the Israeli authorities to close their offices, seize their assets and arrest or jail their staff members. It also prohibited publicly expressing support for their activities or funding the organizations. This designation has been widely condemned, including by international NGOs, European and other third-party governmental offices and representatives, and UN experts.  
Prior to the designation, in October 2021, the human rights NGO Front Line Defenders (FLD) collected data that confirmed, following a peer review by Citizen Lab and Amnesty International’s Security Lab, that six devices belonging to six Palestinian human rights defenders in these organizations were hacked with Pegasus, a form of spyware developed by Israeli cyber-surveillance company NSO Group.   
On 18 October 2021, the Israeli minister of interior notified French-Palestinian lawyer Salah Hammouri, who works with Palestinian prisoner rights group Addameer, that his Jerusalem residency was being revoked and he would be deported for allegedly “breaching allegiance with the State of Israel”. He has been held in administrative detention, without charge or trial, since 7 March 2022. Amnesty International has called for his release.

The criminal court of Maldives observed that the activist spent six months in pretrial detention, in excess of the sentence stipulated under domestic laws. Therefore, he will not have to serve more time in jail.   
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Accused of posting content critical about religion on social media and for possession of “obscene material”, Maldivian religious freedom and human rights activist Mohamed Rusthum Mujuthaba faced five months in prison upon conviction.  
Mohamed Rusthum Mujuthaba appeared in court on 11 May 2022, where he stated that he had been detained for six months, in excess of the sentence stipulated if convicted. However, the state prosecutor argued that he had been detained for 29 days, 22 hours and 19 minutes. The reduced time argued by the state meant that he could have been imprisoned again.  
Amnesty International contacted the Maldives Correctional Services and confirmed that the activist spent time in pretrial detention, in excess of the claims by the Prosecutor General’s Office. On 10 August 2022, when the state prosecutor argued at the Maldivian criminal court that Mohamed Rusthum Mujuthaba was detained for only 29 days, the judge checked the information with the Maldives Correctional Services and found Amnesty International’s findings to be true.  
Mohamed Rusthum Mujuthaba pled guilty to the charges but the criminal court relieved him from further imprisonment. No further actions are required as the case has drawn a conclusion and he no longer faces imprisonment.  
“I would have had to go to prison again as the state was trying to imprison me illegally. Amnesty International took urgent action, contacted the Maldives Correctional Services to corroborate my claims and wrote to the prosecutor general’s office and attorney general’s office. I sincerely thank members and supporters of Amnesty International for their genuine support,” said Mohamed Rusthum Mujuthaba.

Today, on what marks one year of the Taliban becoming the de-facto leaders of Afghanistan, we’re holding space for the dignity, protests, and voices of Afghanistan’s women and girls, who bear the worst brunt of the Taliban’s ideology and whose lives have been treated solely as instruments for diplomatic engagement with the international community. 
The women’s protests this weekend were a bold and brave response against the Taliban, who in the past 12 months have mounted sustained attacks on human rights, violently clamped down on peaceful protests, and suppressed women’s rights. The women’s protests produced powerful images and those of us in the international community hold the responsibility of supporting their visibility.

Today is a day of mourning for almost everyone in Afghanistan, those not in Afghanistan, and especially the women of Afghanistan. Since last August, they have basically lost everything. The Taliban have become even tougher and crueller in their approach and their measures become more extreme day-by-day. In the past year, they have issued 28 decrees and verdicts to eliminate women’s rights, when they could have instead invested that time and energy on the economy or security of the country. It’s clear that women of Afghanistan are the Taliban’s natural resistance and are regarded as their natural opponents. The Taliban are scared of women of Afghanistan.  
In a new briefing released by Amnesty International today, The Rule of Taliban: A Year of Violence, Impunity and False Promises, we are calling on the Taliban to immediately stop committing gross human rights violations and crimes under international law. As Afghanistan’s de facto authorities, the Taliban must urgently restore, protect and promote the rights of all Afghan people, regardless of gender and sexuality.

The briefing, The Rule of Taliban: A Year of Violence, Impunity and False Promises, documents gross human rights violations under a year of Taliban rule. It reveals widespread impunity for crimes such as torture, revenge killings and forced evictions of opponents of the Taliban, who initially promised to uphold women’s rights, press freedom and an amnesty for government officials.  
“A year ago, the Taliban made public commitments to protect and promote human rights. Yet the speed with which they are dismantling 20 years of human rights gains is staggering. Any hopes of change have quickly evaporated as the Taliban seek to govern through violent repression with full impunity,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s South Asia Regional Director.  
“Arbitrary detentions, torture, disappearances, summary executions have returned as the order of the day. Women and girls have been stripped of their rights and face a bleak future, deprived of education or the possibility of taking part in public life.”  
Amnesty International is calling on the Taliban to immediately stop committing gross human rights violations and crimes under international law. As Afghanistan’s de facto authorities, the Taliban must urgently restore, protect and promote the rights of Afghan people.  
“To prevent Afghanistan’s human rights crisis from spiralling further, the international community must take meaningful action to hold the Taliban accountable for these crimes,” Yamini Mishra said.  
Amnesty International’s research details the use of excessive force by the Taliban’s security forces as they try to police a ban on peaceful protests. In several large cities, security forces dispelled peaceful protests by beating and shooting unarmed protesters.  
One protester from Herat province told Amnesty International of the injuries inflicted by security forces: “I saw one man lying in a pool of blood in a ditch in the street; I believe he had been killed… My hand was fractured but I didn’t go to the hospital, fearing that I could be arrested for participating in the protests.”  
The Taliban’s crackdown on freedom of expression has targeted human rights defenders and civil society activists, many of whom have been harassed, threatened, detained, and even killed as a direct result of their human rights work.   
Press freedom has also come under attack. On 19 September 2021, the Government Media and Information Centre (GMIC) issued an order containing vague wording that forbids journalists from publishing stories ‘contrary to Islam’ or ‘insulting to national figures’.   
In the past year, more than 80 journalists have been arrested and tortured for reporting on peaceful protests. One journalist told Amnesty International: “I was beaten and whipped so hard on my legs that I couldn’t stand… My family signed (a) document, promising that I would not speak out about what happened to me after my release; if I did, the Taliban would have the right to arrest my entire family.”   
Since August 2021, there have been widespread reports of Taliban soldiers beating and torturing Afghans deemed to have broken Taliban edicts or accused of working with the former government.  
Hundreds of civilians have been unlawfully detained. Many are beaten with rifle butts or whipped during arrest. Sahiba* (not her real name), a female protestor, told Amnesty International her body was covered in bruises after the Taliban security forces finished with her.   
“There was no court, no charges and no due process; we were abducted from the streets, kept in a private jail for several days during which we had no access to our family, lawyer or any other official… Some of the women and girls who were with me in the same room never returned and none of us knew what happened to them,” Sahiba said.  
Revenge killings, summary executions of alleged resistance fighters and other crimes reportedly committed since the Taliban takeover could amount to war crimes.   
There have been hundreds of extra judicial killings, with bodies found with gunshot wounds or signs of torture. Dozens of people have been disappeared, their whereabouts still unknown, because of their work under the previous government or because they are suspected of being involved in resistance against the Taliban.   
Torab Kakar, 34, told Amnesty International, that despite securing a “pardon letter” from the Taliban, his friend Jalal, who had served in the Afghan National Defence Security Forces (ANDSF), was taken away to an undisclosed location by the Taliban.   
“The Taliban tied his hands behind him, blind-folded him and kept beating him while his wife and children, parents and younger siblings were crying and screaming.” When Jalal’s family looked for him, they were threatened by the local head of intelligence and warned to stop their search.  
Within weeks of the Taliban taking power, reports emerged of non-Pashtun Afghans being forcibly evicted from their homes and farms, so that the Taliban could reward their followers with land taken from other groups, particularly Hazaras, Turkmen and Uzbeks.   
Evictions were reported across the country, including in Balkh, Helmand, Daikundi, Kandahar and Uruzgan provinces, contributing to already huge numbers of internally displaced people. By June 2022, the United Nations estimated that the number of internally displaced Afghans had grown to more than 820,000.  
On 30 August 2021, the Taliban unlawfully killed 13 ethnics Hazaras, including a 17-year-old girl, in Daikundi province. According to eyewitness testimony gathered by Amnesty International, the Taliban extrajudicially executed nine former members of the ANDSF who had surrendered — killings that appear to be war crimes.   
The Taliban have subjected women to increasing violence since they took power. Sometimes as a way of punishing their family members.  
Lida, the wife of a former member of the Afghan security forces, was shot and killed by two armed Taliban men on a motorbike. The 22-year-old, who was eight months pregnant, was killed along with her two children aged two and four years old.   
Dozens of women have been arrested and tortured for holding peaceful protests demanding their rights, amid mounting restrictions that have stripped away their freedoms.   
The Taliban has clamped down on the right to education, blighting the prospects for millions of Afghan girls. When secondary schools reopened on 17 September 2021, the Taliban forbid girls above grade six to attend, claiming it was a temporary situation while they recruited more female teachers and ensured ‘appropriate’ conditions were put in place for gender segregated education. To date, none of these plans have been implemented.   
Meena* (not her real name), a 29-year-old teacher from Kabul, told Amnesty International of her despair for her daughter’s future: “…we are repeating history… I look at my uniform, remembering the school days, students, and teachers but I am left with no choice but to stay home.”  
“We must not just stand on the side-lines, watching as the human rights of a whole population collapses. A firm, meaningful and united international response is the only hope of ending the nightmare that Afghans have endured for a year now,” said Yamini Mishra.

In every conflict situation, Amnesty’s primary focus is the protection of human rights and civilians, particularly those most vulnerable and at risk. Although this was the intention of the research and extended press release, Amnesty International failed on several fronts. 
We regret the insufficient context and legal analysis, particularly given the nature of Russia’s aggression. These findings were not communicated with the sensitivity, responsibility, and precision required and expected of Amnesty. We recognize the magnitude and impact of these failings from an institution of our stature, particularly in times of conflict. 
The manner in which the International Secretariat conducted this work, engaged with sections internally, and publicly communicated these findings resulted in creating the opposite effect and challenged our core principle of impartiality. We also regret the International Secretariat subsequent communication and response to public and legal critique. 
We condemn Russia’s instrumentalization of the press release to justify its illegal aggression. Since the start of the invasion in February, Amnesty International has and continues to categorically condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as an unjustified act of aggression and a grave violation of international law. 
Our commitment to investigate the Russian military’s aggression and war crimes against the Ukrainian people is reflected in the extensive research conducted since the beginning of the invasion in February. Amnesty has documented war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine in nearly two dozen outputs—ranging from press releases to a 72-page report. 
As a section firmly committed to an equitable and decolonized approach to human rights, we greatly regret the deficiency in the collaboration between our International Secretariat and our AI Ukraine colleagues, which resulted in the resignation of Amnesty Ukraine’s director. 
A decolonial approach begins with the principle to do no harm and centering those we are privileged to work with, particularly when they are most impacted and when they tell us that they are in harm’s way. How we work is as important as what we work on—and, in this case, our ways of working from an equity-informed perspective fell unacceptably short. 
Several years ago, Amnesty International purposefully decentralized to better listen, respond to, and be led by the voices of human rights defenders on the frontlines. Unfortunately, this press release defaulted to outdated ways of working that centralize knowledge and decision-making while placing local expertise and understanding at the margins. We have done this at considerable risk to our colleagues and rights holders in Ukraine. 
Holding ourselves accountable requires a comprehensive and independent review of the internal processes that brought us to this place, resolute steps to act on those learnings, and doing the hard work to rebuild the trust of our colleagues, partners, members, donors, and supporters. 
We are actively engaged with our International Secretariat to ensure local knowledge and expertise guide our future work and will continue to advocate for the “nothing for us without us” principle in human rights advocacy. 
Important discussions —including plans for a thorough internal review— are currently underway, and Amnesty International Canadian Section (English Speaking) is committed to ensuring they lead to significant and more equitable changes in how Amnesty works globally. 
We express our solidarity to our Amnesty Ukraine colleagues, human rights defenders, and civilians who remain at grave risk in Ukraine.

The UN Secretary-General has warned that any damage to that or other nuclear plants could result in “catastrophic” consequences in the immediate vicinity and far beyond. 
“The allegations we are receiving directly from Enerhodar, the town adjacent to the nuclear plant, speak volumes about the terrible impact Russia’s militarization of the plant and surrounding areas is having on civilians. Amnesty International is currently investigating these worrying reports and urges the Security Council to do the same,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
The UN Security Council’s unequivocal priority – with regard not just to Zaporizhzhia but across the entire conflict – must be to ensure civilians are protected. 
“The Council must also include accountability for the wide range of egregious Russian violations in the conflict to date.“The imminent danger posed by the militarization of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant is and should be the key issue for the Security Council. It would appear that this militarization is part of a broader strategy by Russian forces to threaten civilians and put millions of people at great risk. We should also keep our attention on Russia’s abominable conduct, and the fact that during its six months of aggression against Ukraine its forces have endangered and killed many civilians. We should not allow the Russian authorities to avoid accountability.” 
Since the invasion, Amnesty International has documented and reported on numerous violations by Russian forces, including indiscriminate attacks, use of banned cluster munitions, and extrajudicial executions. Many amount to war crimes, which the Security Council must condemn and pave the way for those responsible to be brought to justice.“The UN Security Council’s unequivocal priority – with regard not just to Zaporizhzhia but across the entire conflict – must be to ensure civilians are protected,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, Amnesty International has spent months on the ground documenting Russian violations and war crimes. The organization has published more than a dozen press releases, briefings and reports condemning these acts and calling for accountability.

Hereditary chiefs oppose the liquified natural gas pipeline and have not given their consent...,"Wet’suwet’en land defenders in Canada are at risk of serious human rights violations as the construction of a pipeline is slated to begin in late August 2022. Hereditary chiefs oppose the liquified natural gas pipeline and have not given their consent to the project. Wet’suwet’en and other land defenders have already faced three raids by heavily armed police, and 19 people are currently facing criminal contempt charges for defying a court injunction that authorizes the police to remove people occupying permitted work sites. Wet’suwet’en Nation members report daily visits, harassment and intimidation by Canadian police officers and the company’s private security service.  
This is one of the last remaining clean sources of drinking water and salmon spawning grounds in the territory. Peaceful protestors and land defenders occupied the drill pad site in September 2021. British Columbia’s Minister of Public Safety authorized militarized police forces to arrest and forcibly remove land defenders from the territory in order to enforce an injunction obtained by the company. I am extremely worried that further arrests in 2022 will put Wet’suwet’en land defenders at risk of serious human rights violations.   
Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs – the traditional authorities of the Nation according to Wet’suwet’en Law as well as the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1997 Delgamuukw ruling – have never consented to the Coastal GasLink pipeline project, even though some elected First Nations governments have signed benefit agreements with the company. Wet’suwet’en land defenders say they are harassed, intimidated, forcibly removed, and criminalized by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the company’s private security guards for peacefully defending their traditional lands over which they have title.   
In May, the United Nations’ Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) issued a third letter to Canada noting its concern over the escalating use of force, surveillance, and criminalization of land defenders and peaceful protestors by the RCMP, the RCMP’s Community-Industry Response Group (CIRG) and private security firms.     
Write to the Minister of Public safety urging him, as a matter of urgency, to:

Salutation: Dear Minister Mendicino:  
The British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General supported the deployment of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers to arrest Wet’suwet’en land defenders and peaceful protestors on their traditional territory on three separate occasions in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Seventy-four people have been arrested and detained, including legal observers and journalists. The RCMP were equipped with assault weapons, helicopters, and dog units and on one occasion were recorded by media breaking down the door to a home with an axe and a chainsaw while pointing weapons at people inside. To date, over CAN $20 million dollars has been spent on policing and surveilling Wet’suwet’en land defenders. Federal government public safety documents label Wet’suwet’en leaders as ‘aboriginal extremists’.   
In February 2022, lawyers for Coastal Gaslink asked BC Supreme Court Justice Marguerite Church to seek Crown approval for criminal contempt charges against those arrested in November 2021. On two previous occasions, the Crown determined criminal charges were not in the public interest. However, on 1 June, BC’s Prosecution Service announced it will prosecute 15 people for criminal contempt and that it is contemplating criminal charges against a further 10 people who were arrested on 19 November. The Crown will announce its decision on 7 July. The Crown says that land defenders are repeatedly defying a court order, but the Hereditary Chiefs say that Canada has no jurisdiction to grant a company an injunction on their territory for a project they do not approve. The Wet’suwet’en won their title and rights claim in the 1997 Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw decision.   
The RCMP Community-Industry Response Group (C-IRG) was formed by in 2017 in response to large scale resource based industrial projects throughout British Columbia. It aims to ‘provide strategic oversight addressing energy industry incidents and related public order, national security, and crime issues and to create a standardized response across the province”. Much of its efforts concern injunction enforcement. C-IRG coordinates responses from different policing groups such as the RCMP, Indigenous Policing Services, E-Division Critical Incidents Program, and government agencies.   
Canada is party to international human rights Conventions, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and has a legal obligation to uphold the rights enshrined in those treaties. Canada announced its support for the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) which was passed into federal and provincial law in 2021 and 2019 respectively. The Declaration affirms that Indigenous peoples have the right to make their own decisions about their lives and futures according to their own laws and traditions. Yet Canada consistently fails to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples when they say no to resource extraction projects. A selective approach to human rights is contrary to the letter and spirit of Canada’s human rights obligations and the reconciliation with Indigenous peoples that the Federal and Provincial governments claim to champion.   
The Coastal GasLink pipeline is part of LNG Canada’s liquified natural gas project to export LNG to Asian markets. The project has the support of the government of Canada and the province of British Columbia. Canada is pursuing a policy of aggressive domestic fossil fuel expansion which contributes to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Canada must urgently phase out fossil fuels use and production to protect human rights.

Indigenous Peoples face racism and discrimination in most countries. We have been stripped of our lands and evicted from them. 
The powerful implement policies that leave us impoverished and obstruct all kinds of opportunities for human, social and professional development. Very few governments invest in education, health or infrastructure in communities where Indigenous Peoples are a majority. On the contrary, the total lack of state presence is noticeable. 
Governments and economic powers continue to reduce our customs and ways of life to folklore, exploiting parts of Indigenous culture to attract tourism when it suits them. 
States and extractive companies act in a racist and exclusionary manner when they implement projects or megaprojects that affect our communities, without respecting or complying with national laws or international standards on prior information and consultation. As Indigenous communities, we have ancestral wisdom and practice principles and values that guide us not to consent to the megaprojects or monoculture plantations that they want to establish in our territories. 
In our cultures, we have always been taught, from generation to generation, about the love and respect that we must have for hills, valleys, rivers, mountains and forests, for the air that we breathe, the rain and other elements of Mother Nature. Any damage that we allow to be done to them is damage that is being done to ourselves. Therefore, we are the caretakers and guardians of Mother Nature in our territories. To us, it is an insult and a lack of respect when companies arrive to loot and plunder the natural resources that we have done so much to protect. 
When we express our disagreement with the damage that these companies cause to Mother Nature or the environment, it is the state itself that represses us during protests, criminalizes us and uses or manipulates legal proceedings in order to imprison Indigenous leaders solely for defending human rights. There are many people imprisoned who are victims of delaying tactics in court proceedings in order to punish them by means of psychological torture. 
I, Bernardo Caal Xol, of the Maya Q’eqchi’ People in Guatemala, am a guardian against the Oxec S.A. electric company, which has diverted and seized the Cahabón river, leaving thousands of families and living beings without access to the water they have used for centuries from the sacred river in our territory. 
Together with the communities of Cahabón and Alta Verapaz, I denounced the violation of the right to information and consultation of the Q’eqchi’ People in the granting of environmental licenses and concession of the Cahabón river to the Oxec and Oxec II projects. I denounced the environmental crime of unlicensed logging of 15 hectares of natural forest – forests play a fundamental role in combatting climate change. I also denounced the construction of the hydroelectric plants, the illegal appropriation of national land and the deprivation of access to water of the Q’eqchi’ Indigenous inhabitants of the banks of the Oxec and Cahabón rivers. 
I have been persecuted and criminalized for making these denunciations on behalf of my people. On 24 March I was released from prison having served a sentence based on crimes fabricated by companies and the state. This is how I witnessed and proved the way in which corporations co-opt state structures in Guatemala. 
The state responded to our complaints and demands by imprisoning and torturing the representatives of Indigenous Peoples so that we would not reclaim our rights, mainly in regard to the implementation of megaprojects that do not benefit the majority. The electricity produced by the companies in my community is not for the Q’eqchi’ families, it is for commercial use in other countries, meanwhile our communities do not have electricity. Our families still use lamps, so we are certain the companies are stripping us of our natural resources. 
Amnesty International carried out a comprehensive investigation into my case and in June 2020 declared me a Prisoner of Conscience, having determined that I was only defending the collective rights of my territory in a peaceful manner. Yet I was still wrongfully imprisoned for four years and two months. 
This 9 August, the International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples, I raise my voice to demand that governments around the world stop criminalizing our Indigenous brothers and sisters. They must respect the territories that we live in. They must respect the natural resources that we have protected, as we have been taught by our ancestors. 
The right to self-determination of peoples and the right to free, prior and informed consultation remain the fundamental pillars of our existence and the construction of democracy in every country around the world. I therefore call for the work of human rights defenders around the world to be respected and protected. 
Likewise, I call on governments to enforce and respect international laws and agreements so that companies can be held responsible for the damage they have caused to Mother Nature, to the environment and biodiversity, particularly now that we are facing serious consequences due to climate change. 
As Indigenous Peoples, we find ourselves in a very difficult situation. We are still struggling with COVID-19. We are those who are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We continue to defend our territory against looting and pillaging. We continue to defend water, our rivers and forests. On a daily basis we continue to face the structural racism, patriarchy and colonization imposed on us by the state in every country we live in. 
For all of the above reasons, every government in Latin America and the Caribbean must approve and sign the Escazú Agreement, an unprecedented regional treaty to guarantee the right to a healthy environment and protect the work that we do as defenders of the land, territory and environment. This is a matter of urgency. 
Bernardo Caal Xol’s case was featured in last December’s Write for Rights, an annual campaign by Amnesty International and the world’s biggest human rights event. In March 2022, Bernardo was freed from jail but the miscarriage of justice he suffered has yet to be redressed.

While most of Canada’s restrictions born during the height of the pandemic have been lifted, the long-term impacts on the economic rights of women and girls demand immediate attention as Canada, and the world, begins to regain its footing. In the last two years, millions of women’s public-facing jobs have been at the mercy of continuous public health closures, and millions more balanced this with unpaid labour at home. 
In May, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives (CCPA) released A Bumpy Ride, an analysis outlining how women in the labour force and their economic recovery was severely affected by the pandemic. Its findings bring attention to the need for recovery efforts targeted at women’s economic opportunities. 
Compared to men, women experienced disproportionate economic losses as a result of the highly gendered character of the labour market, their concentration in sectors and occupations that have been vulnerable to pandemic restrictions, and the precariousness of those positions reflecting deep-seated gender bias. 
This research incorporates an emphasis on the intersectionality of women and their persistent economic struggles – namely by migrant status, race, ethnicity, Indigeneity, disability, age, and childcare and family care responsibilities. Such intersecting identities and factors require close attention as they expose the different experiences of women, thus creating inclusive data representation and policy recommendations that are attentive to such a wide range of struggles.  
First, economic challenges were most noticeable among women facing intersecting forms of discrimination. For marginalized communities, the weight of the pandemic was further burdened by issues including but not limited to: increased domestic and intimate partner violence, isolation, and economic insecurity. These communities’ pre-existing barriers, including high levels of poverty, housing precarity, and food insecurity were disadvantages in the face of the pandemic’s subsequent loss of income, and more than two years later, the employment barriers persist. The report noted marginalized communities were twice as likely to report financial difficulties than other families. Immigrant women also reported higher levels of financial stress, likely due to their over-representation in lower-wage jobs. The pandemic recovery was more sustainable for professional sectors such as accounting, computer systems design, and scientific research – sectors that have always had gender disparities and where compared to women, men experienced more employment and economic gains. 
Women with disabilities faced increased financial stress as the pandemic brought on additional essential needs such as obtaining personal protective equipment, attendant care, and safe transportation. In fact, people with disabilities were the largest group forced to subsist on welfare benefits. 
Employment levels of older women ran below pre-pandemic levels as thousands chose to leave the labour market altogether. Young women experienced the largest employment losses in the spring of 2020 as accommodation, food services, and culture and recreation sectors experienced recurring closures. In addition to providing entry-level jobs for young people and newcomers, these sectors serve as flexible employment for women with caring responsibilities.. 
Recurring shutdowns and online learning brought fluctuating unemployment rates for mothers with each wave of the pandemic. Between February and April 2020, a drop in employment of 235,000 and an increase of 385,000 absences from work was observed from 620,000 mothers. In addition to such employment losses, single mothers have faced heighted financial stress. While pandemic recovery has allowed many mothers to resume their positions in the labour market, employment levels show that single parents do not have the same opportunity. 
The need for job protections and flexibility for the care needs at home is emphasized in the comparison of women’s salaries with rising inflation. In the past year, two-thirds of women have seen their wages decrease when adjusted for inflation and the rising cost of living. While the annual change in inflation was 5.7% in February 2022, women’s wages only increased by 2.2%. 
While overall employment rates for women have recovered to pre-pandemic levels by December 2021, employment in pandemic-vulnerable sectors such as service and hospitality is still down 11 percent from December 2019. As for job losses in these sectors, women account for 60% cuts. The study’s bigger picture reveals that women experienced disproportionate economic losses compared to men. This comparison is attributed to the gendered character and bias of the labour marker and the concentration of women in sectors vulnerable to pandemic restrictions. 
Without focusing and sustaining recovery efforts on the needs of those experiencing the greatest barriers, progress towards greater gender equality will be rolled back and the recovery itself will be prolonged for the most marginalized who have born the worst of the pandemic. 
The lifting of these restrictions, however, cannot be misconstrued as the quick fix or solution. The pandemic and its restrictions exacerbated existing gender inequalities. The chance to be better lies ahead. As the world sifts through the fallout of the pandemic, the rights of women and girls must be at the forefront of considerations of what comes next.

Their convictions were based on “confessions” which both men retracted in court and said were obtained under torture and other ill-treatment. They are prisoners of conscience targeted for exercising their right to peaceful assembly and their families’ real or perceived links to opposition groups.   
University students Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi, both 22, are serving unjust 16-year prison sentences in Tehran’s Evin prison after Branch 29 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran convicted them on 25 April 2022 of “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”, “spreading propaganda against the system” and “destruction of public property” for their participation in peaceful protests in January 2020 and their families’ real or perceived ties to the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), an opposition group based outside Iran. Their trial was grossly unfair; their rights to adequate defense, not to incriminate themselves, and to the presumption of innocence were violated. Ministry of Intelligence agents denied them access to an independent lawyer of their choosing for the first 13 months of their detention. On 8 December 2021, journalists working with outlets affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards disseminated a video of their forced “confessions” on social media. According to an informed source, they “confessed” under the threat of death and sexual violence after being transferred out of Section 209 of Tehran’s Evin Prison to a location outside prison, where Ministry of Intelligence agents warned them that prison regulations did not apply. Prior to their transfer, they were held in solitary confinement for nearly 60 days in violation of the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment.  
Amnesty International learned that in their last trial session on 17 April 2022, the judge noted that the prosecution had failed to present the video footage of their interrogation sessions he had requested during a previous hearing after the two students told him that they had “confessed” under torture and other ill-treatment. Even though the prosecution only gave the court the aforementioned propaganda video containing their videotaped forced “confessions”, the judge convicted them on that basis and failed to order an investigation into their claims. Branch 36 of the Appeals Court upheld their convictions and sentences on 6 June 2022. Amnesty International learned that since then, Ministry of Intelligence agents visited Amirhossein Moradi’s father and made vague promises about the possibility of his son’s release in exchange for agreeing to a “friendly” interview with state TV and publicly criticizing dissidents; Amirhossein Moradi refused.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei:  
Ministry of Intelligence agents subjected Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi to torture and other ill-treatment, by inflicting severe pain and suffering on the two students for the purpose of extracting “confessions”. They were held in separate rooms in Section 209 of Evin prison for 808 days following their arrests on 10 April 2020. For the first 60 days, they were held in solitary confinement in small windowless rooms with bright lights on 24 hours a day, which left them without a sense of day and night and caused them severe distress and pain. Ali Younesi stated that he was only able to sleep by covering his eyes with his shirt. During their detention in Section 209, agents severely limited their access to fresh air and natural light to 20 minutes twice a week and denied them face to face visits with their families. Ali Younesi revealed to his family that he had been denied adequate healthcare for serious injuries sustained to his left eye during beatings upon his arrest by Ministry of Intelligence agents; he has not been examined by an eye doctor during his detention. Amirhossein Moradi also reported being harshly beaten during his arrest. On 26 June 2022, they were transferred to the public ward of Evin prison. On 15 July 2022, Iran’s High Council for Human Rights, which is supervised by the judiciary, responded to a communication by a group of UN Special Procedures dated 3 May 2022 raising concerns about Ali Younesi’s and Amirhossein Moradi’s treatment in detention and the violation of their fair trial rights , dismissing concerns and falsely claiming that “the defendants were kept in the solitary suite (not solitary cell) of Ward 209 of Evin Prison for a limited period of time before the verdict was issued. After that, they were transferred to General Ward 209”. (See here for more information).   
The authorities violated their right to be presumed innocent by publicly accusing them of ties to “counterrevolutionary” groups apparently based on their families’ real or perceived association with the PMOI. During a weekly press conference on 6 May 2020, Iran’s then judiciary spokesperson Gholamhossein Esmaili stated that two university students had been arrested for being in contact with “counterrevolutionary” groups, in apparent reference to Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi. He used a pejorative term to refer to the PMOI, and failed to provide any evidence for the accusations. Authorities also made spurious accusations of having found “explosive devices” in their possession. Both students denied these accusations. Their interrogators also accused them of removing posters of Iranian officials and participating in peaceful protests in January 2020. In response to the spokesperson’s allegation that “explosive devices” were found in the homes of the university students, Aida Younesi, Ali Younesi’s sister, stated that security officials told them that that they had found nothing suspicious after searching Ali Younesi’s home.   
During a hearing before Branch 29 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran held on 3 July 2021, Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi were accused of “corruption on earth” (efsad-e fel-arz), which carries the death penalty, “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security” and “spreading propaganda against the system”. According to media interviews given by their lawyer, the judge dismissed the “corruption on earth” charge and replaced it with “destruction of public property” which accounts for 10 years of their sentences.   
The Iranian authorities have a history of targeting family members of those who have real or perceived ties with the PMOI. Following the post-June 2009 election unrest in Iran, the authorities arrested, amongst many others, individuals who had relatives with a past or current association with opposition groups, including the PMOI. See From Protest to Prison, for more information. Those arrested in 2009 include prisoner of conscience Maryam Akbari Monfared, who is serving a 15-year prison sentence following the arbitrary interference with her privacy, family and correspondence in relation to having made phone calls to and visiting once family members who were members of the PMOI (Click here for more information).  
From 11 January 2020, protests began across Iran after the authorities admitted that the Revolutionary Guards fired missiles at a Ukrainian passenger plane in Iranian air space, killing all 176 people on board, with protests quickly expanding to include anti-establishment slogans and demands for transformation of the country’s political system. Amnesty International documented that in response to these protests, security forces fired pointed pellets from airguns, usually used for hunting, at peaceful protesters causing bleeding and painful injuries, and that security forces also used rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters as well as kicking and punching them, beating them with batons and carrying out arbitrary arrests.

The US government must transfer out Toffiq and the other cleared men and close the facility immediately.  
The US government’s use of indefinite detention without charge at the military base in Guantánamo Bay as a response to 9/11 has been unlawful from the outset. Many of the men have already been cleared for release and should be expeditiously transferred  to countries that respect their human rights. This detention regime must be brought to an end.  
One man who is currently detained, Toffiq al-Bihani, has been held since early 2003 without being charged with any offense. He was subjected to torture and other ill treatment at the hands of US authorities. He has been cleared for release since 2010, yet he remains still imprisoned in Guantánamo today. It is entirely unclear why he has not yet been transferred to another country to be reunited with his family. His continued detention is unconscionable and arbitrary, a clear violation of his human rights.   
There are currently 19 men total cleared for transfer and they should be moved out of the facility immediately. In addition to the ongoing violation of their rights, Guantánamo is an all-too-easy location for future abuses to occur. Transferring out the men who have already been cleared will pave the way for the detention facility to be shut down once and for all. There are also 17 men detained who have not yet been cleared and are also arbitrarily detained, many have been subjected to torture.  
The impunity that persists in relation to the torture, enforced disappearance and other human rights violations committed against these detainees is outrageous. Torture and enforced disappearance are crimes under international law.

Under the presidential administration of Joseph Biden in the USA, four men have been transferred out of the military prison at the US naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.  
In July 2021 the Biden administration transferred a 56-year-old Moroccan citizen, Abdul Latif Nasser, to Morocco. Nasser had been cleared for release in 2016, but was held in Guantánamo for another five years. In total, he spent 19 years at Guantánamo without being charged.  
In April 2022 the US government repatriated Sufyian Barhoumi to Algeria. He was captured in Pakistan in March 2002 and soon taken to Guantánamo Bay, where he never faced trial. He was notified under the Obama administration in August 2016 that he was eligible for release, but his case was stalled by a Trump administration policy that generally halted transfers.  
In March 2022 the US government repatriated detainee Mohammed al-Qahtani to Saudi Arabia for mental health care. al-Qahtani was tortured so badly by US authorities that he was found ineligible for trial as the alleged 20th hijacker in the September 11th attacks.  
In June 2022 Asadullah Haroon Gul, an Afghan prisoner held in US custody for nearly 15 years, was released from Guantánamo pursuant to a U.S. federal court order.  
While these transfers are welcome, the administration must move much more quickly to transfer out the remaining 19 men cleared to leave, and to transfer, release or bring to a judicial resolution all those who remain.   
Amnesty International calls on the Biden administration to close the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay once and for all. All those still detained there must either be released and transferred out or if there is sufficient admissible evidence under international law to prosecute internationally recognizable criminal offences then the authorities should do so through fair judicial resolution before a federal court without recourse to the death penalty. Detainees held at Guantánamo and elsewhere by the USA since 9/11 have been subjected to torture and enforced disappearance. The USA must investigate and bring suspected perpetrators of these crimes under international law to justice, whatever their current or former level of office.   
Closing Guantánamo is not only about the current detentions, but also about crimes under international law from the past 20 years and the lack of accountability and remedy for them.

Ali Maziad’s family told Amnesty International that they immediately contacted several police stations and government agencies in Saudi Arabia to seek information about his fate and whereabouts, but the authorities provided no information to the family. In November 2021, over three months after Ali Maziad’s disappearance, the Lebanese Embassy in Riyadh informed the family that he was being detained by Saudi Arabia’s State Security without having any further information. “We don’t even know if he is alive. We haven’t had any contact with him since they [group of men] took him away,” Ali Maziad’s relative told Amnesty International.   
On 4 August 2021, Ali Maziad, a 58-year-old Lebanese Shia Muslim man and Lebanese national residing in Saudi Arabia, was abducted from his house in the capital, Riyadh by a group of men in civilian clothes. The Lebanese Embassy informed his family three months after his disappearance that he is being detained by State Security. Since then, he has been forcibly disappeared and his family has no information about his fate and whereabouts. Amnesty International urges the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately disclose the fate and whereabouts of Ali Maziad, release him and ensure he has access to medical treatment and legal representation.   
Ali Maziad has been living and working in Saudi Arabia intermittently since 2004. According to his family, he takes medications to treat several health illnesses. Ali Maziad’s relative told Amnesty International: “His cancer recurrence requires proper health care and follow up. He also has diabetes, irregular heartbeats, and glaucoma—all of which requires medication.”

Amnesty International has documented several cases of foreign nationals being arbitrarily detained by the Saudi Arabian authorities, accused of trumped-up charges and put through grossly unfair trials. Ten Egyptian Nubian men have been detained since 14 July 2020 and are facing trial before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh in relation to a peaceful community event they had planned. At least two of the men are older people and suffer health ailments. Amnesty International urges Saudi Arabian authorities to release all the men immediately and unconditionally.  
In another case, two Palestinian nationals, Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari, who is 84-years-old and advanced cancer patient and his son Hani al-Khudari, were detained on 4 April 2019 and charged before the Specialized Criminal Court with “joining a terrorist entity” – understood to be Hamas de facto authorities – as part of a mass trial of 68 individuals. Both men remain in detention despite their prison sentence ending on 28 February 2022. They have been deprived of proper health care and family contact. Amnesty International urges Saudi Arabian authorities to release both men immediately and unconditionally.

•Myanmar must immediately free all those unjustly detained 
•Profound psychological trauma experienced upon release 
Authorities in Myanmar’s prisons and interrogation centres routinely subject people detained for resisting the 2021 military coup to torture and other cruel or degrading treatment, Amnesty International said today in a new briefing, more than a year and a half after the power grab shattered the country’s halting transition to civilian rule. 
Based on 15 interviews carried out in March 2022 with former detainees, lawyers of prisoners and experts, as well as a review of over 100 news reports, the briefing, 15 Days Felt like 15 Years, documents the horrific experiences of individuals from the moment they are arrested, through their interrogation and imprisonment, and after their release. 
Since the 1 February 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military has arrested more than 14,500 people and killed more than 2,000, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP). 
From showing up without an arrest warrant and forcing confessions through torture or other ill-treatment, to enforceable disappearances, reprisals against relatives, and holding detainees incommunicado from family and legal counsel,military authorities flout the law at everystage of the arrest and detention process. 
This was horrifically demonstrated in the unlawful execution of four men in July, including a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker, following their death sentences by a military court. The executions were the first to be carried out in more than 30 years. More than 70 people remain on death row in Myanmar while 41 have been sentenced to death in absentia, according to AAPP. 
“Myanmar has stooped to unimaginable new lows in its vile and brutal treatment of detainees as part of an overall strategy intended to break their spirits and compel people to give up any resistance to the 2021 military coup,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnes Callamard.  
“But it is having the opposite effect. The Myanmar people remain unbowed even after the litany of violations, including most recentlythe shameful and despicable executions of Kyaw Min Yu –also known as Ko Jimmy –Phyo Zeya Thaw, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw.” 
“As a matter of urgency, Myanmar’s military must free thousands of people languishing in detention simply for exercising their rights, and let them return to their families. The United Nations Security Council must increase the pressure on the Myanmar military with a referral to the International Criminal Court, a global arms embargo and targeted sanctions.” 
Tased and beaten 
Amnesty’s research reveals how prison officials kicked and slapped detainees, and also beat them with rifle butts, electrical wires and branches of a palm tree. 
Detainees allege they were psychologically tortured with death and rape threats to force confessions or extract information about anti-coup activities. One person was presented with a parcel delivery that contained a fake bomb. 
Several former detainees interviewed by Amnesty International observed that other detainees had visible injuries on their bodies, including blood, broken limbs, and swollen faces. 
“When they [the police] found us sleeping, they beat us. When they caught us sitting, they beat us… They pointed G3 rifles atour foreheads and threatened that they could kill us anytime,” said one student arrested in the central Magwe Region.  
One woman heard security forces plunging the head of another detainee in a bucket of water and using a taser on the person several times during interrogation. 
One woman heard security forces plunging the head of another detainee in a bucket of water and using a taser on the person several times during interrogation. 
A student activist told Amnesty International that he saw police bang his friend’s head against the wall. Police also used a taser on his genitals and threatened to blow them up with a grenade. 
Ma Kyu, who was arrested in Karenni State for protesting the coup, told Amnesty what a police officer told her after she was detained: 
“We can just kill you after the arrest. We do not even need to put you in jail. We can simply shoot you.” 
‘They took off my clothes’ 
Interrogators also committed sexual and gender-based crimes. 
Saw Han Nway Oo is a transwoman who was arrested and detained in September 2021 by the military on suspicion of having attended self-defence training. She was taken to the Mandalay Palace interrogation centre, which has become notorious for reports of torture. 
Over three days, she was interrogated at the palace centre and at a police station. She said the interrogators scratched her knees with sharp objects and sprayed methylated spirit over the bleeding wounds. She was not given food or water for three days. 
“During the interrogation, whenever I used feminine pronouns for myself, they said you are gay, so you must like this and exposed their male genitals in front of me.” 
They also looked at messages with her doctor and asked if she had had a sex-change operation. They then took off her clothes, looked at her naked body and mocked her. 
Other LGBTI people also experienced thorough body checks of their private body parts to ‘‘ensure whether they are males or females,” according to one detainee. 
Humiliating and invasive body searches may constitute torture or other ill-treatment, particularly for transgender detainees. 
Blindfolded and cut off 
Arrests are typically conducted during the night. During these night raids, soldiers and police break down doors, beat residents, ransack houses, confiscate electronics such as phones and laptops, and occasionally take valuable items such as jewellery. 
Protest leader Ma Win was arrested while travelling on a passenger bus in Mandalay Region. She was slapped in the face, handcuffed, blindfolded and driven to an unknown location. 
During an interrogation lasting more than 24 hours, security forces wearing heavy boots beat and kicked her and repeatedly threatened tokill her. 
Lawyers who AmnestyInternationalspoke to described facing difficulties when trying to discover theirclients’ whereabouts. At times, they resorted to paying bribes to get basic information. 
The prison facilities are crowded, with one person describing staying with 50 people in a cell meant for 10. Detainees also found dead insects and worms in their food. 
Though the experience of detention has exacted a profound psychological toll on those who have survived it, many activists are determined to keep resisting. 
“We will never give up,” Saw Han Nway Oo told Amnesty. “We are like phones, we will recharge once we run out of batteries.”

She maintains she had never heard of this group before. Aleksandra Skochilenko was arrested in April and accused of replacing price tags with anti-war information in a supermarket. Despite not having committed any internationally recognized crime, she faces up to 10 years in prison. She has a serious health condition and placing her in pretrial detention, where she is not receiving the appropriate diet and necessary medical care, puts her health and wellbeing at risk.  
Aleksandra Skochilenko is a songwriter and artist from Saint Petersburg. She is known internationally for her work on destigmatizing mental illnesses and has helped many people inside and outside Russia.   
She is a prisoner of conscience, deprived of her freedom solely for exercising of her right to freedom of expression.  
Aleksandra Skochilenko suffers from celiac disease (genetic gluten intolerance) and according to her lawyer, the authorities in the pretrial detention centre continue to deny her the appropriate diet and the medical care she urgently needs and continue restricting her access to parcels with adequate food from her family.  She has lost considerable weight and her health and wellbeing have seriously deteriorated in detention. If she consumes gluten, there is a risk that organ failure or oncological and autoimmune diseases may start to develop. This neglect of her healthcare places her in serious danger.

Additional information  
Aleksandra Skochilenko is a well-known songwriter and artist from St. Petersburg. She writes songs, creates comic books and cartoons, organizes concerts and jam sessions. She also wrote “Book About Depression” which helped many people and contributed to destigmatizing mental illnesses. The book has become extremely popular and has been reprinted several times and translated into various languages. It also has inspired many videos and exhibitions.  
Aleksandra Skochilenko is accused of replacing price tags in local supermarkets with anti-war information, including about those killed during the shelling of the Mariupol Drama Theatre. She has been charged with “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation” under recently added Article 207.3(2) of the Criminal Code. She faces 5 to 10 years in prison if convicted.  
On 11 April, police searched Aleksandra Skochilenko’s home and arrested and interrogated her until 3am the next morning. On 13 April, the Vasileostrovsky District Court placed her in pre-trial detention until 1 June 2022. Her pre-trial detention has been subsequently extended.  
Aleksandra Skochilenko suffers from celiac disease and requires a special gluten-free diet. On 20 April it was reported that her health had deteriorated due to lack of access to adequate food. On 21 April her lawyer informed Amnesty International that the detention centre had finally allowed her to have a food parcel from her family that catered to her medical requirements.  
However, on 23 April she was transferred from a temporary detention centre to a pre-trial detention centre and on 25 April one her lawyers visited her and reported that her health condition was getting worse, as she was not being provided with the diet she required or allowed food provided by her family. Aleksandra Skochilenko felt weak much of the time. She was also being subjected to psychological pressure from detention centre guards and her cellmates.  
On 7 May, after information on Aleksandra Skochilenko’s treatment was published by media, she was transferred to a double cell with a cellmate who did not harass her.   
On 8 June, Aleksandra Skochilenko was taken to a psychiatric hospital for an expert opinion on her mental health. She spent three weeks there even though an expert diagnosis usually takes one day and can be carried out in the pre-trial detention centre. During her stay there her health continued to deteriorate. Doctors refused to share medical information about Aleksandra Skochilenko with her partner on the grounds that she is not a close relative despite an official request made by Aleksandra Skochilenko to recognize her partner as such. The hospital also refused to share this information with Aleksandra Skochilenko’s lawyer. Aleksandra Skochilenko complained that she was experiencing severe pain in her chest and abdomen, but doctors failed to carry out any tests arguing staffing shortages.  
On 28 June, Aleksandra Skochilenko was transferred back to the pre-trial detention centre. Her partner requested Aleksandra Skochilenko’s medical records again, but the authorities did not provide them. Aleksandra Skochilenko was once again denied the medical treatment she needed.  
On 30 June, the Centre for Combating Extremism (Centre “E”, a police unit that specializes in monitoring and prosecuting political opposition and government’s critics) submitted a report claiming that Aleksandra Skochilenko is a member of a “radical protest feminist group” called the “Eighth Initiative Group”. Aleksandra Skochilenko claims that she has never heard of this group. The report was submitted to justify the prolonged detention of Aleksandra Skochilenko. However, she and her lawyers believe that this claim may be used against her later.  
At the Pre-Trial Detention Centre, Aleksandra Skochilenko was being provided with gluten-free food at least once a day for lunch, but she was not able to eat breakfast or dinner. Aleksandra Skochilenko has already lost a lot of weight which puts her health at risk of further deterioration. In addition, the investigating team has declared her partner a witness in the criminal case, which means they are not allowed to see each other. Her partner has unsuccessfully filed several requests to be able to visit Aleksandra Skochilenko.  
On 1 August, Aleksandra Skochilenko was transferred to a Temporary Detention Centre, a smaller facility, where she may face further issues to access the diet and medical care her condition requires.

Iranian authorities have forcibly disappeared and are torturing Jamshid Sharmahd, a 67-year-old German-Iranian political dissident who is at risk of being sentenced to death for “corruption on earth” (efsad-e fel-arz) following a grossly unfair trial. He has been arbitrarily detained and held in solitary confinement since July 2020, but authorities refuse to reveal his location to his family.   
Throughout the trial proceedings, which concluded on 26 July 2022, he was denied access to an independent lawyer of his own choosing and the right to defend himself. His government-appointed lawyer told his family on 2 July 2022 that there was “no point” to him objecting against the Revolutionary Court admitting Jamshid Sharmahd’s forced “confessions” as evidence. Prior to this, on 9 May 2021, the government-appointed lawyer said that without payment of US$250,000 from the family, he would not defend Jamshid Sharmahd in court and would only “sit there [in court]”. Following Jamshid Sharmahd’s abduction in late July 2020 and arbitrary detention, Iranian state television aired propaganda videos showing him “confessing” to having a role in an April 2008 explosion in Shiraz, Fars province, in which 14 people were killed according to Iranian state media, thus violating his right to the presumption of innocence, not to self-incriminate and violating his right to be protected from torture and other ill-treatment. The charge of “corruption on earth”, which is in connection with Jamshid Sharmahd’s involvement in the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, an opposition collective that advocates for an end to the Islamic Republic system, is not clearly defined in law, and as such contravenes the principle of legality. He has repeatedly denied these accusations, including during trial.   
Jamshid Sharmahd has been forcibly disappeared for about 21 months, with the authorities continuing to refuse to reveal the location of his detention to his family. Since late September 2021 he has only been permitted two brief phone calls to his family –on 23 March 2022 and on 19 June 2022. During these brief phone calls in the presence of security agents, Jamshid Sharmahd revealed that he is being tortured and otherwise ill-treated, including by being held in prolonged solitary confinement since his abduction in July 2020, denied all contact with other prisoners, forced to sleep on the floor in a small room, where he is unable to take even a few steps or distinguish between daytime and night-time. Authorities are also denying him adequate healthcare, including dental care, and are routinely delaying his access to medications required for his Parkinson’s disease, resulting in severe body aches and difficulty breathing.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei,   
Additional Information:  
Jamshid Sharmahd, a resident of the USA and a journalist, created a website, Tondar, for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran (also known as Anjoman-e Padeshahi-ye Iran), where content could be posted anonymously, and which he read out in radio and video broadcasts. The website included statements from the Kingdom Assembly of Iran claiming responsibility for explosions inside Iran. Jamshid Sharmahd has denied his involvement in the violent acts attributed to him by the authorities, including by rejecting all accusations during trial. Amnesty International is concerned that Jamshid Sharmahd is at risk of the death penalty as two men, Mohammad Reza Ali Zamani and Arash Rahmanipour, were executed in Iran in January 2010 after being convicted in grossly unfair trials of “enmity against God” (moharebeh) in relation to their real or perceived affiliation with the Kingdom Assembly of Iran.   
On 1 August 2020, the Ministry of Intelligence announced in a statement that its secret agents, referred to as the “unknown soldiers of Imam Zaman” had arrested Jamshid Sharmahd following a “complex operation” without providing further details. The same day, Iran’s Minister of Intelligence, Mahmoud Alavi, stated that Jamshid Sharmahd was “heavily supported by the intelligence services of the USA and Israel” and that he had been “led” into Iran through “complex operations” and taken into the custody of the Ministry of Intelligence. This was widely understood to have meant that he was abducted by Iran’s intelligence agents from abroad – Jamshid Sharmahd had been in the UAE – and forcibly taken to Iran. Jamshid Sharmahd’s forced “confessions” were aired on Iranian state television on multiple occasions prior to his trial. In one propaganda video, released in January 2021, his “confessions” were interspersed with clips of his broadcasts for the Kingdom Assembly of Iran, with him identified by the narrator as the group’s leader and a “terrorist”. Following his abduction and arbitrary detention, his family in the USA reports that Ministry of Intelligence agents pressured them to prepare forced “confessions” on Jamshid Sharmahd’s home computer, which they refused. Following his abduction, Ministry of Intelligence agents told Jamshid Sharmahd that he was held in Tehran’s Evin prison, but by late 2020 he told his family he was no longer there without being permitted to say more about his location. During a 23 March 2021 phone call, Jamshid Sharmahd said he had lost nearly 20kg and that only two of his teeth remained intact without being able elaborate further, adding that he was only able to eat by using his gums to try to chew food.   
Since 2019, Amnesty International has documented two other cases involving the abduction of dissidents based abroad by Iran’s security and intelligence agents and their forcible return to Iran. Dissident journalist Rouhollah Zam was abducted during a visit to Iraq in October 2019 by the Revolutionary Guards, apparently with the assistance of Iraqi intelligence authorities, and forcibly returned to Iran. He was executed in December 2020 following a grossly unfair trial. Habib Chaab, an Iranian-Swedish dual national, currently detained in Iran, was abducted in Turkey in October 2020, and removed to Iran through what the Iranian authorities called “specialist and combined actions”. Turkish authorities wrote in a January 2021 reply to a communication from several UN Special Rapporteurs that he was “illegally smuggled to Iran the day after his arrival in Turkey.” Habib Chaab is currently at risk of being sentenced to death.  
While every government has a duty to bring to justice those suspected of criminal responsibility for criminal acts, anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge, including those related to “terrorism”, must be treated in full compliance with Iran’s human rights obligations, including to guarantee the right to a fair trial and ensuring international fair trial standards are respected. These further include the rights to choose one’s own lawyer; to access effective legal assistance from the time of arrest and throughout the pre-trial, trial and appeal proceedings; to be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power; to challenge the lawfulness of detention before an independent, impartial tribunal; to be presumed innocent; to remain silent and not to be compelled incriminate oneself or to confess guilt; to obtain full access to relevant evidence; to not be detained on vague charges; to examine and cross-examine witnesses; to receive a fair, public hearing before a competent, independent and impartial tribunal; and to be provided with a public, reasoned judgement. The imposition of the death penalty following an unfair trial constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life and executions of individuals sentenced to death by Revolutionary Courts following unfair trials that violate international human rights law, may also amount to extrajudicial executions, a crime under international law. Amnesty International has documented a pattern of systematic violations of the rights to a fair trial in Iran from the time of arrest and throughout the investigation, trial and appeal proceedings. Courts routinely ignore allegations of torture and other ill-treatment, without ordering an investigation, and rely on torture-tainted “confessions” to issue convictions and sentences, including in death penalty cases.

They have been included in the Free Xinjiang...,"48 individuals from predominantly Muslim ethnic groups have been allegedly interned in camps or sentenced without a fair trial and sent to prison in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang). They have been included in the Free Xinjiang Detainees campaign bringing the total to 120 individuals. These cases are representative of the perhaps 1 million or more men and women estimated to have been detained in the region since 2017. The Chinese government has knowingly and purposefully targeted mostly Uyghurs, Kazakhs and those from other predominantly Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang, including by conducting a campaign of mass detention and torture and other ill-treatment. The Chinese authorities must immediately release all people arbitrarily detained in internment camps and in prisons in Xinjiang.   
Based on the evidence collected by Amnesty International in the report “Like We Were Enemies in a War”, the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution in Xinjiang. Lawful activities many of us take for granted such as living, travelling, studying abroad, communicating with people abroad, reciting the Qur’an, or wearing religious clothing can be considered a reason to be sent to an internment camp or a prison, where detainees are subjected to a relentless forced indoctrination campaign, physical and psychological torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  
Family members living overseas are desperate to get in touch with their loved ones, many of whom they have not heard from in years. Further to their desperation is the fact that, without any access to a lawyer of their choice, the detained individuals are at even further risk of torture or ill-treatment.

Additional Information 
Xinjiang is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. More than half of the region’s population of 22 million people belong to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million) and other populations whose languages, cultures and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han who are the majority in “interior” China. 
Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against “terrorism” and “religious extremism”, the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against Muslims living in Xinjiang. It is estimated that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps throughout Xinjiang since 2017. 
The report “Like We Were Enemies in a War”: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang is the most comprehensive account to date of the crushing repression faced by Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. The evidence Amnesty International has gathered provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture, and persecution.  
The Chinese authorities had denied the existence of internment camps until October 2018, when they began describing them as voluntary, free “vocational training” centres. China’s explanation, however, fails to account for the numerous reports of beatings, food deprivation and solitary confinement that have been collected from former detainees.   
In 2019 the Chinese government claimed that they had closed the camps but did not provide any proof   
or unfettered access to journalists, human rights investigators, and diplomats. Instead, the Chinese government has made efforts to silence criticism by inviting delegations from different countries to visit Xinjiang for carefully orchestrated and closely monitored tours. The latest example is the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ visit to China in May 2022.   
As one of the people whose relatives are in arbitrary detention said to Amnesty: “they [Chinese authorities] want to show the happy Uyghur, the dancing Uyghur. I think the [UN] investigation group they have to do their best to investigate the real thing…the real situation.”  
Amnesty International launched the international campaign Free Xinjiang Detainees, and in less than four months collected more than 320,000 signatures on a petition calling for the closure of the internment camps and the release of everyone arbitrarily detained in internment camps and in prison in Xinjiang.   
The government of China must immediately close all the remaining internment camps and release all persons held in internment camps or other detention facilities – including prisons – in Xinjiang, unless there is sufficient credible and admissible evidence that they have committed an internationally recognized offence.   
Amnesty International is also calling on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to release her long-awaited report on Xinjiang and to publicly acknowledge the scale and severity of human rights violations in Xinjiang before her term concludes in August 2022.   
Last but not least, the Human Rights Council must establish an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes under international law in Xinjiang, with a view to ensuring accountability, including through the identification of perpetrators.

Andrei Pivovarov is a political activist, human rights defender and the former director of Open Russia, an organisation advocating for democracy and human rights. On 31 May 2021, he was taken off a flight in Saint Petersburg and arbitrarily detained since. Andrei Pivovarov has committed no internationally recognized crime and has been jailed for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and association. He is appealing his conviction.  
Andrei Pivovarov’s only “crime” was posting information about the peaceful and lawful activities of the Russian non-governmental organisation Open Russia. He was arrested on 31 May 2021 and put in pretrial detention in Krasnodar, a city many kilometres away from his home.  
Andrei Pivovarov is a prominent political activist and human rights defender from Saint Petersburg. He has been involved in the democracy and human rights movement in Russia for more than 15 years and has never used or condoned violence. Exercising one’s rights to freedom of expression and freedom of association is not a crime. They are guaranteed by the Russian Constitution and international law.

Andrei Pivovarov is a prominent Russian political activist, human rights defender and ex-director of the now banned organisation Open Russia. He has been involved in the work of various pro-democracy and human rights groups in Saint Petersburg since the mid-2000s. Open Russia was formed with the support of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former Russian businessman and prisoner of conscience, now living in the United Kingdom. The organisation supported opposition candidates in local elections and independent journalists, organized peaceful protests, helped individuals prosecuted on political grounds and conducted other similar activities.  
On 26 April 2017, the Prosecutor General’s office arbitrarily designated two British NGOs with similar names (Otkrytaya Rossia and Open Russia Civic Movement) as “undesirable organizations” under a restrictive law, which makes it an offence in Russia to be involved in any activities associated with organisations labelled as “foreign organisations”. Although initially the authorities claimed that this move would not affect Open Russia, which is a domestic, and not foreign entity, they later changed their approach and began persecuting Open Russia’s activists. These included Anastasia Shevchenko and Mikhail Iosilevich, who were both recognized by Amnesty International as prisoners of conscience.  
In all the reported cases, the very fact of having some sort of connection to Open Russia, or even just sharing its materials, was sufficient to impose fines and, later, penalties under criminal law. There has been no evidence of the use of violence or other internationally recognized crimes committed or planned by Open Russia.  
In March 2021, a protocol was drawn up against Andrei Pivovarov under Article 20.33 of the Code of Administrative Offences (carrying out the activities of an undesirable organization) in connection with the Moscow Congress of Municipal Deputies, which, according to the police, was organized by the “undesirable” Open Russia Civic Movement.   
In April 2021, an administrative case under the same article was initiated against Andrei Pivovarov for activities in 2020, when he delivered personal protective equipment to an ambulance station in Saint Petersburg during the Covid-19 pandemic. The authorities said that in doing so, he “acted on behalf of the foreign non-governmental organization Open Russia”.  
On 27 May 2021, Open Russia announced the cessation of its activities in connection with the upcoming tightening of legislation on “undesirable organizations” and the persecution of its activists. See Amnesty International’s reaction here: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/05/russia-open-russia-movement-forced-to-dissolve-while-its-members-face-severe-reprisals/   
On 29 May 2021, a criminal case was initiated against Andrei Pivovarov under Article 284 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (carrying out the activities of an undesirable organization).  
On 31 May 2021 Andrei Pivovarov was taken off a flight from Saint Petersburg to Warsaw and arbitrarily detained (see more details here: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2021/06/russia-immediately-release-open-russia-leader-detained-after-being-hauled-off-flight/). The accusation was based on the information that on 12 August 2020, Andrei Pivovarov, while in Krasnodar, had reposted on Facebook information relating to opposition candidates in the local elections. The authorities claimed that this was an activity of the “undesirable” Open Russia. Andrei Pivovarov was transferred to Krasnodar and has remained in detention there since. His communication with the outside world was severely restricted, and he had been allowed no family visits until the trial started at the end of 2021.  
On 11 October 2021, the Investigative Committee updated the charges against Andrei Pivovarov and included thirty of his posts and one repost on Facebook on topics such as the protests in Khabarovsk, criticism of amendments to the Russian Constitution and support for detained protesters.  
On 15 July 2022, the Leninsky District Court of Krasnodar sentenced Andrei Pivovarov to four years in a penal colony. His lawyer appealed the verdict.

Following public consultations and submissions from various stakeholders, an amended bill was presented in June 2022 which significantly altered the initial bill, disregarded civil society’s concerns and imposed stricter and more repressive clauses. The bill, if passed, threatens to crack down on civil society and organizations exposing human rights violations and holding the government accountable, criminalize their work and impose punitive measures, including imprisonment.  
In June 2022, following public consultation and submissions from various stakeholders, further amendments to the bill were presented. The latest amendments to the bill pose a serious threat to the vital work of civil society organizations that have been exposing human rights violations, holding the government accountable, and ensuring the rights of the Zimbabwean people are respected, protected, promoted and fulfilled. The proposed amendments introduce additional, excessively punitive, criminal and civil penalties for noncomplying PVOs, as well as individual liability for trustees, employees and managers of PVOs, and anyone involved in the control of a PVO, including members of the public. The bill concentrates power in the office of the Registrar, which may be used to de-register and refuse registration to organizations which in the past have come under attack and been criticized by the government.  
Furthermore, the amendments introduced in June 2022, have far reaching material changes which were not in the original bill which the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare consulted the public on. These significant changes must be subjected to public consultation.  
If passed, the bill, which is now being debated in parliament – the next sitting due to take place on 20-21 August – would constitute a grave violation of the rights to freedom of expression and association, severely curtailing the work of civil society, including enabling the shutting down of some organizations which work to promote and protect human rights and call for accountability from the government.

On 31 August 2021, the Zimbabwe Government, through its cabinet, approved amendments to the Private Voluntary Amendment Act which were proposed by the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. The proposed changes to the Act were met with widespread scepticism based on the current national context and historical experiences. The country is already in election mode and is heading towards a crucial election in July 2023. The interpretation of the provisions of the proposed PVO bill must be understood in the current context within which it is proposed. Overall, post-election disputes, a collapsing economy and widespread economic hardships caused by poor economic policies and austerity measures have raised tensions in the country. NGOs have been falsely accused of meddling in political affairs and stirring the populace to vote against the ruling party.  
On 29 June 2021, the ruling party’s Harare Provincial Development Coordinator issued a directive that NGOs must submit their operational strategies to him for review/approval. He called on the police to arrest all those that refused to comply and threatened to ban NGOs that had not submitted their plans. Civil society came together and challenged the legality of his orders with the High Court ruling in September 2021 that the directive was illegal.   
The government has also considered enacting a ‘Patriotic Bill’. A ruling party member of parliament, Hon Pupurai Togarepi of ZANUP PF, who supported the motion for government to develop a Patriotic Bill noted that: ” …civic organizations that in their activities deviate from their core business and start advancing activities that destabilize the people of Zimbabwe … people come to this country, they tell us that they are social welfare organizations yet they have political agendas … if you have campaigned against Zimbabwe, the law should actually bar you from getting into any public office because you will have killed the people that you want to look after.”  
In 2004 an initial attempt was made to regulate NGOs through the 2004 ‘Non-Governmental Organization Bill’. The Bill was passed by Parliament but never signed into law by then President, Robert Mugabe. The NGO Bill was brought about in a similar context. To date the context has not changed as civil society leaders continue to be targeted, accused of tarnishing the image of the state by exposing human rights violations or of representing ‘Western’ interests when they call for the authorities to respect and protect human rights.  
The PVO Bill places all civic organizations registered under different laws under one law and the clauses indicate an attempt to control and shut down civil society perceived to be ‘anti-government.’ The bill aims to limit CSOs ability to perform roles that might fundamentally affect the ability of ordinary Zimbabweans to fully participate in the upcoming elections and thus infringe on their constitutionally guaranteed civil and political rights. The Bill contains vague provisions where supporting or opposing a political party or candidate is prohibited, but it is not clear what supporting or opposing a political party means. Civil society organizations, that is, organizations that provide very critical safety nets for political actors in the run up to elections, either through the provision of legal aid or socio-medical assistance, voter education, mobilization of new entries to the voters’ row, election monitoring and/or observation, are considered ‘political’ under the proposed bill and are worried that their interventions may be misconstrued as support to political parties.  
Civil society has presented oral and written submissions, including the ‘CSOs’ Consolidated Analysis of the PVO Bill’, highlighting their concerns to the Parliament Legal Committee, Parliament Portfolio Committee on Public Service. On 11 April 2022 civil society met with the Minister of Justice during a consultative meeting and the Minister addressed parliament agreeing to introduce various amendments. The proposed amendments which the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare brought back to Parliament are worse than the first with provisions that introduced additional, excessively punitive, criminal and civil penalties for noncomplying PVOs, as well as individual liability for trustees, employees and managers of PVOs, and anyone involved in the control of a PVO, including members of the public.

On July 25, Pope Francis (Jorge Mario Bergoglio) offered a long-overdue apology to survivors. The Pope’s words and visit to Canada  raise strong emotions and traumas for many people. They will be heard and received differently by those with lived experiences. As a human rights organization, our thoughts are with the many children who never made it home and their families who still grieve for them.    
We acknowledge that this is a historic moment for many Indigenous peoples, including Indigenous Catholics, for whom the visit and apology is an important part of their healing. It is up to them as individuals and communities to determine whether they accept it and to chart the way forward in the weeks and months ahead.  
As a number of people have said, including Murray Sinclair, Cindy Blackstock, the Keepers of the Water, Ellen Gabriel and others, an apology alone is not enough; it is an empty gesture unless it is accompanied by real actions, transparency, accountability and redress.   
Settlers may use this time to reflect on and support the remarkable work Indigenous peoples and communities are doing in their search for truth and justice to gather and analyze evidence, support survivors, and lobby nationally and internationally for recognition and restitution.   
For its part, the Canadian government and other institutions such as the RCMP also have long way to go to delivering on the Truth & Reconciliation Commission’s 94 Calls to Action. Amnesty International continues to urge Canada to act on these and other recommendations without delay, including those from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls’ 231 Calls for Justice.   
The complex process of genuine reconciliation in Canada cannot take place without truth and without an end to ongoing acts of colonial violence. Canada must not use the Papal visit and apology as a pretense to cover up its own responsibility for the laws and policies created to eradicate Indigenous cultures, languages, and Nations, and break children’s connections to their Indigenous identities.

His conviction is based solely on social media posts criticizing human rights violations in Egypt and the state’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Verdicts by ESSCs cannot be appealed. Ahmed Samir Santawy is a prisoner of conscience, who has been arbitrarily detained since February 2021, and he should be immediately and unconditionally released.  
The court reduced his prison sentence from four to three years’ imprisonment. Proceedings in front of the ESSCs are inherently unfair and its verdicts cannot be appealed, they are only subject to authorization by the president.   
After President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ordered Ahmed Samir Santawy’s retrial on 16 February 2022, a new trial started on 21 February 2022, again in front of an ESSC. His right to a fair trial was violated throughout both proceedings, including his right to have the conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal and to have adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence, since his lawyers were not allowed to meet with him in private throughout the pre-trial and trial proceedings. His conviction on retrial is solely based on social media posts criticizing human rights violations in Egyptian prisons and the state’s mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic that he denied writing. Regardless of the author of the posts, criminalizing the dissemination of information based on vague concepts such as “false news” is contrary to the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by the Egyptian constitution and international human rights law.   
Ahmed Samir Santawy is held in Mazraet Tora prison, part of the Tora Prison Complex south of Cairo, in a small windowless cell he shares with another prisoner. When his family last saw him on 16 July 2022, he complained of a high fever and recurrent vomiting for days, amid reports about the renewed spread of Covid-19 in the prison and the closure of the prison hospital. Amnesty International learned from informed sources that authorities have not transferred him, or other ill prisoners held in the Tora Prison Complex, to outside hospitals in recent weeks.

Ahmed Samir Santawy is a researcher and a student of anthropology at the Central European University in Vienna, Austria. His research focused on the history of reproductive rights in Egypt. He was arrested on 1 February 2021, while on vacation in Egypt, and has been arbitrarily detained since. Following his arrest, he was subjected to enforced disappearance for five days before appearing before the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), a special branch of the Public Prosecution responsible for prosecuting crimes that relate to “state security”. The SSSP initially ordered his detention pending investigations in Case No.65/2021 over unfounded terrorism-related accusations, on the basis of secret investigations by the National Security Agency (NSA) that neither he nor his lawyers have been allowed to examine. On 22 May 2021, the SSSP opened a new criminal investigation against him under Case No.774/2021 and referred him to trial on 28 May 2021 in the new case.  
During the hearing on 22 May 2021 before the SSSP, Ahmed Samir Santawy told prosecutors that he had been beaten the previous day by the deputy warden of Liman Tora prison. His lawyers requested his transfer to the Forensic Medical Authority to examine his injuries. The family of Zyad el- Elaimy, a former parliamentarian and human rights lawyer arbitrarily detained in Liman Tora solely for his peaceful political activities, also lodged a complaint with the public prosecutor about prison officials’ beating him and Ahmed Samir Santawy on 21 May 2021. On 25 May 2021, the Ministry of Interior denied the allegations which it attributed to media channels supportive of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. No investigations have been conducted into these claims, as well as Ahmed Samir Santawy’s previous complaints to prosecutors of being subjected to enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment following his arrest on 1 February 2021 by the NSA.  
Ahmed Samir Santawy went on a hunger strike for 40 days in June 2021 in protest against his original conviction on 22 June 2021. On 28 January 2022, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) found that the Egyptian government had arbitrarily detained Ahmed Samir Santawy in violation of international human rights law and called for his immediate release.  
The inability to appeal verdicts by emergency courts denies defendants a critical guarantee for a fair trial to have their conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal. The conviction of Ahmed Samir Santawy over social media posts by an exceptional court sends a chilling message on the erosion of rule of law in Egypt, and the use of such courts as a tool of repression. In the months leading up to the lifting the state of emergency in Egypt in October 2021, the SSSP referred dozens of opposition politicians, human rights defenders and activists, including Abdelmoneim Aboulfouttoh, Ezzat Ghoneim, Alaa Abdel Fattah, Zyad el-Elaimy, Mohamed Baker and Mohamed Radwan “Oxygen” to trials in front of the ESSCs. Since October 2021, ESSCs convicted dozens of political opponents, critics and human rights defenders, sentencing them to between three and 15 years’ imprisonment after grossly unfair trials.  Article 19 of the law governing the state of emergency stipulates that ongoing trials are to continue even after the state of emergency is no longer in force.  
Blanket prohibitions on the dissemination of information, based on vague and ambiguous concepts such as “false news” or “spreading misinformation”, are incompatible with international human rights law and standards since they do not meet the principles of necessity and proportionality. The UN Human Rights Committee has stated that general prohibitions of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of events contravene article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Egypt is a party. Under international law, detention is arbitrary even if allowed by national law if it results from the exercise of human rights or is on the basis of unfair proceedings.

Soon after they took control of the country’s government, the Taliban said they were committed to upholding the rights of women and girls. Yet they have violated women’s and girls’ rights to education, work and free movement; demolished the system of protection and support for women and girls fleeing domestic violence; arbitrarily detained women and girls for infractions of the Taliban’s discriminatory rules; and contributed to a surge in the rates of child, early and forced marriage in Afghanistan. Women who peacefully protested against these restrictions and policies have been harassed, threatened, arrested, forcibly disappeared, detained and tortured. 
For women in Afghanistan, it’s death in slow motion. 
The scope, magnitude and severity of the Taliban’s violations against women and girls are increasing month by month. Within a year of its takeover of Afghanistan, the group’s draconian policies are depriving millions of women and girls of the opportunity to lead safe, free and fulfilling lives. They are being sentenced, as one Afghan woman put it, to death in slow motion. This death sentence for Afghan women and girls can only be lifted by major and wide-ranging policy changes by Taliban. The international community must urgently develop and implement a robust, coordinated and effective strategy that pressures the Taliban to bring about these changes.   
Amnesty International conducted research on the situation of women and girls under Taliban rule from September 2021 to June 2022, interviewing a total of 90 Afghan women and 11 girls. The ages of these women and girls ranged from 14 to 74 years old, and they lived in 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Amnesty International also interviewed six current or former staff members of Taliban-run detention centres; 22 staff members of national and international NGOs and UN agencies and mechanisms; and 10 Afghan and international experts and journalists. The research was conducted through in-person interviews in Afghanistan from 4 to 20 March 2022, as well as through remote interviews. 
This report describes a web of interrelated restrictions and prohibitions in which Afghan women and girls are trapped. It shows how the Taliban’s violation of any single right can have pernicious implications for the exercise of other rights. Cumulatively, Taliban policies form a system of repression that discriminates against women and girls in Afghanistan in almost every aspect of their lives. 
On 1 July 2022, Amnesty International communicated the key findings detailed in this report in letters addressed to Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Muttaqi and Minister of Labor and Social Affairs Abdul Wali. No response had been received as of 15 July 2022, when the report was finalized. 
Since their takeover, the Taliban have issued a series of policies, decrees and guidelines that violate the human rights of women and girls in Afghanistan, including those related to education, work, free movement and clothing. 
In the area of education, the Taliban have prevented the vast majority of girls at the secondary level from returning to school. The Taliban called girls at the secondary level to return to school on 23 March 2022, only to send them home the same day, citing a “technical issue” related to their uniforms. Fatima, a 25-year-old high school teacher based in Nangarhar province, summarized the feelings of her students: “These young girls just wanted to have a future, and now they don’t see any future ahead of them… There are millions of Afghan girls waiting for action.” 
At the university level, the Taliban’s harassment of female students as well as restrictions on students’ behaviour, dress and opportunities have contributed to an unsafe environment where female students are systematically disadvantaged compared to male students. As a result, many female students have either stopped attending or decided not to enrol in university. Other challenges affect girls’ and women’s access to education at all levels, including restrictions on their movement, teacher shortages and students’ lack of motivation due to limited career options under the Taliban. 
The Taliban have prevented women across Afghanistan from working. Most female government employees have been told to stay at home, with the exception those working in certain sectors such as health and education. In the private sector, many women have been dismissed from high-level positions. The Taliban’s policy appears to be that they will allow only women who cannot be replaced by men to keep working. Women who have continued working told Amnesty International that they are finding it extremely difficult in the face of Taliban restrictions on their clothing and behaviour, such as the requirement for female doctors to avoid treating male patients or interacting with male colleagues. 
Taliban restrictions on work have created a desperate situation for many women who were their families’ sole or primary wage-earner. For instance, Farida, an office worker, said: “When Nangarhar collapsed, the office was closed down… because men and women can’t work together… [My family] spent two weeks without food in our household. Previously, I couldn’t even think that we wouldn’t have food on the table.” 
Taliban restrictions on women’s and girls’ freedom of movement have become increasingly repressive. Initially, they ordered women and girls to be accompanied by a mahram, or male chaperone, for long- distance journeys. Most recently, they decreed that women should not leave their homes unless necessary. Women and girls told Amnesty International that in light of the numerous and evolving restrictions on their movement, any appearance in public without a mahram carried serious risks. They also said that the mahram requirements made their daily lives almost impossible to manage. 
The Taliban have enforced increasingly strict guidelines on permissible clothing for women and girls. On 7 May 2022, the Ministry of Vice and Virtue issued a decree requiring women to cover themselves fromhead to toe. Male family members were made responsible for women’s adherence to the new rules, and can be detained if women and girls in the family refuse to comply. Zainab, a 27-year-old woman based in Daikundi province, shared her reaction to the decree: “Why would we cover our faces and hide who we are?… I have worn a [head scarf] all my life, but I do not want to cover my face… I can’t breathe now that I’m trying to talk about covering my face.” 
Before August 2021, women and girl survivors of gender-based violence had access to a nationwide network of shelters and services, including legal representation, medical care and psychosocial support. Specialized prosecution units and courts dealt with cases involving violence against women and girls. While the system had its limitations, it served thousands of women and girls each year. As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, this system collapsed. Shelters were closed, and many were looted and appropriated by members of the Taliban. In some cases, Taliban members harassed or threatened staff. As shelters closed, staff were forced to send many women and girl survivors back to their families. Other survivors were forced to live with shelter staff members, on the street or in other unsustainable situations. Incomprehensibly, as the Taliban advanced across the country, they also systematically released detainees from prisons, many of whom had been convicted of gender-based violence offenses.  
Survivors of gender-based violence and the women who worked within the system of protective services are now in grave danger. Meanwhile, women and girls who have fled violence since the Taliban’s takeover have nowhere to turn. Fariha was nine months pregnant when she spoke to Amnesty International. She was desperately seeking a safe place to live after escaping her husband’s abuse. “Before, there was a shelter, and I went to that place,” she said. “They said it’s not running now, and they can’t accept any new cases. There are no options for me now.”  
According to four individuals who worked in Taliban-run detention centres, the Taliban have arbitrarily arrested and detained women and girls for violating their discriminatory policies, such as the rules against appearing in public without a mahram or appearing in public with a man who does not qualify as a mahram. Those arrested have usually been charged with the vague and ambiguous “crime” of “moral corruption”. The four prison staff members also told Amnesty International that survivors of gender-based violence who were formerly based in the shelters are now being detained in the same two detention centres in Afghanistan. Women and girls arbitrarily detained due to alleged “moral corruption” or for fleeing abuse have been denied access to legal counsel and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment as well as inhuman conditions in detention. 
One university student was detained in 2022 on charges related to the Taliban’s mahram restrictions. She said that soon after her arrest, Taliban members “started giving me electric shocks [with a taser]… on my shoulder, face, neck, everywhere they could… They were calling me a prostitute [and] a bitch… The one holding the gun said, ‘I will kill you, and no one will be able to find your body.’” She said that like all women and girls detained by the Taliban, her detention would stigmatize her for life. “For an Afghan girl, going to prison is no less than death… Once you enter the door, you are labelled, and you cannot erase it.” 
According to Amnesty International’s research, corroborated by national and international organizations operating in Afghanistan, local activists and other experts, the rates of child, early and forced marriage in Afghanistan are surging under Taliban rule. This increase is due to several interrelated drivers, many of which are attributable to the actions and policies of the Taliban and its members since they seized control. The most common drivers include the economic and humanitarian crisis; the lack of educational and professional prospects for women and girls; families’ perceived need to protect their daughters from marriage with a Taliban member; families forcing women and girls to marry Taliban members; and Taliban members forcing women and girls to marry them. 
Khorsheed, a 35-year-old woman from a central province of Afghanistan, told Amnesty International that as a result of the economic crisis in Afghanistan, she had been forced to marry her 13-year-old daughter to her 30-year-old neighbour in September 2021, in exchange for a “bride price” of 60,000 Afghanis (around US$670). She said that after her daughter’s marriage, she felt relieved. “She won’t be hungry anymore,” Khorsheed said. She said she was considering marrying off her 10-year-old daughter as well, but she was reluctant to do so, as she hoped this daughter might provide for the family in the future. She explained, “She went all the way to fifth grade. I wanted her to study more. She would be able to read and write, and speak English, and earn… I have a hope that this daughter will become something, and she will support the family. Of course, if they don’t open the school, I will have to marry her off.”  
The systemic discrimination imposed by the Taliban has led to a wave of peaceful protests by women and girls across Afghanistan. The Taliban has violated the rights of these women and girls to freedom of expression, association and assembly, and subjected them to harassment and abuse during protests, including beating and electric shocks by tasers.   
On 30 May 2022, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Mutaqqi said, “In the past nine months, not a single woman has been imprisoned in the jails of Afghanistan either due to political opposition or raising voice against the government.” This is not true. Based on interviews with 12 women who were involved in protests after the Taliban’s takeover, five of whom were detained, Amnesty International has found that many women protesters in Afghanistan have been subjected to arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment.   
One woman who participated in several peaceful protests was arrested and detained for 10 days in 2022. She described her treatment during detention: “[The Taliban guards] kept coming to my room and showing me pictures of my family. They kept repeating… ‘We can kill them, all of them, and you won’t be able to do anything… Don’t cry, don’t make a scene. After protesting, you should have expected days like this.’”   
She said that while in detention, she was severely beaten on two occasions. “They locked the door,” she said. “They started screaming at me… [One Taliban member] said, ‘You nasty woman… America isn’t giving us the money because of you bitches’… Then he kicked me. It was so strong that my back was injured, and he kicked my chin too… I still feel the pain in my mouth. It hurts whenever I want to talk.” 
Women protesters who were detained by the Taliban said they had inadequate access to food, water, ventilation, sanitary products and medical care. To secure their release, the women were forced to sign “agreements” that they and their family members would neither protest again nor speak publicly about their experiences during detention. 
The Taliban, as the de facto authorities of Afghanistan, must uphold the rights of women and girls to access education, work, and move freely, as well as the right to access support and legal redress after fleeing violence. The Taliban must also immediately cease practices of arbitrary arrest and detention, and protect the right of all people, including women and girls, to protest peacefully. The Taliban is depriving millions of women and girls of rights enshrined in international law, and they must urgently change course. 
Our rights are your rights… You must support the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan. 
Jamila, the principal of a primary and secondary school, told Amnesty International: “[The world] doesn’t hear or see what is happening to us, because they are not affected themselves. Only if this happened to them would they understand.” The international community must demonstrate to Afghan women and girls that it understands their plight. States and international organizations must send a clear, coordinated and resounding message to the Taliban that their current policies on women and girls will never be accepted and take concrete steps that impose consequences on the Taliban for their conduct. Such steps should include identifying and using forms of leverage that may influence the Taliban without harming the Afghan people, such as targeted sanctions or travel bans applied through a UN Security Council Resolution. 
For their part, donor states must urgently address the humanitarian and economic crisis unfolding in Afghanistan, which they had a role in creating, and which also undermines the rights of women and girls. 
Donor states must ease existing financial restrictions on Afghanistan, which are blocking the provision of healthcare, food and other essential services. They must also strengthen systems for the equitable and adequate distribution of urgent financial support and humanitarian aid in consultation with UN agencies, NGOs and humanitarian agencies operating in Afghanistan, local women activists, and organizations supporting other at-risk groups.   
The stakes could not be higher. If the international community fails to act, it will abandon millions of women and girls across Afghanistan and embolden others to undermine the human rights of women and girls around the world. As Sabira, a journalist, said, “Our rights are your rights… You must support the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.”

On 10 May, human rights defender Jeannot Randriamanana – who had been in arbitrary detention for two months- was granted provisional release. On 12 July, the Court of Appeal of Fianarantsoa upheld his conviction and two-year suspended sentence on the charges of “defamation and humiliation of members of Parliament and public servants and identity fraud”. Jeannot Randriamanana was convicted solely for the peaceful exercise of his right to freedom of expression when he denounced on Facebook the alleged mismanagement and embezzlement of humanitarian aid by several authority figures in the district of Nosy Varika, in east Madagascar.  
On 17 March, the Criminal Court of Mananjary sentenced Jeannot Randriamanana to two years of imprisonment for “defamation and humiliation of members of Parliament and public servants” (under article 20 of the 2014 Law 2014-006) and identity fraud (article 258 of the Penal Code). Jeannot Randriamanana was convicted simply for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression when he in late February denounced on social media the alleged mismanagement and embezzlement of humanitarian aid by several authority figures in the district of Nosy Varika, in east Madagascar, following the impact of cyclones, Batsirai and Emnati, that hit the country on 5 and 23 February respectively. On 21 March, his lawyers filed an appeal against the sentence.  
On 10 May, the Court of Appeal of Fianarantsoa granted provisional release to Jeannot Randriamanana – who had been in arbitrary detention for two months – and adjourned the hearing to 14 June. The Court then held the hearing on 14 June and issued the verdict on 12 July that upheld the current sentencing of two years of suspended prison term. Jeannot Randriamanana’s lawyers filed an appeal against the sentence before the Supreme Court of Madagascar (Cour de Cassation). The Supreme Court is yet to set a date for the appeal.

Additional information  
Jeannot Randriamanana is a 38-year-old public secondary school teacher living and working in Mananjary, in the region of Vatovavy, in the center east of Madagascar. He is a father of four children aged 18, 14, 9 and 4 years old. In addition to his work as a public schoolteacher, he also works as a communication officer for the local branch of the NGO, Independent Observatory of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in Madagascar (Observatoire Indépendant des Droits Economiques, Sociaux et Culturels à Madagascar – OIDESCM). He is passionate about human rights, mainly concerned with the right to information and good governance. He has been posting on his social media about the poor state of school infrastructure in the district of Nosy Varika since December 2021. In December 2021, he exposed that he had been targeted for harassment and intimidation for denouncing cases of corruption on his social media account. Jeannot mentioned that he has received threatening messages on his Facebook from anonymous profiles.  
Cyclones Batsirai and Emnati hit Madagascar on 5 and 23 February 2022. They resulted in landfalls in the districts of Nosy Varika and Mananjary, prompting a global call for international humanitarian aid. At the end of February 2022, Jeannot Randriamanana, started to denounce on social media that the local population had not received any of the humanitarian aid promised by the local authorities.  
On 2 March, the Public Prosecutor brought charges against Jeannot Randriamanana for defamation and humiliation of members of Parliament and public servants and identity fraud. He was also charged with fraudulent use of the function of a journalist (identity fraud), solely for having shared information on his social media, as he never claimed to be a journalist. He was arrested on the same day and provisionally released two months later, on 10 May.  
Amnesty International is concerned about the Court of Appeal of Fianarantsoa’s decision to uphold Jeannot Randriamanana’s conviction as it reinforces a pattern of harassment and judicial persecution of whistleblowers and human rights defenders in Madagascar. The Malagasy authorities misuse the criminal justice system to keep the accused whistleblowers and human rights defenders in judicial limbo. Thus, their human rights are severely restricted, including the rights to work and movement. Clovis Razafimalala, an environmental human rights defender who repeatedly denounced the illegal trafficking of rosewood and other timber in Madagascar, has been a victim of intimidation and harassment by Malagasy authorities since 2016, with no closure on the case.  
This is all part of a wider pattern of harassment and intimidation of whistleblowers and human rights defenders and repression of the rights to freedom of expression and information in Madagascar. However, whistleblowing is essential for any country that is genuinely committed to transparency, accountability and respect for human rights and the rule of law.

Since they took control of the country in August 2021, the Taliban have violated women’s and girls’ rights to education, work and free movement; decimated the system of protection and support for those fleeing domestic violence; detained women and girls for minor violations of discriminatory rules; and contributed to a surge in the rates of child, early and forced marriage in Afghanistan.

The report, Death in Slow Motion: Women and Girls Under Taliban Rule, also reveals how women who peacefully protested against these oppressive rules have been threatened, arrested, detained, tortured, and forcibly disappeared. 
This suffocating crackdown against Afghanistan’s female population is increasing day-by-day 
“Less than one year after the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan, their draconian policies are depriving millions of women and girls of their right to lead safe, free and fulfilling lives,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Taken together, these policies form a system of repression that discriminates against women and girls in almost every aspect of their lives. Every daily detail – whether they go to school, if and how they work, if and how they leave the house – is controlled and heavily restricted. 
“This suffocating crackdown against Afghanistan’s female population is increasing day-by-day. The international community must urgently demand that the Taliban respect and protect the rights of women and girls.” 
Amnesty International is calling on the Taliban to implement major policy changes and measures to uphold the rights of women and girls. Governments and international organizations, including all UN member states and the UN Security Council, must urgently develop and implement a robust and coordinated strategy that pressures the Taliban to bring about these changes. 
Amnesty International researchers visited Afghanistan in March 2022. The comprehensive investigation was conducted from September 2021 to June 2022, and includes interviews with 90 Afghan women and 11 girls, aged between 14 and 74 years old, living in 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. 
Since seizing control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have been the country’s de facto authorities. Despite initial public commitments to uphold the rights of women and girls, the Taliban introduced policies of systematic discrimination that violate their rights. 
Women and girls across Afghanistan reacted to this crackdown with a wave of protests. In response, the Taliban targeted protesters with harassment and abuse, arbitrary arrest and detention, enforced disappearance, and physical and psychological torture. 
Amnesty International interviewed one protester who was arrested and detained for several days in 2022. Describing her treatment in detention, she told Amnesty International: “[The Taliban guards] kept coming to my room and showing me pictures of my family. They kept repeating… ‘We can kill them, all of them, and you won’t be able to do anything… Don’t cry, don’t make a scene. After protesting, you should have expected days like this’.” 
She also described being severely beaten: “They locked the door. They started screaming at me… [One Taliban member] said, ‘You nasty woman… America is not giving us the money because of you bitches’… Then he kicked me. It was so strong that my back was injured, and he kicked my chin too… I still feel the pain in my mouth. It hurts whenever I want to talk.” 
A soldier who was walking next to me hit me in my breast, and he said, ‘I can kill you right now, and no one would say anything’ 
Two women said that after photos were posted of a fellow protester’s injuries on social media, Taliban members developed a new strategy to prevent them from showing their injuries publicly. 
One of the women told Amnesty International: “We were beaten on our breasts and between the legs. They did this to us so that we couldn’t show the world. A soldier who was walking next to me hit me in my breast, and he said, ‘I can kill you right now, and no one would say anything’. This happened every time we went out: we were insulted – physically, verbally, and emotionally.” 
Detained protesters had inadequate access to food, water, ventilation, sanitary products and health care. To secure their release, the women were forced to sign agreements that they and their family members would neither protest again, nor speak publicly about their experiences in detention. 
According to four whistleblowers from Taliban-run detention centres, the Taliban has increasingly arrested and detained women and girls for minor violations of their discriminatory policies, such as the rule against appearing in public without a mahram [male chaperone] or with a man who does not qualify as a mahram. Those arrested are usually charged with the ambiguous ‘crime’ of ‘moral corruption’. 
A prison staff member explained: “Sometimes they bring the boys and girls from the coffee shop… [Or] if they see a woman who is not with a mahram, she can be arrested… Before these kinds of cases were not in the prison… The numbers are increasing each month.” 
One university student, who was detained in 2022, told Amnesty International that she was threatened and beaten after being arrested on charges related to the mahram restrictions. 
She said that Taliban members “started giving me electric shocks… on my shoulder, face, neck, everywhere they could… They were calling me a prostitute [and] a bitch… The one holding the gun said, ‘I will kill you, and no one will be able to find your body’.” 
The whistleblowers said that survivors of gender-based violence, who previously lived in shelters or who attempted to flee abuse after the Taliban’s takeover, are now being imprisoned in detention centres. One of the staff members said: “Some came by approaching the Taliban themselves, and asking, ‘Where is your shelter?’ [The Taliban] had no place, so they ended up in prison.” 
These women and girls have been subjected to solitary confinement, beatings and other forms of torture, and forced to endure inhumane conditions, including overcrowding and inadequate access to food, water, and heating in winter months. 
According to Amnesty International’s research – corroborated by national and international organizations operating in Afghanistan, local activists and other experts – the rates of child, early and forced marriage in Afghanistan are surging under Taliban rule. The key causal factors for the increase include the economic and humanitarian crisis; the lack of educational and professional prospects for women and girls; families forcing women and girls to marry Taliban members; and Taliban members forcing women and girls to marry them. 
Stephanie Sinclair, director of Too Young to Wed, an organization working on child, early and forced marriage, explained: “In Afghanistan, it’s a perfect storm for child marriage. You have a patriarchal government, war, poverty, drought, girls out of school – with all of these factors combined… we knew child marriage was going to go through the roof.” 
Khorsheed*, a 35-year-old from a central province of Afghanistan, told Amnesty International that the economic crisis compelled her to marry off her 13-year-old daughter to a 30-year-old neighbour in September 2021, in exchange for a ‘bride price’ of 60,000 Afghanis (around US$670). She said that after her daughter’s marriage, she felt relieved and added: “She won’t be hungry anymore.” 
Khorsheed said she was also considering marrying off her 10-year-old daughter, but was reluctant to do so, as she hoped this daughter might provide for the family in the future. She explained: “I wanted her to study more. She would be able to read and write, and speak English, and earn… I have a hope that this daughter will become something, and she will support the family. Of course, if they don’t open the school, I will have to marry her off.” 
The Taliban continue to block education for the vast majority of secondary school girls. Their scheduled return to school on 23 March 2022 was short-lived. Later the same day, the Taliban sent the girls home, citing a “technical issue” related to their uniforms. Four months later, the Taliban continues to deny girls’ access to education. 
Fatima*, a 25-year-old high school teacher based in Nangarhar province, told Amnesty International: “These young girls just wanted to have a future, and now they don’t see any future ahead of them.” 
At university level, the Taliban’s harassment of female students – as well as restrictions on students’ behaviour, dress and opportunities – has created an unsafe environment where female students are systematically disadvantaged. Many female students have now either stopped attending, or decided not to enrol in university at all. 
Brishna*, a 21-year-old student at Kabul University, told Amnesty International: “[The] guards outside the university yell at us and say, ‘Fix your clothes, your scarf… Why are your feet visible?’… [The] head of our department came to our class and told us, ‘Be careful – we can only protect you when you are inside the faculty building… If Taliban members try to harm you or harass you, we won’t be able to stop them’.” 
Amnesty International is calling for international community to impose consequences on the Taliban for their conduct, such as targeted sanctions or travel bans applied through a UN Security Council Resolution, or employ other forms of leverage that can hold the Taliban accountable for their treatment of women and girls without harming the Afghan people. 
“The Taliban are deliberately depriving millions of women and girls of their human rights, and subjecting them to systematic discrimination,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“If the international community fails to act, it will be abandoning women and girls in Afghanistan, and undermining human rights everywhere.”

“These executions amount to arbitrary deprivation of lives and are another example of Myanmar’s atrocious human rights record. The four men were convicted by a military court in highly secretive and deeply unfair trials. The international community must act immediately as more than 100 people are believed to be on death row after being convicted in similar proceedings.”   
These executions amount to arbitrary deprivation of lives and are another example of Myanmar’s atrocious human rights record. 
“For more than a year now, Myanmar’s military authorities have engaged in extrajudicial killings, torture and a whole gamut of human rights violations. The military will only continue to trample on people’s lives if they are not held accountable.”   
“At a time when more and more countries take steps to abolish the death penalty, the resumption of executions after more than three decades not only puts it at odds with the global trend, but is also contrary to the goal of abolition enshrined under international human rights law and standards. Myanmar’s isolation could not be any more glaring. We urge the authorities to immediately establish a moratorium on executions as a first critical step.”  
Background:  
According to Myanmar state media, four executions have been carried out.   
Phyo Zeya Thaw, a former member of Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, and prominent democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu, also known as Ko Jimmy, were convicted of and sentenced to death by a military tribunal in January for offenses involving explosives, bombings and financing terrorism under the Anti-Terrorism Law – charges that Amnesty International believes to be politically motivated. Two other men, Hla Myo Aung and Aung Thura Zaw, convicted of the alleged murder of a woman believed to act as an informer for the military in Hlaing Tharyar in Yangon, also had their death sentences confirmed.   
All four were named in the report in state-run newspaper Global New Light of Myanmar.  
The proceedings before a military-controlled court were secretive and grossly unfair.   
Following Myanmar military’s issuance of Martial Law Order 3/2021, the authority to try civilians was transferred to special or existing military tribunals where individuals are tried through summary proceedings without right to appeal.  
These courts oversee a wide range of offences including those punishable with the death penalty.  
Under international law and standards, executions carried out following unfair trials violate the prohibition against arbitrary deprivation of life, as well as the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment.  
Myanmar’s last known execution was in the late 1980s. Since the military coup in February 2021, Amnesty International has recorded an alarming increase in the resort to the death penalty in Myanmar, where it has become a tool for the military in the ongoing persecution, intimidation and harassment of all who dare to challenge the authorities.   
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty unconditionally, in all cases and under any circumstances. More than two-thirds of countries all over the world have abolished the punishment in law or practice.

“In charging these 92 members of the Ukrainian armed forces in proceedings that lack transparency and rely on, and seek to feed, misinformation, the Russian authorities have once again revealed their brazen disregard for international fair trial rights and international humanitarian law. 
“The Geneva Conventions clearly state that prisoners of war, including members of armed forces, are protected from prosecution for taking part in hostilities. If individuals are to be charged with alleged crimes against humanity, there must be sufficient evidence to support such a claim. The Russian authorities have shared no evidence to support these charges. Instead, they deployed disinformation blaming Ukrainian forces for acts such as the destruction of the Mariupol theatre, a civilian building shattered by a deliberate Russian attack. 
“If the Russian authorities try prisoners of war on these charges, they will violate the Third Geneva Convention. Willfully depriving a prisoner of war of fair trial rights constitutes a war crime. The Russian authorities must only prosecute prisoners of war if there is genuine, admissible evidence of war crimes or crimes against humanity, in which case they must be afforded their right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards.” 
Background 
Alexander Bastrykin, the head of Russia’s Investigative Committee, told government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta on Monday that Russian authorities had enacted more than 1,300 criminal investigations against more than 400 Ukrainian nationals. He added that at least 220 individuals are suspected of committing “crimes against the peace and security of humanity”, while 92 members of the Ukrainian forces have reportedly already been charged. 
The news follows a case in early June when a separatist “court” in Russia-occupied Donetsk ordered the death of two captured British nationals and a captured Moroccan national. 
Ukraine is also carrying out investigations into tens of thousands of war crimes, and war-related crimes, allegedly committed by Russian soldiers. The speed of at least one such trial, which resulted in May in the conviction of Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old Russian soldier who killed a 62-year-old civilian in the first days of the war, has raised concerns over fair trial rights.

The individuals, who are Syrian and Palestinian refugees, have no food or safe drinking water and report that two of the children are sick and the woman with diabetes is in need of urgent medical care. Despite interim measures issued by the European Court of Human Rights last week, the group has not yet been rescued. The Greek authorities must urgently rescue them and provide support, health care, access to asylum procedures in Greece and protection from non-refoulement.   
The refugees told the Greek Council and HumanRights360 – the two organizations representing them –   that they have no access to food, safe drinking water, medical attention and means to keep warm during the night. Two of the pregnant women are in advanced stages of pregnancy. In recent days, they reported in desperation their hunger and thirst and that two of the children are sick and the woman with diabetes is in need of urgent medical care.    
On 20 July 2022, the European Court of Human Rights issued interim measures requesting the Greek authorities not to remove the group of refugees from Greece and to provide them with” food, water and adequate medical care as needed until further notice”.

According to information received from the Greek Council for Refugees and HumanRights360 who represented the 50 refugees before the European Court of Human Rights, the Orestiada Police Directorate informed them that they could not trace the group. The organization has been informed that the authorities have been provided with the group’s coordinates.  
The people stranded also reported to the two organizations that yesterday Arab-speaking individuals appeared and threatened them and told them to return to Turkey. Additionally, in the past few days, the group   told the two organizations that the 70-year-old woman with diabetes requires urgent medical assistance, one of the children has a fever and suffered from nose bleeds, and a second child fainted from the heat and hunger.   
Currently, violent pushbacks remain rampant at Greece’s borders and go unpunished while the criminalization of aid groups that try to help victims of pushbacks continues. In June 2021, through the testimonies of 16 victims, Amnesty International reported 21 incidents of group pushbacks to Turkey in 2020, conducted by individuals appearing to belong to law enforcement and individuals in civilian or unmarked clothing. The incidents were estimated to have affected around 1,000 people. Many victims experienced arbitrary detention and ill-treatment, in some cases amounting to torture. None of those interviewed had the opportunity to seek asylum or to challenge their return. The research, consistent with evidence from other reputable actors, showed that pushbacks were Greece’s de facto policy of border management.

In the early hours on Friday, a massive joint operation by the military, police and special forces forcefully removed protestors sleeping in tents at a peaceful protest site established in Colombo in April this year. Protestors were beaten and assaulted. The area was blocked, preventing access to media, lawyers and activists. According to reports, more than 50 were injured and 9 people have been arrested. 
Amnesty International strongly condemns the pre-dawn attack by security forces on peaceful protestors at Galle Face. It is shameful that the new government resorted to such violent tactics within hours of coming to power.  
“Amnesty International strongly condemns the pre-dawn attack by security forces on peaceful protestors at the iconic protest site ‘GotaGoGama’ at Galle Face. It was the main anti-government demonstration site and had drawn global attention to the dire situation faced by the people of Sri Lanka following the economic crisis in the country. It is shameful that the new government resorted to such violent tactics within hours of coming to power. The people’s right to protest needs to be respected. Any pending charges against those arrested for peacefully exercising their right must be immediately dropped,” said Kyle Ward, Amnesty International’s Deputy Secretary General. 
“The protesters have a right to demonstrate peacefully. Excessive use of force, intimidation and unlawful arrests seem to be an endlessly repetitive pattern in which the Sri Lankan authorities respond to dissent and peaceful assembly. These repressive actions clearly do not meet Sri Lanka’s obligations under international human rights law including with regard to people’s freedom of expression.” 
At around 01:00 local time (19:30 GMT Thursday), the military and police armed with riot gear violently descended on the protest camps, indiscriminately beating and assaulting everyone and everything in their way, dismantling the tents in which protestors had been sleeping for over three months. 
All access points to the protest site were blocked ahead of the raid. Eyewitness accounts and media reports say that the military attacked many protesters, especially those trying to film the developments. Soldiers broke apart ‘one tent after the other’ in the stretch leading to Presidential Secretariat and dismantled the protest site. 
An eyewitness interviewed by Amnesty International early morning of Friday at the attack site recounted, “There were about 200-300 demonstrators at that time, I would say. Suddenly (the forces) came out from (behind) the barricades and totally destroyed and broke down the tents. There were enough police and military to swamp the area. The police and especially the army beat up peaceful protesters.” 
“(The military) did these acts in anger. We saw some of the demonstrators engaged in (the protest) had brought their guitars. We saw them take those and smash it on iron fences. We saw them beat up people… The crackdown was brutal.” Video footage shared by media also show unarmed individuals/protesters being assaulted by security forces. 
(The military) did these acts in anger. We saw some of the demonstrators engaged in (the protest) had brought their guitars. We saw them take those and smash it on iron fences. We saw them beat up people… The crackdown was brutal. 
Eyewitness accounts suggest that the attack on protestors and their tents came as a complete surprise, even though there had been some rumours that there may be an attack. Protesters had been caught off-guard as they could not understand the reasons behind such an attack. There was no warning given to vacate the area by the military and police personnel before the use of brute force against the protestors. 
Another female eyewitness, who had been asleep at the protest site when it was raided, told Amnesty International, “At around 1.30 a.m. there was shouting (from other protestors) saying ‘they have surrounded us, they have surrounded us, get up, get up.’ When I went outside, I saw a large group of army people coming towards us. Some of them had covered their faces so I don’t know who they are… There was no announcement… They hadn’t told (us) to move out. Suddenly, they had started hitting the tents around us. They hit the youth the same way they hit the tents.” 
Amnesty International calls for an independent and impartial investigation into the incident. The perpetuators of the violence, and those who commanded the attack, must be identified and held accountable for their actions. 
They hadn’t told (us) to move out. Suddenly, they had started hitting the tents around us. They hit the youth the same way they hit the tents. 
The newspaper The Hindu reported that around 3.00 a.m. as news of the attack spread, media and activists reached the spot but were denied access as raids were ongoing. A security personnel stationed on Galle Road leading to the protest site reportedly said, “No one can go. Not even the media or lawyers.” 
A BBC video journalist was reportedly beaten by the military and his phone snatched by a solider and videos deleted. 
Lawyers who sought to intervene in their professional capacity were also reportedly prevented from doing so by security forces. At least two were reportedly assaulted. 
Several journalists and at least one lawyer has reportedly been detained. 
“Sri Lankan authorities must refrain from arresting people for exercising their right to peaceful assembly within sight and sound of the intended target of the protest’s claims. In addition any arrest must follow due process safeguards such as prompt access to legal counsel. We are very concerned by the human rights violations currently taking place in Sri Lanka as the authorities are using unlawful force and restrictions on movement in an attempt to quell dissent,” said Kyle Ward. 
No one can go. Not even the media or lawyers. 
The security personnel aggressively dismantled protesters’ tents put up at the demonstration site, including those of the deaf and mute community and soldiers with disabilities who had been part of the peaceful protests since April. 
‘I saw them hitting people on both sides and coming towards us. We ran the other way since they were chasing us… The deaf and mute demonstrators’ group had a very young translator with them. That group is usually in that area. No one knows what happened to them… no one could find them. At the ‘war heroes’ tent there was a small group of soldiers with disabilities, there were some monks in front as well… they had hit them also,” recounted an eyewitness to Amnesty International. 
Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in as President on Thursday after ex-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country last week. A new Prime minister took oath today. After a 100 days of protest, there was a pledge by the protestors to vacate parts of the protest site on Friday. But the military’s aggressive takeover of the protest site under cover of darkness less than 24 hours after the change in regime, is shocking. 
“We think what the government did, attacking a peaceful struggle was wrong,” said a protestor and an eyewitness to the Friday morning incident. 
We think what the government did, attacking a peaceful struggle was wrong. 
Amidst appeals to the international community to assist Sri Lanka, Amnesty International calls on the authorities to take action immediately to protect the rights of those peacefully protesting at GotaGoGama in Colombo and in other places in Sri Lanka. The charges against all the protesters must be dropped as they were detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights. 
“Justice and accountability from the Sri Lankan authorities is the need of the hour as Sri Lanka looks towards stability ahead of an IMF bailout to address the economic crisis. Amnesty has repeatedly called for restraint from security forces amidst the emergency regulations enforced in the country. Using them as a pretext for more human rights violations is deeply concerning and reflects poorly on the new administration in Sri Lanka. They must not lose their chance to start afresh and break off from the cycle of repression of people’s rights which further compounds the mistrust and fear in the people of Sri Lanka. Their right to peaceful protest must be protected,” said Kyle Ward.

He was falsely accused of communicating with foreign entities. Following his arrest, he was subjected to enforced disappearance for several weeks and then held incommunicado for at least three months. Amnesty International urges the Huthi de facto authorities to immediately release Younis Abdelsalam. Pending his release, they must ensure he is protected from torture and other ill-treatment and that he has access to legal representation, his family, and adequate healthcare.  
The 28-year-old, has been arbitrarily detained by the Huthi de facto authorities since 4 August 2021 in Sanaa, Yemen. He was held for one night in an underground cell in an unofficial detention centre next to Sanaa international airport before he was transferred to a Huthi-run security and intelligence detention centre in Sanaa. Younis Adbelsalam was subjected to enforced disappearance for several weeks. He was also held in solitary confinement for 80 days and in incommunicado detention for at least three months.  
 To date, he has not been charged nor has he appeared before a judge. His lawyer has not been allowed to visit him or speak to him since his arrest. According to his brother, Younis Abdelsalam was detained for peacefully opposing the authorities. He is accused of communicating with foreign entities but has not been formally charged.  
On 19 January 2022, his lawyer submitted a request to the Specialized Criminal Prosecution to release Younis Abdelsalam on the basis that his detention is arbitrary. A month later, the family paid bail to the security and intelligence apparatus for the release of Younis Abdelsalam but were informed that his case will be transferred to the public prosecutor instead.  
 Amnesty International reviewed a medical report which mentions that Younis Abdelsalam suffers from a mental health condition that requires regular medical follow up and treatment. He has been denied adequate healthcare throughout his detention. According to his brother who recently visited him, Younis Abdelsalam’s mental health has deteriorated due to his detention conditions.

Salutation: Dear Mohamed Abdelsalam  
 All parties to the conflict, including Huthi forces, the Yemeni government, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)-led coalition and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have carried out arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, harassment, torture and other ill-treatment, and unfair trials.  
In areas they control, Huthi forces arbitrarily arrested and detained critics and opponents as well as journalists, human rights defenders and members of the Baha’i community, subjecting scores to unfair trials, incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance. The majority of those targeted have been members or supporters of the political party, al-Islah.   
In May 2021, Amnesty International published a report, ‘Released and Exiled: Torture, unfair trials and forcible exile of Yemenis under Huthi rule’- an in-depth investigation into the experiences of a minority of non-fighters, including journalists, political opponents and Baha’i religious minority members, who were released as part of political deals in 2020 after being unlawfully detained and tortured for up to seven years. Upon their release, the Baha’is were forced into exile, with the United Nations (UN) facilitating their departure; eight other detainees were banished to other parts of the country.  
Conditions in Huthi-run prisons and detention centres, including mass overcrowding of detention cells, inadequate access to health care, sufficient food, clean water and sanitation, caused Covid-19 to spread, exposing detainees to substantial health risks. All parties failed to take measures to protect detainees and curb the spread of the virus in prisons and detention centers through the provision of masks or other hygiene products.  
The internationally recognized Yemeni government has also harassed, threatened and arbitrarily detained human rights defenders and other activists. UAE-backed Yemeni forces in southern Yemen conducted a campaign of arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances. In May 2018, Amnesty International detailed the cases of 51 men held in a network of secret prisons by UAE and Yemeni forces operating outside the command of Yemen’s government, including individuals detained between March 2016 and May 2018.

(British Columbia, July 21, 2022) – In a historic move, British Columbia’s Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, Mike Farnworth, announced today that the province will terminate its immigration detention contract with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). 
“Today’s decision is a momentous step. We commend British Columbia on being the first province to stop locking up refugee claimants and migrants in its jails solely on immigration grounds,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada (English Speaking). “This is a true human rights victory, one which upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life.” 
This is a true human rights victory, one which upholds the dignity and rights of people who come to Canada in search of safety or a better life. 
British Columbia’s landmark announcement came after the province concluded a review of its immigration detention contract. In the course of the review, the province received submissions from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International alongside a BC-based coalition of social justice, academic and grassroots organizations, advocates with lived experience in immigration detention, as well as healthcare providers, lawyers and academic scholars, and religious leaders across Canada. In June, the Vancouver City Council voted unanimously to urge the BC government to end immigration detention in the province’s jails. 
Over the past five years, CBSA has incarcerated hundreds of people on immigration grounds in British Columbia’s provincial jails. In a June 2021 report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented how people in Canadian immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. Canada is among the few countries in the global north with no legal limit on the duration of immigration detention, meaning people can be detained for months or years with no end in sight. 
People with psychosocial disabilities (or mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the immigration detention process. For example, CBSA policy indicates immigration detainees with psychosocial disabilities may be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated federal immigration holding centers in order to access “specialized care.” People from communities of color, and Black people in particular, appear to be incarcerated for longer periods in immigration detention and often in provincial jails instead of immigration holding centers. 
The #WelcomeToCanada campaign began in British Columbia in October 2021 and has since expanded to Quebec and Nova Scotia. British Columbia’s decision is a major milestone on the path to ending immigration detention in provincial jails in Canada, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. BC Corrections told Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International the province will give CBSA its 12-month written notice to terminate the immigration detention contract next week. 
“We are thrilled that BC has taken this historic step to eliminate some of the worst abuses in immigration detention,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “We urge other provinces and the federal government to follow suit by ending this harmful practice across the country, and to get on the path to abolishing immigration detention.”

“These horrific killings in Tole, allegedly at the hands of the Oromo Liberation Army, reveal its perpetrators’ utter disregard for human life 
Hundreds of people were killed and scores injured in an attack that survivors and victims’ family members say was committed by the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). 
The organization interviewed 10 people, including five eyewitnesses as well as survivors, victims’ family members and a local official. Interviewees consistently recounted summary killings, burning of homes and looting. Satellite imagery analysis by the organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab also corroborates claims that fires erupted in villages in Tole Kebele on 18 June. 
“These horrific killings in Tole, allegedly at the hands of the Oromo Liberation Army, reveal its perpetrators’ utter disregard for human life. This callous massacre, which also saw women and children lose their lives, must be independently and effectively investigated,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“Ethiopian authorities must leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the perpetrators of these killings are brought to justice in fair trials.” 
‘They suddenly came and attacked us’ 
The attack began at around 9am on 18 June after many adults in the area had left home to work on farms or take care of other business, according to nine witnesses who told Amnesty International they were in Tole or on the outskirts of the area as the attack unfolded. Witnesses said OLA forces surrounded villages in the locality, before a gunshot signaled the start of the attack. Most of those who had stayed behind in the villages were mothers and children who were unable to flee the attackers. 
All of the witnesses Amnesty International interviewed said they lost multiple relatives in the massacre, most of whom were women and children. 
Jamila*, who survived the attack after sustaining bullet wounds, told Amnesty International that: “I was on the farm ploughing around 9 am when they suddenly came and attacked us. They hit me with bullets, and they slaughtered my husband. I was lying among six dead bodies until I was rescued. They slaughtered my husband with banga. The others were killed with banga and bullet.” 
This callous massacre, which also saw women and children lose their lives, must be independently and effectively investigated 
Hussein*, a 64-year-old relative of victims in the attack, told Amnesty International he lost 22 children and grandchildren. He said he ran for his life when the shooting started, as the women and children stayed at home assuming they would be spared. He said: “They killed 42 people at one place. There was only one adult male among them, the rest were women and children. We found their bodies piled up at one place. Among those dead were newborns. Among those 42, 22 of them are my children and grandchildren. One of my daughters died with her five children, the other one with four, the other with five, the other with two children, one newlywed daughter and one boy.” 
Jemal*, a local administration official, lost his three children and his wife, who was seven months pregnant. He said: “As I was searching [for] them on the street and [in] the bushes… I found 28 dead bodies in addition to my wife and children. I found them in the compound of the Silsaw Mosque.” 
He added: “At Chekorsa [neighborhood], 104 people were killed. Only five of them are male adults. The rest are women and children. At Silsaw neighborhood, 112 people were killed… many of the victims were children, even newborns and toddlers.” He said their bodies were riddled with bullets. 
Abdi*, a resident who was on his farm when the attack happened, said: “My farm is a bit far and I couldn’t return home since the attackers blocked the route to the village. I was watching from a nearby hill. The attack started around 8:30am and continued until around 3pm in our village. In other villages they stayed until 4 and 5pm.” 
According to witnesses, some residents who stayed in the villages were armed, but they were outnumbered by the OLA fighters and unable to defend themselves. Most of those killed were unarmed women and children. 
Witnesses said they knew the attackers were OLA fighters because of their distinctive long braided hair, their military camouflage, and because they spoke the Oromiffa language. They also said that the OLA had operated in the area for at least four years. 
A local administrative official interviewed by Amnesty International said at least 450 people were killed in the attack. 
‘They torched the house of my neighbour’ 
In addition to the mass killing of Amhara residents, OLA fighters also burned homes and looted cattle, cash and cereals from houses. 
Dawud* said he witnessed OLA forces attacking his neighbour: “They also torched the house of my neighbour [Shambel Mohammed] while the family with his children and grandchildren and others were inside (12 people in total). One of them was seven months pregnant and was with her two children. They were buried in the compound since they were completely charred.” 
Another witness, Abdi*, said the attackers looted four oxen and ETB 70,000 cash (approximately $1000USD) from his home. 
“This is not the first time that ethnic Amhara residents have been attacked in Oromia region. The Ethiopian government must protect ethnic Amhara in Oromia from unlawful killings and other human rights abuses,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Authorities failed to respond 
According to a local official interviewed by Amnesty International, the attack was immediately reported to district and zonal officials, who said they were unable to respond because the road was closed. 
Government forces did not intervene during the five-hour period in which the perpetrators killed residents and burned and pillaged homes in Tole, according to nine witnesses. Gimbi town, where the local district administration is based, is just 49kms away from Tole by road. 
Residents said government forces arrived hours after OLA fighters had left; survivors were already collecting the bodies of their relatives. 
The pervasive culture of impunity in Ethiopia is driving cycles of violence 
“The pervasive culture of impunity in Ethiopia is driving cycles of violence. The authorities must urgently order a credible and independent investigation into all atrocities committed in the country and facilitate access for the International Commission of Human Rights Experts established by the UN Human Rights Council,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Background 
The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) armed group splintered from the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) after the OLF entered politics in 2018. Government authorities refer to OLA as OLF Shane. Since 2018, there have been frequent armed confrontations between OLA forces and government forces in western and southern Oromia. 
Amnesty International has previously documented attacks on ethnic Amhara, allegedly carried out by OLA forces. However, OLA officials repeatedly rejected allegations of abuses by their forces including the attack in Tole and instead blame government forces.

“The emergency regulations brought into operation in the name of public security should not become a pretext for more human rights violations. Amnesty International is very concerned such regulations will serve as a springboard for further crackdown on people’s fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, right to personal security, liberty and freedom from arbitrary detention.” 
The emergency regulations brought into operation in the name of public security should not become a pretext for more human rights violations. 
“The emergency regulations give sweeping powers to the police and the armed forces to search and make arrests of ‘suspects’ without due process safeguards. It levies hefty penalties including life imprisonment for ordinary penal offences like causing ‘mischief’. Detainees can be kept in custody for up to seventy-two hours without being produced before a Magistrate and guaranteed access to lawyers. This prolonged period of custody without timely judicial oversight or the ability to challenge their detention heightens the risk for detainees to be subjected to torture or other ill-treatment.” 
“As the new President takes power, he must ensure the people of Sri Lanka can exercise their right to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly, including to express dissent and demand respect for their rights. Such emergency regulations have a chilling effect on society. It’s time for authorities in Sri Lanka to stand with its people and not repeat the mistakes of the past.” 
On 17 July 2022, a proclamation of emergency was brought into force by the then acting President of Sri Lanka. 
On 18 July 2022, Government of Sri Lanka issued notification under Public Security Ordinance for the Emergency (Miscellaneous Provisions and Powers) Regulations, 2022. The English translation for same was posted online recently. 
On 20 July, upon the request of law enforcement authorities, a court in Colombo has issued an order prohibiting people from assembling in certain areas of what has been apeaceful protest site since April 2022. 
The Sri Lankan authorities have carried out a number of arrests of largely peaceful demonstrators since the beginning of the current wave of protests in Sri Lanka.

0,Myanmar: Military’s use of banned landmines in Kayah State amounts to war crimes,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/myanmar-militarys-use-of-banned-landmines-in-kayah-state-amounts-to-war-crimes/,"Inherently indiscriminate landmines kill and injure civilians Military laid landmines in homes, on farming lands and on church grounds Myanmar increasingly isolated globally in its use of antipersonnel landmines The Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying antipersonnel landmines on a...","The Myanmar military is committing war crimes by laying antipersonnel landmines on a massive scale in and around villages in Kayah (Karenni) State, Amnesty International said today after an on-the-ground investigation in conflict-affected parts of the state. 
Antipersonnel landmines are inherently indiscriminate and their use is internationally banned. The landmines laid by the Myanmar military have killed and seriously injured civilians and will have significant long-term consequences, including on displaced people’s ability to return home and to farm their lands. 
“The Myanmar military’s use of landmines is abhorrent and cruel. At a time when the world has overwhelmingly banned these inherently indiscriminate weapons, the military has placed them in people’s yards, homes, and even stairwells, as well as around a church,” said Matt Wells, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues. 
The Myanmar military’s use of landmines is abhorrent and cruel. 
“The world must urgently respond to the military’s atrocities against civilians across Myanmar. Countries around the world must cut off the flow of weapons to Myanmar and support all efforts to ensure those responsible for war crimes face justice.” 
From 25 June to 8 July, Amnesty International researchers interviewed 43 people in Kayah State’s Demoso, Hpruso, and Loikaw Townships. These areas have been at the centre of fighting between the military and Karenni armed groups since May 2021, when conflict in Kayah State re-ignited following the military coup.The organization interviewed landmine survivors and other witnesses, as well as health professionals who treated landmine injuries and people who had discovered and deactivated landmines in villages. It also visited several recently demined villages. 
The Myanmar military is laying several types of landmines that it manufactures itself. These include the M-14, which typically blows off the victim’s foot at the ankle, and the more powerful MM-2, which often blows off the victim’s leg at the knee and causes injuries to other parts of the person’s body, with severe risk of death due to blood loss. 
Antipersonnel landmines, including the M-14 and MM-2, are inherently indiscriminate and their use is banned under customary international humanitarian law, as well as the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which 164 states have joined. According to Landmine Monitor, Myanmar’s military is the only state armed forces confirmed to have used antipersonnel landmines in 2020-21. 
Lu Reh, 62, and his family were displaced from Daw Thea village in Demoso Township in late February 2022 after a Myanmar military air strike killed two people in a neighbouring village. On 10 June, he and others returned to collect things from their property. 
As he walked along a dirt path to collect jah fruit, Lu Reh stepped on a landmine that ripped off his right leg just below the knee, leaving the bone exposed at the calf. According to a witness and another person with direct knowledge of the incident, it also wounded his left leg and right hand and caused significant blood loss. Lu Reh died on the way to the hospital. 
The Myanmar military has controlled that area since February 2022 and soldiers from the 66th Light Infantry Division (LID) have based themselves out of several nearby villages. 
The Karenni Human Rights Group (KnHRG) has documented at least 20 civilians killed or seriously injured by landmines in Kayah State since June 2021. According to activists, local aid workers, and people without formal training who have tried to demine villages, the military’s use of landmines there has soared in recent months, especially as they retreat from certain areas. 
In early April 2022, Rosie, 52, and her daughter Ma Thein Yar Lin, 17, were trying to return to their home in Loikaw town after being displaced by fighting in January. Rosie parked their motorbike near a rocky path, and Ma Thein Yar Lin walked a short distance away to go to the bathroom. 
I heard the explosion, then I looked and saw a lot of smoke. I heard my daughter yelling, ‘Mama, Mama,’ and I went to look and saw her lying on the ground…my daughter had no leg anymore. 
“I heard the explosion, then I looked and saw a lot of smoke,” Rosie recalled. “I heard my daughter yelling, ‘Mama, Mama,’ and I went to look and saw her lying on the ground.” 
“I noticed that my daughter had no leg anymore… I went searching for [her leg], but the man who [was passing by and stopped] to help us said, ‘Stop! There will be another landmine. The most important thing is to stop the bleeding.’” 
Ma Thein Yar Lin lost her right leg from the mid-calf down and had landmine fragments throughout her left leg. She now uses a wheelchair donated by a friend. She and her mother cannot return to their home partly because the house and bathroom are not accessible. 
She told Amnesty International that she wants to continue her studies; she had reached Grade 11 before the Covid-19 pandemic and the coup stopped her schooling. She said she also wants to ensure her leg recovers so that she can be fitted with a quality prosthetic. 
On 27 June 2022, Amnesty International researchers visited St Matthew’s church in Daw Ngay Khu village in Hpruso Township. The military had planted at least eight landmines on church grounds in mid-June, when there was fighting in the area. 
Amnesty International photographed areas where landmines had been removed, including along the main entrance path and behind the church. People involved in demining the church believed there were more landmines there that had yet to be discovered. 
On the afternoon of 15 June, soldiers also burned down the church and the priest’s house next door. When Amnesty International researchers visited 12 days later, the grain stored in the priest’s house was still smouldering. 
A 41-year-old woman from Daw Ngay Khu told Amnesty International: “That church was the centre of our village. We worried about our things [when the military started coming], so we brought them to the church to keep [them] there. We thought the Myanmar military would not attack the church, that it was a hallowed place.” 
Researchers saw a discarded uniform of the 66th LID on the church grounds, along with bullet casings and a used round from a 40mm grenade launcher. 
Amnesty International previously implicated the 66th LID in war crimes and likely crimes against humanity in Kayah State, in a report published in June 2022. 
In addition to the church, Myanmar soldiers laid landmines in and near homes in Daw Ngay Khu village, according to six people who lived there as well as people who had demined parts of the village. Other areas of Daw Ngay Khu likely remain contaminated. 
Amnesty International received credible information that the Myanmar military has laid landmines in at least 20 villages in Hpruso, Demoso, and Loikaw Townships in recent months. There are likely many more contaminated villages across Kayah and southern Shan States. 
The military appears to be systematically laying landmines near where it is based as well as in areas from which it retreats. The region along the main road between Moe Bye in southern Shan State and Hpruso town in Kayah State is particularly contaminated. The military systematically burned homes in the same area from February to April 2022, as Amnesty International reported previously. 
Soldiers have placed landmines in people’s yards, at the entrance of homes, and outside toilets. In at least one documented case, soldiers boobytrapped a house stairwell with a trip-wire improvised explosive device (IED). They have also placed landmines on paths to rice fields, and credible evidence indicates that at least one civilian was seriously injured recently from stepping on a landmine when going to their field. 
Displaced civilians across these areas of Kayah State told Amnesty International that fighters from ethnic armed groups had warned them about the military’s use of landmines in their villages and said they should not go back. The warnings have helped to limit civilian casualties so far, but many people are desperate to see their property and to work their fields during the planting season. 
Paulina, 20, a teacher from Daw Ngay Khu village, said her house was damaged by a military mortar during fighting and that soldiers then based themselves in the village. She said: 
“Last year we could move back and forth and get things from our village. But this year we dare not go back… We are worried about landmines, because they plant them anywhere.” 
Limited demining is overwhelmingly being undertaken by members of armed groups, who do it by hand with only rudimentary equipment and without any professional training. Contamination remains widespread.The threat to lives and livelihoods posed by landmine contamination remains an issue in other parts of Myanmar where the military has engaged in conflict with armed groups. In 2017, Amnesty International documented several incidents of landmines injuring Rohingya women, men and children along the border of Myanmar’s Rakhine State and Bangladesh. 
The military’s depraved use of landmines in homes and villages will continue to have devastating effects on civilians in Kayah State for years to come. 
“The military’s depraved use of landmines in homes and villages will continue to have devastating effects on civilians in Kayah State for years to come. We know from bitter experience that civilian deaths and injuries will mount over time, and the widespread contamination is already blocking people from returning to their homes and farmland,” said Rawya Rageh, Senior Crisis Adviser at Amnesty International.“Myanmar’s military leadership should immediately end its use of landmines and join the majority of the world in supporting the Mine Ban Treaty, which includes provisions for demining and victim assistance. “There is an urgent need for a scaled-up humanitarian response that addresses rising food insecurity and ensures proper rehabilitative, psychosocial, and other needed care for landmine survivors, as well as adequate planning for and resourcing of post-conflict demining operations to clear contaminated areas.”

0,Syria/UN: UN General Assembly must take responsibility for ensuring aid continues to reach civilians in need,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/syria-un-un-general-assembly-must-take-responsibility-for-ensuring-aid-continues-to-reach-civilians-in-need/,"Ahead of a United Nations General Assembly meeting on 21 July to discuss the Russian veto of a Security Council resolution which would have allowed the UN to continue delivery of cross-border aid to north-west Syria for one year, Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General,...","Ahead of a United Nations General Assembly meeting on 21 July to discuss the Russian veto of a Security Council resolution which would have allowed the UN to continue delivery of cross-border aid to north-west Syria for one year, Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said:   
“Member states must not allow the cynical exploitation of vital humanitarian issues to be a political bargaining chip at the UN Security Council. This meeting must be the start of the UN General Assembly assuming responsibility towards protecting those most in need of humanitarian assistance, without compromise. The General Assembly must state unequivocally: International law is clear; the Security Council authorization should not be needed to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need.” 
“The Syrian government and the Russian veto power must not stand in the way of providing humanitarian assistance to millions of civilians in desperate need in north-west Syria, as this amounts to violating their rights to life, to an adequate standard of living including housing, water and sanitation, and to health. 
The General Assembly must state unequivocally: International law is clear; the Security Council authorization should not be needed to deliver humanitarian aid to those in need. 
“The UN General Assembly and other actors cannot sit back and simply wait for millions to risk losing access to humanitarian aid, nor can they have any trust that the Russian government will not again abuse its veto to finally close this essential crossing in January when the mandate expires. They must do everything that they can to guarantee that life-saving aid will continue getting to Syrians in dire need.” 
Background 
On 8 July, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution that would have allowed the UN to deliver cross-border aid to Syria for one year without the Syrian government’s authorization. 
In a last-minute deal on 12 July, after the expiry of the cross-border mandate, Security Council members capitulated to Russia’s demand and agreed to a resolution opening the Bab al-Hawa crossing point for only six more months. 
In accordance with Resolution 76/262, the President of the General Assembly has called a plenary meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter for which the veto was cast with the entire UN membership. 
According to international humanitarian law, no party to a conflict may arbitrarily refuse offers to carry out relief operations that are impartial and humanitarian in nature, including cross-border humanitarian assistance. In fact, they should facilitate the provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians in need.  Using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, including by impeding relief supplies, is a war crime. 
Expert guidance commissioned by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs states that in exceptional situations (such as when a state is arbitrarily blocking life-saving assistance for part of its civilian population), international organizations may conduct temporary humanitarian relief operations to bring life-saving supplies to a people in extreme need without the consent of parties to a conflict. Such measures are allowed when no alternatives exist and when taking them would not seriously impair territorial integrity of the state withholding consent.

Inside Israel, the authorities must recognize the housing rights of Palestinian Bedouin citizens in the Negev/Naqab desert, who saw their village, al-‘Araqib, demolished again this morning, Tuesday 19 July. 
In recent weeks, Masafer Yatta communities have been hit by wave after wave of demolitions according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). A campaign of intimidation by the Israeli authorities has sought to create unbearable living conditions that coerce residents into leaving. Roadblocks and other restrictions on movement have also prevented residents from celebrating the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha with their extended families in the nearby town of Yatta. On 11 May and 1 June, the Israeli army destroyed the homes of dozens of residents, with some suffering a third home demolition in the past 12 months. 
With every day that accountability is delayed, more Palestinians are losing their homes, livelihoods and hopes for a life of dignity. 
Around 1,150 Palestinians currently live in Masafer Yatta, of whom 569 are children, in over 200 homes, according to OCHA. Living conditions are dire, with residents almost entirely dependent on humanitarian aid. The Israeli authorities have issued orders to demolish or stop construction of almost all homes, animal shelters, cisterns, and community infrastructure in the area, on the grounds that they were built without permits, which are almost impossible to obtain. 
“More than 1,000 Palestinians in Masafer Yatta, including around 500 children, are bracing themselves for the potential arrival of Israeli bulldozers that would demolish their homes, solar panels and animal pens. Going ahead with this large-scale expulsion would amount to an act of forcible transfer, which is a war crime and crime against humanity,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Regional Middle East and North Africa Director. 
“The imminent displacement of Palestinians from Masafer Yatta offers a stark reminder of the cruel strategy Israel has used for decades to maintain its cruel system of apartheid over Palestinians.” 
Amnesty International is concerned that the housing rights of Bedouin citizens in Israel are not respected, and that they are discriminated against with regard to other economic, social and cultural rights as well, a policy aimed at maintaining Israel’s system of oppression and domination over Palestinians. Palestinian Bedouins who are citizens of Israel have suffered the repeated demolition of their homes as a corollary of discriminatory policies that do not recognize the legality of some 35 villages in the Negev/Naqab region. For example, since 2010 the authorities have repeatedly demolished all the homes in the village of al-‘Araqib, subjecting some 250 people to forced evictions that have rendered them homeless, as they relocated to shacks in other villages or to relatives’ residences in nearby Bedouin township. Israeli government plans to “regulate” Bedouin construction in the Negev/Naqab have led to the forced eviction of hundreds of members of this minority, and tens of thousands more are at risk. 
“Instead of demolishing homes, the Israeli authorities should dismantle discriminatory planning and building policies that have put Bedouin citizens in the absurd situation of being labelled trespassers on their own lands,” said Heba Morayef. 
On 4 May 2022, Israel’s High Court of Justice (HCJ) rejected multiple petitions by residents in eight villages of Masafer Yatta that sought to halt the eviction orders. As a result, homes and animal shelters are now being demolished, forcing residents out of their ancestral land to allow for military training in the area. 
In 1980, the Israeli army designated the 3,000-hectare area as ‘firing zone 918’, a restricted military zone to be used for training exercises. In November 1999, the army expelled all Masafer Yatta residents, yet an interim injunction issued by the HCJ in March 2000 allowed them back pending a final decision, and under the condition that they do not restore their homes. Since then, residents have been denied permission even to install solar panels or water cisterns. 
On 16 June, the Israeli army started carrying out military training in the area, which was only temporarily paused during a three-day visit by US President Joe Biden. 
The HCJ based its decision on its flawed conclusion that Israeli military orders have precedence over international law, which demonstrates the need to enforce international justice mechanisms. 
“The HCJ’s decision to uphold the Masafer Yatta expulsion highlights how Israel’s domestic courts are complicit in maintaining apartheid and perpetuating serious violations against Palestinians living under occupation. It shows the urgent need for an investigation by the International Criminal Court into war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). With every day that accountability is delayed, more Palestinians are losing their homes, livelihoods and hopes for a life of dignity,” said Heba Morayef. 
Israel has systematically designated large areas of Palestinian land as military zones, state land, archaeological sites or national parks to maximize control over Palestinian land in both Israel and the OPT. These arbitrary classifications form key elements of Israel’s institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination of Palestinians. Moreover, a recent investigation into classified documents from 1979 revealed that Israel’s creation of ‘firing zones’ in the OPT, which cover approximately 20% of the occupied West Bank, was  “for the sole purpose of eventually handing the land over to Israeli settlers”. 
Background 
Masafer Yatta comprises 19 traditional villages and hamlets, of which eight are at imminent risk of demolition and displacement. The villages are located on the South Hebron Hills in Area C of the occupied West Bank. Area C covers 60% of the West Bank, yet the Israeli authorities retain exclusive control over planning and zoning in the region. 
Across Israel and the OPT, Israel’s state-sanctioned, discriminatory policies and practices have forcibly displaced Palestinian communities for decades. Such policies have been deliberately designed to minimize Palestinians’ access to and control over strategic lands while seeking to maintain Jewish Israeli domination. 
Also targeted by threats of forcible transfer are other Palestinian communities in the South Hebron Hills and the Jordan Valley, a strategic area for Israeli settlement expansion and encroaching annexation. Last July, one such community, the shepherding hamlet of Khirbet Humsa, was completely wiped off the map by Israeli bulldozers. 
On the other side of the Green Line, in Israel, 35 “unrecognized” Palestinian Bedouin villages in the Negev/ Naqab are also at risk of demolition by the Israeli authorities in a blatant example of racial segregation. They do not feature on Israeli zoning and planning maps, and as a result, are considered illegal, with the Israeli authorities refusing to connect them to essential services including electricity and water. Ras Jrabah is one such village whose 500 residents are at risk of forcible transfer due to Israeli authorities’ plans to demolish it to allow for the expansion of Dimona, a town inhabited by mostly Jewish Israelis.

0,Amnesty International Launches Global Campaign To Confront Unprecedented Worldwide Threat To The Right To Protest,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/amnesty-international-launches-global-campaign-to-confront-unprecedented-worldwide-threat-to-the-right-to-protest/,"The right to protest is under unprecedented and growing threat across all regions of the world, Amnesty International said today, as the organization launched a new global campaign to confront states’ widening and intensifying efforts to erode this fundamental human right.

From Russia to Sri Lanka, France to Senegal, and Iran to Nicaragua, state authorities are implementing an expanding array of measures to suppress organized dissent. Protesters across the globe are facing a potent mix of pushbacks, with a growing number of laws and other measures to restrict the right to protest; the misuse of force, the expansion of unlawful mass and targeted surveillance; internet shutdowns and online censorship; and abuse and stigmatization. Meanwhile, marginalized and discriminated groups are subjected to even further barriers. 
Amnesty International’s “Protect the Protest” campaign will challenge attacks on peaceful protest, stand with those targeted and support the causes of social movements pushing for human rights change. 
“In recent years we have seen some of the biggest protest mobilizations for decades. Black Lives Matter, MeToo, and the climate change movements have inspired millions the world over to take to the streets and online to demand racial and climate justice, equity and livelihoods, and an end to gender violence and discrimination. Elsewhere, people have stood up in their thousands against police violence and killings, state repression and oppression,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Almost without exception, this wave of mass protest has been met with obstructive, repressive and often violent responses by state authorities. Instead of facilitating the right to protest, governments are going to ever greater lengths to quash it. This is why, as the world’s biggest human rights organization, we have chosen this moment to launch this campaign. It’s time to stand up and loudly remind those in power of our inalienable right to protest, to express grievances, and to demand change freely, collectively and publicly.” 
Instead of facilitating the right to protest, governments are going to ever greater lengths to quash it. 
It’s time to stand up and loudly remind those in power of our inalienable right to protest, to express grievances, and to demand change freely, collectively and publicly. 
 
A range of issues including the environmental crisis, growing inequality and threats to livelihoods, systemic racism and gender-based violence have made collective action ever more necessary. Governments have responded by introducing legislation imposing illegitimate restrictions on the right to protest. For example, we have seen blanket bans on protests, as seen in Greece and Cyprus during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the UK, a new law contains provisions providing police officers with wide-ranging powers, including the ability to ban ‘noisy protests’, while in Senegal, political demonstrations in the centre of Dakar have been banned since 2011, precluding protests near government buildings. 
Governments of all kinds are also increasingly using emergency powers as a pretext to clamp down on dissent. This was seen at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in countries including Thailand, while in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a government-imposed ‘state of siege’ has provided military and police officers with extensive powers to restrict protest in the provinces of Ituri and North Kivu since May 2021. 
Governments across the world are justifying restrictions by arguing that protest constitutes a threat to public order and by stigmatizing protesters; branding them “troublemakers”, “rioters”, or even “terrorists”. By casting protesters in this light, authorities have justified zero-tolerance approaches: introducing and misusing vague and draconian security laws, deploying heavy handed policing, and taking pre-emptive deterrent measures. 
This approach was witnessed in Hong Kong, where the National Security Law and its expansive definition of “national security” have been used arbitrarily, among other things, to restrict protest. 
And, in India, the anti-terror Unlawful Prevention (Activities) Act (UAPA) and the crime of “sedition”, have been used repeatedly against peaceful protesters, journalists, and human rights defenders.

Political activists Cecillia Chimbiri, Joana Mamombe and Netsai Marova were arrested in May 2020 at a police roadblock in Harare, Zimbabwe’s capital, for leading an anti-government protest over the authorities’ response to the Covid-19 pandemic and widespread hunger in the country.

THE SATURDAY MOTHERS 
On 25 August 2018, police in Istanbul used tear gas and water cannons to disperse a peaceful gathering, mainly of women, some of whom were in their 80s, known as ‘Saturday Mothers’. 
While governments have long relied on aggressive tactics to police protests, security forces have increased the amount of force they use in recent years. 
So-called less lethal weapons, including batons, pepper spray, tear gas, stun grenades, water cannons, and rubber bullets are routinely misused by security forces. And, since the early 2000s, Amnesty International has documented a trend towards the militarisation of state responses to protests, including the use of armed forces and military equipment. In countries including Chile and France security forces in full riot gear are often backed by armoured vehicles, military-grade aircraft, surveillance drones, guns and assault weapons, stun grenades and sound cannons. 
During the mass uprising that followed the 2021 coup in Myanmar, the military used unlawful lethal force against peaceful protesters. More than 2,000 people have been killed, according to monitors, and more than 13,000 arrested since the military seized power. 
People who face inequality and discrimination, whether based on race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, age, disability, occupation, social, economic or migratory status are also more affected by restrictions on their right to protest and face harsher repression.  
For example, women, LGBTI and gender-non-conforming people are facing different types of gender-based violence, marginalization, social norms and legislation.  In countries including Sudan, Colombia and Belarus, women have been sexually assaulted for participating in protests, while in Turkey, for example, Pride marches have been banned for years. 
“Our campaign comes at a critical juncture. The precious right to protest is being eroded at a terrifying pace, and we must do all we can to push back,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Countless protesters have been killed in recent years, and it is partly on their behalf that we must now raise our own voices and defend our right to speak truth to power through protests in the streets and online.” 
International human rights law protects the right to protest through a number of separate provisions enshrined in various international and regional treaties which, taken together, provide protests with comprehensive protection. Even though the right to protest is not codified as a separate right in human rights treaties, when people engage in protests, whether individually or collectively, they are exercising a variety of rights, which can include the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.

The joint report by the Thai NGO iLaw, Digital Reach and The Citizen Lab found that the infections spanned 2020 to 2021 and involved prominent individuals leading the mass pro-democracy protests, which called for major political and economic reforms, as well as academics and human rights defenders who have publicly criticized the Thai government.   
These findings stemmed from alarming notifications sent by Apple to many Thai activists that they had been targeted with the spyware in November 2021. Amnesty International’s Security Lab independently confirmed five of the cases in the report through forensic analysis.  
“We can now officially add Thailand to the growing list of countries where people peacefully calling for change, expressing an opinion, or discussing government policies may trigger invasive surveillance with a profound toll on an individual’s freedom of expression, privacy, and sense of security,” said Etienne Maynier, Technologist at Amnesty International. “It is worth remembering that this is only what has been found so far, and the scale of surveillance attempts could be bigger and more damaging.”  
It is worth remembering that this is only what has been found so far, and the scale of surveillance attempts could be bigger and more damaging. 
According to the report, Pegasus spyware was found on the phones of leading Thai protest organizers, including Arnon Nampa, Benja Apan and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, also known as Rung, who authorities have targeted with multiple unwarranted criminal proceedings for peacefully exercising their rights to assembly and freedom of expression.   
“Instead of listening and engaging with these protesters, academics, and human rights defenders, intrusive surveillance has been used to harass, intimidate, and target them in an attempt to break their spirit and create a society-wide chilling effect. These new revelations are a shocking example of just how low authorities might stoop to control peaceful dissent.”   
NSO Group, the company behind Pegasus, claims that it only sells products to government intelligence and law enforcement agencies.   
States have binding obligations under international law to not only respect human rights, but also to protect them from abuse by third parties, including private companies.  
Amnesty International continues to call for a global moratorium on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards that govern its use are in place.  
“Thai authorities must launch an independent, prompt, thorough, and effective investigation into the use of Pegasus spyware and take necessary measures to foster a safe environment for civic engagement. Such measures must include the amendments of legislation enabling state surveillance, including the Computer Crimes Act, the Cybersecurity Act, and the National Intelligence Act in line with international human rights law, as well as implementing safeguards to protect the right to privacy and freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.”  
Background:  
The new report was released one year after the global Pegasus Project revelations, which uncovered how governments worldwide were using NSO Group’s invasive Pegasus spyware to put human rights activists, political leaders, journalists and lawyers under unlawful surveillance.  
The lack of a global moratorium on the sale of spyware is allowing the surveillance industry to continue unchecked, Amnesty International warned in a separate statement today.  
Following repeated calls for the surveillance industry to be regulated, some steps have been taken in the right direction – but government action has not yet been enough.  
The Pegasus Project was a collaboration by journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries, coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Amnesty International’s Security Lab used cutting-edge digital forensic tests and research methodologies to confirm evidence of targeting and infections on scores of phones around the world.  
In the last year, the Security Lab uncovered new instances of targeting using Pegasus in Morocco-Western Sahara and Poland.

The Pegasus Project uncovered how governments worldwide were using NSO Group’s invasive Pegasus spyware to put human rights activists, political leaders, journalists and lawyers around the world under unlawful surveillance. 
Following repeated calls for the surveillance industry to be regulated, some steps have been taken in the right direction – but government action has not yet been enough. 
Everyone targeted with NSO Group’s spyware has a right to remedy 
“One year after the Pegasus spyware revelations shocked the world, it is alarming that surveillance companies are still profiting from human rights violations on a global scale,” said Danna Ingleton, Amnesty Tech’s Deputy Director. 
“The Pegasus Project offered a wake-up call that action was urgently needed to regulate an industry that is out of control. Shamefully, governments worldwide are yet to step up and fully deal with this digital surveillance crisis. 
“Everyone targeted with NSO Group’s spyware has a right to remedy. Global governments’ failure to take meaningful action is an insult to all those who have suffered, physically and psychologically, after being targeted with this invasive software. 
“The unlawful targeted surveillance of human rights defenders and civil society is a tool of repression. It is time to clamp down on this industry that continues to operate in the shadows.” 
The Pegasus Project was a collaboration by journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries, coordinated by Forbidden Stories. Amnesty International’s Security Lab used cutting-edge digital forensic tests and research methodologies to confirm evidence of targeting and infections on scores of phones around the world. 
In the last year, the Security Lab uncovered new instances of targeting using Pegasus in Morocco-Western Sahara and Poland. In addition, the Security Lab independently confirmed numerous additional cases where Pegasus was still being used to unlawfully target people, including cases in El Salvador, Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories, Poland, and Spain. 
Unlawful surveillance violates the right to privacy, and can also violate the rights to freedom of expression, opinion, association, and peaceful assembly. 
Amnesty International has been investigating unlawful surveillance for many years. There is mounting evidence of human rights violations being committed by governments, and how companies profit from unlawful targeted surveillance. 
Every month, there are new cases confirmed of people being targeted with Pegasus. Amnesty International interviewed several people who had been infected with Pegasus, who told of their distress at being targeted. 
That’s their goal: to make you paranoid, isolate you from people and lock you in a prison 
Julia Gavarrete, a journalist in El Salvador, said: “It’s a shame that a powerful tool to combat criminals is being used to attack independent journalists and human rights defenders. It’s a shame that we have no clue about who was behind the targeting. It’s impossible not to feel angry when our entire life is at someone else’s hands, and there’s no answers about the responsibility of this.  
“Being targeted led me to change my way of communicating, the places I used to go, and also to think twice about the type of information I want to share with others – not only because of my own security, but to protect the integrity of those who communicate with me. I have to be aware of the places we visit and try to be very careful every time we have our devices near…  As a journalist, I have to guard my sources, but as a woman, I need to protect my family and friends. Surveillance entails an indignity to our professional life and our private life.”  
Hicham Mansouri, a Moroccan journalist living in France, described being targeted as “a very violent form of censorship, because we deprive ourselves of expressing ourselves on many subjects both in a professional and personal context”. He added: “That’s their goal: to make you paranoid, isolate you from people and lock you in a prison.” 
There are currently open investigations and cases pending against NSO Group in France, India, Mexico, Poland and Spain. In March, the European Parliament established the PEGA Committee to investigate the use of Pegasus and other spyware in Europe. 
In November 2021, the United States’ government placed NSO Group on its Entity List, for “engaging in activities that are contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests”. Later that month, Apple filed a lawsuit against NSO Group to hold it accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users. 
In recent weeks, there have been reports that US defence contractor company L3Harris is in talks to buy ownership of Pegasus software. NSO Group’s future remains uncertain. 
“Any attempt by NSO Group to alter its business model in a bid to evade accountability must be resisted. The entire surveillance industry is broken and needs urgent reform,” said Danna Ingleton. 
“We continue to call for a global moratorium on the sale, transfer and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards that govern its use are in place.” 
States have binding obligations under international law to not only respect human rights, but also to protect them from abuse by third parties, including private companies.

Amnesty International considers that the Colombian state is not fully committed to protect Territory, Land and Environmental Defenders. In 2020, Amnesty International denounced that regardless of the extensive legislation on HRDs in the country, the State has done very little to offer comprehensive protection for TLERDs in the country, which is considered the deadliest for Global Witness and Frontline Defenders.   
In April 2021, Amnesty International launched an urgent action for CREDHOS, an environmental organization working in the Magdalena Medio region and faced similar risks than FEDEPESAN. The State took the measures we requested in the UA.    
On 7 June, Amnesty International launched an urgent action calling on the Colombian government to live up to its 2009 commitment on implementing the Roundtable on Guarantee of Human Rights and effectively provide protection to Territory, Land, and environmental defenders in the region.

“The recent escalation of the authorities’ response to protests by calling in the armed forces, firing at protestors and excessive use of tear gas which resulted in the death of one person yesterday is deeply worrying,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s South Asia Regional Director. 
The recent escalation of the authorities’ response to protests by calling in the armed forces, firing at protestors and excessive use of tear gas which resulted in the death of one person yesterday is deeply worrying. 
On the morning of 13 July 2022, thousands of protestors started making their way towards the Prime Minister’s office and the Parliament in Colombo. After an angry face-off, protesters breached the gates and took over the Prime Minister’s office. Amnesty International staff present at the protest location confirmed that law enforcement officers fired volleys of teargas against people, including children and journalists some of whom were seen escaping the plumes while coughing and sputtering. Dozens of protesters were injured, and one was reported dead. At Galle Face, helicopters flew low overhead, where a rolling peaceful protest site had been established three months ago in the prolonged agitation over the economic crisis in the country. At another protest near the Parliament later the same day, more than 80 people were reported to be injured and admitted to hospital. 
At 3pm the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe delivered a televised address in which he said he had ordered the military to “do whatever is necessary to restore order”. On 14 July 2022, a press release was issued by the army announcing a warning that they will use force to restore law and order in the country. 
Any blanket order authorising use of force by armed forces is problematic even during times of emergency. The armed forces should not be involved in the policing of public assemblies, since they are trained to fight against enemies and not to protect and control civilians. 
The armed forces should not be involved in the policing of public assemblies, since they are trained to fight against enemies and not to protect and control civilians. 
Amnesty calls upon law enforcement agencies to act with restraint to avoid further serious injury and loss of life. They may only use the minimum level of force necessary force to bring a situation under control where doing so is strictly necessary and proportionate. Even in instances where some parts of a protests turn violent, law enforcement must assess the situation on a case-by-case basis with use of force only where absolutely necessary and only against those engaged in violence. It must be strictly proportionate to the situation faced by law enforcement, which means authorities must not cause more harm than they seek to avert. 
“At a time when the country is facing a dire economic crisis and protests are growing in scale, authorities must make comprehensive efforts to de-escalate the situation and focus resources on ensuring people can access essential goods and services, in line with international human rights law and standards,” said Yamini Mishra.

More than 70,000 Indigenous Maasai people are at risk of being evicted from their ancestral grazing lands to make way for a tourism operation after a paramilitary group arrived on 7 June in the Maasai town of Loliondo, in Arusha Region of Northern Tanzania, to implement the authorities’ plans to seize the ancestral and registered land of the Maasai people. On 9 June, community members began to protest the demarcation but were met with force by security officers, who used teargas and firearms against the protestors. 25 community members were arrested and have since been charged with conspiracy to commit the murder of a police officer. The authorities must end the security operation in Loliondo, immediately release the arrested persons and suspend any ongoing land acquisition plans.  
On 7 June, a security operation consisting of around 700 people, mostly police, park rangers, military and other security forces, arrived at Loliondo to implement the authorities’ plans to seize 1500 square kilometres of the communal land of the Maasai people. On 9 June, soldiers used force to disperse community members in four villages (Ololosokwan, Oloirien, Kirtalo and Arash) who had gathered to protest the demarcation exercise by removing the beacons that the security had placed marking the boundaries of the land that the Maasai lay claim to. According to two eyewitnesses, security forces started shooting at the protesters with firearms and also used teargas. Many sustained injuries, some bullet wounds.   
Before the day of the protest, around 20 members of the Maasai community, some village elders, were arbitrarily arrested for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Ten of them as they were meeting to discuss state plans to demarcate the parcel of land. On 16 June they were falsely charged with the murder of a policeman. They were arrested even before the policeman was killed. The statement of offence has since been amended four times to be conspiracy to murder, while also adding five persons to the list of accused persons.  
The demarcation of the Maasai’s land happened contrary to the court orders by the East African Court of Justice. Furthermore, eviction from their ancestral lands in the absence of their free prior and informed consent will violate their human rights and will take away their livelihoods and impact their traditional way of life. Police force caused serious injury and risked the lives of the Maasai community members.

Loliondo is a division in Tanzania’s northern Ngorongoro district, in the Arusha region. It borders Serengeti National Park to the west, Ngorongoro Conservation Area to the south, and Kenya to the north. More than 70,000 Indigenous Maasai people are at risk of being displaced from their ancestral grazing lands to make way for a tourism operation. People are being evicted from their communal land as demarcation is ongoing despite a pending case at the East Africa Court of Justice. In 1992 the Tanzanian government leased the whole of the Loliondo division as a hunting block to a company from the United Arab Emirates.  
The recent security forces operation is the fourth attempt to evict the Indigenous Maasai people who are pastoralists from their grazing site at Loliondo, in a dispute that has lasted more than a decade. Security forces were previously deployed in 2009, 2013 and 2017, when they evicted community members from four villages: Ololosokwan, Oloirien, Kirtalo and Arash. On 25 September 2018, the East African Court of Justice issued orders which included explicit directions that the state ceases from evicting the Maasai Indigenous people until the determination of a case that the community had filed against the state was completed. Nearly two weeks after the demarcation operation had already begun and the security forces were deployed to Loliondo, the court issued a notice of adjournment and postponed the delivery of its judgment to the September 2022 session.  
The arrested persons include: Molongo Daniel Paschal, Albert Kiseya Selembo, Simeli Parmwati, Lekayoko Parmwati, Sapati Parmwati  Sirikoti, Ingoi Olkedenyi Kanjwel, Sangau Morongeti Ngiminiso, Morijoi Ngoisa Parmati, Morongeti Meeki Masako, Kamabatai Lulu, Moloimeti Yohana Saing’EU, Ndirango Senge Laisier, Joel Clemes Lessonu, Simon Naiam Orosikiria, Damiani Rago Laiza, Mathew Kursas Njausi, Taleng’o Twambei Leshoko, Kijoolu Kakenya Olojiloji, Shengena Joseph Killel, Kelvin Shaso Nairoti, Lekerenga, Fred Victor, Wilson Tiuwa Kilong, James Memusi Taki and 5 others.

He sought asylum in Spain but the Spanish authorities refouled him to Algeria in March 2022. The Algerian authorities subjected him to torture and ill-treatment and imprisoned him in El Harrash prison in Algiers before moving him to El-Blida military prison. He is undergoing trials on several cases before the military and civil courts. He was sentenced to death in absentia, while still an asylum seeker in Spain, on charges of espionage and desertion.  
Mohamed Benhlima has been in solitary confinement in El-Blida military prison since 28 April 2022. He is being held in a small cell with only 10-minute breaks daily without any contact with other prisoners. On 19 June, he testified in front of the judge in Kolea court that military security agents in S’hawla intelligence center in Algiers subjected him to torture and other ill-treatment for many days after his refoulement to Algeria on 24 March 2022. The allegations include him being stripped naked and freezing water poured on his body.   During their bi-weekly visits, his family reported visible weight loss, pale face and dark circles under his eyes. During the 19 June visit, his family noticed his moustache was plucked, not shaved, and both his hands and arms had many little holes as if his skin had been pierced by what could have been a nail clipper or a hot instrument. His family requested an investigation into the torture allegations in a letter that they addressed to the Algerian authorities including the Military Attorney General, the President of the Republic, and the Minister of Justice on 25 June. In the same letter, the family complained about the conditions of the bi-weekly visits they are allowed to pay him in El Blida military prison. The prison administration leaves the family waiting until the official visit time is almost over and that all other families have finished their visits before allowing Mohamed Benhlima’s family to see him for less than 10 minutes and in the presence of guards.  On 19 and 22 June, Algerian national television aired new videos of Mohamed Benhlima entitled “new confession from terrorist Benhlima”. These videos, deemed defamatory by his lawyers, gravely violate his rights to privacy and a fair trial, and jeopardize the investigation process.

Additional information  
Mohamed Benhlima is an Algerian citizen who sought asylum in both Spain and France, a former military official, and whistleblower who exposed alleged corruption by high-ranking Algerian military officials on a YouTube channel and participated in peaceful protests against the Algerian authorities that started in Algeria in 2019. Upon deportation to Algeria, the Algerian authorities widely mediatised Mohamed Benhlima’s “detention” and gravely violated his right to privacy as well as his fair trial rights, most notably his right not to be forced to testify against himself.  
Algerian national broadcasting services aired a video in which he “confesses” to the crimes of conspiracy against the state and affirms that he was not treated badly in custody. Mohamed Benhlima had himself released a video from the immigration detention centre in Valencia, Spain, before his forced deportation to Algeria, in which he warns that such videos would not be genuine and would show that he “was subjected to severe torture at the hands of intelligence services”.   
According to the information that Amnesty International has obtained, Mohamed Benhlima arrived in Spain on 1 September 2019 through a valid Schengen visa. He filed for asylum in Spain and received a residence permit from Spanish authorities, which he renewed and was valid until 5 November 2021. On 23 August 2021, he received a summons to the police station in Bilbao, Spain. Fearful of a possible extradition to Algeria, he fled to France shortly after. His fear of extradition was based on a similar case of extradition from Spain to Algeria of former military official and asylum-seeker Mohamed Abdellah on 20 August 2021. Mohamed Benhlima was later arrested and brought back to Spain. On 14 March 2022, the Spanish authorities opened an administrative file of expulsion for infringement of Art. 54.1.a. of Immigration Law 4/2000, alleging that Mohamed Benhlima took part in “activities contrary to public security or which may be harmful for Spanish relationships with foreign states”.   The Spanish authorities justified the opening of an expulsion file against him based on Mohamed Benhlima’s alleged association with political opposition group Rachad, which was listed as a terrorist group by Algeria on 6 February 2022. The Spanish authorities claimed that Rachad’s objective was to infiltrate radical youth into Algerian society to protest against the Algerian government and concluded that the activist was a member of a terrorist group. However, the Spanish authorities did not provide any proof of use of violence, advocacy of hatred, or any other action taken by the activist that could be considered as “terrorism” in accordance with the definition proposed by the UN Special Rapporteur on the protection of human rights while countering terrorism.   The Spanish authorities do not appear to have considered a context in which Algerian authorities have been increasingly levelling bogus terrorism and national security charges against peaceful activists, human rights defenders and journalists since April 2021. On 27 December 2021, UN Special Procedures warned that the definition of terrorism in the Algerian Penal Code was too imprecise and undermined human rights. They stated that the procedure for registration on the national terrorist list did not comply with international human rights standards and expressed concern that it could give rise to abuse. On 24 March, at around 7pm, Mohamed Benhlima’s lawyers were notified of the resolution of expulsion and promptly filed a request for an interim suspensive measure at the National Court of Spain, which was rejected; however, it was revealed later that the activist was already being escorted on a plane to Algeria at the time.

He was sentenced to death in 2006 for a murder committed in 2001, when he was just over 18 years old and emerging from a childhood of neglect and abuse.  The TCCA remanded the case to the trial court for review of the claim that the prosecution’s expert gave false testimony at the trial when testifying about Ramiro Gonzales’ “future dangerousness”, a jury’s finding of which is a prerequisite for a death sentence in Texas.   
On 30 June 2022, lawyers for Ramiro Gonzales filed a petition in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, including the claim that at the sentencing phase of their client’s 2006 trial the prosecution had presented false and inaccurate expert testimony.  The prosecution had presented a psychiatrist who testified that Ramiro Gonzales would “certainly” pose a risk of committing acts of violence in prison. Such predictions have long been shown to be grossly inaccurate, even if seen by prosecutors as effective in their pursuit of a death sentence in Texas where the jury must make a finding of “future dangerousness” before a death sentence can be passed.   
The psychiatrist in question recently assessed Ramiro Gonzales again. This time the psychiatrist concluded that Ramiro Gonzales does not have antisocial personality disorder – as he had stated at trial – and that he “does not pose a risk of future danger” to others.  In his report, he wrote: “At the time of the commission of this offense Mr. Gonzales was barely 18 years old. With the passage of time and significant maturity he is now a significantly different person both mentally and emotionally. This represents a very positive change for the better. At the current time, considering all of the evidence provided to me, my evaluation of Mr. Gonzales, and his current mental status, it is my opinion, to a reasonable psychiatric probability, that he does not pose a threat of future danger to society in regard to any predictable future acts of criminal violence.” During Ramiro Gonzales’ 15 years on death row, none of the few occasions when he has been subject to disciplinary action, most of which occurred early in his imprisonment, alleged any violence.  
On 11 July 2022, despite having this and more information before them in Ramiro Gonzales clemency petition, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles voted to deny clemency – that is, voted against recommending that the Governor grant clemency.   
About an hour later, the TCCA issued its order, staying the execution.  The Court stated that the “determination of future dangerousness is made at trial and is not properly reevaluated on habeas [corpus review]”.  To the extent that the claim brought was such a reevaluation, the TCCA order, “the trial court shall not review it”. However, the TCCA continued, the lawyers had also presented evidence that the psychiatrist’s testimony about recidivism rates had been false and that “the false testimony could have affected the jury’s answer to the future dangerousness question” at the sentencing phase.  It remanded this aspect of the claim to the trial court for review of its merits.  The stay of execution, the TCCA made clear, would remain in force pending resolution of this process.    
There have been seven executions in the USA so far in 2022, in Alabama (1), Arizona (2), Missouri (1), Oklahoma (2) and Texas (1).

José Daniel Ferrer García was last able to communicate with his family by telephone on 4 June 2022, and on 30 June authorities denied visits from his wife, according to his family. Detention without access to the outside world – incommunicado detention – facilitates torture or other ill-treatment and enforced disappearance. In some circumstances, it can itself constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.  
On 7 July 2022, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances informed NGO Prisoners Defenders that it had written to the government asking it to provide information about the fate and whereabouts of José Daniel to his family and lawyers, and to provide the Committee with detailed information about his current access to communication with the outside world. The concealment of a prisoner’s fate or whereabouts may amount to an enforced disappearance for the purposes of Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, to which Cuba is a state party.

José Daniel Ferrer García is an activist and leader of the unofficial political opposition group “Patriotic Union of Cuba”. He was detained on 11 July 2021, in the context of island-wide protests, and has been imprisoned ever since.   
On 11 July, José Daniel tried to attend the country-wide demonstrations in Santiago de Cuba with his son. He left his house and walked past the state security officials who constantly monitor him, but other law enforcement officials stopped him a few meters ahead.   
José Daniel Ferrer García and his son were detained together and initially following his detention there was no formal record of José Daniel’s whereabouts, and the authorities did not allow his family to see or communicate with him. Amnesty International believes that the concealment of his whereabouts amounted to an enforced disappearance for the purposes of Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, to which Cuba is a state party.  
For his attempt to join the protests, José Daniel Ferrer García was charged with “public disorder,” however, a year after his arrest he has not received a trial and remains in prison. In 2020, following a different trial tainted by irregularities, José Daniel was convicted to four and a half years of house arrest. According to documents seen by Amnesty International, due to the new charges of “public disorder” a Provincial Tribunal in Santiago revoked his house arrest in August 2021, obliging him to pass that previous sentence in prison.  
On 4 June 2022, a Provincial Tribunal in Santiago denied a habeas corpus request submitted by his family.  
On 7 July 2022, the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances informed NGO Prisoners Defenders that it had written to Cuba asking the state to provide information about the fate and whereabouts of José Daniel to his family and lawyers, and to provide the Committee with detailed information about his current access to communication with the outside world.   
Prior to his detention on 11 July, José Daniel Ferrer García endured constant threats and harassment. José Daniel Ferrer García has long reported suffering health problems, related to his previous long-term detentions in prison, including, among other things, serious gastric problems, and chronic headaches.

“Amnesty International demands an effective and transparent investigation into the allegations made against the UK Special forces in Afghanistan, that delivers justice for victims and holds the perpetrators accountable.” 
“Amnesty International demands an effective and transparent investigation into the allegations made against the UK Special forces in Afghanistan, that delivers justice for victims and holds the perpetrators accountable.” 
“The BBC’s findings are horrifying, and clearly depict an alarming level of impunity and lack of accountability of UK troops who operated in Afghanistan. The BBC’s reporting outlines unlawful killings, including deliberate killing of individuals after they were detained, targeting of civilians and fabricating evidence to justify the killing of unarmed men, pointing to potential war crimes having been committed. The suggestion that there’s been a high-level cover-up compounds the moral outrage and suggests an unwillingness on the part of the UK to pursue independent and effective investigations into the allegations.’ 
“The UK is obligated to urgently commence investigations into all allegations of war crimes involving its Special Forces, and any UK nationals who are suspected of individual criminal responsibility must be brought to justice in UK courts. If the UK is unwilling to bring cases against its own military, as it has shamefully demonstrated in relation to war crimes committed by its forces in Iraq, the ICC should do so.’ 
“The International Criminal Court (ICC) has also opened an investigation in Afghanistan and the Prosecutor must urgently investigate, without fear or favour, allegations of war crimes committed by all parties to the conflict as soon as possible. However, despite harrowing reports of war crimes and crimes against humanity being committed in Afghanistan by western militaries, including the USA, the ICC has not initiated any investigations, other than into the Taliban – leading to accusations of double standards in its approach.” 
‘This episode also underscores just how damaging any move to remove human rights protections and responsibility from troops operating overseas would be. The UK Government must step away from the reprehensible proposal to replace the Human Rights Act before any more damage is done.’ 
Background: 
On 12 July, 2022, the BBC published their report on investigation into the role of SAS operatives in Afghanistan who repeatedly killed detainees and unarmed men in suspicious circumstances. The reports suggest that the unit may have unlawfully killed 54 people in one six-month tour. 
Since 2001, the UK along with other international forces were in Afghanistan, and had been conducting operations against the Taliban for over a decade. The Taliban captured Kabul by 15 August 2021, the Afghan President fled the country, and the last international forces left the country by the end of August. The Taliban now control Afghanistan. 
Since 2003 Afghanistan has been a member state of the International Criminal Court, granting jurisdiction to the Court to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, committed on Afghan territory or by its nationals. The UK ratified the Rome Statute in 2001, granting the ICC jurisdiction over UK nationals and territory since 2002.

On 28 June his sentence came into force. Mikhail Iosilevich is prosecuted for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom of expression and association. He must be immediately released and be able to continue his peaceful activism without fear of persecution.   
On 27 May, the Sovetskii District Court in Nizhnii Novgorod sentenced Mikhail Iosilevich to 20 months imprisonment in an open regime penal colony and RUB 100,000 (US$ 1,585) fine. Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the court found him guilty of cooperation with an “undesirable organization” (Article 284.1 of the Criminal Code) and “threats to a witness” (Article 119 (2) of the Criminal Code).   
The court acquitted Mikhail Iosilevich under the third charge – “failure to report second citizenship” (Article 330.2). As Mikhail Iosilevich spent around seven months in pre-trial detention which, according to the Russian law is counted as double the time of imprisonment in an open regime penal colony, he should be released before the end of the year. The activist decided not to appeal against the sentence, as he does not believe the appeal would have a positive outcome but would draw on a lot of time and resources. Mikhail Iosilevich has been prosecuted under fabricated charges solely for his peaceful civic activism. His trial did not meet international fair trial standards.   
We will continue calling for his immediate release and overturning of the sentence, albeit through other less public channels. We encourage activists to continue sending their messages of solidarity to Mikhail Iosilevich while he is still imprisoned.

With the world facing human rights challenges on so many fronts, one can easily lose sight of the many positive changes that have taken place across the globe over the past six months. Thanks to the tireless commitment of our supporters, Amnesty International has helped to free the wrongfully imprisoned, rewrite unjust laws, and hold the powerful to account.  Here’s a round-up of human rights victories to celebrate so far this year… 
A Polish court dismissed an appeal against the acquittal of three women who had been accused of ‘offending religious beliefs’ for distributing posters of the Virgin Mary with an LGBTI rainbow halo. More than 276,000 actions were taken on their behalf by Amnesty supporters. 
The abolition of the death penalty for all crimes in Kazakhstan came into force — a significant win for Amnesty’s campaign for the global abolition of the punishment. Kazakhstan, which became the 109th fully abolitionist country, also went on to become a state party to a key international treaty on abolition in March. 
The US Department of Defense published the findings of an independent RAND Corporation investigation it commissioned into the Pentagon’s civilian casualty reporting practices. The investigation was prompted, in part, by Amnesty’s reporting on civilian casualties caused by US & Coalition forces in Raqqa, Syria in 2017; our multimedia investigation War in Raqqa: Rhetoric versus Reality is cited multiple times in RAND’s report. 
Ghana’s Parliament rejected a bill that would have further criminalized LGBTI people, introduced prison sentences for anyone expressing support or “sympathy” toward LGBTI people, and encouraged conversion therapy and gender “realignment” for children. Opposition to the bill came from groups including Amnesty International, who criticized it before the Parliament. 
In Afghanistan, Professor Faizullah Jalal, who had been arbitrarily arrested and detained by the Taliban, was freed following campaigning by Amnesty International and others. His daughter said that his release would not have been possible without Amnesty’s intervention.   
After nearly 30 years of advocacy and campaigning by Amnesty International Slovenia, the country’s President finally issued a public apology to the thousands of people from other former Yugoslav republics whose residency permits were revoked after Slovenia declared independence in 1992. The so-called “erasure” left some 26,000 people without residency and economic and social rights, depriving them of health and social benefits. 
The Kuwaiti Constitutional Court overturned a law criminalizing “imitation of the opposite sex,” legislation that Amnesty International had previously criticized in its Annual Report. 
Following a long-term campaign by Amnesty International and other civil society organizations, Colombia decriminalized abortion during the first 24 weeks of a pregnancy. This achievement further boosted the momentum behind the movement for sexual and reproductive rights across Latin America, following the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020 and the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico 2021. 
In Honduras, the “Guapinol eight”, water rights defenders and prisoners of conscience, were unconditionally released after two and a half years. Amnesty International carried out media, advocacy and campaigning work for more than a year to highlight their wrongful detention. 
Dipti Rani Das, a 17-year-old girl from Bangladesh’s Hindu minority, was released after spending more than 16 months in detention for a Facebook post. Amnesty International issued an Urgent Action on her behalf and provided relief support for her legal expenses. 
The UNHRC renewed the mandate of the Human Rights Commission on South Sudan, which is currently the only independent mechanism capable of collecting evidence for future accountability. Amnesty International actively advocated for its renewal through joint public letters to UNHRC member states, bilateral meetings with UNHRC member states and section engagement at capital level. 
Two individuals recently featured in Amnesty International’s annual Write for Rights Campaign were released from prison. Bernardo Caal Xol, an Indigenous Mayan environmentalist and prisoner of conscience in Guatemala, was freed early after being wrongfully imprisoned for his activism. And, in South Sudan, Magai Matiop Ngong, who was a 15-year-old school student when sentenced to death in 2017, was released after the High Court ruled he was a child at the time of his alleged crime. 
In 2018, Amnesty International launched a campaign on behalf of Tayebe Abassi, a then 18-year-old girl whose family faced being deported to Afghanistan from Norway, where they had lived since 2012. In April, Tayebe’s mother finally received a residency permit, giving her the right to stay with her children in Norway. Tayebe shared the following message to thank Amnesty International for its support:    
“I wanted to ask you if that’s possible I could send my thankful message to Amnesty International and everyone who supported me and my family during our struggle. Looking back in time makes me feel strong and powerful, I found all of those support cards that I got from different Amnesty members around the world ❤❤” – Tayebe 
In Libya, Mansour Atti, a journalist, blogger and head of the Red Crescent Committee and of the Civil Society Commission, was released ten months after his enforced disappearance. Amnesty International issued an urgent action, public statement and press release on his case and encouraged members and supporters to sign petitions, send letters and post on social media to call for his immediate and unconditional release. 
In another win for the long-running campaign by Amnesty International and others for the global abolition of the death penalty, Papua New Guinea became the latest country to abandon the punishment, 30 years after its reintroduction in 1991. 
Following months of advocacy and campaigning by Amnesty International and other civil society organizations, the European Union reached political agreement on the Digital Services Act (DSA). This landmark regulatory framework will, among other things, require Big Tech platforms to assess and manage systemic risks posed by their services, such as advocacy of hatred and the spread of disinformation. 
In response to research by Amnesty International and partners, Mali’s authorities launched an investigation into an ‘anti-terrorist operation’ in the city of Moura, carried out by Mali’s armed forces and mercenaries from the Wagner group, that left at least 203 people dead. Based on eyewitness testimonies, Amnesty International’s joint-research had concluded that dozens of civilians were killed during the operation and that many people were unlawfully killed. 
In a success for the women’s movement in Spain and for Amnesty International activists, who long campaigned for it, the lower chamber of Spain’s parliament passed a bill containing important measures to prevent, protect and prosecute rape. The law puts consent at the centre of the discussion around sexual violence, including rape. 
The UN Security Council (UNSC) renewed the arms embargo on the territory of South Sudan for another year. Amnesty International contributed to this result through research and targeted advocacy, including bilateral meetings with UNSC members during an advocacy mission to New York in April and section engagement at capital level. 
A day after the launch of Amnesty International’s annual death penalty report, Zambia’s President announced that the country would begin the process of abolishing the death penalty. 
In Guinea, a judicial investigation was launched against former political and police leaders for violations of the right to life, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detentions, and torture following the country’s constitutional crisis in 2020. Amnesty International has called repeatedly for an end to the impunity for these violations, publishing a report and multiple other outputs condemning the unlawful killings of dozens of demonstrators and the arbitrary detention of dozens of political activists and civil society representatives. 
In a positive step for the right to freedom of expression in India, the country’s Supreme Court suspended the 152-year-old sedition law. 
In a move long advocated by Amnesty International, States, civil society, and international organizations gathered in Geneva to finalize the text of a political declaration aimed at strengthening the protection of civilians arising from the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. It is expected that states will sign onto the political declaration at a diplomatic event later this year. 
Amnesty International’s ongoing campaign on the death penalty saw further success, with an announcement by Malaysia’s government that it would begin the process of abolishing the mandatory death sentence that currently exists for 11 offences.

Responding to the Russian veto on extending a UN Security Council draft resolution that would have renewed the provision of cross-border humanitarian aid for twelve months to north-west Syria, Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General, said: 
“This veto comes after a series of compromises with Russia and China, starting with the closure of two crossing points in the past two years and ending with the dismantling of the UN mechanism. The draft resolution vetoed today had still further compromises with Russia on the terms for continuing cross-border aid. 
“Russia tabled an alternative resolution for only a six-month renewal that was supported by only two Council members, far less than the nine votes required. 
“The Russian veto will effectively close the last lifeline for at least four million people in north-west Syria who depend on UN aid for survival. This will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis but will also lead to a humanitarian catastrophe as men, women and children living in north-west Syria will no longer receive food or access to essential services such as housing, water and healthcare. 
“Russia’s veto today is an irresponsible political game for which innocent Syrian civilians will pay the price. Russia should join the 13 Council members who supported a full 12-month renewal and refrain from further use of veto against the extension of life-saving humanitarian aid for twelve months. 
Background 
The UN cross-border aid delivery mechanism was established by resolution 2165 (2014) for the UN and its implementing partners to provide aid, without the Syrian government’s authorisation. Since then, the UN and its implementing partners as well as other humanitarian organizations have been providing assistance and services such as food, water, hygiene, sanitation, health, education and protection for people living in north-west Syria, including IDPs, across the border from Turkey to north-west Syria. 
In a new report, ‘Unbearable living conditions’: Inadequate access to economic and social rights in displacement camps in north-west Syria, Amnesty International details how, as a consequence of the Syrian government’s denial or obstruction of displaced people’s access to economic and social rights, IDPs living in dire conditions in camps are extremely vulnerable and entirely dependent on international aid for survival.

She is also denied adequate healthcare for her kidney and heart conditions, and back pain. Hours after the delivery, authorities transferred her and her newborn to Urumieh prison, West Azerbaijan province, where she has been denied access to her lawyer since her arrest on 14 October 2021.       
Throughout her pregnancy and while Covid-19 was rampant in prisons in Iran, prosecution authorities and Ministry of Intelligence agents repeatedly denied her access to the specialized health care she required. According to an informed source, authorities ignored medical advice for her to be under close medical observation during her last month of pregnancy. On 20 June 2022, So’ada Khadirzadeh was transferred from Urumieh prison to hospital, where Ministry of Intelligence agents kept her hands and feet shackled to the bed while she was in active labour, in violation to the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment. The shackles were removed after medical staff protested. Her child was born following a caesarean operation, but authorities transferred her and her newborn back to Urumieh prison on the same day, against medical advice.   
In a leaked audio message recorded inside prison in late April 2022, So’ada Khadirzadeh stated that following her 14 October 2021 arbitrary arrest by Ministry of Intelligence agents in Piranshahr, West Azerbaijan province, she was held for 25 days in a Ministry of Intelligence detention centre. There, agents subjected her to intense interrogations, which included verbal abuse of a sexual nature, to compel her to “confess” to helping her husband, who left Iran a day prior to her arrest and who they said was wanted. She was then transferred to Urumieh prison, where she has been denied access to a lawyer. She was held without charge until prosecution officials indicted her around March 2022 for “membership of a group with the purpose of disrupting national security” in apparent reference to the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran and being accessory to murder, all of which So’ada Khadirzadeh denies. She was arrested in the days after the reported killing of a man in Piranshahr identified by human rights activists abroad as a Ministry of Intelligence agent. A first court hearing before a criminal court is scheduled for 24 August 2022.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei 
Following So’ada Khadirzadeh’s arbitrary arrest, when she was about six weeks pregnant, on 14 October 2021, she was subjected to an enforced disappearance for 25 days whereby her family was denied information about her fate and whereabouts until she was transferred to Urumieh prison on 8 November 2021. In December 2021, prison doctors issued a medical note confirming she required specialized medical care outside of prison, but prosecution authorities, together with Ministry of Intelligence agents, barred her access to such healthcare. On 26 April 2022, So’ada Khadirzadeh began a 12-day hunger strike in protest at her continued detention and being denied the specialized health care she required. During this time, she also refused all medication. In a leaked audio message recorded inside the prison and made public on 27 April 2022 during her hunger strike, So’ada Khadirzadeh recounted that Ministry of Intelligence agents forcibly disappeared her following her arrest and subjected her to intense interrogations, verbally abused her and “even made immoral suggestions to me”. In the same audio message, she also referred to herself as being held “hostage”, alluding to Ministry of Intelligence agents holding her to compel her husband to return to Iran. So’ada Khadirzadeh subsequently agreed to stop her hunger strike after prison officials said they would release her on bail, though this never took place. According to an informed source, doctors from the Legal Medical Organization of Iran, a state forensic body, examined So’ada Khadirzadeh after her hunger-strike and held that she should not remain jailed during the remaining period of pregnancy. Their medical advice was dismissed.   
In early June 2022, authorities set her bail to over thirty billion rials (GBP£70,000), which neither she nor her family could afford. Since giving birth, she has relied on other prisoners in the ward to help care and nurse her child. Prison officials failed to provide adequate accommodation to So’ada Khadirzadeh and her child, prompting another prisoner to volunteer her bed, which was more suited for mother and newborn. So’ada Khadirzadeh’s is also being denied nutrient food, including for nursing her child, and has not been permitted to accompany her child to health examinations outside of prison. Rule 48 for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-custodial Measures for Women Offenders (the Bangkok Rules), states that pregnant or breastfeeding women prisoners must be provided with an adequate diet organized and monitored by a qualified health practitioner, and a healthy environment for both mother and child.  
State-affiliated media referred to a man killed in early October 2021as a “martyr” and claimed the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, an armed Kurdish opposition group, was responsible. Human rights activists abroad identified him as a Ministry of Intelligence agent in Piranshahr.  
Amnesty International has documented a pattern of systematic fair trial rights violations in Iran, beginning from the time of arrest right up until when defendants stand trial. Detainees are often arrested without warrants and held in prolonged solitary confinement in undisclosed locations without access to their families. Individuals detained, investigated and prosecuted, especially those arrested on politically motivated charges, are subjected to grossly unfair judicial proceedings. Prosecution authorities and interrogators belonging to security and intelligence bodies, including the Ministry of Intelligence, systematically deny detainees their right to access a lawyer from the time of arrest during the investigation phase, and at times, even beyond. Torture and other ill-treatment are widespread and systematic, especially during interrogations. Prison and prosecution authorities have also deliberately denied prisoners of conscience and other prisoners held for politically motivated reasons access to adequate health care, in many cases as an intentional act of cruelty intended to intimidate and punish them.  
Ethnic minorities, including Ahwazi Arabs, Azerbaijani Turks, Baluchis, Kurds and Turkmen face entrenched discrimination in Iran which curtails their access to education, employment, adequate housing and political office. Despite ongoing calls for linguistic diversity, Persian is the sole language of instruction in primary and secondary education. The Iranian authorities also refuse to cease and provide accountability for the unlawful killing of scores of unarmed Kurdish cross-border couriers (kulbars) between the Kurdistan regions of Iran and Iraq.   
Under international law, detention pending trial is a preventive measure aimed at averting further harm or obstruction of justice, rather than a punishment. It must not be used for improper purposes or constitute an abuse of power and must not last any longer than is necessary with ongoing examinations into the continued necessity of keeping an individual in detention. Additionally, under Rule 64 of the Bangkok Rules, non-custodial sentences are preferred for pregnant women and women with dependent children.

The strikes, apparently using anti-ship missiles, hit the town in the Odesa region shortly before 1am on 1 July, injuring at least 35 people. Five people remain in serious condition in intensive care, meaning the total death toll may rise.“These powerful weapons were designed to destroy warships, and firing them into residential areas is extremely reckless,” said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser. 
“This attack is yet another example of the Russian military’s utter disregard for civilians in Ukraine as they continue to cause needless death and destruction. All those responsible for such war crimes must face justice for their actions.” 
Amnesty International visited the strike locations in Serhiivka and found no evidence of the presence of Ukrainian soldiers, weapons, or other valid military targets nearby. Satellite imagery reviewed by Amnesty International also did not indicate any military activity in the area prior to the attack. 
This attack is yet another example of the Russian military’s utter disregard for civilians in Ukraine 
Local government officials told Amnesty International that the weapons used in the attack were two Kh-22 guided missiles. With an estimated warhead of more than 900kg and a targeting system designed to hit ships rather than land objects, the missile is potentially extremely inaccurate, and therefore completely inappropriate for use in a populated area. 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Response weapons expert found ordnance fragments consistent with a large guided missile at the scene of the strike on the hotel. Notably, the fragments contained old-style rivets, consistent with a 50-year-old weapon such as a Kh-22. 
A core principle of international humanitarian law (the laws of war) is that parties to an armed conflict must at all times distinguish between civilians and civilian objects, and members of the military and military objectives. Military objectives can be targeted, but it is unlawful to target civilians or civilian objects. Prior to any attack, members of the military are required to take steps to ensure that they are reasonably certain they are not targeting civilians and civilian objects. 
To date, there have been numerous examples of Russian forces routinely launching unlawful attacks in Ukraine which have killed and injured civilians, some of which may have been deliberate attacks on civilians or civilian objects. 
Just after midnight on 1 July, Russian forces launched at least two missiles towards the Black Sea resort of Serhiivka, around 45 miles southwest of the city of Odesa. The first missile hit the Godji Hotel, and killed six civilians. Just minutes later, a second missile hit the hardware store at the front of a residential nine-storey building at 23 Budzhaska Street, and killed 15 civilians. 
Amongst those killed at the Godji Hotel were Nadiya Rudnitskaya, the hotel manager, and her 12-year-old son Dmytro Rudnitsky. Olha Ilyashevych, 30, and her mother Maria, who had both fled fighting from Slovyansk in the Donbas region, were also killed. 
The fatalities also included Oleksander Shishkov, 41, a well-known football coach who lived in Odesa but who had been staying at the hotel following a children’s football match the day before between the local team and the team from the nearby town of Bilhorod-Dnistrovsky. 
Amongst those killed in the strike on Budzhaska Street were Volodymyr Chulak, a 68-year-old physical education teacher, his wife Tetiana, a 64-year-old chef, and their son Mykhaylo, 35, who lived in Odesa and was visiting his parents. 
Tetiana Chulak’s sister Valentyna told Amnesty International: “I heard the explosions and ran to the street… I ran there [number 23] and into the building, and found Tetiana in her bed, dead, covered in smashed-up furniture and debris, and her husband Volodymyr was dead in the kitchen. Their son Mykhaylo had been standing on the terrace, and was directly hit by the missile; he was in shreds.”  
Also killed were Halyna Rumashuk, a 50-year-old receptionist, and her husband Serhii, a 48-year-old builder. They had initially survived the strike and managed to escape the building, but the couple then returned to look for some of their belongings, when a wall collapsed and killed them both. 
Roman, 36, a resident of the fourth floor of the building, told Amnesty International that he and his mother only survived because at the time of the strike they were behind a poured-concrete wall in their kitchen, bathing their puppy who had undergone surgery. The rest of their apartment was obliterated in the blast. Roman attempted to save his next-door neighbour, Proskovia Pavlenko, 63. She was mortally wounded in the blast, and died as he carried her from the building. 
Natalia Yankovska and her partner Maksym Nedomov both died from serious injuries caused by the blast. Natalia’s two young sons from a previous marriage, aged 10 and 14, both remain in hospital, with one in critical condition. 
Other victims killed in the strike on the residential block include Oleksander Sribny (47), Tetiana Nesterenko (64), and Vira Maksymenko (71). 
“The Russian military’s relentless bombardment of residential areas full of civilians, killing people as they sleep, shocks the conscience,” said Donatella Rovera. 
“How many more civilians must die before there is justice and accountability for these crimes? The Russian forces responsible for these ongoing serious violations of international humanitarian law must be held accountable for their actions, and victims and their families must receive full reparations.”

Iranian activist Abbas Vahedian has been detained incommunicado since 5 May 2022, when authorities in Vakilabad prison in Mashhad, Khorasan-e Razavi province, cut off his contact with the outside world. His incommunicado detention heightens longstanding concerns over his torture, including by denial of adequate medical care and enforced isolation. He is solely held for the peaceful exercise of his human rights and must be immediately and unconditionally released.   
Unjustly imprisoned political activist Abbas Vahedian has been subjected to incommunicado detention since 5 May 2022, when prosecution and prison authorities in Vakilabad prison in Mashhad, Khorasan-e Razavi province, cut off all his contact with the outside world. Since then, his family and lawyer have approached various judicial, prosecution and prison authorities, expressing concern over his fate and whereabouts and requesting visits and phone calls. In response, the authorities have simply said he is banned from visits and phone calls and they will contact his family and lawyer whenever the ban is lifted. On 19 June 2022, the head of the Intelligence and Protection Unit of Vakilabad prison told his distressed family that he is being punished for “disrupting prison order” through chanting slogans such as “Down with the Dictator” and speaking out against his unjust imprisonment and ongoing torture in prison.  
Before he was subjected to incommunicado detention, Abbas Vahedian was locked with another prisoner in a room in section 1(6) of Vakilabad prison in isolating conditions. He was banned from having contact with other prisoners and from family visits. He was only allowed to call his family daily for a few minutes in the presence of an official who prevented him from speaking freely. On 5 May 2021, the official terminated the call after about a minute when Abbas Vahedian began complaining about his torture in prison. His family has not heard from him since and have no confirmation about where he is being held, making his circumstances akin to enforced disappearance. The authorities have also tortured Abbas Vahedian by deliberately denying him adequate medical care since his arbitrary arrest on 1 September 2021, causing him severe pain and suffering. He has dental pain due to a worsening gum infection which has been left untreated. He developed chronic neck pain after Ministry of Intelligence agents held him in solitary confinement at an unmarked detention facility and forced him to sleep on the ground without a pillow and a mattress from 1 September 2021 to 6 March 2022. He has also been denied adequate treatment and medication for high blood pressure, high level of lipids in his blood, chest pain, and a skin condition which has resulted in cuts and abrasions on his knees. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison in late 2021 solely for his peaceful activism for a democratic secular Iran.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei 
Additional Information:  
Following his arbitrary arrest on 1 September 2021, Abbas Vahedian was held for more than six months in solitary confinement nearly 24 hours a day in an informal, unmarked Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Mashhad. During this period, he was denied access to fresh air and natural light and held in a windowless cell where bright lamps were kept on 24 hours a day, causing him sleep deprivation and distress. Every few days, he was taken to a hallway for a short walk while blindfolded. He was also denied adequate healthcare, bedding, warm clothing, and regular family visits. Ministry of Intelligence agents told him that for his detention conditions to improve, he must denounce his political activities in writing and reveal the password to his phone. On 6 March 2022, the authorities transferred him to Vakilabad prison in Mashhad and locked him there in a room where prisoners are held in isolation. For a month, the authorities forced him to share the room with five or six other prisoners who were charged with or convicted of robbery and murder and had records of assault and self-harm. For example, Abbas Vahedian reported that one of the prisoners had dozens of self-inflicted stab injuries on his body and regularly burned himself with a heated spoon in prison. These conditions caused Abbas Vahedian mental anguish and sparked fears about his safety. On 4 April 2022, after his family and lawyer publicly spoke out, the authorities removed the abovementioned prisoners from the room and placed a prisoner also held for politically motivated reasons next to him.    
Throughout his imprisonment period, intelligence agents and prison officials have repeatedly withheld the medication that Abbas Vahedian needs for various health problems, including high blood pressure, high levels of lipid in his blood, lung complications and a skin condition, and on many occasions, when he has complained of pain, they have simply given him painkillers. Abbas Vahedian’s family understands that the authorities have also failed to vaccinate him against Covid-19. This is while he has a history of lung complications including breathing difficulties and a persistent cough and is at increased risk of severe illness if he contracts Covid-19 in prison. Abbas Vahedian also suffers from gum disease, which emerged during his previous 11-month imprisonment in 2019 and 2020 as a result of medical neglect of the open wounds he sustained in his mouth during arrest. In December 2021, after repeated follow-ups by his family, he was transferred to a dental clinic outside prison and two of his teeth were pulled out. No adequate pain relief or further care were provided, despite warnings by his dentist that he would risk worsening gum infections and tooth loss without long-term routine dental treatment.   
On 26 February 2022, Abbas Vahedian was transferred, while semi-conscious, to a hospital in Mashhad and admitted to a department specializing in drug toxicity. The authorities refused to provide his family with any information about the causes and circumstances leading to his partial loss of consciousness and hospitalization. According to an informed source, he said at the hospital that his health deteriorated after the authorities put unknown drugs in his food. On 28 February 2022, his family learned from hospital staff that he had been forcibly discharged against medical advice and while still disoriented. The authorities held him incommunicado for 48 hours and refused to provide his family with any information about his fate or whereabouts until his relatives spoke out publicly. In a brief phone call granted on 2 March 2022, he told his family that he had been returned to the informal, unmarked Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Mashhad where he had been held in solitary confinement since 1 September 2021. He confirmed to his family that he had fainted after eating tainted food. He also said that three nights before his latest hospitalization, that is, on 24 February 2022, he had also been brought to hospital with dangerously high blood pressure. The authorities interrupted his treatment on that occasion as well and returned him to prison against medical advice.  
Abbas Vahedian has been sentenced to a total of 21 years in prison on spurious “national security” charges solely stemming from his peaceful political activism. This consists of an 11-year prison sentence imposed in December 2021 for his peaceful work with political groups, which call for the formation of a secular democratic system in Iran, and a 10-year prison sentence imposed in October 2021 for authoring and co-signing an open letter, published in June 2019, which called for the resignation of Iran’s Supreme Leader and a fundamental change to the country’s constitution. In both cases, he was suddenly taken, without prior notice and information about the nature of charges against him, from detention to the Revolutionary Court of Mashhad, and told by judges whom he has described as aggressive and biased that he was on trial for acting against “national security”. In both instances, he responded that due to the serious legal breaches committed, he did not recognize the legitimacy of the court hearings and insisted that his lawyer be present. In both cases, the presiding judges ended the hearings within minutes and refused to reconvene. He was only allowed to meet his lawyer once in late December 2021 after his second verdict was issued.

0,China: Families of Xinjiang detainees speak out as they await long-overdue UN report,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/china-families-of-xinjiang-detainees-speak-out-as-they-await-long-overdue-un-report/,"Almost 50 new detainees added to Amnesty International campaign on arbitrary detention, bringing total to 120 Family members describe injustice and horror of prolonged separation UN High Commissioner yet to release report on situation despite recent Xinjiang visit Amnesty International today...","Amnesty International today published heartbreaking new testimony from relatives of 48 ethnic Uyghur and Kazakh people detained in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, as it reiterated its call for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to take action.The outgoing High Commissioner, Michelle Bachelet, has yet to release a long-awaited report on serious human rights violations in Xinjiang, and has repeatedly failed to recognize the gravity of violations by Chinese authorities in the region. It is deeply disappointing that due to this delay, yet another UN Human Rights Council session will close this week without having been able to discuss the UN’s findings on Xinjiang.The new testimony gathered by Amnesty International is part of its Free Xinjiang Detainees campaign, which now tells the stories of 120 individuals who have been swept up in China’s vast system of prisons and internment camps in Xinjiang.“The accounts of these families offer a window into the horrors taking place in Xinjiang, which amount to crimes against humanity. Many people said they have several family members in detention, illustrating the industrial scale of the abuses – one man said 40 of his relatives had been detained,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.“The foot-dragging which has characterized the UN response to the dystopian nightmare in Xinjiang adds insult to injury for victims and survivors of China’s campaign of mass imprisonment, torture and persecution against predominantly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang since 2017. We continue to call on the Chinese government to dismantle its vast system of internment camps; end all arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and ill-treatment whether in prisons or other locations; and end its horrific persecution of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang.“Chinese authorities must be held accountable, and a crucial step is for High Commissioner Bachelet to publish her long-delayed report that should be presented urgently at the UN Human Rights Council. Her ongoing failure to call out crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations in Xinjiang is an obstacle to justice. It also puts the UN system to shame.” 
Chinese authorities must be held accountable, and a crucial step is for High Commissioner Bachelet to publish her long-delayed report that should be presented urgently at the UN Human Rights Council. Her ongoing failure to call out crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations in Xinjiang is an obstacle to justice. It also puts the UN system to shame. 
“She was seven weeks pregnant. She was on her way to the hospital to have some checks on the pregnancy when her mom called her saying that there were police at home waiting for her. She went back home. From there…no news [from her].” Almas’ wife, Buzaynap Abdureshit, is now in prison. 
“To be killed is one thing but living without being in touch with the family is also a very hard feeling.” Mafivet’s uncle, Abudumijiti Abudula, was arrested allegedly for travelling abroad. 
“I could not sleep for several days… I have been arrested by the Chinese [authorities] in the past. The police are very brutal. They treat us very badly. Only if all the people of the world together will take action to stop China’s oppression, then this oppression will end.” Habubulla’s brother Zekeriya Emet is currently in prison. 
“We want to live [freely] like you. We want to live in our own country. We want to sit [on the same table] with our relatives and eat together.” Minawa’s younger brother, Aniver Ablimit, is currently in prison. 
“We [Uyghurs] have committed no crimes, yet we are being detained in camps and we are experiencing lives full of suffering.” Abuduaini’s brothers, Ablet Ablez and Abdulshukür Ablez, are in a prison or an internment camp. 
“If the Chinese government says, ‘the people there are living happily with normal lives’, I should be able to communicate with my own family normally. My family members and especially my mother who is 70 years old should be at home, not in a camp.” Selamet’s sister, Muherrem Muhammed Tursun, is either in prison or in an internment camp. 
“On one hand, they [Chinese authorities] detained my father and mother, on the other hand, my brother and sister, my own children, my wife whom I loved and married. They did not leave anyone of my loved ones, I am the only one who remained.” Abudureheman’s wife and parents have been arbitrarily detained. 
“There is no court, they just put him in jail, tell him 25 years, nobody knows, I don’t think himself knows the reason. Somebody said because he travelled to Kazakhstan. There is no clear justifications and reason.” Gulaisha’s brother, Dilshat Oralbay, is currently in prison. 
“My mom was arrested in mid-March 2018 because she attended a religious ceremony in 2013. I felt very sad, I was mentally broken because my mother was ill at the time… I really miss her face, I always imagine I could see her.” Memet’s mother, Baishihan Hushur, is in an internment camp. 
“We can’t describe the feelings that we had [when we heard he was arrested]…Why did they arrest him. He was not a guy who would do any bad things. We were surprised that they arrested him. We didn’t know the reason.” Zohre’s cousin, Muhammedali Omer, is in prison. 
“When I heard my sister was being subjected to such atrocities in camps, I wished it was me instead…At some point I couldn’t take it anymore, I was having bad dreams, I couldn’t stop crying. I had a psychological breakdown. I didn’t want to talk to anyone.” Tursuncan’s sister, Aygul Ablet, is in an internment camp. 
Amnesty International recently carried out in-person interviews in Turkey with exiled relatives of 48 detainees. They described how their loved ones had been arrested for “terrorism”-related or other spurious charges, apparently for things as mundane as traveling or paying for their children’s education abroad. Others appear to have been arrested solely on the basis of their religion or ethnicity.Gulaisha Oralbay, a Kazakh woman, described what happened to her brother, Dilshat Oralbay, a retired Kazakh journalist and translator, after the Chinese authorities coaxed him into returning to Xinjiang from Kazakhstan in 2017. His passport was confiscated immediately upon his return, and he was arrested several months later.“There is no court, they just put him in jail, [and told him it would be] for 25 years,” Gulaisha said. 
“I don’t even think [he] himself knows the reason. Somebody said [it was] because he travelled to Kazakhstan, and different excuses; there is no clear justification and reason.”Gulaisha and Dilshat’s two sisters, Bakytgul and Bagila Oralbay, are also in detention.Abdullah Rasul told Amnesty International how his brother Parhat Rasul, a Uyghur farmer and part-time butcher, was detained and taken to an internment camp in May 2017. The family have not heard from him directly since then, but in 2018 a reliable source told them Parhat had been sentenced to nine years in prison.Parhat’s family believes that he was arrested simply because he is an observant Muslim and was doing charity work. Family members said Parhat’s wife Kalbinur and his mother-in-law Parizat Abdugul were also imprisoned. Parhat and Kalbinur have two daughters, aged 14 and 16, and a son aged 11.“They [the Chinese government] want to erase our identity, erase our culture, erase our religion,” Abdullah Rasul said. “I hope everyone can see clearly what is happening in our homeland.” 
[The Chinese government] want to erase our identity, erase our culture, erase our religion. I hope everyone can see clearly what is happening in our homeland.” 
Medine Nazimi described how she last heard the voice of her sister, Mevlüde Hilal, at the end of 2016. Mevlüde had been studying in Turkey but, after she returned to Xinjiang to help her ailing mother, she was sent to an internment camp in 2017 and later allegedly sentenced to 10 years in prison on a charge of “separatism”. She is married and has a young daughter.“When they took my sister, my niece, Aisha, was only one year old,” Medine told Amnesty International. “We were just going about our daily lives, and we were a happy family. My sister was taken for only one reason: it’s because she’s a Uyghur.”People who speak out about the situation do so at great risk; several family members of detainees described being threatened by the authorities for going public.Abudurehman Tothi, a Uyghur businessman and activist living in Turkey was interviewed by international media about his wife and mother’s imprisonment and father’s arbitrary detention. He told Amnesty International that afterwards the Chinese consulate in Turkey contacted him and threatened him with detention or death in a “car crash”. 
Since 2017, there has been extensive documentation of China’s crackdown against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, carried out under the guise of fighting “terrorism”. In 2021, a comprehensive report by Amnesty International demonstrated that the systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution perpetrated by Chinese authorities were crimes against humanity.Chinese authorities have used their repressive surveillance state to try to sweep these violations under the carpet, but information continues to seep out of Xinjiang. In May 2022, several international media outlets published a joint investigation, the Xinjiang Police Files, which included a cache of leaked speeches, images, documents and spreadsheets obtained from Chinese internal police networks.“Despite a growing body of evidence, Chinese authorities are still lying to the world about arbitrary detention on a massive scale in Xinjiang,” said Agnès Callamard.“Amnesty International supports the joint call by dozens of UN experts to establish an independent, impartial and international mechanism. Such a mechanism must investigate crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations committed by the Chinese government in Xinjiang. The many thousands of people still arbitrarily detained, and their families, deserve truth, justice and accountability.” 
The many thousands of people still arbitrarily detained, and their families, deserve truth, justice and accountability. 
Bachelet should as a matter of urgency address the demands of the detainees’ families and indicate whether her office has been able to take any steps towards facilitating information on those detained. 
The UN Human Rights Council’s 50th session is ongoing and will end on 8 July. It will be the last with Michelle Bachelet as High Commissioner; her mandate ends on 31 August 2022 and she has announced she will not seek a second term.At the end of May, in a press conference following her long-awaited trip to China – including a brief visit to Xinjiang, Bachelet failed to acknowledge serious human rights violations in China. Her statement at the end of her visit undermined efforts to advance accountability in the region, instead giving the impression she had walked straight into a highly predictable propaganda exercise for the Chinese government. She admitted afterwards that she could not speak to any detained Uyghurs or their families while in Xinjiang, and was accompanied by state officials at all times in the region.

Unjustly jailed Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace, who has been on a hunger strike for a year, since 8 July 2021, announced on 29 June that he would also stop taking salts, in protest at the Bahraini authorities’ withholding some of his medication, increasing concerns over the deterioration of his already poor health. Abduljalil al-Singace, a Bahraini academic and human rights defender, has served over 11 years of a life sentence in Bahrain’s Jaw prison for his peaceful role in Bahrain’s 2011 uprising. He must be immediately and unconditionally released, and pending that, granted immediate access to any necessary healthcare.  
Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace (60) is serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in Bahrain’s 2011 uprising. He has been imprisoned for over 11 years, solely for exercising his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. On 29 June, Abduljalil al-Singace, who has been on hunger strike since 8 July 2021, announced that he would also stop taking salts – which stabilize his health while abstaining from food – to protest the authorities’ failure to promptly grant him his prescribed medication, including eye drops and analgesic creams for joint and muscle pain, which he needs daily.  
A year ago, Abduljalil al-Singace began his hunger strike, consuming only liquids, to protest the prison authorities’ confiscation of his book on Bahraini dialects that he spent four years researching and writing. On 18 July 2021, authorities transferred him from Jaw prison to the Kanoo Medical Centre, where he remains held. The same month, the Bahrain Ministry of Interior Ombudsperson declared that his book could not be handed to his family until a “legal decision” was made. In November 2021, a legal decision clarified the apolitical nature of the book and yet the book has still not been returned. In March 2022, the Ombudsperson’s representative visited Abduljalil al-Singace and asked him to edit and resubmit the book for the authorities to review, warning of “legal consequences” if it is published without authorization.  
Abduljalil al-Singace suffers from multiple medical conditions, including severe intermittent headaches, a prostate problem, arthritis in his shoulder joint, tremors, numbness, and diminished eyesight. In January 2022, his neurologist requested a CT scan but the authorities are refusing Abduljalil al-Singace’s request for it be performed at the Salmaniya Medical Complex, run by the Ministry of Health, and insist for it to be conducted at the King Hamad Military Hospital. Abduljalil al-Singace does not believe that he would receive adequate and timely healthcare at King Hamad Military Hospital given that he has yet to be informed of the result of an MRI scan of his shoulder taken there in October 2021.

Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace is a Bahraini academic, blogger, and human rights defender. He was among 14 opposition activists who were arrested between 17 March and 9 April 2011 during the Bahrain uprising. Most were arrested in the middle of the night by groups of security officers who raided their houses and took them to an unknown location, where they were held incommunicado for weeks. Many of the 14 activists have alleged they were tortured during their first few days of detention when they were being interrogated by officers from the National Security Agency (NSA). None of them were allowed to see their lawyers during NSA interrogations following their arrests. Some saw their lawyers during questioning by the military prosecutor ahead of the trial, while others were only allowed to see them during the first court hearing in May 2011, which was the first time any of the activists had seen their families since their arrest. On 22 June 2011, Bahrain’s National Safety Court, a military court, announced its verdict and sentenced them to between two years and life in prison after convicting them of multiple charges including “setting up terror groups to topple the royal regime and change the constitution”. In April 2012, the case was transferred to a civilian court for an appeal trial. On 6 January 2013, the Cassation Court confirmed the verdict.  
In June 2011, the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI) was appointed by Royal Order to investigate and report on human rights violations committed following the anti-government protests in February and March 2011. At the launch of the BICI report in November 2011, the government publicly committed to implement the recommendations set out in the report. Instead, it went onto a path of sustained repression over the past decade, disbanding opposition groups and independent media and sentencing peaceful activists to long prison terms. The BICI report documented the torture and other ill-treatment of Dr. Abduljalil al-Singace, reporting that police had subjected him to nightly beatings for two months while placed in solitary confinement, targeted his disability by confiscating his crutches, making him “stand on one leg for prolonged periods”, pushing his crutch “into his genitals”, and “threatened him with rape and made sexually explicit comments about his wife and his daughter”.

He maintains that he is innocent and that he was abducted in November 2018 and tortured to extract a “confession”. Oleksandr Marchenko has survived thyroid cancer and has multiple health issues. Russian authorities are denying him the medical care that he urgently requires which poses a risk to his life and may amount to torture.   
In 2016, Oleksandr Marchenko had his thyroid removed due to cancer. Following the surgery, he requires daily medication, monthly blood tests and other medical examinations once every three months. However, since he was deprived of his liberty in 2018, he had only had one blood test privately arranged by his family in July 2021. According to Oleksandr Marchenko’s lawyers, on at least two occasions he was denied the medication he requires by the penitentiary authorities for extended periods. First, in April-May 2021, while he was being held in remand centre SIZO-1 and penal colony IK-14 in Krasnodar, and from 12 to 28 December 2021 while being held in SIZO-1 in Ulan-Ude, Buryatia. Being deprived from his vital medication caused a significant deterioration of his health. Currently, in penal colony IK-8, he is denied the regular tests he requires, while the vital medication has to be supplied by his family at their own cost. The denial of medical care may amount to torture or other ill-treatment.    
According to Oleksandr Marchenko’s lawyers, the administration of SIZO-1 in Ulan-Ude issued death threats against him and threatened him with sexual violence. He was also reportedly placed in a punishment cell for 15 days with a man who had tuberculosis, for trying to contact the Ukrainian Consul. In March 2022, the administration of the penal colony IK-8 placed him in a disciplinary cell for 28 days, for his pro-Ukrainian views.

Ukrainian citizen Oleksandr (Aleksandr) Marchenko told his lawyers that in December 2018 he travelled from Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, via Russia to Donetsk, in Russia-occupied eastern Ukraine, on personal business. On 18 December 2018, he was abducted by masked men when crossing back into Russia. According to Oleksandr Marchenko, the men put a bag over his head, took away his mobile phone and other personal belongings, and drove him to a secret prison belonging to the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic” (DNR). There he was held incommunicado in the basement, in a cell without windows, bed, toilet or running water. From the first day of his abduction Oleksandr Marchenko was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including electrocution, until he agreed to read out his self-incriminating “confession” on video.  
On 18 February 2019, he was made to sign papers that he had no complaints against the “Ministry of State Security of the DNR”, was driven to the Russian border and was handed over to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The FSB officers put a bag over Oleksandr Marchenko’s head and drove him for several hours to the Krasnodar Regional FSB. There, he was questioned about a man whom he says he had never met. Oleksandr Marchenko told his lawyers that after the questioning FSB officers took him to a police station where he spent the following night. Based on a fabricated record of an administrative offence, drawn by police, a court ruled the next day to have Oleksandr Marchenko detained for 10 days. Subsequently, the police fabricated two more administrative cases against Oleksandr Marchenko – each time on the day when he would have served in full his previous administrative detention (on 1 March 2019 and 16 March 2019), and he continued to be kept in custody.   
During his arbitrary administrative detention, FSB officials, together with “security officials” from the “DNR”, repeatedly interrogated Oleksandr Marchenko and made him sign a “confession”. They made threats against him and his family, and denied him access to a lawyer. On 1 May 2019, Oleksandr Marchenko was remanded by a court accused of contraband, initially for two months. This detention was subsequently extended several times. On 6 December 2019 Oleksandr Marchenko was charged with espionage. On 26 November 2020, the Krasnodar Regional Court found Oleksandr Marchenko guilty under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code (“Espionage”) and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment in a strict regime penal colony. His appeals were rejected.   
Amnesty International and other organizations monitoring human rights have documented cases of individuals deprived of their liberty by the so-called “Ministry of State Security” in Russia-occupied eastern Ukraine who placed them in secret detention and subjected them to torture and other ill-treatment in order to extract a forced “confession”, which was then used for their “conviction”. For more details about such practices, please see the joint report by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, You Don’t Exist: Arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, and torture in eastern Ukraine.

Thai authorities charged her for her human rights work under Covid-19 emergency regulations, which they have used to suppress peaceful dissent. She has a court hearing scheduled for late August 2022 and would face up to four years’ imprisonment for two criminal proceedings if prosecuted and found guilty. Amnesty International calls on the Thai authorities to drop all proceedings against Sitanun, and for a safe and enabling environment to be provided for all human rights defenders.  
Proceedings against her under the 2005 Emergency Decree, invoked to control the Covid-19 pandemic, were initiated following her presence at a public assembly in Bangkok on 5 September 2021 and the presentation of a petition handed to the United Nations on 10 December 2021. In April 2022, an NGO reported that Sitanun’s name and personal details appeared on a Thai security forces’ watch-list alleged to have been passed to local police which may mean she is under unlawful surveillance.  
Sitanun Satsaksit is a human rights defender who has been campaigning for an investigation into the abduction of her younger brother by unknown persons in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 4 June 2020. His fate and whereabouts are still unknown. The charges against Sitanun Satsaksit stem solely from her rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and are hindering her ability to campaign for her brother and for strengthened protection of human rights in Thailand.

Sitanun Satsaksit’s last telephone conversation with her younger brother, Wanchalearm Satsaksit, a social and political activist, was interrupted when he was abducted by unknown persons in Cambodia. While she has tirelessly sought justice for him, his fate and whereabouts remain unknown and the circumstances of his abduction are yet to be clarified. The measures that Cambodian and Thai authorities have taken to investigate his disappearance result directly from Sitanun’s advocacy. Thailand’s Department of Special Investigations opened an investigation into his case in March 2022 – almost two years after his abduction.   
Official measures to establish Wanchalearm’s whereabouts have been limited and delayed. Cambodian authorities have failed to act promptly and investigate his abduction thoroughly, independently, and effectively. As well as trying to seek justice for her brother, like many human rights defenders in Thailand, Sitanun is now also forced to dedicate her time and resources to defend herself against unwarranted criminal proceedings for peacefully exercising her rights and to determine whether she has been unlawfully surveilled.   
Sitanun decided to speak out to help other relatives who face similar ordeals to secure justice and determine the fate and whereabouts of their family member after they have gone missing. She has joined civil society campaigns urging Thailand’s House of Representatives to pass a delayed draft law criminalising enforced disappearances and torture. The law could lead to strengthening measures to investigate and prevent suspected enforced disappearances, in and outside Thailand.   
The first set of criminal proceedings against her began following her speech in support of Thai parliament passing a law against torture and enforced disappearances at a peaceful rally on 5 September 2021, held at a busy intersection in central Bangkok. Police subsequently filed criminal proceedings under the Emergency Decree against Sitanun and others on the basis that a group of more than 25 people imposed a risk of spreading Covid-19. She is also accused of gathering with around a dozen activists on International Human Rights Day outside the UN Headquarters in Bangkok before submitting petitions about their human rights concerns – in her case, about Wanchalearm. Police started separate criminal proceedings against her and five others. If convicted on both counts, Sitanun would face up to four years’ imprisonment and a fine of up to 80,000 baht (around $2,250 USD).  
Amnesty International has documented with concern how social and political activists, students and young people have been targeted and harassed by the Thai authorities under Covid-19 emergency powers. The authorities have used these regulations discriminatorily and have opened unfounded criminal proceedings against people that have peacefully exercised their rights, including in pro-democracy and reform protests held since May 2020. Among them are individuals who petitioned the Cambodian embassy or publicly gathered to call for an investigation to establish Wanchalearm’s fate and whereabouts. Prosecutors and courts have previously dismissed several charges filed under the Emergency Decree, stating that individuals were exercising their constitutional rights and should therefore not be prosecuted or subject to penalties.

The organization highlighted several recent decisions and practices which appear to demonstrate double standards and a willingness to be influenced by powerful states. 
For example, in 2020 the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) decided not to investigate war crimes by UK forces in Iraq, despite its own finding that these crimes had been committed. This was followed by a decision in 2021 to deprioritize an investigation into war crimes in Afghanistan by US and Afghan national forces, with Prosecutor Karim Khan citing viability and budget constraints. But just six months later, the Prosecutor launched his office’s largest ever investigation in Ukraine, for which he had sought ‘voluntary’ financial assistance from member states – much of which was ‘earmarked’ by states for the Ukraine investigation. 
The ICC’s budgetary excuses for inaction on Afghanistan, Nigeria and others can no longer be maintained. 
“Twenty years ago the ICC opened its doors for the first time, following a historic decision to create a permanent international criminal court with jurisdiction over the most serious international crimes. For victims and survivors who had been denied justice, the ICC offered a glimmer of hope that perpetrators would be held to account,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“But it has appeared to veer off course in recent years, with recent decisions by the ICC Prosecutor raising concerns that the court may be heading towards a hierarchical system of international justice. There must be no doubt: the investigation in Ukraine is urgent and vital. But it shows that the ICC’s budgetary excuses for inaction on Afghanistan, Nigeria and others can no longer be maintained. 
“The response to the situation in Ukraine has shown what the ICC is capable of. We now call on the Office of the Prosecutor, and on states parties, to ensure that all investigations receive the same standard of treatment, so that all victims of international crimes have equal access to justice.” 
The international community has shown unprecedented support for the ICC since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Governments who have previously opposed ICC investigations involving their own nationals or political allies have actively encouraged the OTP to investigate crimes committed in Ukraine. 
Meanwhile, the ICC has recently begun accepting voluntary funding and seconded personnel clearly ‘earmarked’ for the Ukraine situation. Without exceptional caution and sufficient transparency, this approach risks allowing states parties to support only those situations which align with their interests. This exacerbates the risk of selective justice and leaves the court vulnerable to manipulation by powerful states. 
Amnesty International is also concerned that the court and its principals have largely remained silent on the situation in Palestine and other investigations, in contrast to the publicity they have given to the Ukraine situation. This silence may have weakened the court’s deterrent effect, and has left a void which has been filled with political attacks on the court’s work, as well as attacks on human rights defenders. It is vital for the court’s credibility that its messaging does not appear politicized. 
On this twentieth anniversary, we still believe the ICC can play a unique role in the realization of the universal rights to remedy and reparations. 
Amnesty International is calling on the ICC to ensure that all funding is allocated in a non-discriminatory way and in accordance with the interests of justice, and to ensure that all victims of international crimes have equal access to the rights to remedy and reparations. In particular, and with its increased funds, the OTP should reprioritize its investigations into crimes committed by all parties in Afghanistan. It should also request judicial authority for its hibernated Nigeria investigation, and increase its activities in other situations where it has justified minimal progress with resource constraints. 
ICC states parties must ensure that all of the court’s investigations and activities are fully funded – they must not use their resources and cooperation as tools to influence which situations and parties are investigated. Meanwhile, all states who have not yet done so, including Ukraine, must ratify the Rome Statute. 
“On this twentieth anniversary, we still believe the ICC can play a unique role in the realization of the universal rights to remedy and reparations,” said Agnès Callamard. 
”To fulfil this role, the Prosecutor must pursue all investigations without distinction: into all perpetrators of atrocities, without fear or favour, and no matter how great the political or economic power of certain actors.”

Hangings have resumed in Singapore for drug related offenses, after Abdul Kahar bin Othman was executed on 30 March and Malaysian national Nagaenthran Dharmalingam was executed on 29 April, while on 28 April a third one was stayed. The executions of Malaysian national Kalwant Singh and another man are scheduled for 7 July. Both men were convicted of and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking, in violation of international law and standards. The government of Singapore must halt these executions, commute all existing death sentences and review national legislation to bring its use of the death penalty in line with international law and standards as urgent first steps towards full abolition of the death penalty.  
Singapore continues to resort to the death penalty for drug-related offences and as mandatory punishment, which are practices not only prohibited under international law and standards, but abandoned by the majority of the world’s countries. Against Singapore’s international commitments undertaken as a state party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a man with intellectual and mental disabilities has been executed. Several concerns on the fairness of the proceedings have further tainted the use of the death penalty against those convicted of drug trafficking.   
International law and standards set out restrictions on the use of the death penalty to protect against the arbitrary deprivation of life.   
Singapore is one of four countries known to have carried out executions for drug-related offences in recent years. Due to the country’s drug control law, judges are very limited in their ability to take into consideration possible mitigating circumstances at sentencing, including drug dependence or other circumstances relevant to the case. Unfortunately, Singapore’s highly punitive drug policies have failed not only to tackle the use and availability of drugs in the country, but also to offer effective protection from drug-related harm such as addressing root causes of drug use and adopting a health-based approach to drugs.

Additional information  
Kalwant Singh, a Malaysian national, was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty in 2016 for drug trafficking in 2013. The High Court found him to have been a “courier”, but the prosecution did not provide him with a certificate of substantive assistance, a requirement for the judges to be able to decide between the death penalty and life imprisonment with caning. His conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2016. Singapore authorities set his execution for 7 July 2022, leaving his family little time to make arrangements to travel from Malaysia.   
Another man was also convicted in the same case and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking. His execution is also scheduled for 7 July. A third co-defendant, on the other hand, who was deemed to have cooperated with the authorities in their cases was granted a certificate of substantive assistance and was sentenced to life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.  
Following amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act effective from 2013, judges in Singapore have some sentencing discretion in cases where the role of the defendant was limited to transporting drugs (“courier”) provided that the public prosecutor issue a certificate of substantive assistance with the authorities, or defendants are found to have mental or intellectual disabilities that substantially impaired their mental responsibility for their acts and omissions in relation to the offence. Alarmingly, if the prosecution does not provide a certificate of substantive assistance after a defendant is found to be a “courier”, the court is deprived of any discretionary powers and must sentence the accused to death, shifting the sentencing decision in practice to the prosecution.   
Malaysian Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, was executed on 29 April 2022, despite international outcry. Medical experts who assessed Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam in 2013, 2016 and 2017 found that he has borderline functioning intelligence and concurrent cognitive deficits, which “may have contributed toward his misdirected loyalty and poor assessment of the risks in agreeing to carry out the offence”. In the ruling of his final appeal on 29 March 2022, the court rejected arguments about the decline of his mental state, and they have similarly dismissed challenges based on his intellectual ability. The treaty bodies for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), to which Singapore is a party, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have clarified that these treaties prohibit the imposition of the death penalty on people whose mental and intellectual disabilities have impeded their effective defence.   
Abdul Kahar bin Othman was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty in 2015. His family were provided notice and asked to make arrangements for last visits in a letter dated 23 March, prior to his execution on 30 March. The hangings of Dharmalingam and Othman appear to be part of a new wave. A third man, Datchinamurthy Kataiah had his executed stayed on 28 April, a day before it was due to be carried out, after he petitioned – unrepresented – the court for a stay as he had another appeal ongoing. International safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty prohibit executions from being carried out when appeals are pending.   
International law and standards prohibit the imposition of mandatory death sentences as these deny judges the possibility of taking into account the mitigating circumstances in the case. Moreover, international law and standards require that the imposition of the death penalty be restricted to the “most serious crimes” involving intentional killing. Of additional concern remains the possible reliance by the prosecution on legal presumptions under Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act, meaning that any person who is proved to have in their possession certain amounts of prohibited substances can be presumed to have knowledge of the substance contained in the package and its quantity, and to have had that drug in their possession for the purpose of trafficking, unless they can prove differently, in contravention of the right to the presumption of innocence.  
The last execution before March 2022 was carried out in November 2019, prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. The authorities set further executions in 2020 and 2021, but these were eventually stayed because of pending appeals. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception. As of today, 110 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and more than two-thirds are abolitionist in law or practice.

His arrest stems from a declaration he made on Al Jazeera TV the day before in which he mentioned that the army had refused presidential orders to shutter the headquarters of the Tunisian General Labor Union. Salah Attia is currently detained in Mornaguia prison in Tunis pending further investigation. He is the second journalist and the 12th civilian at least to be prosecuted by the military court since President Kais Saied’s power grab. Amnesty International calls for his immediate release. We also call on the authorities to limit the use of military courts only to try military personnel for breaches of military discipline.  
On the evening of 10 June 2022, Salah Attia appeared remotely on Al Jazeera TV where he sometimes appears as a political analyst on Tunisia. In his remarks he states that President Saied asked the army to enforce the closure of the office of the Tunisian General Labor Union (Union Générale des Travailleurs Tunisiens – UGTT), but that the army had refused and had subsequently informed the UGTT of the order. Salah Attia also said that, in addition, President Saied had asked the army to impose house arrest on a number of political leaders – whom Attia did not name – and that the army had refused this request as well.  
On 11 June, UGTT issued a press release to deny the journalist’s claims. Salah Attia is charged with “inciting people to take up arms against one another, and causing disorder, murder, and plunder on Tunisian territory”. , accusing public officials without proof of illegal acts, denigrating the army, as well as “intentionally harming others or disturbing their peace through telecommunication networks”, under article 72 of the Penal Code which carries the death penalty, article 128 of the Penal Code, Article 91 of the Military Code of Justice and Article 86 of the Telecommunications Code, respectively. Salah Attia is set to appear for audience before an investigative judge at the military court on 7 July according to his lawyer Samir Dilou.    
Salah Attia’s prosecution by a military court violates Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Tunisia has ratified. That article guarantees the right to “a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.” His prosecution also undermines his rights to freedom of expression as it is based on his remarks on Al Jazeera which are protected speech under international law.

Salah Attia is a journalist, he is the founder and editor in chief of the online Arabic news outlet Al Ray Al Jadid (the new opinion). The website publishes Tunisian and international news. From time to time, Salah Attia is interviewed by other media as a political analyst on Tunisia.    
On the evening of 11 June, police officers in civilians’ clothes went to Salah Attia’s home in Hay Ettahrir in Tunis where they found his wife and two of his three children. The officers wanted to search the house despite not showing a warrant, but Salah Attia’s wife refused according to his daughter Sondes Attia who was not present but shared with Amnesty International what her family told her. The officers asked to speak to Salah Attia on the phone who told them his location in a café in the Ibn Khaldun neighbourhood. Police went to the café and arrested Salah Attia.  
Police officers escorted Salah Attia to his home where he changed clothes and then took him away in their car to the military facility of El Aouina for interrogation. They questioned him on the source of his claims about the army as well as his purpose in going public with the story.   
After questioning him on the evening of 11 June, police officers transported Salah Attia to Bouchoucha, a detention facility in Tunis, pending his appearance before a military court on Monday 13 June. The investigation against Salah Attia was opened by the Military Court of First Instance, Tunis, one of his lawyers, Samir Dilou, told Amnesty International.   
On 13 June, police brought Salah Attia for a hearing before an investigative judge at the Military Court of First Instance, Tunis. One of his lawyers, Malek Ben Amor, told Amnesty International that the investigation is based solely on his remarks on Al Jazeera TV on 10 June. The investigative judge asked Salah Attia to name his source, but he refused, according to the same lawyer, who attended the hearing.    
Amnesty International documented an alarming pattern since President Saied’s power grab on 25 July 2021 of recourse to the military justice system to prosecute civilians, including journalists, parliamentarians, a lawyer and a social media user.  
Tunisia’s military courts do not fulfil the requirement of independence because the president has final say over the appointment of judges and prosecutors to military courts. In addition, both the general prosecutor who heads the military justice system, as well as all prosecutors in the military courts, who play a pivotal role in initiating proceedings, are serving members of the military and subject to military disciplinary procedures. This places them under the influence of the executive branch, since the president is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces under Tunisia’s constitution.  
Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Tunisia is a state party, everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes “freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds.” The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression considered that “Custodial sentences for defamation are not justifiable; all laws that provide for criminal penalties for defamation should be abolished and replaced, if necessary, by appropriate civil defamation laws.” The UN Human Rights Committee, the treaty body that is an authoritative interpreter of state duties under the ICCPR, considered that it is not legitimate for states “…to suppress or withhold from the public information of legitimate public interest that does not harm national security or to prosecute journalists, researchers, environmental activists, human rights defenders, or others, for having disseminated such information….”  
In addition, in his April 20, 2010 report, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, stated:  
Criminal defamation laws may not be used to protect abstract or subjective notions or concepts, such as the State, national symbols, national identity, cultures, schools of thought, religions, ideologies or political doctrines.

His current research is on the conflicts between LGBTQ2S identities and Muslim cultures, and the experiences of LGBTQ2S Muslims, including a funded research project on LGBTQ Muslims in Canada. He has presented this work at international academic conferences and at private policy meetings with the United Nations Human Rights Council. His published works appear in and include The Oxford Handbook of Global LGBT and Sexual Diversity Politics (2020, co-edited with Michael Bosia and Sandra McEvoy, Oxford University Press), Homosexualities, Muslim Cultures and Modernity, (2014, Palgrave Macmillan), Gender and Sexuality (2010, with Stevi Jackson, Polity) and Sexuality and Democracy (2000, Edinburgh University Press).  
In April 2022, Sort Of won Best Comedy Series at the Canadian Screen Awards. This CBC show centres on a gender-fluid, second-generation Pakistani-Canadian Muslim who is navigating love and family in a multicultural and sexually diverse Toronto. In 2020, Samra Habib’s queer Muslim memoir, We Have Always Been Here won ‘Canada Reads’ – the national book competition run by the CBC. As Sort Of and Habib’s memoir rightly assert, we exist! There are Queer Muslim Canadians, but I also want to complicate any assumptions of ‘progress’ that this visibility may imply, particularly during Pride Month, when we mostly emphasize the increasing acceptance queer people in Canada. 
The reality is that there are both public and private difficulties and exclusions for queer Muslims that are more visually described by the slashes in this essay’s title. In Canada and around the world, being queer and being Muslim is often understood as a dichotomy, and being Muslim and Canadian also remains in tension, evidenced by anti-religious laws in Quebec, the murder a Muslim family in London, Ontario in 2021, and the targeted killings of Muslims at the Quebec City Mosque in 2017.  
I write as a queer Muslim heritage racialized immigrant to Canada, whose academic work has focused on developing an analytical framework of ‘Muslim Queer as Intersectionality’. This framework means thinking of queer Muslims as an intersection of queer, Muslim and Canadian, and using this lens to interrogate the assumptions of all three identities. An intersectional research agenda would begin with the distinct experiences of LGBTQ Muslims within the specific identities of both Muslim and queer. Queer Muslims are racialized queer individuals whose identities should not be reduced to ‘minority’ versions of being either Muslim or queer, because we suffer specific compounding exclusions of homophobias, racism and Islamophobia. However, we also exist as part of the two larger identities and, therefore, our issues also impact understandings of both Canadian queerness and Canadian multiculturalism.  
Understanding the complexities of contemporary queer Muslim existence and regulation forces us to think about how queer politics needs to understand and confront colonial inheritances of sexuality tied to racialization, and at the same time ask questions of Muslim cultures about their denial of ‘Eastern’ gender and sexual traditions. 
It is this precise understanding that would disrupt the apparent opposition of queer (as Western) and Muslim (as Eastern), leading us towards a more decolonial understanding of complex cultural differences in sexualities. For example, while all cultures, Muslim or otherwise, have often been patriarchal historically, many Muslim cultures also suffer from colonial impositions of anti-queer laws and culture, narrowing the acceptability of gender diversity and sexual expression in order to reinforce a heterosexual property-based model of relationships that was crucial to legitimizing western colonial power. Many Muslim leaderships now buy into these ideas, recovering heterosexism for their postcolonial cultures and thus denying the traditions of gender and sexual diversity that we know existed historically. Understanding the complexities of contemporary queer Muslim existence and regulation forces us to think about how queer politics need to understand and confront colonial inheritances of sexuality tied to racialization, and at the same time ask questions of Muslim cultures about their denial of ‘Eastern’ gender and sexual traditions. 
Focusing on queer Muslim experiences exposes the imperfections and incompletions of frequently taken-for-granted understandings of the categories LGBTQ or Muslim and, moreover, opens up a way to create pathways to commonality and acceptance that are necessary for both communities. There are common themes within the lived experiences of queer Muslim Canadians. First, there is the expectation and experience of homophobia from immediate family and the wider community, which is based on the view that public homosexuality (i.e. being out) is seen by Muslim communities as a western phenomenon. Furthermore, many queer Muslims describe the lack of a community to support them, specifically a group of other queer Muslims, but also from mainstream Muslim and LGBTQ organizations. For those who profess faith, a common reaction to this is to seek to engage with Islamic scripture on an individual basis, searching for ways to reconcile sexual diversity and Islam. Many, however, identify as culturally Muslim, with family and community anchoring their sense of self instead of the specific religious identity. Finally, racialization plays a key part of how queer Muslims experience their everyday lives and their queerness and, to a lesser extent, how they perceive this as part of the wider cultural antipathy towards Islam and Muslim minorities in the West and internationally.   
These realities presents challenges to both LGBTQ and Muslim communities. For the former, there must be an understanding that the journey and end point of ‘coming out’ is not universal, and is not the only path towards a fully realized queer life. Many queer Muslims have said they are happy not to be out to their families or extended communities, while still being able to live a queer social and sexual life. They may share their identities with select (and chosen) family members and friends and otherwise live a life in social worlds outside of Muslim communities. Other queer Muslims have come out and have received varying levels of support from family and friends, but still too often not from the wider Muslim community. Westerners may react to this knowledge as a ‘limited’ queer existence, but it should be questioned whether that assumption is based on western experiences of secularization, gender differences and the equation of sexuality with core individualism. Questioning these assumptions is what a true decolonial process looks like. This is not to suggest that cultural homophobias should be accepted without question, but rather that we employ a decolonial analysis that considers racialization when challenging queer oppressions. For example, the role of Islamophobia in making Muslim communities resistant to queer acceptance needs to be explored more, as does the motivation of Muslim religious and political leaders in embracing the colonial-era version of a rigid heterosexual norm. Much of the research evidence shows that families draw on wider political ideas of queerness versus Islam, even when they are aware of their own historical cultural traditions of gender and sexual diversity.  
Queer organizations thus need to be active allies in challenging racism and Islamophobia, because not all their members are white or culturally secular and because queer rights discourse can be coopted into the racist and Islamophobic rhetoric that’s deployed in the disparaging portrayals and ‘othering’ of Muslims.  
None of these pathways can be established without first, the validation of queer Muslim knowledge and experiences. Too often, we are excluded from mainstream Muslim and queer groups, politics and communities. Queer organizations thus need to be active allies in challenging racism and Islamophobia, because not all their members are white or culturally secular and because Western queer rights discourse can be coopted into the racist and Islamophobic rhetoric that’s deployed in the disparaging portrayals and ‘othering’ of Muslims. As queers, we should have no part of that stigmatization. Supporting the sustainable capacity for queer Muslim organizations like Salaam Canada can help the community and their needs. Muslim communities and leaders also have a critical role in recognizing the existence of homo and transphobias within their communities and be equally active allies to queer groups in challenging such hate. The key way to do this is to affirm and embrace their queer members, and develop better support mechanisms for their families, where much of the exclusion and heartache exists for queer Muslims. It’s a difficult path, but we can begin, together. Above all, we need to recognise that homophobias and Islamophobia will never be fully defeated if one or the other remains. To not see and uplift those who are vulnerable within your community, weakens the entire community, and wears away at the pride and dignity that all communities, and all their members, should enjoy.  
My message for queer Muslims is to recognize the power that you have. Both queers and Muslims can oftentimes make it difficult for us to live in peace, security and with pride, but that is also precisely why we have so much power: we are the connection point between two groups who need to see each other and learn from each, and through us, that can happen.

In response to the news that at least 50 people have been found dead in a trailer in San Antonio, Texas, and a dozen others who were onboard have been hospitalized, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said: 
“The tragedy in San Antonio is a devastating example of the failure of states across the Americas to protect migrants and asylum seekers. It is heartbreaking to reflect that this has happened before and it will continue to happen until there are profound changes in the migration policies of the United States and neighboring countries.” 
Instead of pushing migrants and asylum seekers into desperate situations where they risk suffocation, drowning or dying of thirst, states must put human rights at the center of their policies and uphold their international obligations to protect them.” 
“Cruel and inhumane migration policies endanger lives, forcing people into taking ever-more risky routes when all they want is to find a safe place where they can rebuild their lives. Instead of pushing migrants and asylum seekers into desperate situations where they risk suffocation, drowning or dying of thirst, states must put human rights at the center of their policies and uphold their international obligations to protect them.”

The organizations they represent published a report exposing possible extrajudicial executions in Carabobo and calling for exhaustive investigations, including chain of command responsibility. The settlement included an agreement for both defenders to clarify that their calls for accountability did not directly target the governor.   
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
On 16 May 2022, recognised Venezuelan human rights defenders Marino Alvarado and Alfredo Infante received notification of a defamation lawsuit filed against them by the governor of Carabobo state, Rafael Lacava. The lawsuit came in response to a report published in March by the NGOs Alvarado and Infant belong to, Provea and Centro Gumilla respectively, exposing possible extrajudicial executions in Carabobo state and calling for full accountability. Amnesty International called for an immediate stop to the attack from the governor against Marino Alvarado and Alfredo Infante.  
Since then, Rafael Lacava engaged Marino Alvarado and Alfredo Infante in a conciliation process overseen by the Third Court judge of First Instance in Carabobo state. The conciliation process led to a conciliation agreement or settlement, stating that between 23 June and 23 August Marino Alvarado and Alfredo Infante should clarify and publicise the fact that their calls for accountability were generic and not specific to the governor. After 23 August, the case should be permanently closed by the overseeing judge.   
Amnesty International’s urgent action contributed to generating public attention towards the unfair lawsuit brought against two recognised human rights defenders and putting pressure on the governor to reach a settlement instead of pursuing a trial.

Wade and ruled to end protections for abortion rights in the US. Not only will this landmark decision endanger the health and lives of millions, it also reverses nearly 50 years of essential protections of the rights of women, girls, and those who can become pregnant. It will also embolden more governments to restrict abortion and further their repression of women’s rights. This egregious violation of human rights is a massive blow to gender justice–both nationally and globally. The US has set a terrible precedent that other governments and anti-human rights groups around the world will cite to justify attacks on human rights consequently denying the rights to life, health, bodily autonomy, and privacy. The end of Roe v. Wade is just the beginning of a new war over abortion rights in the US. Much of the battle will shift to state-level legislatures. 
AI Canada is mobilizing its members on the ground across Canada to participate in protests, marches, and activism. Pressure from the international movement is critical for the long-term success to defend abortion rights in the US at the state and national level. Every US state needs to see international support for abortion rights and international outcry can prevent further harm and push for further protections.

Wade, Tarah Demant, Interim National Director for Programs, Advocacy and Government Affairs, said: 
“Today marks a grim milestone in the history of the United States as the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade and stripped Americans of the right to an abortion. Millions of people who can become pregnant in the United States now face a future where they will not be able to make deeply personal choices that affect their bodies, their future, and the well-being of their families. This ruling affects each and every person in the United States, regardless of their ability to become pregnant. You know someone who has had an abortion. We all do, as approximately one in four women in the United States will seek an abortion in their lifetime.  
“People will be forced to give birth. They’ll be forced to seek unsafe abortions. This is the outcome of a decades-long campaign to control the bodies of women, girls, and people who can become pregnant. And it paves the way for unprecedented state legislation to criminalize abortion, as well as other bills that will aim to strip human rights from people in the United States, including the potential for bills that will affect access to birth control, gender, and marriage equality, as well as other anti-discrimination laws.  
“For our supporters and those around the world watching this moment with the same sense of horror and pain that we feel we say: whatever you’re feeling – anger, fear, betrayal, sadness – you’re not alone. You’re one of the vast majority of Americans who disagree with today’s decision. You’re one of 10 million people around the world who make up this grassroots movement for human rights. This is where our power and our hope springs from: We are the majority.

She is a prisoner of conscience who must be immediately and unconditionally released.     
Prosecution authorities on the instruction of Ministry of Intelligence agents are subjecting human rights defender Narges Mohammadi, 50, who is arbitrarily detained in Shahr-e Rey prison (also known as Gharchak) in the city of Varamin, Tehran province, to torture and other ill-treatment. They are deliberately denying her adequate healthcare in reprisal for her public campaigning against the use of solitary confinement in Iran’s prisons and for seeking accountability for hundreds of unlawful killings during the November 2019 nationwide protests. From about late April 2022 to mid-May 2022, the authorities withheld the medication she requires for serious health conditions, including for her heart and lungs. Narges Mohammadi reported that on 3 February 2022, following a heart attack, the prison doctor denied her adequate healthcare, while prosecution officials barred her transfer to hospital outside of prison for urgent healthcare, placing her life at risk. Only after Narges Mohammadi suffered a series of heart attacks on 16 February 2022, she was transferred to hospital, where she had emergency heart surgery. Against medical advice and before she recuperated, on 19 February 2022, authorities took her back to prison.   
Narges Mohammadi has been unjustly in and out of prison for over a dozen years in relation to her human rights work. Most recently, Narges Mohammadi was convicted and sentenced to a total of 10 years and eight months in prison, 154 lashes and other sanctions in two separate cases both stemming solely from her human rights work; and in late April 2022, prosecution authorities summoned her for questioning in a new case also in relation to her peaceful human rights activities. Narges Mohammadi’s latest imprisonment resumed on 21 April 2022, when Ministry of Intelligence agents arrested her while she out of prison on medical leave, began on 22 February 2022, and sent her to Gharchak to resume serving her sentences. There, prison authorities are holding her in cruel and inhumane conditions. In recent weeks, prisoners in Gharchak have reported overflowing sewage resulting in filthiness and foul odours, putting prisoners at risk of disease and exacerbating the unsanitary conditions in the wards, washing and toilet facilities. She is also held with women convicted of violent crimes and in late May 2022 her lawyer reported that a prisoner threatened to kill Narges Mohammadi and another prisoner held for political reasons.

Salutation: Dear Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei 
On 16 November 2021, Narges Mohammadi was violently arrested while attending a memorial ceremony in the cityof Karaj, Alborz province, to mark the second anniversary of the death of Ebrahim Ketabdar, who was killed byIranian security forces during nationwide protests in November 2019. The day after her arrest, while held in solitaryconfinement in section 209 of Tehran’s Evin prison, which is under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence, theauthorities informed her that she was to begin serving a prison sentence of two years and six months following a2021 conviction, and they also threatened to carry out her flogging sentence of 80 lashes imminently. She recountedbeing held in prolonged solitary confinement for 64 days in section 209, during which period Ministry of Intelligenceagents subjected her to torture and other ill-treatment. She said Ministry of Intelligence agents kept bright lights on24 hours a day; severely limited her access to fresh air and natural light to only thrice a week for 20 minutes eachtime; and kept her in almost near total isolation without meaningful contact with other prisoners; she only saw theguards who took her to toilet or brought food – all this caused her severe distress and suffering, including shortnessof breath. 
On 4 January 2022, while still in solitary confinement, Narges Mohammadi was taken before Branch 26of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran to stand trial in a second case. This trial was grossly unfair: it lasted just fiveminutes and she revealed afterwards being denied access to a lawyer both before and during the trial. On 15 January2022, she was informed that the Court sentenced her to eight years and two months in prison; two years in internal“exile” in a city outside Tehran where she normally lives; a two-year ban on membership in political and socialparties, groups or collectives; a two-year ban on engagement in online space, media and press; and 74 lashes. TheJanuary 2022 conviction and sentence are in addition to an earlier conviction by Branch 1177 of Criminal Court Twoin Tehran, which, according to Narges Mohammadi’s Instagram post dated 24 May 2021, sentenced her to twoyears and six months in prison, 80 lashes and two fines on charges that included “spreading propaganda againstthe system”. She was convicted of “offences” stemming from her participation, during an earlier period ofimprisonment, in a sit-in with other prisoners in the women’s ward of Evin prison between 21 and 24 December 2019to protest unlawful killings during the November 2019 nationwide protests and making statements condemning thedeath penalty. She also spoke out against prison, male security and judicial officials subjecting her to torture andother ill-treatment, shortly after the peaceful sit-in, including through repeated beatings all over her body, roughlyyanking her down a stairwell and throwing her against a wall. The office of the prosecutor in Tehran refused toprocess the complaint that Narges Mohammadi filed in late December 2019 in connection with these allegations oftorture and other ill-treatment.Narges Mohammadi is being denied the ongoing healthcare she requires following heart attacks and subsequentheart surgery she had earlier in 2022, including monitoring of the inserted stent, medication, the specialized dietrecommended by her doctors and maintaining low levels of stress. In addition to this, Narges Mohammadi has apre-existing lung disease, which is characterized by breathing difficulties, and for which she must use an inhaler andregularly take anticoagulant medications that prevent the formation of blood clots in her lungs. 
On 19 January 2022, Narges Mohammadi was transferred from section 209 of Evin prison to Shahr-e Rey prisonand placed in a ward with women convicted of serious violent crimes is in breach of both Iranian law and internationalstandards, which require the authorities to keep prisoners convicted of non-violent offences separate from prisonersconvicted of violent offences. In late May 2022 her lawyer reported that a prisoner threatened to kill NargesMohammadi and another prisoner held for political reasons. These unsafe conditions have previously contributed toa deterioration in Narges Mohammadi’s mental well-being, particularly as she had reported receiving death threatsby other prisoners in April and July 2020.Narges Mohammadi was released from prison on 8 October 2020 after being unjustly imprisoned for over five yearsin a case also solely stemming from her human rights work. She reported that from the time of her release until herarbitrary arrest and detention on 16 November 2021, she received death threats from security forces and wasarbitrarily arrested on at least five occasions and detained each time for periods reaching up to about a day. Eachtime, she was arrested while carrying out her peaceful human rights work, including supporting those who areunjustly detained by seeking to draw public attention to the human violations Iranian authorities subject them to andattending a gathering for the people of Afghanistan. On some of these occasions, Narges Mohammadi said thatMinistry of Intelligence agents subjected her to torture and other ill-treatment, including by roughly pulling her hairand repeatedly beating her all over her body.

Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs...,"Wet’suwet’en land defenders say they expect work on the Coastal GasLink pipeline to resume in the next few weeks and fear they will face further arrests and human rights violations if the RCMP enforce an injunction to remove people from the construction site. Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs say that drilling under Wedzin Kwa – or Morice River- will harm the river, an important source of drinking water on the territory and crucial habitat for wild salmon. They unanimously oppose the pipeline and have called on Canada to stop construction and withdraw RCMP and security forces from their territory. 
Please immediately send an Urgent Action to federal Public Safety Minister, Mark Mendicino 
On April 29, the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) issued a third letter to Canada expressing alarm over Canada’s failures to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples who oppose the construction of two fossil fuel pipelines in British Columbia – the TransMountain pipeline expansion and the Coastal GasLink pipeline.  
The letter states the Committee’s ‘profound regret’ that despite two earlier letters from the UN body recommending that Canada withdraw police and security forces and suspend construction on the Coastal GasLink and TransMountain pipelines, the intimidation, use of force, surveillance and criminalization of land defenders has in fact escalated. The Committee noted concern that the situation could further deteriorate, resulting in violations of the rights of Wet’suwet’en and Secwepemc people to their rights and territories, the right to be consulted and the right to security of the person. 
Canada became a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in October 1970 and is required to uphold the Convention under international law. 
Watch the joint press conference with land defenders on May 11. 
When I read the third letter from CERD, I felt overwhelmed by the recognition that our experiences are violations of international human rights and Indigenous rights. The construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline project, and the RCMP’s treatment of me and other land offenders is a violation of our humanity as Indigenous peoples 
The Committee called on Canada to: 
The Committee also noted that Canada is long overdue to submit its 21st to 23rd combined periodic reports and asked them to do with urgency. Canada says it expects to submit its report in November 2022. 
Amnesty International is extremely concerned about increasing intimidation, harassment, and surveillance tactics by the RCMP’s Community-Industry Response Group (CIRG) being reported by land defenders from the Wet’suwet’en and Secwepemc Nations. Wet’suwet’en spokespeople report regular visits from RCMP members of the Community-Industry Response Group (CIRG) to homes, community spaces and roadways. When residents demand they leave, they are reportedly threatened with arrest. Tensions in the area are high. 
“The government sends their RCMP goons to push us around. But we’re not going anywhere. The simple message is that we are going to protect the water, our wildlife, and our ways of life. We’re not going to leave that behind and get on board with this project,” said Hereditary Chief Woos of the Cas Yikh House of the Gidimt’en clan. “Canada is hypocritical. On the international stage they say one thing, but behind closed doors, they do another. Stop this racism. We are still here, and we will never surrender”. 
On June 22, several Wet’suwet’en members filed a Notice of Civil Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia for damages related to the surveillance, harassment and intimidation of members of the Gidimt’en Clan by the RCMP, Coastal GasLink, Forsythe Security, and BC’s Minister of Justice. You can read the press release here.  
Land defenders arrested in 2021 continue to face legal challenges. During legal proceedings in February 2022, lawyers for Coastal GasLink petitioned BC Supreme Court Justice Marguerite Church to seek Crown approval for criminal contempt charges against those arrested in November 2021. On two previous, separate occasions, similar requests were denied on the ground that criminal charges were not in the public interest. However, on June 1, BC’s Prosecution Service announced it will prosecute 15 people for criminal contempt and that it is contemplating criminal charges against a further 10 people. That decision will be announced on July 7. A trial date for the 15 people facing criminal contempt charges has not been set. 
This problem will never go away until the governments of this country recognize our inherent sovereignty over our lands. The first step is to stop the construction of this project and pull CIRG out of our territories immediately. Anything less feeds the normalization of racism in this country and is in direct violation of the Convention 
Urgent efforts are being directed by Gidimt’en Checkpoint and the Hereditary Chiefs towards preventing drilling under the Wedzin Kwa – or Morice River – which is one of the last remaining sources of clean drinking water on the territory. The river is also important to salmon which return to the region to spawn and represent an important source of nutrition and cultural identity for the Wet’suwet’en and neighboring peoples. 
Sound the Alarm for Wet’suwet’en is an initiative developed by organizations with the approval of the Hereditary Chiefs that invites settler allies to contact key players, such as the pipeline construction companies, the government of Canada, and project funders, about the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline. The campaign includes a variety of actions directed to company decision-makers. Our partner organizations, like Stand.Earth, Greenpeace and Banking On a Better Future are also calling on the 5 major Canadian banks to stop funding these pipelines.

Amnesty International...","Police violently broke up the student-organized Pride march on 10 June at Middle East Technical University (METU) Campus in Ankara, detaining 37 students after dragging some of them on the ground. The students were later released. Amnesty International called for the university rectorship to respect right to peaceful assembly of the Pride participants.   
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
On 7 June, the METU rectorship sent an email to all the university’s students, warning them that their planned campus-based Pride march would be met with police intervention.  
Amnesty International called on the university rector to ensure that the Pride march planned to take place on 10 June could go ahead without any restrictions, including possible intervention by police. We reminded the rectorship that their attempt to ban the march represented an unjustifiable restriction to the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly of METU students and staff; and that the grounds cited in their email to students, namely the ‘damage that would be caused to the University’s prestige’ were not among those permitted under Turkey’s domestic laws, nor permissible under binding international human rights laws and standards.  
On the day of the march, the authorities deployed riot police and plain cloth officers to the campus as well as busses to transport detained students, which were positioned inside the campus before the start of the Pride march. When a few hundred of students started to march, riot police intervened to break up the peaceful protest by using excessive force including firing pepper balls. As a result, 37 students were arrested after some of them were being dragged on the ground. Some reported to being ill-treated while they were being detained or in detention.  
Amnesty International’s Urgent Action was important to put pressure university management to reverse their decision to arbitrarily prevent the campus-based Pride. The METU rectorship issued a statement post-event trying to justify their decision not to allow the march and calling for police action. Amnesty will monitor any criminal investigation and prosecution that may occur.  
Speaking to Amnesty International, METU LGBTIQAA+ Solidarity expressed their deep gratitude to all those who took action on their behalf:   
“As METU LGBTIQAA+ Solidarity, we thank to everyone who gave support and put effort to 10th METU Pride that we realized under state repression and police violence. We believe that the fight for LGBTIQAA rights in METU and Turkey can only continue with this support and solidarity, despite attempts to intimidate us. With love and solidarity.”

Since then, the Russian forces have been pushed back away from Kyiv Region, and Russian aerial attacks have been less frequent and less vicious there. However, Ukrainian people, including older people, are now facing the same problems in other parts of Ukraine that are more directly affected by intense fighting. What Olga Perekopaiko told Amnesty International about the experiences of older people during the conflict remains all too relevant. 
How has the war affected mental health of older people? 
Many older people, unable to endure a long journey on physical or psychological grounds, are compelled to stay in their hometowns rather than flee to a safer place alongside other family members. As a result, they often find themselves living near the front line, or may even experience shelling or bombing. 
Older people, just like others, feel terrified when they hear explosions or the sounds of air raid sirens. Some experience flashbacks of World War II while others may refuse to accept reality altogether. “How can this be happening today? We have already survived one war,” they ask. 
It is cold in the house, no water, no light. We are waiting until the weather warms up. We are lying in bed in our clothes, my wife is a Chernobyl disaster survivor and she could hardly walk. We did not try to hide anywhere. I gave up on it, although the shelling was so hard, it was mad. But I have come to an end of my life, I don’t care. First, we lost gas. We had a small gas container for a camping cooker, so we would boil some tea in the morning, and think how much gas was left there. We would cook bortsch and try to eat little to keep it for a week. It was hard, we could not imagine how hard it would be… 
Often older people are scared to leave their homes. They worry that in case of an air raid siren, they will not be able to run to a hiding place. Some may even feel nervous about venturing onto a balcony. So older people may find themselves confined within four walls, without fresh air or exercise. I also meet people who seem relaxed about the prospect of death. They refuse to go down into a bomb shelter; they say, “We have already lived our lives.” 
How did you join the volunteer movement? 
At the start of the war, the Zhiznelyub charity set up a phone helpline for older people to leave a request for food or medicine, which volunteers then buy and deliver to them. Through a Facebook ad, I got connected to such a volunteer group for a Kyiv district.  
How do you help older people? 
My responsibility is to bring them food and medicine. But I also offer help around the house or with other pressing issues that they may have at that moment. In addition, as a trained psychologist, I try to spare some time for talking to them about their worries and anxieties. 
I think it is important that volunteers offer help. For example, it might be just to open the window – if the person uses a walking-frame, for instance, it can be difficult for them to move. Or it might be helping to find out when their pension will be delivered. Older people may get worried if they do not receive their pension on time – with shortages of banknotes and long queues at ATMs, they become very anxious that they will have no money to buy food or medicine. 
In Kyiv, it was also a challenge to find certain kinds of medicine. Many pharmacies closed down because of staff shortages. I would often spend hours queuing up only to find out at the counter that just a handful of medications on my list were available. I would then head to another pharmacy, and so on. 
The bombing was so intense during the first day – rockets were flying from one side to the other. One missile is in the air, then another, and it seems as if the roof will be blown away in a moment. The windows were smashed in a second, and we hid in the toilet, where we kept praying non-stop. 
How can you support older people psychologically? 
Chatting to them even for 15-20 minutes could make a huge difference to their mental state. 
During my first volunteering experience, I met Lyubov, a 90-year-old lady, who lost her daughter and son-in-law due to Covid-19 a few months before the war. Her grandson was in Irpin[1] and could not get in touch with his grandmother. She told me a lot about her daughter and her life and shared some very deep emotions that had been overwhelming her. 
Are there currently high levels of anxiety? 
Yes, and I would say especially among the older generation. It is also being exacerbated by them feeling isolated and secluded, as many people around them have left. For example, only a third of my own apartment building is currently occupied. 
It is quite common in my experience that older people would try to alleviate their anxiety by stocking up on groceries and medicines. They have such memories from the Soviet times when food shortages were ubiquitous. For example, they may ask you to buy a dozen packs of various cereals and several loafs of bread, in addition to a number of packs of medicine. Pantry stocks seem to increase their sense of security. 
I cannot help them stocking up, yet I worry that supplies might run out. I queue up at the pharmacy, feeling guilty for buying many packs of medicines – maybe other people in the queue are also looking for this medicine, and there will not be enough for everyone. Heart and anti-anxiety medications are selling out in a flash, and many other drugs come in small quantities, if they come at all. 
What advice would you give to those who want to help older people? 
I think that setting up a psychological support ‘hotline’ for older people should be a first step. The service should be free and older people should also be exempt from any phone charges. Secondly, volunteers should be trained to work with older people so that they learn some of the most useful skills. 
Having a chat could really improve an older person’s emotional state and make them feel cared for. 
The most important thing is of course to ensure their safety, but these days nowhere is entirely safe.

The trial against Yulia Tsvetkova, an artist and activist from Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Russian Far East, is coming to an end. On 14 June, the prosecution requested a jail term of three and a half years under the absurd charges of “production and dissemination of pornography” for posting online her body-positive drawings of women’s bodies. The final hearing is expected to take place on 12 July. Yulia Tsvetkova will make her final statement and the sentence will be published soon after. 
Yulia Tsvetkova is an artist from Komsomolsk-on-Amur who has been continually targeted over the years for her human rights activism. Since 2019, she has been prosecuted for her artistic work depicting bodies of women, and faced harassment by police, including repeated house and workplace searches. She spent almost four months under house arrest until March 2020 and has been under travel restrictions since. She has committed no recognizable criminal offence, which has been confirmed by some respected Russian legal experts during her trial. 
Yulia Tsvetkova has also repeatedly faced administrative proceedings and fines under the discriminatory “gay propaganda” legislation (Article 6.21 of the Code of Administrative Offences). She has faced homophobic threats, abuse and harassment, over the phone, via social networks, and by mail, as has her mother. 
Yulia Tsvetkova is facing reprisals for exercising her right to freedom of expression, which violates both Russia’s Constitution and its obligations under international human rights law.

Additional information  
Yulia Tsvetkova, an artist and stage director from Komsomolsk-on-Amur (Russian Far East), was arbitrarily detained on 20 November 2019 and put under house arrest two days later after being accused of “production and dissemination of pornographic materials” (Article 242(3b) of the Russian Criminal Code). These absurd charges were brought against her in connection with her drawings of women’s bodies, including body-positive pictures of female reproductive organs, which she posted on social media on her online group Vagina Monologues. This was part of her campaigning for the empowerment of women. On the day of her detention, searches were carried out in her apartment and in the children’s educational club where she had worked previously. The police seized her electronic devices, documents, and brochures on gender issues. Yulia Tsvetkova recalled that during the search the police officers stated that she was a “lesbian, sex trainer and propagandist leader”. The authorities also decided to block her online group Vagina Monologues, a decision that Yulia Tsvetkova has challenged legally. 
Yulia Tsvetkova has been the target of an overtly homophobic campaign since March 2019, when she had to end her cooperation with the youth amateur theatre company Merak after the police had launched an investigation into her alleged “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors” on account of her anti-bullying and anti-discrimination play “Blue and Pink”. Also, the theatrical group she had founded in 2018 was forced to cease its activities. 
On 11 December 2019, Yulia Tsvetkova was found guilty in violation of Article 6.21 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors” and fined 50,000 Rubles (US$ 780) for being the administrator of two LGBTI-themed online communities on the popular Russian social media, VKontakte. Both online communities were marked “18+”, as required by Russian law, making the fine imposed on her unfounded even under the homophobic Russian “gay propaganda” legislation (this “offence” only arises if the “propaganda” material is targeted at persons under 18). 
On 17 January 2020, Yulia Tsvetkova informed the media that an administrative proceeding had been opened against her once again, under the same Article 6.21 of the Code of Administrative Offences, this time for posting her drawing “Family is where love is. Support LGBT+ families” (depicting two same-sex couples with children) on social media. She had published the drawing in support of a same-sex couple who had had to flee Russia with their adopted children because the authorities had threatened to take their children away from them. On 10 July 2020 she was fined 75 000 Rubles (US$ 1,050) for this “offence”. 
During 2020, the criminal case against Yulia Tsvetkova was referred back and forth between the investigator and the prosecutor five times. Her trial finally started in January 2021 but it was adjourned in November 2021 until February 2022. 
In September 2021, Yulia Tsvetkova successfully appealed the authorities’ decision to block her online group Vagina Monologues where she had posted the drawings that led to the criminal proceedings under the “pornography” charges against her. However, in February 2022, the decision was reviewed in court, and the online group was blocked once again on arbitrary grounds. Yulia Tsvetkova is appealing this decision again and the next court hearing will take place on 13 July. If she loses the case, this prejudicial decision will have important and worrying implications for the criminal case against her. 
On 12 May the prosecution presented a new legal expert opinion on the criminal case which was written by an expert from the organisation involved with the liquidation of Memorial, one of the oldest and most prominent human rights organisations in Russia. The expert surprisingly declared that Yulia Tsvetkova’s art is not pornography. The prosecution tried to request another expert’s opinion, but the court declined. On 3 June the Russian Ministry of Justice claimed that Yulia Tsvetkova is a “foreign agent” which negatively affected the case as the prosecution used this as a reason to show her as a” public enemy’. On 14 June, the prosecution requested a jail term of three and a half years for Yulia Tsvetkova.

Rachel has been an Indigenous and human rights activist for 20 years and holds a Master’s degree in Community and Regional Planning from the University of British Columbia where she specialized in Indigenous Community Planning. She has worked with many communities-at-risk throughout her 20-year career as an Indigenous Community Planner and is currently a Social Policy Planner for the City of Vancouver where she supports the implementation of the recommendations from Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and Red Women Rising Indigenous Women Survivors in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (Red Women Rising). She currently lives and works on the ancestral, unceded and traditional lands of the Coast Salish Peoples who have protected and cared for since time immemorial. 
Tansi booshoo, my name is Rachel Sagastas Wuttunee. I am Anishinaabekwe from Kitchenuhmaykoosib in Northwestern, Ontario and I am from the Bear Clan. I am an Indigenous Community Planner educated through a lifetime of planning and with knowledge passed down to me by my Elders, community and peers. Bear Clan are the guardians of their own communities, protectors, and carriers of medicine. My Elders have always influenced my life’s journey, have nurtured my community engagement skills and have instilled my sense of responsibilities to Indigenous communities. I have been a human rights and Indigenous rights activist for over 20 years, working on the frontlines with communities at risk, community leaders, Elders, mothers, and youth in foster care. Throughout my journey carrying out decolonization work at the frontlines and grassroots level, and as an Indigenous Planner advising senior leaders in governments, I have witnessed the pervasiveness of colonial practices and the degree to which they violently permeate across all systems, policy sectors and social areas. It would be a mistake to describe colonialism as just a legacy because it is an ongoing practice.  
In my time working with youth in foster care, I worked directly with those who had aged out of care, were homeless and in jails or mental health institutions, and were mothers who had open files for their children with the Ministry of Children and Family Development. Through stories of their lived experience, the youth and mothers showed me where the gaps and harms in the systems existed. While I was working to support them, I advocated against policies and processes to ensure at-risk youth would be getting the substantive equality type of support they needed. For example, for at-risk youth without access to any resources, income supports which were greatly needed. However, income supports were only eligible for people fleeing violence, who had aged out of care, or for a single parent with dependents under the age of three. For youth who were eligible, many would end up losing the support because the income supports came with a level of administrative burden and, more importantly, without culturally appropriate frontline service delivery that would ensure recipients would maintain their applications to receive an income. This primed a condition for many of these youth to become further at risk. Many Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples are often left with little to no options for survival and many resort to survival sex where they exchange sex for food, a place to sleep or other basic needs. Without any ongoing support (or attempts to improve the income support application process) this systemic practice creates conditions for these youth to be targets of abuse and assault. There is a direct connection between this social and economic marginalization and the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and Two Spirit People, which is described as one of the four pathways identified in the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. 
Many levels of government continue to maintain colonial systems and processes that are often harmful to Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples. Statistics that are collected by governments can only convey so much information because that data is not disaggregated. Data needs to be collected specifically for the intersections of Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples’ lived experiences of violence and the outcomes and sources of that violence. The exclusions in income supports is a clear example of a social policy with a lack of disaggregated data and how it could be used to improve the application process, eligibility, and service delivery.  
There is no data collected on how many youth have aged out of foster care into homelessness. Or, on the number of Indigenous youth who experience violence and lack of opportunity compared to non-Indigenous youth. 
Many of the Indigenous youths’ intersections and reported barriers within systems not designed to support them are not identified within government data sets. For example, there is no data collected on how many youth have aged out of foster care into homelessness. Or, on the number of Indigenous youth who experience violence and lack of opportunity compared to non-Indigenous youth. To better serve Indigenous youth in foster care, this kind of research is required so that can be effectively aged out of foster care and avoid homelessness, poverty, or otherwise fall through the cracks. 
One of the greatest systemic barriers to engaging with Indigenous Peoples, especially Elders, is the bureaucracy in financial and administrative processes everywhere. In addition to the challenge of bureaucratic forms, social insurance numbers are often required in order to receive an honorarium, which alerts Revenue Canada that a payment (usually a small amount) has been made to an individual. Honorariums are typically irregular and only a one-time payment, and for individuals receiving income supports, this may bring their income threshold beyond the point of eligibility for the same support in the following year. For those relying on income supports for housing or childcare, this has the consequence of furthering marginalizing them, especially for Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples and needs to be addressed. More attention on the human rights issues for gender diverse individuals within Indigenous communities needs to be brought to the forefront of many policies and social issues. Statistics show that Indigenous women and 2SLGBTQQIA+ experience more violence than non-Indigenous residents of Canada. Every service provider and funder should apply a Gender Based Analysis Plus (GBA+) to their work in order to effectively assess systemic inequalities for program service delivery staff and participants. This is another key area where disaggregated data could be collected and incorporated. 
Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples specifically have historically been targeted for violence and to this day still experience social, economic, and cultural marginalization. Qualitative and quantitative data about their experiences of marginalization in those spaces is critical to collect, record, and share. Doing so can positively impact the work of funders and philanthropists who rely on having data to determine funding allocations for the kinds of projects and programs needed to address those social gaps. The significance of this is highlighted across the 231 Calls for Justice which demand to end the socio-economic marginalization of Indigenous women-led grassroots organizations. Positive de-colonization practices are: paying grassroots groups for their work; paying Indigenous community members long-term and at competitive rates (avoid defaulting to honorariums every time). One of the greatest barriers for Indigenous grassroots groups when applying for funds are the criteria and conditions attached to the funding. Often, funding programs and initiatives are not culturally appropriate or inclusive of the needs of the community. For instance, funders will have outlined specific parameters based on their own top-down strategic priorities that do not often align with the needs of grassroots groups or even families of survivors, the latter who are also excluded from the funding applicant eligibility criteria.  
There is a very specific lived experience I hold as an Anishnaabe woman doing frontline work and personally experiencing the systemic barriers against my community, while also carrying out the professional work in implementing the Calls for Justice. This lived experience has a burden on me physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, and I maintain a spirit-based approach to my work. In practice, this means I take entire paid days for a ceremony and defend expenses for cultural protocols in my budgeting, such as hiring an Elder or beading a feather to give away. I also establish firm boundaries that protect my personal journey of decolonization and resist further assimilation to the quasi standards of professionalism that are based on the norms of the dominant culture. Enforcing these cultural practices teaches a lesson to non-Indigenous employers on ways to incorporate Indigeneity into the workplace. Decolonizing the workplace is essential to delivering equity and upholding the inherent rights of Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ Peoples.  
I consider myself a grassroots support worker for life. What I have said in this essay is the truth and it is up to the settler population to reconcile these harms.

She is the boundary line between Cas Yikh and Unist’ot’en and they both fight to protect her from Coastal GasLink and other oil and gas pipelines that want to destroy her for profit. Image credit: Michael Toledano. 
The Wet’suwet’en people have lived in what is now known as northern British Columbia, Canada since time immemorial. We have governed and maintained 22,000 km2 of land through careful monitoring and through balancing a reciprocal relationship with the land. As a matrilineal society, our governance system is rooted with our women, and it is from our mothers that we get our house membership. Our practice of cultural transmission, which includes our duty to protect the land, was intentionally broken by the government by its forced removal of our people from the yintah (land). All the historic and ongoing violence of colonization has been perpetrated with the singular intention of having unfettered access to our territories and resources. As confirmed in 1997 by the Supreme Court of Canada case, Delgamuukw—Gisdaywa, our rights and title as Wet’suwet’en people have never been extinguished. The day after this decision was announced, the government and industry schemed ways to circumvent the decision in order to ensure their ongoing access to our yintah. As reported by The Narwal:  
“Internal emails, memos and confidential briefing notes also show that, immediately after the Delgamuukw decision came down from the Supreme Court of Canada on Dec. 11, 1997, B.C. government officials discussed tactics to fight land rights with legal challenges, to curb direct action or litigation by First Nations and to use federal money intended for the healing of residential school survivors to make treaty negotiations more attractive.“ 
Today, this violence continues as mega-projects such as gas and oil pipelines are forced onto and throughout our lands as our laws and systems are disrespected, our women are victimized, and as our people are criminalized for upholding Wet’suwet’en laws. In December 2018, Gidimt’en, one of the five clans of the Wet’suwet’en Nation, took control of access to our territory by erecting the Gidimt’en Checkpoint. This was done to stand in solidarity with the Unist’ot’en house group for the protection of our sacred headwaters Wedzin Kwa (also known as the Morice River), our main salmon spawning river with water so pure we still drink directly from it. Since then, the RCMP have organized yearly militarized raids to forcibly remove Wet’suwet’en people from their very own land, including key spokespeople like Sleydo’ Molly Wickham, Gidimt’en clan member, and Howilkit Freda Huson of the Unist’ot’en. This was in direct contravention of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, and the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has issued three letters to Canada addressing these, and other, human rights violations.

The criminalization of our people goes back to the potlatch ban that was in effect from 1884-1951. During this time, Wet’suwet’en governance practices were outlawed by the Canadian government within the Indian Act. There were many ways the government tried to control and eradicate our ways of life through the Indian Act, including creating the reservation system, imposing the governance of chief and council, creating residential schools, and what has been come to be known as the 60’s Scoop – the intentional and forceful removal of Indigenous children from their families and homes and their placement in predominantly white foster homes without access to their culture. Many of these colonial tactics were rooted in the belief that Indigenous people were barbaric, uneducated, and had no religious beliefs. These beliefs dehumanized Indigenous people and led to legitimize the theft of their land, resources, and children, under the guise of ‘saving them’. In 2008, then PM Stephen Harper delivered an apology to Residential School survivors, stating, “These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, ’to kill the Indian in the child’.” 14 years on from this formal apology, the same kind of colonial violence that tries to upend our rights, suppress our governance, and menace our community, prevails against us in our daily lives on Wet’suwet’en territory. 
Many of the widespread harmful beliefs that were imposed on to our people were also taught to generations of non-Indigenous children. These harmful beliefs have resulted in the systemic failure to end the staggering numbers of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls in Canada. In particular, there is a highway that runs through Wet’suwet’en territory known as the “Highway of Tears” called so because it is the site of the last known whereabouts of many of our women and girls. The prevalence of industry, transient men, and disposable income increases the risk for the already vulnerable women and girls along the remote stretch of this highway. Studies on the impacts of resource development on our land are explicitly referenced in the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls: 
“Expert witnesses, institutional witnesses and Knowledge Keepers told the National Inquiry that resource extraction projects can drive violence against Indigenous women in several ways, including issues related to transient workers, harassment and assault in the workplace, rotational shift work, substance abuse and addictions, and economic insecurity.”  
Very recently, a former Coastal GasLink employee filed a lawsuit for sexual battery. The Inquiry specifically recommended: 
“We call upon all governments and bodies mandated to evaluate, approve, and/or monitor development projects to complete gender-based socio-economic impact assessments on all proposed projects as part of their decision making and ongoing monitoring of projects. Project proposals must include provisions and plans to mitigate risks and impacts identified in the impact assessments prior to being approved.” 
The 231 Calls for Justice still have not fully been implemented and it has taken years for the federal government to create a National Action Plan, all the while our women are still being murdered and going missing. We have received reports of assault and violence from individual Indigenous women who have worked for the Coastal GasLink pipeline within our territories and supported them in their filing of police reports and choices to take action to protect themselves. Turning to the RCMP to report assaults is not a reliable option in Wet’suwet’en territory as RCMP are known to harass and intimidate our women and community members on a daily basis.  
Just one example of how everyone on the yintah is harassed and ticketed for not being CGL employees https://t.co/qeWYnMDOsW 
Since March 2022, there have been hundreds of visits by the Community-Industry Response Group (a division of the RCMP) who threaten, arrest, intimidate and surveil all persons coming and going from the territory who do not appear to be industry workers. They set up road checks with no clear purpose other than to stop and identify Wet’suwet’en people travelling in their own territory for cultural purposes. They have repeatedly been found idling on the driveway of Sleydo’, Gidimt’en Checkpoint spokesperson’s home and have even gone so far as to shine flashlights through her windows while claiming to be ‘checking in’ on her family’s safety. This kind of blatant harassment has extended to the site of our newest project, the building of a balhats (feast hall) at Tsel Kiy Kwa (Lamprey Creek), an ancient village site that is a physical embodiment of our governance system on the land. It’s clear that these are attempts to suppress our forms of governance, cultural practices, and even frighten our leaders into silence. 
The fight for Wet’suwet’en sovereignty continues against the face of colonial violence, with Wet’suwet’en women at the frontlines defending their children’s futures.

The repression by President Guillermo Lasso’s government of demonstrations called by Indigenous, trade union and social organisations as part of a national strike since 13 June 2022 is causing a human rights crisis with many reports of harassment, excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, ill-treatment, and criminalisation of protesters, journalists and human rights defenders, Amnesty International said today. 
“President Lasso’s regrettable decision to repress the protests is provoking a human rights crisis reminiscent of that of October 2019. To prevent history from repeating itself, the president must cease the repression and address the structural causes of the protests, including addressing the economic crisis and the impact of his policies on the rights of groups most affected by the pandemic, such as Indigenous Peoples and people living in poverty,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Since 14 June the Ecuador Alliance for Human Rights has recorded 79 arrests, 55 injuries and 39 episodes of human rights violations – such as excessive use of force, arbitrary detentions of demonstrators, attacks on journalists and intimidation of civil society organisations – in the context of the authorities’ repression of demonstrations. Other human rights organisations have also warned of cases of ill-treatment and criminalisation. The National Police have also reported incidents of violence by demonstrators. 
To prevent the escalation of this crisis, Amnesty International calls on President Lasso to cease stigmatising and repressing those exercising their right to peaceful protest, to publish detailed information on the number of people injured and detained, as well as the charges against them, and to address the structural causes that have led various sectors of the population to demonstrate in defence of their human rights.” 
Human rights organisations in Ecuador and Amnesty International documented similar human rights violations during the crackdown on protests in October 2019, and these still remain unpunished. 
According to public information, between the night of 17 June and the early hours of 18 June at least 16 people received injuries, including to the skull and eyes, during the repression of a demonstration by National Police officers in Riobamba. Two of the victims are reported to have suffered pellet wounds. 
On 19 June at 2:17 pm the General Commander of the National Police stated that he would launch an internal affairs investigation and denied that his officers used buckshot and also that they shot at the victims. 
Human rights defenders and Indigenous leaders have also reported suffering harassment and attacks while carrying out their work in the context of the protests. 
On 18 June the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) reported that unidentified individuals had shot at the window of the vehicle of its president, Leónidas Iza, while it was empty. Two hours later the Ministry for Government reported that it would request an investigation into this and that it did not tolerate acts of violence “all the more so if the acts occur against those who criticise us, justifiably or not”. CONAIE had already reported surveillance and harassment by unidentified persons. 
On 19 June at 6:34 pm CONAIE released a video showing two military trucks with security agents allegedly parked in the vicinity of the organisation’s headquarters in Quito. 
CONAIE, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONFENIAE) and the Alliance for Human Rights Ecuador reported having suffered attacks on their websites by bots seeking to overload their servers on 13, 14 and 18 June, respectively. 
“To prevent the escalation of this crisis, Amnesty International calls on President Lasso to cease stigmatising and repressing those exercising their right to peaceful protest, to publish detailed information on the number of people injured and detained, as well as the charges against them, and to address the structural causes that have led various sectors of the population to demonstrate in defence of their human rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Given the disturbing number of allegations of human rights violations committed by security forces, the Attorney General must conduct prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations to bring those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice, including the chain of command. 
More information: 
On 14 June, at around 12:29 a.m., security forces arrested Leonidas Iza, president of CONAIE, in Cotopaxi province. He was detained incommunicado and charged with the crime of “paralysing a public service” before being released that night. His detention may have been arbitrary and the criminal proceedings against him could constitute the criminalisation of protest. 
On 17 June President Lasso issued Executive Decree No. 455 which declared “a state of emergency due to serious internal commotion in the provinces of Cotopaxi, Pichincha and Imbabura”, suspending freedom of association, assembly and transit for thirty days. The decree established the Metropolitan District of Quito as a “Security Zone” in the charge of the Armed Forces, who were also ordered to “maintain order” in the context of the protests in a manner “complementing” the actions of the National Police. 
An earlier version of the decree, which contained the president’s signature, included worrying provisions authorising the use of “lethal force” (Article 11) by security forces and limiting the right to information (Article 9), suspending “fixed, mobile and internet telecommunications services” and restricting the dissemination of “classified, reserved or restricted information through social media, social networks and communication content”. Subsequently, the President’s Office contended that this was only a “draft” and issued a new version without these provisions. 
On 18 June, despite the state of emergency suspending freedom of association and assembly, the President’s Office issued Official Bulletin 561 entitled “Ecuadorians’ capital marches for Peace”, to promote a march of “hundreds of Quito residents (…) concerned about the situation in the country and the acts of violence and vandalism”. The bulletin included the message “The National Government supports this initiative and joins this cause”. Both the official page hosting the bulletin and the tweet promoting it were subsequently deleted. A video posted on social media, allegedly recorded during the march, shows a group of people chanting racist messages against the indigenous population.

On 13 June 2022, the Appeals Court upheld his death sentence after a grossly unfair trial. During his time in detention, he was held in solitary confinement, denied access to a lawyer, and forced to “confess” under duress. On 2 March 2022, he was re-sentenced to death by a Criminal Court in Tabuk on charges which included armed robbery and the murder of a security officer. Amnesty International calls on the Supreme Court and the King to not ratify Abdullah al-Huwaiti’s death sentence, quash his conviction, and re-try him in proceedings that are fully consistent with international fair trial standards, without resort to the death penalty.  
Abdullah al-Huwaiti was only 14 years old at the time of his arrest and when he was tried with five other defendants on 11 May 2017. Following a re-trial ordered by the Supreme Court in 2021, he was re-sentenced to death by a Criminal Court in Tabuk on 2 March 2022.   
During his detention, Abdullah al-Huwaiti was detained in solitary confinement for four months and was not allowed to speak to his family and access a lawyer throughout this period and during interrogation. Despite the fact that he was a child at the time of arrest, he was detained in the criminal investigations unit of Tabuk instead of the juvenile detention centre (Dar Al Mulahaza). Abdullah al-Huwaiti told the court: “Everything in the ‘confession’ is not true, and I was forced to confess as I was beaten and threatened… I was also told to change my testimony to match that of other defendants”. Abdullah al-Huwaiti refused to sign his testimony as he maintained it is not true; yet, the court refused to withdraw his testimony and consequently sentenced him to death.  
The Saudi Human Rights Commission said in a statement to Amnesty International in February 2022 that the country no longer executes individuals “for crimes committed by minors” and has commuted all such outstanding sentences. Meanwhile, Abdullah al-Huwaiti’s death sentence was still upheld following a re-trial.

On 27 October 2019, Abdullah al-Huwaiti was initially convicted to death by a Criminal Court in Tabuk on charges related to “gang formation and armed robbery of a jewellery story”, “the killing of a security officer intentionally and aggressively”, “robbery of gold” and “hiding the weapons used and the stolen gold.” On 10 November 2021, the Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and ordered a re-trial. On 2 March 2022, Abdullah al-Huwaiti was convicted on the same evidence and re-sentenced to death by the Criminal Court in Tabuk.  
In the absence of transparent information around judicial processes in Saudi Arabia, particularly in death penalty cases, families only find out about the fate of their loved ones through the media. Amnesty International’s assessment of the Appeals Court’s decision to uphold the conviction and death sentence of Abdullah al-Huwaiti indicates he will be at imminent risk of execution as soon as the Supreme Court ratifies it, which could be at any moment, since families are not informed when the King ratifies death sentences at the final stage.  
A Royal Order issued in 2020 announced an end to the use of the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime. However, the Royal Order does not extend to cases involving Saudi Arabia’s main counterterrorism law, the Penal Law for Crimes of Terrorism and its Financing (2017), and more generally hadd crimes (those with fixed and severe punishments) or crimes punishable by qesas (retribution-in-kind) under sharia law.  
On 13 March 2022, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior announced the execution of 81 people, in a shocking mass execution of people who had been convicted of a wide range of offences, including “terrorism”-related crimes, murder, armed robbery and arms smuggling. A number of those executed were also convicted of offences such as “disrupting the social fabric and national cohesion” and “participating in and inciting sit-ins and protests” which describe acts that are protected by the rights of freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 41 of those executed were from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority.  
In 2021, Amnesty International documented a sharp rise of 140% in executions carried out by the Saudi Arabian authorities, from 27 in 2020 to 65, including 1 woman. The rising executions trend continues into 2022, with 120 people executed so far between January and June 2022.  
As of today, 144 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The organization campaigns for total abolition of this cruel punishment.

We honour their strength and courage as they have been forced to flee their home countries...","By Alliance for Human Rights in AfghanistanWorld Refugee Day 2022 
To mark World Refugee Day, members of the Alliance for Human Rights in Afghanistan stand together to honour Afghan refugees around the globe. We honour their strength and courage as they have been forced to flee their home countries to escape conflict and persecution. We acknowledge the profound hardships they have endured and reaffirm our commitment to carry their voices and defend their rights. The Alliance for Human Rights reminds the international community of its obligations to uphold and protect the right to seek asylum, the right to life and other fundamental human rights of Afghan refugees under the international human rights law regime. 
The Afghan refugee crisis is one of the largest protracted refugee situations in the world. Today, over 6 million Afghans have been driven out of their homes and their country by conflict, violence and poverty. Of those, 3.5 million are displaced within Afghanistan, with 2.6 million Afghan refugees living in other countries. These numbers have been exacerbated by the Taliban´s seizure of power in Afghanistan in August 2021 and the critical humanitarian crisis Afghanistan is facing today. The impact of the situation has been particularly devastating for women and children, who account for 80 percent of newly displaced Afghans, as they face increased protection risks such as family separation, psychosocial stress and trauma, exploitation and gender-based violence. 
Refugee rights are fundamental human rights. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol protect the rights of refugees. This includes the right not to be expelled except under certain strictly defined conditions; the right not to be punished for illegal entry into a state; the rights to work, housing, education, public relief assistance, freedom of religion, access to the court system, freedom of movement within the territory and receiving identity and travel documents. 
Regrettably, many Afghan refugees, including in Iran, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Malaysia and Turkey do not enjoy their rights under international law. They continue to face brutality, violence, ill-treatment and pushbacks. They face discrimination and struggle to access basic services, education, work, identity and travel documents. In the worst cases, they face arbitrary detentions, penalties and forced deportation. 
We are appalled by the increasing number of incidents of violence and serious human rights violations against Afghan refugees. In the face of such egregious abuses, many governments are ignoring the great suffering of individuals in need of international protection, particularly women and children. 
States must uphold their commitments and respect fundamental human rights, including the right to life and the right to seek asylum. We call on states to: 
We stand in solidarity with Afghans – both at home and in exile.

“Constantly, reports are coming of arbitrary arrests and unlawful killings of civilians by the Taliban in Panjshir. Events in the last couple of weeks leave little room for doubt that there is a growing pattern of extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests committed by the Taliban. These serious human rights violations create a climate of fear and distrust in the region and violate international humanitarian law and may constitute war crimes. The Taliban must immediately release all the civilians who have been arbitrarily arrested by the various Taliban members and groups over accusations of being members of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) – an armed group.” 
Events in the last couple of weeks leave little room for doubt that there is a growing pattern of extrajudicial executions and arbitrary arrests committed by the Taliban 
“Amnesty International is gravely concerned about reports that those arbitrarily arrested are also facing physical torture and beatings that, in some cases, even resulted in death, as has been reported in the case of Abdul Munir Amini on 4 June.” 
“While the Taliban have rejected any reports of civilian deaths, these incidents are accompanied by lack of accountability within the Taliban rank and file. As the de facto authorities in Afghanistan, the Taliban must take immediate steps to conduct thorough, impartial and independent investigations of these incidents and prosecute those responsible for the torture, arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial execution. To ensure accountability, transparency and safeguard civilians from torture, arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances, the Taliban must release information on all those who have been arrested or detained and permit detainees to communicate with their families.” 
Background 
On 12 June 2022, the Taliban shot dead Murzataza, a resident of Khesa-Awal district of Panjshir who reportedly was also suffering from mental illness. 
On 4 June 2022, the spokesperson for the Taliban Governor of Panjshir Province in a video statement to the media said that fewer than 40 people were arrested. In Panjshir the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan, an armed group fighting against the Taliban, has strong presence. 
One of those arrested, Abdul Munir Amini, was reportedly tortured to death. 
Media reports suggest that a larger number of civilians than admitted by the Taliban have been arbitrarily arrested from various different districts of Panjshir in the past few weeks.

0,Covid-19: WTO ministerial decision on TRIPS Agreement fails to set rules that could save lives  ,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/covid-19-wto-ministerial-decision-on-trips-agreement-fails-to-set-rules-that-could-save-lives/,"Responding to today’s ministerial decision by the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the TRIPs Agreement, Tamaryn Nelson, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, said:  “More than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and the WTO still hasn’t made...","Responding to today’s ministerial decision by the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the TRIPs Agreement, Tamaryn Nelson, Amnesty International’s Researcher on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, said:  
“More than two years into the Covid-19 pandemic and the WTO still hasn’t made the changes needed to ensure everyone has access to life-saving health products when they most need them.  Under the terms of this decision, hundreds of millions of people in developing countries will likely continue to be denied access to many of these products.  
“This decision is unlikely to make a significant difference in global access to Covid-19 vaccines right now. And the fact that the WTO decided to postpone by six months the decision around extending the agreement to cover diagnostics and therapeutics – at this stage of the pandemic – demonstrates how the WTO is out of step with reality.   
“This decision is not only a hollow response to Covid-19, but it sends the message that intellectual property rights outweigh the rights to health and life. After more than 18 months of discussion, the WTO has missed an opportunity to use its power to set global trade rules that save lives, setting a worrying precedent for international cooperation in future public health emergencies.”    
Background  
The WTO’s Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement sets out minimum standards for many forms of intellectual property (IP), such as copyrights, trademarks, patents, undisclosed information (including trade secrets and test data) and anti-competitive practices.   
As IP rights can create barriers to timely access to lifesaving health products the TRIPS Agreement includes safeguards known as “flexibilities” so states can amend their laws and take certain measures to address public health emergencies, such as issuing compulsory licenses that would allow a company to produce a lifesaving drug without following IP rules.   
The Covid-19 pandemic has raised questions about whether the “flexibilities” are effective to address the world’s urgent needs, given that they usually apply on a country-by-country, case-by-case, and drug-by-drug basis and have onerous reporting requirements.    
In October 2020, India and South Africa requested a temporary waiver (IP/C/W/669) to intellectual property protections that would allow countries to produce versions of Covid-19 products more easily. Despite receiving support from more than 100 countries, this draft has stalled due to opposition from a small number of wealthy states.   
A new draft ministerial decision spearheaded by the WTO Director General (WT/MIN(22)/W/15) but largely based on proposals from the European Union, was discussed and eventually adopted at the WTO’s 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) held from 12 to 17 June 2022. Rather than waive intellectual property protections, it provides some clarifications to current “flexibilities” and a narrow exception to an export restriction on Covid-19 vaccines for the duration of five years.

The decision comes two months after the activists, including prominent philanthropist and human rights defender Osman Kavala, were convicted at the end of a sham retrial when a court of appeal overturned their previous acquittals. It also comes a week after the court published its ‘reasoned judgment’ in which it provided no grounds for its majority verdict. 
“Naming these seven people as prisoners of conscience is a recognition of the chronicle of injustice they have suffered beginning with arbitrary detention and politically-motivated prosecutions and ending in a show trial and convictions,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The injustice that these seven have been subjected to is emblematic of that suffered by so many in Turkey’s draconian crackdown on human rights.” 
On 25 April, Osman Kavala was sentenced to life in prison for ‘attempting to overthrow the government’. The prosecuting authorities alleged that he played a leadership role in the largely peaceful 2013 Gezi Park mass protests but failed to provide any evidence to substantiate their claims. He has been imprisoned since November 2017. 
His seven co-defendants, architect Mücella Yapıcı, city planner Tayfun Kahraman, lawyer Can Atalay, documentary film-maker Mine Özerden, film producer Çiğdem Mater, higher education director Hakan Altınay and university founder Yiğit Ekmekçi, were also convicted for assisting Osman Kavala. They were each sentenced to 18 years. 
Six of them were immediately put in prison and an arrest warrant was issued for the seventh defendant Yiğit Ekmekçi. 
The POC announcement was made following visits to the prisoners by a high-level delegation led by Amnesty International Turkey’s Chair, Kerem Dikmen, who is also a lawyer. 
“The shocking injustice meted out to the Gezi Park defendants exposes again how Turkey’s judicial system has become a repressive tool to silence dissent,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Each day they spend behind bars is an affront to the concept of justice and human rights, principles that the Turkish state has committed itself to upholding but is repeatedly and relentlessly violating. The Gezi Park defendants are prisoners of conscience and must be immediately and unconditionally released.” 
Who are the seven Prisoners of Conscience? 
Osman Kavala is a businessperson and has dedicated his life to promoting culture and dialogue through the arts. He set up Anadolu Kültür and arts centres in several provinces around the country, as well as projects that promote artistic expression, creating opportunities for those who could not previously access them. 
Mücella Yapıcı is an architect and was the secretary of the Istanbul branch of the Chamber of Architects at the time of the Gezi Park protests in 2013. She was among 26 people prosecuted for ‘opposition to the law on meetings and demonstrations’ and one of five people accused of ‘setting up and leading an [unlawful] organization’ and ‘opposition to the law on meetings and demonstrations’ for their role in Taksim Solidarity, a case in which they were all acquitted in 2015. The Gezi Park retrial was the third prosecution she faced in relation to the mass protests. 
Tayfun Kahraman is a town planner and a member of Taksim Solidarity. He works at the Greater Istanbul Municipality as its urban planning coordinator.Can Atalay acted as the lawyer for Taksim Solidarity and for the Istanbul Chamber of Architects during the Gezi Park protests. He is also representing the families in prominent impunity cases such as the Soma coal mine explosion that killed more than 300 miners in 2014, and the Çorlu train derailment that killed 24 people in 2018. 
Mine Özerden is a member of the Taksim Platform, another civil society umbrella group that was established in 2011 in response to the proposed redevelopment of Taksim Square. She is a documentary film-maker who has worked in advertising and in civil society organizations. 
Çiğdem Mater is a film producer and formerly a reporter, translator and producer for various international press organizations including the Boston Globe, Le Nouvel Observateur, the LA Times, RFI and Sky News. She has worked as a producer on various Turkish and international feature films and documentaries since 2010. A film that she produced called ‘Burning Days’ premiered at this year’s Cannes Film Festival. She could not attend as she was in jail but a chair at the event was left empty in tribute to her. 
Hakan Altınay is the Director of the European School of Politics and the President of the Global Civics Academy. He has written for the Financial Times, International Herald Tribune and New York Times. He was the founding director of the Open Society Foundation in Turkey.

“Member states need to seize the opportunity in Kigali to denounce this inhumane arrangement and pressure the UK and Rwanda to end the deal. It seriously threatens to undermine the international mechanism for the protection of asylum seekers.” 
Background 
The UK and Rwanda signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 14 April 2022 that agrees a system to relocate asylum seekers who are not being considered by the UK to Rwanda. 
In its submission to the Universal Periodic Review process in 2020, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees raised concerns over Rwanda’s shortcomings in its asylum process, citing the arbitrary denial of access to asylum procedures for some people, the risk of detention and deportation of undocumented asylum seekers, the discriminatory access to asylum procedures that LGBTIQ+ individuals face, or the lack of legal representation. In a legal analysis published in June 2022, UNHCR concluded that the UK-Rwanda arrangement “does not meet the requirements necessary to be considered a lawful and / or appropriate bilateral transfer arrangement.”

“If the extradition proceeds, Amnesty International is extremely concerned that Assange faces a high risk of prolonged solitary confinement, which would violate  the prohibition on torture or other ill treatment. Diplomatic assurances provided by the US that Assange will not be kept in solitary confinement cannot be taken on face value given previous history.” 
“We call on the UK to refrain from extraditing Julian Assange, for the US to drop the charges, and for Assange to be freed.” 
Julian Assange is likely to further appeal the extradition on separate  grounds that it violates his right to freedom of expression.

On the morning of 5 June, British journalist Dom Phillips, a contributor to The Guardian newspaper, and Brazilian Indigenous expert Bruno Pereira, a licensed public servant of the National Indian Foundation (Funai), were last seen before being considered missing on the route between the riverside community São Rafael and the city of Atalaia do Norte, in the state of Amazonas, in northern Brazil. The two traveled through the Javari Valley with the aim of visiting and interviewing an Indigenous surveillance team, organized to ensure the protection and environmental preservation of the reserve’s lands.  
The Javari Valley is located on the Amazon border with Peru and Colombia and has 8.5 million hectares of demarcated land, forming the second largest homologated Indigenous land in Brazil. The region is home to the largest concentration of Indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation in the world, and its access is only possible through areas and river routes. Like other regions of the Brazilian Amazon, the Javari Valley is the scene of intense conflicts led by land invaders associated with mining and illegal logging. In addition, the area is also crossed by drug trafficking disputes, which benefit from poorly supervised borders to dominate drug trade flows between the countries of the triple border.  
The region has a history of violence and threats against Funai’s civil servants, human rights defenders, and non-governmental organizations. In 2019, Maxciel Pereira dos Santos, Funai’s server in Tabatinga, was shot dead. To this day the crime has not been solved.   
The Brazilian Government, chaired by Jair Bolsonaro, is internationally recognized for its policies of dismantling environmental legislation and for its offensives against the rights of Indigenous and traditional populations. The Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) updated the complaint made by the Articulation on 9 August 2021, which accuses Jair Bolsonaro of the commission of genocide and crimes against humanity for extermination, persecution, and other inhuman acts. These facts refer to the period from January to May 2022, including negligence in the searches for Bruno da Cunha Araújo Pereira and Dom Phillips and “barbarism” in the Yanomami territory.  
The Brazilian State has an obligation to ensure that human rights defenders, journalists and public servants can carry out their work with freedom and security. Don Phillips and Bruno were recognized for their reports on the Amazon and their committed actions to indigenous peoples and territories.

At least three of the men were convicted based on torture-tainted “confessions” following grossly unfair trials. One of the three men, Hadi Rostami, was beaten by prison guards on 12 June and has since been forcibly disappeared.   
Since 8 June 2022, the authorities have made two attempts to transfer Hadi Rostami, Mehdi Sharfian, Mehdi Shahivand, Amir Shirmard, Morteza Jalili, Ebrahim Rafiei, Yaghoub Fazeli Koushki and an unidentified man to a prison with a guillotine machine to implement their sentences. On 8 June 2022, authorities told the men they would be transferred to Tehran’s Evin prison or Raja’i Shahr prison in Karaj, Alborz province, to have their sentences carried out; the transfer was postponed for unknown reasons. On 11 June 2022, authorities removed at least seven of the men from their wards and put them in a vehicle for transfer to another prison to implement their sentences, but the transfer was postponed at the last minute and the men were returned to their cells.   
According to informed sources, on 12 June 2022, prison guards broke Hadi Rostami’s nose during beatings in reprisal for him speaking out against their sentences, removed him from his prison cell and have refused to inform his family of his fate and whereabouts since, thereby subjecting him to enforced disappearance. Human rights activists in Iran have reported that a guillotine machine was recently installed in the medical clinic of Evin prison and used to amputate four fingers of a prisoner on 31 May 2022. Amputation as a form of punishment constitutes torture – a crime under international law.   
The eight men have been convicted of robbery. Hadi Rostami, 35, Mehdi Sharfian, 39, and Mehdi Shahivand, 26, were denied access to lawyers during the investigation phase of their cases and courts relied on torture-tainted “confessions” to convict them, despite the defendants retracting them during their trials. The judicial authorities failed to order any investigations into their torture allegations. According to their court verdicts, they are sentenced to “have four fingers on their right hands completely cut off so only the palm of their hands and thumbs are left”. In protest, on 29 May 2022, Hadi Rostami and Mehdi Shahivand went on hunger strike, ending it on 2 June 2022 after authorities promised to grant them pardons. In February 2021, Hadi Rostami was flogged 60 times in prison after being convicted of “disrupting prison order” in reprisal for his earlier hunger strikes against his inhumane prison conditions and repeated threats that his amputation sentence would be implemented imminently. He has attempted suicide twice in prison, including by swallowing pieces of broken glass, resulting in serious health complications for which the authorities denied him adequate medical care.

Salutation: Dear Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei 
Hadi Rostami, Mehdi Sharfian and Mehdi Shahivand were sentenced on 19 November 2019 to having their fingers amputated, after Criminal Court 1 in West Azerbaijan province found them guilty of breaking into the houses of four individuals and robbing safes containing gold and cash. Their trial was grossly unfair and relied on forced “confessions” which the men have said were obtained under torture while they were detained and interrogated, without access to their lawyers, in a detention centre run by the Investigation Unit of Iran’s Police (agahi). According to informed sources, the men were tortured through being beaten, kicked, flogged with a cable and hung from their wrists and feet during interrogations. The aforementioned sources added that Hadi Rostami’s hand was broken and interrogators removed Mehdi Shahivand’s trousers and threatened to rape him with a piece of wood if he refused to make “confessions” incriminating himself and his co-defendants. According to informed sources, interrogators forced Mehdi Sharfian and Mehdi Shahivand to “confess” to committing burglaries in which they had no involvement and to implicate Hadi Rostami in the same burglaries. In a letter written to the Head of the Judiciary on 20 September 2020, reviewed by Amnesty International, Hadi Rostami said that during the investigation phase of their case, interrogators punched, kicked and beat him with various instruments. He also said one of the interrogators demanded that he sign a blank piece of paper and that he did so only when he reached the point of physical and mental collapse. Prosecution authorities subsequently added, without his knowledge and consent, the details of his charges to the blank paper to make it appear as though he had accepted the charges. 
All three men retracted their “confessions” in court and told judges they were made under torture, but both the Criminal Court and the Supreme Court failed in their obligations to exclude the “confessions” as evidence and order investigations into their torture allegations. The verdict of the Supreme Court, reviewed by Amnesty International, briefly mentioned in a few general words that Hadi Rostami had complained about torture, but did not provide any further analysis. 
Hadi Rostami has made numerous official complaints to judicial bodies but has been ignored. In March 2021, while he was being held in Urumieh prison, he complained to a representative of the Head of the Judiciary in Iran, Ebrahim Raisi at the time, during his visit the prison; the representative gave him reassurances that his case would be resolved. Hadi Rostami has also raised his case directly with the current Head of the Judiciary Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei when he visited Ilam prison, Ilam province, while he was being held there, but to no avail. 
Previous plans by the Iranian authorities to carry out the amputation sentences against Hadi Rostami, Mehdi Sharfian and Mehdi Shahivand were halted in September 2020 after international pressure. 
Iran is legally obliged to prohibit and punish torture in all circumstances and without exception. Despite this, Iran’s Islamic Penal Code continues to provide for corporal judicial punishments amounting to torture, including amputation, flogging, blinding, crucifixion and stoning. According to Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, the Iranian courts have issued at least 356 sentences of amputation issued since 1979. The organization has also recorded the implementation of 192 amputation sentences since 1979, but the Abdorrahman Boroumand Center believes that the real number is much higher. 
Under international law, torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as punishing them for an act that they have committed or are suspected of having committed, or intimidating them or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind. The UN General Assembly has consistently condemned torture and other ill-treatment and has called on states to investigate and prosecute them. In 1975, it adopted a Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, setting out the obligations of all states to investigate allegations of torture and prosecute those responsible, as well as provide redress to victims. Article 10 of the ICCPR also states that all persons deprived of their liberty must be treated “with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person”.

Amnesty International is deeply saddened by the news of the killing of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips. We join their families, their partners Beatriz and Alessandra, and the members of the Observatório dos Povos Indígenas (OPI) and the União dos Povos Indígenas do Vale do Javari (UNIVAJA) in solidarity over the deaths of the British journalist and the Brazilian expert on Indigenous Peoples. 
The murders of Bruno Pereira and Dom Phillips are unacceptable, but they are not isolated cases in Brazil. Amnesty International will continue to investigate and demand clarity over the circumstances surrounding the disappearance and murder of these defenders of human rights and the Amazon, as well as accountability for all those involved in this crime. The Amazon must be a safe place for all people. Amnesty International demands protection and freedom in the defense of the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the right to press freedom throughout Brazil.    
Amnesty International demands justice for Bruno and Dom … President Jair Bolsonaro’s government cannot turn a blind eye to the crimes occurring in the Amazon, nor be complicit in them. All possible measures must be urgently taken to put an end to this cycle of violence in the Amazon. Who protects those who defend the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Amazon? It is the Brazilian state that has this duty.” 
“Brazil is one of the world’s most lethal countries for human rights defenders and environmentalists, and this reality is the consequence of a policy that promotes attacks on environmental legislation, dismantles institutions for the promotion and protection of the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and criminalizes social movements and community organizations,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil.  
“Amnesty International demands justice for Bruno and Dom. Their families must have access to truth and reparations. Brazilian society needs to see an end to impunity and the absence of public policies that promote and guarantee rights. President Jair Bolsonaro’s government cannot turn a blind eye to the crimes occurring in the Amazon, nor be complicit in them.

Aleksandra Skochilenko was arrested on 11 April accused of replacing price tags with anti-war information in a supermarket in Saint Petersburg. She is charged with “disseminating knowingly false information about the use of the Russian Armed Forces” (Article 207.3 of the Criminal Code). Aleksandra Skochilenko has a serious health condition and placing her in pre-trial detention where she is not getting the full appropriate diet and medical care puts her health and wellbeing at risk. She faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.   
Aleksandra Skochilenko is a songwriter and artist from Saint Petersburg. She is internationally famous for her work on destigmatizing mental illnesses that have helped many people inside and outside Russia. Aleksandra Skochilenko suffers from celiac disease (genetic gluten intolerance). If she consumes gluten, organ failure or oncological and autoimmune diseases may start to develop. According to her lawyer and media reports, the pre-trial detention centre can’t fully ensure the gluten-free diet and doesn’t lift the restrictions for food delivered by her family. This neglect of her health puts her in serious danger.

Aleksandra Skochilenko is a songwriter and artist from St. Petersburg. She is accused of replacing price tags in local supermarkets with anti-war information, including about those killed during the shelling of the Mariupol Drama Theatre. On 11 April, police searched Aleksandra Skochilenko’s home, arrested and interrogated her until 3am the next morning. On 13 April, the Vasileostrovsky District Court placed her in pre-trial detention until 1 June 2022 (the term is likely to be extended). Aleksandra Skochilenko is accused of “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the exercise by state bodies of the Russian Federation of their powers” under recently added Article 207.3 (2) of the Criminal Code. She faces 5 to 10 years in prison if convicted.   
Aleksandra Skochilenko is well-known in the art community: she writes songs, creates comic books and cartoons, organizes concerts and jam sessions. She also wrote the famous “Book About Depression” which helped many people and contributed to destigmatizing mental illnesses. The book has become extremely popular. It has been reprinted several times and translated into various languages. It also has inspired many videos and exhibitions.   
Aleksandra Skochilenko suffers from celiac disease and requires a special gluten-free diet. On 20 April it was reported that her health had deteriorated due to lack of access to adequate food. On 21 April her lawyer informed Amnesty International that the detention centre finally allowed a food parcel from her family more suitable for her. On 23 April she was transferred from a temporary detention centre to a pre-trial detention centre. On 25 April one of Aleksandra Skochilenko’s lawyers visited her in the pre-trial detention centre and reported that her health condition was getting worse, as she was not being able to eat as she is not provided with the diet she requires, and she has not been allowed food provided by her family either. She feels weak much of the time. She is also being subjected to psychological pressure from detention centre guards and her cellmates, with unsanitary conditions in her cold cell. On 7 May, after the above information was shared with the media, Aleksandra’s conditions in detention were improved. She is provided with gluten-free food at least once a day. However, she is unable to have either breakfast or dinner. On the day of her last trial, she was unable to eat anything all day. Aleksandra lost a lot of weight while in detention which creates risks for a person with her disease. In addition to that, the investigation made her partner a witness in her criminal trial. That means that they cannot see each other. Her partner made a few claims, but the investigator declined all of them.

The controversial dam was under construction in northern...,"Hidroituango is a hydroelectric dam megaproject financed in part by Canada that has resulted in severe harms to people and the environment. The controversial dam was under construction in northern Colombia when it nearly collapsed in 2018. An avalanche of water and debris resulting from a sudden re-opening of a diversion tunnel destroyed homes, bridges and livelihoods, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. The Cauca River was polluted and the ecological integrity of the area was destroyed. Four years later, locals are still suffering the consequences, with no remedy from Canada in sight. 
Export Development Canada (EDC), a Crown corporation that serves as Canada’s export credit agency, was among the lenders that financed the construction of the Hidroituango dam. EDC did so despite numerous warnings about the risks associated with the megaproject. 
For years, local fishers, artisanal miners and subsistence farmers, represented by a grassroots collective called Movimiento Ríos Vivos, denounced violence and human rights abuses linked to development of the dam, and warned of severe harms to the environment on which their livelihoods depended. Speaking out brought death threats, more attacks and even killings. 
Despite the warnings, in 2016 EDC approved a CAD $466-million loan to the company developing the project, Empresas Públicas de Medellín. EDC was aware that 45% of the loan was earmarked for construction of the enormous 2,400-megawatt dam, which Empresas Públicas de Medellín was promoting as a feat of engineering that would generate enough electricity to meet nearly one fifth of Colombia’s energy needs. 
EDC says that it undertook due diligence on the loan, screening Empresas Públicas de Medellín twice, and that it found the firm’s anti-corruption, human rights and environmental policies and procedures were adequate. With that, EDC was satisfied to go ahead with the loan. 
In 2019, a spokesperson for Movimiento Ríos Vivos, Isabel Zuleta, travelled to Canada and met with EDC executives. Accompanied by Above Ground and Amnesty International Canada, Ms. Zuleta spelled out the extent of the damage done by the dam, and called for both reparations and an end to EDC’s harmful lending practices. 
“Without foreign money, Hidroituango would not have been possible,” Ms. Zuleta said. “Six leaders of Ríos Vivos have been assassinated. Most of us have been threatened. […] Responsibility for the ongoing impact on our lives rests with the investors as well.” 
Deep concern in Canada over impacts of EDC-funded #Hidroituango dam & deadly threats vs @RiosVivosColom river defenders. #ActNow @GobAntioquia @anibalgaviria @QuinteroCalle @FP_Champagne @mary_ng @Mairead_Lavery @marcel_lebleu #DefendDefenders #DayofActionforRivers pic.twitter.com/xWXV5Hzxx3 
EDC did not deny that harms had occurred. Indeed, the credit agency publicly acknowledged in 2019 that its loan to Empresas Públicas de Medellín “tied EDC’s name to an environmental, economic and human catastrophe.” However, EDC stopped short of taking any responsibility for providing remedy. 
As part of its human rights framework, in 2020 EDC adopted a formal policy statement describing its “principles on leverage and remedy.” EDC states that these principles will help “advance human rights risk management” and “better position EDC to ensure that remedy gets provided when impacts occur, through actions we can take before and after impacts occur.” The principles are little comfort to communities in Colombia harmed by the Hidroituango megaproject. 
Remedy requires the rectification of injustices. According to the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, an authoritative global standard unanimously endorsed by member states of the UN Human Rights Council including Canada in 2011, remedy can include apologies, restitution, rehabilitation, financial or non-financial compensation, and guarantees of non-repetition to prevent further harm. 
To our knowledge, EDC has offered none of these remedies, or any other remedy, to the victims of the Hidroituango disaster, even after hearing direct testimony about the desperate situation for those who lost their homes and livelihoods. 
It would not be unprecedented for a lender to provide financial compensation to people harmed by a project it bankrolled. The Australian and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has done so, compensating Cambodian families who were forcibly evicted for a project it supported. EDC’s policy, on the other hand, never mentions financial compensation. It acknowledges that those who are harmed have a right to recourse that restores them to “the situation they were in before the impact occurred” but adds that “[i]n most cases, EDC’s responsibility is to use our leverage to encourage customers and other responsible parties to provide appropriate forms of remedy for people severely impacted by their activities.” 
It’s a strategy with loopholes. For instance, EDC told Above Ground and Amnesty International Canada that it has “no leverage” to press Empresas Públicas de Medellín to provide remedy for Hidroituango’s harms, as the company repaid all its EDC financing by 2019. With this, it appears EDC has washed its hands of the mess. 
Given this reality, it’s hard to see EDC’s policy as anything more than a hollow theoretical statement about the “right to effective recourse” for victims of “adverse impacts” that allows EDC to distance itself from potential culpability. 
Construction on the Hidroituango dam continues and it is now scheduled to be operational by November 2022. Meanwhile, surrounding communities are still suffering devastating impacts from violence and destruction associated with the project. 
While EDC’s loan to Empresas Públicas de Medellín has been repaid, Canada’s export credit agency continues to back corporate investments in other areas of Colombia where human rights violations are linked to corporate activity.[1] Articles on EDC’s website promote Colombia as a post-conflict country, where human rights violations are a thing of the past and it is no longer risky to do business, despite abundant recent evidence to the contrary. The agency also continues to support or promote investment in Colombian industries associated with well-documented reports of grave human rights violations, such as agri-business, oil and gas, and defence and security. Human rights, environmental protection, leverage and remedy must be more than words in policy documents. Risk assessment of any request for financing must always put first the dangers posed to people and the environment. Human rights and environmental due diligence must prioritize careful consultation with affected communities and credible organizations. EDC must also actively defend human rights by advocating for guarantees that people who speak out against the harms posed by a project do not face criminalization, threats or attack. As Movimiento Ríos Vivos legitimately states: “We have our own voice, one that must be listened to by government entities. […] [T]he lands and lives of many people depend on our testimony.” 
[1]EDC has recently provided finance to companies affiliated with Empresas Públicas de Medellín – up to CAD $500 million in 2020 and 2021 – and to other companies operating in conflict-laden regions of Colombia. 
Add your voice to our petition to send a message to Canada’s International Trade Minister and the President of Export Development Canada calling on them to: 1. Remedy the impacts of EDC’s Hidroituango dam investment and 2. Stop investing in human rights and environmental harm

On 20 May 2022, the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE) and other organizations announced that they would start mass protests on 13 June in response to austerity measures and alleged failures by Guillermo Lasso’s government to guarantee their economic, social, cultural and environmental rights. They also published an agenda with their main demands.  
On 11 June, the Minister of the Interior, Patricio Carrillo, stigmatized demonstrators even before protests had taken place, stating that “The announced mobilization or demonstration, in practice, is a week of blocked highways and oil wells, kidnappings of police and military personnel, looting, etc. They will disguise it as a social struggle to provoke victimization. Who benefits from another protest without limits?”  
On 13 June, CONAIE and other Indigenous, farmer peasant, labour, education, student, feminist, LGBTI and environmentalist organizations started protests. Many of these protests included blocking roads in different provinces. Since that day, human rights organizations in Ecuador have made allegations of arbitrary detentions, criminalization, and excessive use of force, including indiscriminate use of tear gas, against protesters, human rights defenders, and journalists across the country, including a student who was allegedly shot in the leg in Quito.  
On 14 June at 0:29 a.m., a live streaming showed officers in Police and military uniforms detaining Leónidas Iza, president of the CONAIE, near Pastocalle, in the province of Cotopaxi, and pushing him into a white unmarked vehicle that later left the scene. Later that morning, Ecuador’s Human Rights Alliance complained that the officers who detained him failed to present an arrest warrant and to inform him of the grounds for his detention, that authorities concealed his whereabouts and kept him incommunicado, preventing him from contacting his family and lawyers, and that the plates of the vehicle (PTR-3246) in which he was transported did not appear on publicly available databases. This may indicate that his detention was arbitrary.  
At 1:18 a.m., President Lasso posted a video, accusing protesters of committing crimes and threatening them with prosecution: “The detention of intellectual and material authors, who executed these violent acts, has started (…) We cannot be victims of vandals who only want to cause chaos (…) Now that we have begun reactivation, we cannot stop. Those who commit acts of vandalism will answer to justice and to the Ecuadorian people”.  
At 3:20 a.m., the National Police informed that it had detained Leónidas Iza in the parish of Pastocalle, Cotopaxi province, on “presumption of commission of crimes”, without specifying the alleged acts he committed or the actual charges against him. The National Police also stated that he was being held at a “temporary custody room, for in flagrante delicto hearings”.  
At 9:22 a.m., the General Prosecutor’s Office informed that it had only became aware of Leónidas Iza’s detention through social media, and that the National Police had not presented him to its institution, nor had it provided the corresponding police report to explain the motivation of his detention. Finally, it stated that the General Prosecutor had issued guidelines to provincial prosecutors to coordinate actions and proceedings with “corresponding authorities” to prevent illegal or arbitrary detentions.  
At 10:47 a.m., the General Prosecutor’s Office informed that it had received the police report of Leónidas Iza’s detention in flagrante delicto (detained at the very moment a crime is being committed) that early morning in the Cotopaxi province, and stated that the institution would follow the corresponding proceedings.  
At 11:37 a.m., the National Police informed that Leónidas had been detained while he allegedly “directed and encouraged actions for the escalation and radicalization of violence”, and that it had delivered the police report on his detention to the Prosector’s Office “first thing in the morning”.  
Later that day, Iza’s lawyers complained that them and his family ignored his whereabouts, but that information available on social media indicated he may have been transported from the Cotopaxi province to Quito in the unmarked vehicle, and then to a military facility in Latacunga, Cotopaxi province, in a military vehicle.  
That night, Leónidas Iza’s in flagrante delicto hearing was held at the Specialized judicial unit for violence against women or family members and offenses against sexual and reproductive integrity, in the city of Latacunga. The judge ruled that his detention was legal and initiated criminal proceedings against him for the “blockage of public services”, for this alleged participation in the obstruction of roads during the protests. This could constitute criminalization of the right to protest.   
Ecuador’s Human Rights Alliance has identified at least 36 people detained between 14 and 15 June in Quito and Cotopaxi in the context of the protests.

In addition, bail conditions of house-arrest have been imposed on Tantawan ‘Tawan’ Tuatulanon, after detaining her for 36 days. Nutthanit has missed university exams due to being detained. The three face criminal proceedings including under laws on sedition and lèse majesté, solely for peacefully soliciting public opinion in an opinion poll and sharing their opinions online.

Netiporn and Nutthanit have been detained since 3 May 2022, with their requests for bail repeatedly denied. They have been on hunger strike since 2 June 2022 in protest of their detention. Tantawan is currently on bail under house arrest, after 36 days of hunger strike in detention after authorities revoked her initial/earlier bail on 20 April 2022. 
On 10 March 2022, police initiated criminal proceedings against Netiporn, Nutthanit and Tantawan for canvassing the opinions of shoppers outside a Bangkok shopping mall on 8 February 2022, summoning the three to face complaints that they had refused to comply with police officers, and released them on bail. The three women and others had asked members of the public about their views on road traffic controls imposed when royal motorcades are travelling. Officials initiated criminal complaints against them under Article 112 of the Criminal Code governing lèse majesté, which allows three to 15 years’ imprisonment for “whoever, defames, insults or threatens the King, the Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent,” and Article 116 of the Criminal Code, which allows for seven years imprisonment, and prohibits people “to raise unrest and disaffection amongst the people in a manner likely to cause disturbance in the country; or to cause the people to transgress the laws of the Country.” International human rights experts have recommended Thai authorities amend or repeal these and other laws, in order to comply with Thailand’s international human rights obligations. 
Police had also detained Tantawan between 5 and 7 March 2022, taking her into custody while she livestreamed Facebook commentary about traffic measures police were instituting to clear roads outside UN headquarters in Bangkok, in preparation for the passing of a royal motorcade. She was released on bail under condition that she does not carry out activities that degrade the monarchy. Police started criminal proceedings against her under Article 112 of the Criminal Code, governing lèse majesté, and provisions of the Computer Crimes Act on the import of material into computer systems. 
In mid-March police requested the Criminal Court and South Bangkok Criminal Court to revoke all three women’s conditional release on bail. The three women were remanded to custody, with Tantawan detained on 20 April, and Netiporn and Nutthanit on 3 May 2022. Police alleged on 3 May 2022 that Nutthanit and Netiporn had violated conditions of their release by carrying out another opinion poll on 13 March 2022. Police also alleged that by advertising the poll on Facebook, they had provoked gatherings that would bring public disorder, and that Tantawan would be likely to continue her activism if not detained. Authorities repeatedly denied all three women’s request for release on bail, only releasing Tantawan to 30 days of house arrest after her health deteriorated because of a hunger strike. 
Thai authorities have carried out a wide-ranging crackdown on peaceful protest and online discussion since overwhelmingly peaceful pro-democracy reform protests started in July 2020. Officials are using vaguely worded provisions of laws – on security, the monarchy and computer crimes – as instruments of repression and are interpreting the peaceful exercise of rights as a threat to security or public order, or offence to the monarchy, and subsequently file criminal proceedings against activists which may result in up to life imprisonment. 
Prominent protesters have also faced months of arbitrary pre-trial detention, often compromising their rights to education and access to a livelihood. They are currently subject to increasingly restrictive bail conditions which stringently limit their human rights to freedom of movement, expression and peaceful assembly, including requirements to stay within their places of residence for up to 24 hours daily, unless for medical treatment, and wear electronic monitoring bracelets 24 hours a day. 
During 2022, Thai authorities have filed criminal proceedings against protesters in connection with their public peaceful activism. Officials continue to increase their judicial harassment of people engaging in acts of perceived public dissent, including children, and are escalating measures to stifle public expressions of opinion and peaceful protest and are imposing excessive restrictions on people’s right to peaceful protest and expression.

NWAC is a national Indigenous organization representing the political voice of Indigenous women, girls and gender diverse people in Canada, inclusive of First Nations on and off reserve, status and non-status, disenfranchised, Métis and Inuit. NWAC was founded on the collective goal to enhance, promote and foster the social, economic, cultural and political well-being of Indigenous women within their respective communities and Canadian societies. 
In partnership with Amnesty’s Gender Rights Specialized Team, NWAC recently relaunched the Faceless Dolls Project in order to generate greater awareness of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls across Canada. For more information about the project and to participate, click here to read our recent blog post or watch our webinar. 
For many Canadians, summer’s warmth inspires travel plans: driving along forested highways, road trips exploring new territories, making pilgrimages to annual reunions. For Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people, travel plans raise significant safety dangers. Canada’s transportation corridors remain ground zero for incidents of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG), both solved and unsolved. 
Investigations into Indigenous deaths and disappearances along highways continue, despite the misperception that the MMIWG crisis has been resolved. While most Canadians enjoy their human right to bodily security, the continuing genocide against the people represented by the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) means they face a significant risk of harm every single time they travel, especially if they are travelling alone. 
Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people are left to rely on their own tools and supports as they navigate the continuing safety risks they face. Grandmothers, aunties, cousins, sisters, and mothers all share information with each other along informal lines, warning against places and people to avoid. 
In 2021, NWAC developed a map that identifies risk hotspots for Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people across the country as part of its Safe Passage project. Using MMIWG case data, the map tracks violence intensity zones. It is a vital resource and tool in helping those at risk when making travel decisions. 
Many Indigenous women who travel this country’s roads are not on leisure trips. Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people may be travelling alone because they are fleeing violence, poverty, or other unsafe situations in their home or community. They may be going to work or a medical appointment in a community that has no direct link by public transportation. The Final Report of the National Inquiry into MMIWG Report released in 2019 explains, in depth, the ways colonization increases these risks. Call to Justice 4.8 calls “upon all governments to ensure that adequate plans and funding are put into place for safe and affordable transit and transportation services and infrastructure for Indigenous women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA people living in remote or rural communities.” Call to Justice 17.9 calls on Canada to provide safe transportation options, such as “safe ride” programs in rural, remote, and Northern communities. These calls have yet to be fulfilled. 
NWAC’s Safe Passage project is both a response to the continuing MMIWG crisis, and a critical tool highlighting the urgency and importance for Canada to take meaningful action. We continue to add cases to the database on a weekly basis and the creation of the map is just one of the actions we are taking while governments dither about what to do next. NWAC calls on Canada to begin to take the steps necessary to address the 231 Calls to Justice in the MMIWG Final Report.  
Our recent analysis finds there has been little effort in that regard since the release of the Inquiry report. Budget 2021 directs $2.2 billion over five years, but concrete action items are not separately costed, and provide little information to show how these funds will help. While we advocate for these concrete steps, we can turn to human-rights laws to demand meaningful action. 
 Human rights laws set the stage for shifting away the perspectives that devalue Indigenous lives and view them as less important. Laws can recognize and affirm that we are inherently and equally worthy of the rights to life and safety. 
Human rights laws, both domestic and international, cannot promise safety for Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people, but they do offer a path to change the grim reality of the MMIWG crisis. Human rights laws set the stage for shifting away the perspectives that devalue Indigenous lives and views them as less important. Laws can recognize and affirm that we are inherently and equally worthy of the rights to life and safety as any other Canadian. Human rights laws also hold Canadian decision-makers accountable for the actions they are taking (or often, not taking) to address violence, especially when it is an ongoing, national crisis harming a specific group of people. For example, when the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child reviewed Canada’s human rights commitments to children earlier this month, they called on Canada to take stronger steps to investigate and provide justice to MMIWG family members. 
Yet, we face barriers when we try to get help and seek protection from violence. Witnesses told the National Inquiry numerous stories of police ignoring requests to help locate missing women, hesitancy to call police during domestic violence for fear their children would be taken and violence committed by health care professionals. Canada does not honour our human rights when it allows unsafe systems to continue operating. These include systemic discrimination in health, child welfare, and justice systems. In reality, this means that Canada’s continued failure to address violence against women is perpetuating genocide. 
As a result, Indigenous women, girls, and gender-diverse people are left to rely on their own tools and supports as they navigate the continuing safety risks they face. Grandmothers, aunties, cousins, sisters, and mothers all share information with each other along informal lines, warning against places and people to avoid. NWAC’s map is helping them. 
We do this because we know, from lived experience, the people in power are not making decisions and taking actions that prioritize our safety. This must change.

A new report, ‘Anyone can die at any time’: Indiscriminate attacks by Russian forces in Kharkiv, Ukraine, documents how Russian forces have caused widespread death and destruction by relentlessly bombarding residential neighbourhoods of Kharkiv since their invasion began in late February.  
During an extensive investigation, Amnesty International found evidence of Russian forces repeatedly using 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions as well as scatterable mines, both of which are subject to international treaty bans because of their indiscriminate effects.  
“The people of Kharkiv have faced a relentless barrage of indiscriminate attacks in recent months, which killed and injured hundreds of civilians,” said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International’s Senior Crisis Response Adviser.  
“People have been killed in their homes and in the streets, in playgrounds and in cemeteries, while queueing for humanitarian aid, or shopping for food and medicine.  
“The repeated use of widely banned cluster munitions is shocking, and a further indication of utter disregard for civilian lives. The Russian forces responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable for their actions, and victims and their families must receive full reparations.”  
The director of the Medical Department at the Kharkiv Regional Military Administration told Amnesty International that 606 civilians had been killed and 1,248 injured in the Kharkiv region since the conflict began. Most of the strikes investigated by Amnesty International inflicted multiple casualties over widespread areas.  
While Russia is not a party to either the Convention on Cluster Munitions or the Convention on Anti-Personnel Mines, international humanitarian law prohibits indiscriminate attacks, and the use of weapons that are indiscriminate by nature.  Launching indiscriminate attacks resulting in death or injury to civilians, or damage to civilian objects, constitutes war crimes.  
The bombardment of Kharkiv, home to 1.5 million people, started on 24 February when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Residential neighbourhoods in the northern and eastern parts of the city bore the brunt of the shelling.  
On the afternoon of 15 April, Russian forces fired cluster munitions in and around Myru Street, in the Industrialni neighbourhood. At least nine civilians were killed and more than 35 injured, including several children. Doctors at Kharkiv’s City Clinical Hospital 25 showed Amnesty International metal fragments they had removed from patients’ bodies, including the distinctive pieces of steel rods contained in 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions.  
Tetiana Ahayeva, a 53-year-old nurse, was standing by the entrance of her building when several cluster bombs exploded. She told Amnesty International: “There was a sudden sound of firecrackers everywhere, lots of them, all over. I saw puffs of black smoke where the explosions occurred. We dropped to the ground and tried to find cover. Our neighbour’s son, a 16-year-old boy called Artem Shevchenko, was killed on the spot… His father had a shattered hip and a shrapnel wound in his leg. It’s hard to say how long the explosions lasted; a minute can seem to last forever.”  
In a nearby playground, Oksana Litvynyenko, 41, suffered devastating injuries when several cluster munitions exploded while she was walking with her husband Ivan and their four-year-old daughter. Shrapnel penetrated her back, chest and abdomen, puncturing her lungs and spine. She tragically died on 11 June. The strike took place in the middle of the afternoon, while many other families were at the playground with their children. 
Ivan told Amnesty International on 26 April: “All of a sudden, I saw a flash… I grabbed my daughter and pushed her against the tree and hugged the tree, so that she was protected between the tree and my body. There was a lot of smoke, and I couldn’t see anything… Then as the smoke around me eased, I saw people on the ground… my wife Oksana was lying on the ground. When my daughter saw her Mum on the ground in a pool of blood, she said to me, ‘Let’s go home: Mum is dead and the people are dead’. She was in shock and so was I. I still don’t know whether my wife will recover; the doctors cannot say if she will be able to speak or walk again. Our world has been turned upside down.” 
After more than one month in intensive care, Oksana’s condition had improved slightly, but she died from her injuries on 11 June. Amnesty International researchers found the distinctive fins and metal pellets and other fragments from the 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions at the playground. Several small craters in the concrete ground were also visible, consistent with the damage expected from the explosion of such munitions. 
All of a sudden, I saw a flash… I grabbed my daughter and pushed her against the tree and hugged the tree, so that she was protected between the tree and my body 
At least six people were killed and 15 were injured on the morning of 24 March, when cluster munitions struck a parking lot near the Akademika Pavlova metro station where hundreds of people were queuing for humanitarian aid.  
Valeriia Kolyshkina, a sales assistant in a pet shop close to the scene of the strike, said that one man was killed when the explosions destroyed the glass front of a nearby store.   
She told Amnesty International: “A man was killed just outside the shop. He was standing outside smoking while his wife was buying pet food… Metal shrapnel came through the front window, flying over my head as I was behind the counter. Then there were several more explosions. It was utter panic. The shop was full of people. We ran to the storage room at the back of the shop for protection. It was very scary… I thought I would die.”  
Ruslan*, a local policeman who witnessed the attack, said: “It was really a horrible situation, shrapnel was falling like rain.”  
Amnesty International researchers found parts of a 220mm Uragan rocket, which carries 30 submunitions, still embedded in a crater in the tarmac. Around the area, they also found fins and fragments from the 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions, and multiple other craters.  
Two other cluster munitions also hit the roof of the Holy Trinity Church, approximately 500 metres from where the rocket landed. The church serves as a humanitarian hub where volunteers prepare food and aid packages to be distributed to people who struggle to access humanitarian assistance distribution points, such as older people and those with disabilities and reduced mobility. Pastor Petro Loboiko and Pastor Serhii Andreiivich showed Amnesty International shrapnel from two cluster munitions that had penetrated the church’s walls and doors after exploding on the roof.    
 It was utter panic. The shop was full of people. We ran to the storage room at the back of the shop for protection. It was very scary… I thought I would die 
On the afternoon of 12 March, Veronica Cherevychko, a 30-year-old logistics manager and mother, lost her right leg when a Grad rocket struck a playground in front of her home in the Saltivka neighbourhood.  
She told Amnesty International: “I was sitting on this bench when the explosion happened. I remember hearing a whistling sound just before the explosion. Then I woke up in hospital, without a leg; my right leg was gone. Now my life is divided into before 12 March, and after 12 March. I will get used to this. Now I am not yet used to it; I often try to touch my leg, to scratch my foot… I don’t know what to say about [the] people who did it. I will never understand them.”  
Three people were killed and six injured when a series of cluster munitions exploded in the same neighbourhood on the morning of 26 April. Olena Sorokina, a 57-year-old cancer survivor, lost both legs in the blast. She was sitting outside her building waiting for a delivery of humanitarian aid when she heard the sound of a flying shell and ran to the entrance of the building.  
Olena blacked out, then woke up in an ambulance and realized that she had lost a leg. She was taken to hospital, where her other leg also had to be amputated. She is now in western Ukraine, hoping to be transferred to a rehabilitation facility elsewhere in Europe. Olena told Amnesty International: “After the battle with cancer, now I have to face another battle to learn to function without legs.”  
Unguided rockets – such as Grads and Uragans, which have been routinely used by Russian forces – are inherently inaccurate, making them indiscriminate when used in populated areas. Unguided artillery shells have a margin of error of over 100 metres. In residential areas where buildings are no more than a few metres apart, such inaccuracies are virtually certain to cost civilian lives and cause widespread destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure.  
Ukrainian forces, for their part, often launched strikes from residential neighbourhoods, endangering civilians in those areas. Such a practice violates international humanitarian law, but does not in any way justify Russian forces’ repeated indiscriminate strikes.  
I don’t know what to say about [the] people who did it. I will never understand them 
Amnesty International researchers investigated 41 strikes (which killed at least 62 people and injured at least 196) and interviewed 160 people in Kharkiv over 14 days in April and May, including survivors of attacks, relatives of victims, witnesses, and doctors who treated the injured. The organization’s researchers collected and analysed material evidence from strike locations, notably munitions fragments, as well as an array of digital materials.  
All of Amnesty International’s ongoing documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here.

The Egyptian authorities have subjected Aisha el-Shater to torture by holding her in prolonged solitary confinement, barring any family visits for more than three and a half years and deliberately denying her access to adequate healthcare even though she has a serious and potentially life-threatening health condition.  
On 23 August 2021, after spending more than 32 months in pre-trial detention, prosecutors indicted them and referred them to trial by the Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) on charges of joining, financing and supporting a “terrorist group”, in reference to the Muslim Brotherhood. The trial began on 11 September 2021 and has been adjourned to 13 June 2022.  
Officials at al-Qanater women’s prison held Aisha el-Shater in solitary confinement in a small poorly ventilated cell, without a bathroom, from January 2019 until December 2020. Guards forced her to wear light clothes in her unheated cell during cold winter months and regularly conducted searches of her cell, confiscating her hygiene products and other personal belongings. Since her detention, the authorities have denied her any family visits, and barred any written or phone communication with her family and lawyers. This treatment amounts to torture, a crime under international law. Aisha el- Shater has aplastic anaemia, a rare and serious condition affecting the blood, which increases the risk of infections and uncontrolled bleeding. Despite this, the authorities have denied her access to adequate and specialized healthcare in an outside hospital.   
Her health deteriorated in detention, and she was admitted, while handcuffed, to Al-Qasr al-Ainy hospital twice in October 2019, with significant bleeding, and was given a platelet transfusion. Since December 2020, she has been held at the al-Qanater prison clinic, but she requires specialist and ongoing treatment in adequately equipped facilities, not available in prison. During the 15 May 2022 trial hearing, the ESSC ordered for Aisha el-Shater’s examination by a committee of three doctors to advise on whether she needs treatment outside prison. As she is banned from communicating with the outside word, her family and lawyers have no information on whether the examination has taken place.

On 1 November 2018, Aisha el-Shater and her husband Mohamed Abo Horeira were arrested from their home in Nasr City, Cairo. Sources told Amnesty International that Aisha el-Shater was forcibly disappeared for 20 days, during which period security forces refused to provide her family any information about her fate and whereabouts. Amnesty International learned from informed sources that during this time, she was held at the headquarters of the National Security Agency in the Abbasiya neighbourhood of Cairo and subjected to beatings and electric shocks. On 21 November 2018, she appeared before the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), where prosecutors ordered her pre-trial detention pending investigations on accusations of “membership in a terrorist group” ”receiving financing for a terrorist purpose” and ”participating in a criminal agreement intended to commit a terrorist crime”. Before her arrest, she spoke out on her account on Facebook about human rights violations in Egypt including enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment in places of detention. Prior to his arrest, lawyer Mohamed Abo Horeira represented detainees suspected of membership in the Muslim Brotherhood.  
On the day of their arrest, 1 November 2018, the Egyptian authorities launched a series of raids, arresting at least 31 human rights defenders and lawyers; 10 women and 21 men. The Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF), which documented enforced disappearances and the use of the death penalty, and provided legal aid to victims of human rights violations, was particularly targeted by the crackdown. In a statement published on 1 November 2018 announcing the suspension of its human rights work, ECRF cited the situation in Egypt as incompatible with human rights work and demanded the UN Human Rights Council to intervene.  
On 23 August 2021, the SSSP referred Aisha el-Shater, Mohamed Abo Horeira, human rights defender and founder of the ECRF, Ezzat Ghoniem, human rights lawyer Hoda Abdelmoniem and 27 other defendants to trial in front of the Emergency State Security Court (ESSC). The SSSP indicted them on various charges, including membership in a terrorist group (the Muslim Brotherhood), disseminating false news about human rights abuses by security forces through a Facebook page titled “the Egyptian Coordination for Rights and Freedoms”, funding a terrorist group and possession of pamphlets to promote the terrorist group’s objectives.  
On 25 October 2021, President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi announced that he would not extend the state of emergency, in force since 2017, which allowed for the creation of ESSCs. Article 19 of the law governing the state of emergency stipulates that, ongoing trials are to continue even after the state of emergency is no longer in force. In the three months preceding the decision not to renew the state of emergency, the Egyptian authorities referred at least 26 human rights defenders, activists and opposition politicians to trial before emergency courts. Proceedings in front of ESSCs are inherently unfair. Defendants are denied the right to appeal their convictions and sentences to a higher tribunal. Only the president retains the power to authorize, quash or commute sentences or to order a retrial. Other documented fair trial violations include the right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defense, right to communicate with counsel of their own choosing and right to a public hearing. In addition, judges at the ESSC routinely deny requests by lawyers to photocopy casefiles, which in some cases exceed 2,000 pages, instead instructing them to review them in court. Prosecutors and judges have also failed to provide copies of indictment orders to defendants and their lawyers, undermining their right to be informed of the exact nature and cause of charges against them. Authorities banned Aisha el-Shater from meeting with their lawyers except in court, violating her right to adequate defense.  
In recent months, dozens of political opponents and critics have been convicted of bogus charges following grossly unfair trials by ESSCs. Among them are politicians Zyad el-Elaimy and Hisham Fouad, who were sentenced in November 2021 to between five and three years in prison, respectively, following an unfair trial by an ESSC simply for criticizing Egypt’s human rights record and economic policies. Security forces arrested them in June 2019, shortly after they met to discuss running in the 2020 elections and detained them without trial for over two years. On 29 May 2022, an ESSC sentenced 25 political opponents, including politician Mohamed al-Kassas and former presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh to 10 and 15 years in prison, respectively, after convicting them of trumped-up terrorism-related charges and spreading false news.  
Aisha el-Shater’s father, Khairat el-Shater, has been imprisoned since July 2013, when the military ousted former president Mohamed Morsi. Since then, the authorities banned the Muslim Brotherhood and rounded-up and prosecuted its leaders and tens of thousands of suspected members and supporters.

0,It’s time to stop bankrolling and exporting climate destruction￼,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/its-time-to-stop-bankrolling-and-exporting-climate-destruction%ef%bf%bc/,"Canada is the largest provider of public finance for fossil fuels in the G20 By Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty Canada and Karen Hamilton, Director of Above Ground Climate change is a global human rights emergency of unprecedented proportions—and devastating consequences....","By Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty Canada and Karen Hamilton, Director of Above Ground 
Climate change is a global human rights emergency of unprecedented proportions—and devastating consequences. Already, half the world’s population suffers from severe water shortages and climate change-related diseases are on the rise. We must change course to protect lives and rights. 
The role of fossil fuels in this emergency is indisputable, prompting dire warnings from experts like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unless we make drastic, immediate cuts in fossil fuel use, the panel reports, accelerated climate breakdown will expose millions if not billions more people to food and water shortages, deadly heat stress, increasing droughts and other life-threatening disasters. 
Canada’s contribution to this crisis must be addressed. We must immediately end our bankrolling of fossil fuels. 
Canada is the world’s third largest oil exporter. According to the most recent data released by Environment Canada, our oil and gas exports in 2019 alone generated a staggering 954 megatonnes of CO2 equivalent—more than the country’s total national emissions that year. Canada may have stabilized emissions at home, but emissions from our fossil fuel exports surged by over 46 per cent between 2012 and 2019. 
Many Canadians are likely unaware that our status as a global fossil fuel powerhouse is enabled by billions of dollars a year in public financing provided by Canada’s export bank, Export Development Canada (EDC). EDC’s support for the sector averaged $13.6-billion a year between 2018 and 2020, making Canada the largest provider of public finance for fossil fuels in the G20. This was 22 times greater than EDC’s support for renewable energy. 
The federal government pledged last December to “develop a plan” to phase out public financing for fossil fuels, including by Crown corporations like EDC. But there is reason to fear the plan may include substantive loopholes. 
An indication is Ottawa’s Emissions Reduction Plan, released in March, that calls for the fossil fuel industry to reduce emissions—by 31 per cent over 2005 levels by 2030—while also allowing for increased oil and gas production. 
Such policy incoherence relies on the calculation that at least 80 per cent of oil and gas emissions are generated when the fuel is burned. This means Canada can increase oil and gas production for export – and back it with massive sums of public financial support, as seen with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion – and still appear to meet its climate obligations because it won’t be counting emissions generated in the countries that burn Canadian fossil fuels. 
Add to this the government’s controversial new tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS), decried by hundreds of Canadian climate scientists and academics as a massive new oil and gas subsidy. Ottawa says CCUS projects are exempt from an international pledge it signed at the UN last November to end a small portion of its fossil finance by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Export Development Canada recently announced the creation of so-called “transition bonds” that will provide support for oil and gas companies seeking to invest in CCUS technology. 
Ottawa defends its funding of CCUS by arguing there is a market opportunity in positioning Canada as the world’s “cleanest oil and gas producer.” Yet there is little value in being a “clean” producer of a product whose impacts, as Amnesty International reports in Stop Burning Our Rights, imperil the right to water, food, health, housing, work and life for hundreds of millions of people. 
Even if Canadian oil and gas companies were to capture the totality of their emissions—and so far, CCUS projects are yet to meet targets—burning the fuels produced will continue to exacerbate climate change, wreaking havoc on vulnerable populations, deepening inequalities and triggering severe, irreversible impacts. 
The alarms are ringing, and they are deafening. The world urgently needs a just transition to sustainable climate solutions that protect human rights and a liveable future. This requires Canada to stop bankrolling fossil fuels immediately and a rapid decline in production—with or without carbon capture. 
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres so bluntly said: “The truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuels infrastructure is moral and economic madness.” 
Canada’s fossil fuel folly must come to an end.

“This is a blatant violation of international humanitarian law on so many counts. 
“The three were members of the Ukrainian regular forces and under the Geneva Conventions, as prisoners of war, they are protected from prosecution for taking part in hostilities. The only exception is prosecution for alleged war crimes, in which case there must be sufficient admissible evidence, and fair trial standards must be ensured. Not only this is not the case in this scenario – they were not tried by an independent, impartial regularly constituted court but by Russian proxies. The so-called ‘charges’ against them would not constitute war crimes. And most outrageously of all, the taking of their lives as result of the grossly unfair proceedings would constitute arbitrary deprivation of life. 
“In fact, wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or other protected person of the right to a fair and regular trial constitutes a war crime. Russia, as the occupying power, bears responsibility for the treatment of all prisoners of war and others deprived of their liberty. They must ensure this so-called ‘sentence’ is immediately quashed, and that these men are treated in full compliance with international humanitarian law.” 
Background 
The “death sentence” against British nationals Sean Pinner and Aiden Aslin and Moroccan national Saadun Brahim, was pronounced on 9 June by the de-facto Supreme Court of the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, a self-proclaimed separatist entity under Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine. 
They were “convicted” of being foreign mercenaries and “actions aimed at violent seizure of power and overthrow of the constitutional order of the DNR”. The three were taking part in the fighting with Russia as members of the regular Ukrainian forces, and were taken captive in May by Russian forces in Mariupol in south-eastern Ukraine.

OTTAWA – In the lead-up to the upcoming WTO ministerial meetings, key figures in the global movement for vaccine justice are calling on the Canadian government to change its position on lifting intellectual property rules for COVID-19 vaccines and other tools. 
For more than 18 months, Canadian trade officials have refused to back the call for making vaccines, tests, and treatments available globally as public goods. 
The open letter is signed by prominent Canadians Stephen Lewis and Naomi Klein, as well as renowned international advocates Joseph Stiglitz (Nobel Prize winning economist), Fatima Hassan (Health Justice Initiative) and Achal Prabhala (AccessIBSA project). 
Other Canadian signatories include Dr. Joanne Liu (former International President, MSF), Dr. Madhukar Pai (Canada Research Chair in Epidemiology & Global Health), Ketty Nivyabandi (Amnesty Canada), and Christina Warner (The Council of Canadians). 
The letter is addressed to Prime Minister Trudeau and was initiated by the Council of Canadians. 
“Over the last two years, monopolies on life-saving vaccines held by a handful of pharmaceutical companies, and the shameful vaccine nationalism and hoarding of wealthy countries, have caused immeasurable suffering and millions of avoidable deaths,” the signatories write. “It is time Canada broke with pharmaceutical monopolies and the failed charity-based model that have hobbled the global fight against the pandemic.” 
More than 100 other countries have joined the call for a comprehensive waiver of intellectual property rights. But WTO negotiations have been stalled for the last year and a half “by the intransigence of a handful of wealthy countries – including Canada,” the letter points out. 
“There is disturbing evidence that the pharmaceutical industry has been behind Canada’s quiet obstructionism at the WTO,” the signatories further write. “Your government has long committed to the principles of fairness and equity. But in practice, a few pharmaceutical companies have been given free rein to use their monopolies to deny access to their life-saving products around the world, to the detriment of our collective well-being.” 
The letter also urges the Trudeau government to reject the flawed “compromise” proposal that the EU has placed at the centre of upcoming WTO negotiations.

Rainbow Railroad is a global not-for-profit organization that supports LGTBQI+ people facing persecution based on their sexual orientation, gender identity and sex characteristics.  Since their founding, the organization has helped over 3,100 LGBTQI+ individuals find safety through emergency relocation and other forms of assistance. 
LGBTQI+ individuals immediately face vulnerabilities in the wake of conflicts and consistently fall through the gaps in conflict responses. In Afghanistan, the situation for LGBTQI+ individuals is life threatening, and has dramatically worsened after the Taliban offensive in August 2021. Reports have emerged of the precarity under which LGBTQI+ people are now living in the nation, with many afraid to reveal their sexual orientation to anyone, fearing being found by the Taliban. Significantly, while the Taliban has made verbal overtures (and albeit failed promises) to protect women’s rights, they have made zero mention of protecting the rights of LGBTQI+ people. Afghanistan’s Ministry of Women’s Affairs was also shut down, increasing the state of precarity for queer women who have lost nearly all of their protections, especially from gendered violence. 
LGBTQI+ Afghans have experienced the additional barrier of the world’s response to one crisis over another, especially as global attention shifted after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. As humanitarian measures prioritized the safe evacuation of Ukrainian nationals, queer Afghans who had, months earlier, fled to Ukraine from Afghanistan, were excluded from receiving immediate support. “There are refugees in Ukraine who are mostly people of colour who did not have the same access to resettlement,” said Powell in an article for The Globe & Mail this April. “Do they not have the right to refuge?” 
Over 70 countries worldwide still criminalize same-sex intimacy. In 11 of them, LGBTQI+ people can be put to death. They are uniquely vulnerable due to systemic, state-enabled homophobia and transphobia, and those factors can either displace them in their own country or prevent them from escaping harm. 
Afghanistan is one of these places, and when the Taliban captured Kabul on August 15, 2021, the situation rapidly deteriorated. Since then, over 3,300 LGBTQI+ Afghans have reached out to Rainbow Railroad for help. 
Amina is a young, lesbian human rights defender. Despite facing bullying and discrimination throughout her teenage years, Amina was committed to helping other LGBTQI+ people find support and safety both as she went through university and beyond. When Afghanistan fell to the Taliban, Amina and people like her faced persecution, violence, and extreme danger. Amina tells a story of her and her friends being called devils, threatened with murder, and being forced to run and hide – changing addresses, and covertly travelling from safehouse to safehouse on an almost daily basis. The LGBTQI+ activist networks she was a part of completely disappeared. With Rainbow Railroad’s support, Amina managed to escape – but for so many others, this is not the case. 
LGBTQI+ Afghans simply do not have the luxury of waiting out timely refugee and asylum application processes. Some have fled to neighbouring countries that also criminalize same-sex intimacy, and their lives remain at risk. 
Right now, Rainbow Railroad is in contact with 300 LGBTQI+ Afghans who are ready for imminent travel and resettlement in a safer country. But they’re stuck, and urgently waiting to secure a way out. 
This January, in collaboration with Outright Action International and Human Rights Watch, we released the report, ‘LGBTI People in Afghanistan After the Taliban Takeover‘, describing the violence and persecution LGBTQI+ Afghans have faced, including beatings, surveillance, having their identification documents burned, having their families threatened with violence, and being imprisoned for their identities. I have personally been to the region twice and witnessed firsthand the state of trauma of those who managed to flee. LGBTQI+ Afghans simply do not have the luxury of waiting out timely refugee and asylum application processes. Some have fled to neighbouring countries that also criminalize same-sex intimacy, and their lives remain at risk. 
In precarious situations like this, civil society organizations have the expertise and knowledge that many governments lack, and such organizations need to be empowered to deliver on their capabilities. 
In precarious situations like this, civil society organizations have the expertise and knowledge that many governments lack, and such organizations need to be empowered to deliver on their capabilities. Rainbow Railroad operates through global partnership networks that provide ongoing monitoring in crisis-prone environments and create pathways to safety when they occur. Presently, we are monitoring anti-LGBTQI+ persecution in many countries — from LGBTQI+ persons in Ukraine to human rights defenders who are being actively targeted in Chad. 
This year, Rainbow Railroad will receive 10,000 requests for help from LGBTQI+ people all over the world, and the only way to reach them is through government action and partnership. As a Canadian organization, we strongly believe there is an opportunity to partner directly with the Canadian government to provide more international pathways to safety. 
To reach the most vulnerable populations in Afghanistan, including women leaders, human rights defenders, journalists, persecuted religious minorities, family members of previously resettled interpreters, and LGBTQI+ persons, the Canadian Government is hoping to rely on Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) slots. But this is a long, slow process, and waiting for this option can be a literal death sentence for people hiding in countries where their very existence is a crime. Luckily, there is another option, and Government Assisted Refugee (GAR) spots can meet the time-sensitive needs of those most critically impacted by this crisis. 
In May, Rainbow Railroad launched a petition calling on the Canadian government to work with us to urgently evacuate and resettle 300 LGBTQI+ Afghans. We are asking for the public’s support in this effort; Rainbow Railroad stands ready to partner with the Canadian Government to identify, triage, verify, and assist as many LGBTQI+ Afghan refugees as possible. 
This Pride Month, I ask you to help us provide LGBTQI+ Afghans with a safe way out. Sign the petition at SafeWayOut.ca.

The building of a sustainable, resilient, and equitable future must include human rights, especially those of millions of people whose rights have been violated, and of historically marginalised communities and population groups, Amnesty International said today in an open letter to the heads of state present at the Ninth Summit of the Americas being held in Los Angeles this week. 
“Rather than fighting for a fair recovery from the pandemic in the most unequal continent in the world, many states in the Americas have taken the opposite route, repressing peaceful demonstrations, intimidating human rights defenders and journalists, and jeopardising judicial independence, in a crude attempt to silence dissenting voices,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The Americas remains home to some of the largest cross-border movements of people in the world. With the US government’s initiative to seek a “Migration Pact” for the region during the Summit, Amnesty International wishes to highlight that most of these movements of people are the result of the multiple human rights crises in countries such as Venezuela, Haiti, Nicaragua and Cuba, or the situation of widespread violence, compounded by natural disasters associated with climate change, in Central America. 
The organisation regrets that, in the face of the urgent need for protection, the authorities of several states are responding with restrictive and often inhumane policies, militarising their borders, detaining migrants and refugees in precarious conditions, and carrying out forced returns without due consideration of their asylum applications or the impossibility of return. 
“For millions of people in the Americas, seeking international protection is the only way that they can obtain minimum conditions of dignity and access to fundamental rights such as health, food and safety,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“If the heads of state in the region reach an agreement on a migration pact, it must be a collaborative tool focused on guaranteeing human rights and able to provide effective and long-lasting solutions. States must adopt coordinated measures to protect migrants and refugees in the Americas, taking into account differentiated approaches for specific focus on at-risk groups such as unaccompanied migrant children, women and LGBTI people, among others.”

Under the current state of emergency, the Salvadoran authorities have committed massive human rights violations, including thousands of arbitrary detentions and violations of due process, as well as torture and ill-treatment, and at least 18 people have died in state custody, Amnesty International said today, following its research into the crisis in the country. President Bukele’s government declared a state of emergency on 27 March, following a spike in homicides allegedly committed by gangs, which has since been extended twice. 
“Three years ago we met with President Nayib Bukele and he pledged to respect human rights. Since then, however, he has repeatedly failed to keep his word”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“On the pretext of punishing gangs, the Salvadoran authorities are committing widespread and flagrant violations of human rights and criminalizing people living in poverty. Instead of offering an effective response to the dramatic violence caused by gangs and the historic public security challenges facing the country, they are subjecting the Salvadoran people to a tragedy. Victims of gang violence urgently deserve justice, but this can only be achieved through robust investigations and fair trials that ensure due process and effective sentencing.” 
Over the past few weeks, an Amnesty International crisis response team has meticulously documented 28 cases of human rights violations involving 34 people, interviewing victims and their families, human rights organizations, journalists, people currently or formerly involved in the administration of justice, and community leaders. In addition, the organization requested meetings with various authorities, including President Nayib Bukele. 
Arbitrary detention, unlawful deprivation of liberty and judicial guarantees 
The state of emergency, recent amendments to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure and their implementation in this context by the Specialized Courts, the Attorney General’s Office and the Prosecutor’s Office, among others, have undermined the rights to defence, the presumption of innocence, effective judicial remedy and access to an independent judge. International human rights law, which is binding on the Salvadoran authorities, does not allow these rights to be restricted, even under a state of emergency. 
Amnesty International found that thousands of people are being detained without the legal requirements being met – there was no administrative or judicial arrest warrant and the person was not apprehended in flagrante delicto – purely because the authorities view them as having been identified as criminals in the stigmatizing speeches of President Bukele’s government, because they have tattoos, are accused by a third party of having alleged links to a gang, are related to someone who belongs to a gang, have a previous criminal record of some kind, or simply because they live in an area under gang control, which are precisely the areas with high levels of marginalization and that have historically been abandoned by the state. 
After arrest, people are deprived of their liberty and at their court hearings most are charged with membership of “illegal groups”, a crime that carries a penalty of 20 to 30 years’ imprisonment. During detention, and before being brought before a judge (which usually happens after 15 days’ detention, following the suspension, as part of the state of emergency, of the constitutional maximum period of 72 hours of “administrative detention”), the detainee does not usually have contact with their legal representative, not even just prior to the hearing, or, if they do, it is only for a few minutes. Moreover, a minority of people have been able to access private defenders and they do not have access to the case file and do not know what information the Prosecutor’s Office has submitted. These hearings can see up to 500 people charged at a time and they are summarily resolved. Virtually all the accused are subject to prosecution by the judiciary, even in the absence of any evidence. 
In virtually all the cases documented by Amnesty International, people stated that there were times when they did not know where their relatives were being held. In at least one case, they still do not know, which could constitute enforced disappearance. This has led dozens of people to file appeals before the Constitutional Chamber for the person to appear before a court (habeas corpus). However, to date, human rights organizations have reported that there has been no progress in these proceedings. 
In one case, the police arrested a woman, who was a single parent and works as a food vendor, in her home at the beginning of April, without an arrest or search warrant, for allegedly being a gang member. At the court hearing, which dealt with more than 500 people at the same time, a Specialized Court imposed a pre-trial detention order on her for the crime of membership of an illegal group, despite the fact that, according to her family, there was no evidence of this. Years ago, police had arrested the vendor on the same charge and beat her severely in detention. In addition to their being unable to prove the charges, she was awarded financial reparation after she reported the police officers for abuse of authority. Since then, she and her children have been forcibly displaced as a result of constant threats from the police. The vendor and her family had returned to their home a few months before her arrest in April. 
Her daughter reported that, the next day, local police returned to the house and put a gun to her head, threatening that she would be next. In May, the young woman was arrested by the same police officers who had arrested her mother and threatened her. Amnesty International documented two other cases in which arrests were preceded by situations in which victims had reported police abuse to the authorities in previous years. 
“It’s alarming to see how the three branches of the state, including judicial institutions, are operating in an extremely coordinated manner to prosecute thousands of people in a summary, illegal and indiscriminate manner. The political use of the bodies created to guarantee justice undermines the rule of law and is facilitating the commission of serious human rights violations and even crimes under international law”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“The arrest and criminal prosecution without due process of more than 35,000 people in less than three months would not have been possible if the judicial authorities had fulfilled their mandate. Instead, they are acting as accomplices to a public security policy ordered at the highest level that tramples on inalienable human rights, accepting as a necessary evil the widespread and unjust prosecution and imprisonment of people living in poverty.” 
Right to life and physical integrity 
Amnesty International has documented cases of torture and ill-treatment inside detention centres. The statements collected reveal the level of control that gang members exert inside cells and the extreme overcrowding, which result in violations of the right to life and physical integrity, and in insanitary conditions, food shortages and lack of basic hygiene, seriously affecting the health of detainees. By the end of May, local media reported that, due to the increase in arrests, 1.7% of the country’s population over the age of 18 was in detention, resulting in overcrowding of over 250% of the prison capacity. 
In one case, a 16-year-old adolescent was arrested on 29 April by members of the police and armed forces and detained for 13 days, accused of membership of an illegal group. During the first night he was chained to the wall in a police detention centre for adults and he said he was beaten by police officers. He was later transferred to a youth detention facility, where members of a gang with whom he shared a cell repeatedly tortured him, punching him in the head and face, kicking him in the chest, abdomen and legs and constantly threatening him. He said they also threw a bag full of urine at his head. He said that officials at the facility knew about and tolerated these acts of torture and ill-treatment. 
As of 28 May, at least 18 people were reported to have died in state custody during the state of emergency. Given the precarious prison conditions, there is a well-founded fear that the number of fatalities could increase in the coming days. 
Amnesty International documented the death of William Alexander Galeas Gonzales, aged 36, who was detained on 13 April along with his mother and sister for alleged links to gangs. On 12 May, a funeral home visited the family to inform them of William’s death; the family had been unable to communicate with him since his detention. To date, no authority has notified them of the death or contacted them. According to a document from the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the forensic report points to pulmonary oedema as a preliminary cause of death. The family reported that when they checked the body they observed multiple bruises. 
“These deaths in state custody are the ultimate expression of the cruelty of a policy implemented with the ostensible justification of reducing violence in the country at any cost. The Salvadoran authorities must investigate all arbitrary deaths immediately and not allow a single one more”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Rights of children and adolescents 
According to data from the Salvadoran Institute for the Comprehensive Development of Children and Adolescents, between 27 March and 17 May at least 1,190 people under the age of 18 were detained and held in youth detention facilities. Most were charged with membership of illegal groups or terrorist organizations. 
Amnesty International documented the case of two cousins, aged 14 and 15, who were both detained on 26 April while they were playing outside their home in Ilopango. Their families reported that police officers accused them of “looking like criminals” (“cara de malandros”) without giving any further justification for their detention; they also told the mothers that their children would spend 30 years in detention. Since then, their mothers have been unable to communicate with them and have little information about the criminal proceedings they face. They say the assigned public defender gave them very little information and barely argued on behalf of their children during the hearing. 
Journalists, human rights defenders and judicial officials 
Amnesty International spoke with five Salvadoran journalists, three of whom had had to move house or leave the country because of harassment by the state or third parties. Two reported having reliable information about possible criminal investigations against them as a form of retaliation. In the context of the state of emergency, not only have changes to the law been approved that put people who report on the phenomenon of gangs at risk of criminalization and potential sentences of up to 15 years in prison, but, public officials and the official media have also publicly accused journalists and researchers of having links with gangs, without evidence, in an attempt to stigmatize and deter them from carrying out their work as journalists. 
On 11 April, President Bukele tweeted that Juan Martínez, a researcher and anthropologist specializing in issues of violence and gangs, was “trash“, following an interview in which he expressed his views on the phenomenon of gangs in the country. Juan Martinez told Amnesty International that the authorities are trying to silence and exile journalism, as well as discrediting recent pieces of investigative journalism that point to the existence of secret negotiations between the government and the gangs. Hours after President Bukele publicly denigrated Juan Martínez, the Director of the Prison Service accused journalists at the newspaper El Faro of being terrorists, spokesmen for the gangs, and mercenaries. 
Similarly, public officials at the highest level have publicly accused human rights organizations of supporting gang-generated crime. In addition, the Salvadoran Network of Human Rights Defenders recorded the arrest of six community leaders from the municipality of Jiquilisco in Usulután in the context of the state of emergency. The authorities had put them under house arrest, without giving any reasons for their detention, and they had subsequently been accused of having links with gangs. 
In another case, Amnesty International documented the detention of four trade unionists, including Dolores Almendares, who works in the Cuscatancingo Town Hall and is General Secretary of the SETRAMUC union, who was arrested on 6 May while on sick leave with an arm injury. She was charged and placed in pre-trial detention, accused of membership of an illegal group, but her family and union colleagues believe that the detention may be connected with her defence of workers’ rights. 
In addition, Amnesty International spoke with two former judicial officials and a sitting judge who detailed the attacks on judicial independence experienced by those involved in the administration of justice, including reprimands and appeals from high-level judicial officials demanding that they do not acquit those accused under the state of emergency and that they impose pre-trial detention as a general rule. 
“The magnitude of the human rights violations demands a strong and immediate response from the international community. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and UN protection mechanisms must be given access to the country, and in particular to detention centres and judicial hearings, so that they can verify the general situation in relation to respect for human rights”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“We call on President Bukele’s government to immediately reverse the recent measures that violate human rights and to establish a dialogue with national and international civil society organizations and international human rights protection mechanisms in order to establish a public security policy that is effective and respects human rights.”

JusticeTrans provides free legal information and education about Two Spirit, non-binary, and transgender rights across Canada, challenges transphobic policies, and advocates for community-based transformative social justice. 
*Featured in this post’s header, the Progress Pride flag was developed in 2018 by non-binary American artist and designer Daniel Quasar. The flag includes black and brown stripes to represent marginalized LGBTQ2S communities of colour, along with the colours pink, light blue and white, which are used on the Transgender Pride Flag. Bridget Tolley, from Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg First Nation in Quebec, beaded the eagle earrings featured at the bottom of the header’s graphic. She runs Families of Sisters in Spirit, a volunteer-run, grassroots initiative supporting the loved ones of missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two Spirit people across Canada. 
June is both Indigenous History Month and Pride Month; two deeply personal aspects of my life. As a Two-Spirit (2S) mixed Inuk, this month is of particular importance to me. At any time of year these elements of my identity influence every aspect of my life, but this month they are highlighted. The ways in which they are rooted in difference, but also the ways in which they intersect; how they collide, meld, and dance with each other. How they invite me to walk between worlds; to code switch; to evaluate safety through different lenses, perspectives, and experiences; and how they help me empathize with others’ experiences. It was these experiences that led me to create JusticeTrans. 
Access to justice for the 2S, Trans, Non-Binary and Gender Non-Conforming (2STNBGN) communities in so-called Canada is deeply important, and JusticeTrans’ first major project was creating a website and mobile phone application that collated legal information in one place. The designs were user-friendly and helped to increase access to justice for 2STNBGN communities. JusticeTrans was the first national 2STNBGN-specific organization to do this, and remains the only one to do so at the national level. 
Since then, JusticeTrans has expanded immensely, most recently having conducted a Canada-wide study on 2STNBGN access to justice experiences, specifically from those who have shared identities on the basis of race, Indigeneity, disability, migrant or refugee status, or precarious employment. Legal education is one of the most pressing needs for these communities, and JusticeTrans provides Canada-wide rights-based information and shares legal resources on issues such as arrest/detention, citizenship, and family law, which are areas that can be difficult for 2STNBGN individuals to navigate on their own, and even more so with other intersectional identities at play. 
Other primary concerns identified by the 2STNBGN community includes targeted harassment and discrimination, whether based on their 2STNBGN identity or within the context of another cultural identity. This added distinction in targeted harassment reflects another area where the focus on intersectionality becomes so important. If we are not operating from an intersectional lens, then who are we serving? The importance of including Black, Indigenous, racialized, people with disabilities, and other historically and presently excluded voices in our conversations and research cannot be overstated. The root of what is highlights is the need for representation and equity practices in all areas. 
For JusticeTrans, this is responsibly considered across the range of legal resources/education provided including whether they are even reasonably accessible to community members, especially those with multiple intersections within their identity. For example, from a geographical perspective, would a person living in a rural or Northern area have the same access to justice as a person living in an urban area? From a socio-political lens, if this personal was visibly 2STNBGN and Black, Indigenous, or racialized, would they have the same access to justice in either location as someone who is white and cis-passing? These questions are multi-faceted, and the answers about who has greater access to justice are rooted in Canada’s colonial history and present-day narratives about who and what is accepted within our social, political, and legal structures.  
When we consider access to justice outside of the Western legal systems, I think about healing circles, transformative justice, abolitionist frameworks, and community care. I think about traditional teachings, reclamation of culture and language, and the freedom to safely exist in the world. 
In addition to legal education, JusticeTrans undertakes advocacy work at the federal level. JusticeTrans has advocated for the inclusion of gender identity and gender expression under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which was included in 2017. It has worked alongside other organizations to support the passage of Bill C-6, which seeks to ban conversion therapy practices; legislation in support of the Bill was introduced in November 2021. JusticeTrans also partnered with numerous organizations to host national debates on 2SLGBTQ+ issues for the 2021 federal election and helped draft an open letter detailing key priorities for our communities. 
While this work is important, it is equally important to consider what is meant by access to justice; how is it being defined? Access to justice does not only apply to the Western legal system; it means beyond the Western legal system as well. Justice spans also to healthcare, housing, personal safety, food security, and community (non-inclusive). When we consider access to justice outside of the Western legal systems, I think about healing circles, transformative justice, abolitionist frameworks, and community care. I think about traditional teachings, reclamation of culture and language, and the freedom to safely exist in the world. 
What does this look like in practice? Transformative justice seeks to respond to violence without engaging in or creating more violence; there is also room within this system for harm reduction, in which case it seeks to lessen violence. In practice, this might be a safe injection site or having a team of healthcare workers respond to a mental health crisis/wellness check, rather than involving the police or other law enforcement. These are also intertwined with community care. Community care is any care provided by a person for the benefit of others within the community. It removes the onus off the individual to be self-reliant and solely independent and emphasizes our interconnectedness. It can look like a neighbour picking up your groceries, participating in a protest, or other acts of interpersonal kindness and compassion.  
These questions are multi-faceted, and the answers about who has greater access to justice are rooted in Canada’s colonial history and present-day narratives about who and what is accepted within our social, political, and legal structures.  
As someone walking between multiple worlds, I am acutely aware of the dangers of making use of Western legal structures. For example, the RCMP were founded to “bring law and order” to the West, to enforce the Indian Act, to forcibly remove Indigenous children from their homes and communities and place them in Residential schools. Residential schools were designed to “kill the Indian in the child,” and strip away from them their language and culture, including the recognition and existence of 2S community members. It was and is an ongoing act of genocide against Indigenous Peoples. It is a clear example of how multiple and intersecting identities were stripped from individuals and communities, in favour of what colonial settlers deemed “normal” and “acceptable.” This approach continues today, contributing to intergenerational trauma; this is one of many reasons why alternatives to the Western legal system are necessary when considering access to justice and ensuring freedoms for 2STNBGN people.  
Benjamin Vandorpe is the Founder of JusticeTrans. They currently work for Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and live on the unceded, unsurrendered territory of the Anishnaabe Algonquin People.

Organized by AI Canada Gender Rights team in partnership with the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) 
The Faceless Dolls Project was initiated by the Native Women’s Association of Canada (NWAC) in the spring of 2012 and builds upon Gloria Larocque’s Angel Doll project. The purpose of this project is to generate greater recognition of the pervasive issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls within Canada through art. The dolls are a visual representation of the 582 known cases of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls and have been used as part of a travelling exhibit launched in Ottawa in 2013. Each doll represents an Indigenous woman who has become a ‘faceless’ victim of a heinous crime. 
This project is being re-introduced in collaboration with NWAC and has been adapted to be suitable to conduct online. While the dolls were originally constructed physically using felt, we are mindful that given the current circumstances it is necessary to provide alternative options to engage in this campaign virtually. As such, Amnesty International Canada volunteers have prepared resources to enable us to collectively commemorate and honor missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls regardless of where we are situated.  
Two templates have been provided which offer the option to either colour in online or assemble with additional material. The completed dolls will be submitted here. We will then collect the dolls and create a virtual tapestry.

Hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were killed when troops opened fire on the students and workers who for weeks had been peacefully calling for political reforms. 
No one knows the exact number who died that day. The official Chinese government report claimed that some 200 died, including dozens of soldiers, and over 3000 were wounded – figures that are widely believed to be far too low. 
Immediately after the military crackdown, the authorities began to hunt down those involved in the demonstrations. Thousands were detained, tortured, or imprisoned after unfair trials. Some were executed. 
China has never publicly acknowledged the human rights violations which occurred in the Tiananmen crackdown, conducted any investigation, or provided any compensation to the victims and their families. 
Instead, for over three decades, the Chinese authorities have done all they can to stop people from asking questions about that day or even talking about it. 
Starting in 1990, every year on June 4, the biggest candlelight vigils in the world were held in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park – sometimes involving hundreds of thousands of people. 
The vigils were banned in 2020 when the National Security Law came into force. Now organizers such as Chow Hang-tung are facing prosecution. 
Human rights lawyer and labour rights advocate Chow Hang-tung was charged for “inciting subversion” under the new National Security Law on September 9, 2021. She faces a potential 10 year sentence. At the time of being charged, she was the vice-chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (the Alliance), the organizer of the annual Hong Kong vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown since 1990. Chow Hang-tung was exercising her fundamental human right of freedom of expression through peaceful means. 
China is erasing the memory of Tiananmen Square through systematic censorship and criminalization of commemoration activities.  It’s up to the global community to keep that memory alive. 
The simple act of lighting a candle for Tiananmen has become a crime in Hong Kong, just as it has been in mainland China for more than 30 years.  
Hongkongers once stood in solidarity with the victims of Tiananmen. The rest of the world now stands with the people of Hong Kong to the deliver the same message: repression will not be tolerated anywhere.  
Light a candle with Amnesty. On Saturday June 4th, please join a special commemoration on social media to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.

“The time has come for the OHCHR to publicly acknowledge the scale and gravity of human rights violations being committed by the Chinese government. The High Commissioner should release the long-awaited report on Xinjiang and present the findings at the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Council in June.  
“Failure to release a report that sufficiently addresses crimes against humanity in the region would amount to a betrayal of the victims and their families. This continued lack of urgency puts the credibility of the High Commissioner’s Office at stake.  
“The High Commissioner’s visit has been characterized by photo opportunities with senior government officials and manipulation of her statements by Chinese state media, leaving an impression that she has walked straight into a highly predictable propaganda exercise for the Chinese government.  
The High Commissioner’s visit has been characterized by photo opportunities with senior government officials and manipulation of her statements by Chinese state media, leaving an impression that she has walked straight into a highly predictable propaganda exercise for the Chinese government.  
“The High Commissioner instead should condemn the ongoing gross human rights violations and seek accountability, truth and justice.  
“Bachelet acknowledged that she received appeals from Uyghurs abroad regarding their missing family members believed to be detained and said she raised them with the Chinese authorities. Her office must follow up on these cases and insist that authorities guarantee detainees rights and means to maintain regular contact with family members, including those living overseas.    
“Given the various restraints imposed, including COVID-19 restrictions, Bachelet has rightly acknowledged that this visit was not an ‘investigation’.  But she should push for it to be a springboard to more meaningful actions and investigations by independent human rights experts in the near future.  
“While Bachelet said a working group on human rights, including on business and human rights, counter-terrorism and human rights, and rights of minorities will be established between the UN and Chinese authorities, no clear goals and timeline have been shared. These cannot be a substitute for urgently establishing an independent international mechanism to investigate crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations in Xinjiang, with a view to ensuring accountability, including through the identification of suspected perpetrators.   
“The High Commissioner must call on the Chinese government to immediately dismantle all remaining internment camps, release the people arbitrarily detained in them and in prisons, and end the systematic attacks against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.   
Background  
A team led by High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet spent six days in China including two days in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, where Amnesty International has documented systematic arbitrary detention, torture and persecution of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.  
On Saturday, 28 May, the High Commissioner held a virtual press conference in Guangzhou where she spoke about her mission to China. She met with government officials, the business community and members of civil society. In regard to Xinjiang, she spoke about how counter-terrorism measures should not result in human rights violations and need to be subjected to independent oversight. She also mentioned linguistics, religious, cultural and education rights in Tibet and other human rights issues.   
During Bachelet’s visit to China, national state media quoted her as saying she “admired China’s efforts in… protecting human rights”. The OHCHR later issued a clarification of Bachelet’s words, which did not praise China’s human rights record.   
Since September 2018, when the High Commissioner first sought access to Xinjiang “in light of deeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities”, numerous organizations have published further detailed and well-corroborated information on the situation. In June 2021, Amnesty International launched a comprehensive report documenting how China’s crackdown against predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounted to serious human rights violations, including crimes against humanity.  
Based on dozens of testimonies, the report described a “dystopian hellscape” encompassing grave violations against detainees, systematic state surveillance of millions of people, and efforts to root out the religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages of the region’s Muslim ethnic groups.  
Amnesty International launched an international campaign, initially focusing on more than 70 individuals, calling for the release of all people arbitrarily detained in camps and prisons, and for the closure of the internment camps. Just this month Amnesty has collected details of a further 40 missing or detained individuals as news of Bachelet’s visit prompted more families to come forward seeking justice for relatives in Xinjiang who have disappeared and are believed to be detained.  
The OHCHR has already compiled its own report on human rights violations in Xinjiang, which Bachelet said was being “finalised” last year. It has not yet been made public, despite repeated requests from almost 200 NGOs, including Amnesty International.

Since their arrest in 2015, the Huthi de facto authorities have detained the journalists, holding them without charge or trial for over four years and subjecting them to various human rights abuses, including enforced disappearance, intermittent incommunicado detention and solitary confinement, beatings, and denial of access to medical care. Amnesty International calls on the Huthi de facto authorities to quash the death sentences – issued following a grossly unfair trial – and order the immediate release of the four journalists.  
The de facto Huthi forces raided Qasr al-Ahlam hotel in Sana’a on 9 June 2015 and arrested the four journalists. They were detained without charge or trial until December 2018 when they were charged with a series of offences, including “spying for Saudi Arabia”, which carries the death penalty, as well as “creating several websites on the internet and on social media”; and “broadcasting rumours, fake news and statements in support of the enemy Saudi Arabia and its allies against the Republic of Yemen.” On 11 April 2020, they were sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court in Sana’a following a grossly unfair trial in which their lawyer was barred from attending nearly all court sessions, and without informing their lawyers and families of the death sentence.  
In October 2020, the four journalists were transferred to the Exchange House prison, in the Central Security Camp in Sana’a, expecting to be released as part of a prisoner exchange deal. Despite the Prosecutor General’s order, dated 30 October 2020, to release them, they continue to be detained and denied visits from their families and lawyers. According to his family, the authorities have barred them from bringing Tawfiq Al-Mansouri any medication despite pressing health concerns, and since 2020 he has been denied transfer to a hospital for treatment. Denial of medical treatment to the seriously ill is considered an act of cruelty amounting to torture and other ill-treatment under international law.

Additional information  
The four journalists, Akram al-Walidi, Abdelkhaleq Amran, Hareth Hamid, and Tawfiq al-Mansouri, were detained among a group of 10 journalists in 2015. Huthi forces raided Qasr al-Ahlam hotel in Sana’a on 9 June 2015 and arrested the four journalists among a group of nine, along with Hasan Anab, Haytham al-Shihab, Hisham al-Yousefi, and Essam Balgheeth. According to an eyewitness, on 28 August 2015 the 10th journalist, Salah al-Qaedi was arrested at his home. The remaining six journalists have since been released.  
During their detention, the four journalists have been subjected to a range of grave human rights abuses as well as violations of their right to a fair trial. Since 2015, they were arbitrarily detained for over four years without charge or trial, subjected to forcible disappearances, intermittent incommunicado detention and solitary confinement, beatings, and denied visits from their families and lawyers. Despite suffering from serious illnesses, the journalists continue to be denied access to medical treatment. Moreover, it is Amnesty International’s understanding that they are additionally being subjected to severe beatings and other harsh treatment, as well as denied access to medical treatment despite urgent health-related concerns.  
All parties to the conflict in Yemen, including the Huthi forces, the Yemeni government, the Saudi-led coalition, and UAE-backed Yemeni forces have carried out serious human rights violations and abuses, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, harassment, torture and other ill-treatment, and unfair trials.  
In areas under Huthi control, journalists, human rights defenders, and members of the Baha’i community have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, as well as incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance. Amnesty International published a report in May 2021 titled ‘Yemen: Released and exiled: Torture, unfair trials and forcible exiles of Yemenis under Huthi rule’ which investigates human rights violations committed by Huthi forces and documents the lived experiences of civilians released as part of political deals in 2020. Detainees in Huthi prisons are subjected to brutal and inhumane conditions inside Huthi prisons and face severe overcrowding, insufficient food and clean drinking water, and poor sanitation.  
According to Reporters Without Borders, 14 journalists are currently detained in Yemen on the basis of their work, and two journalists have been killed in 2022.  
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.

On 11 July 2021, thousands of people took to the streets in Cuba to demonstrate peacefully, in an exercise of their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly and to express their discontent about the economic situation in the country. In response to the protests, authorities, under the leadership of President Miguel Díaz-Canel, scaled-up a decades-long policy of repression that criminalizes peaceful protest and imprisons ordinary Cubans for expressing their views.   
Hundreds of human rights activists, artists and ordinary Cubans have been detained, and criminalized for participating in the nation-wide protest. Some remain imprisoned, and are yet to receive a trial, and many others have faced unfair trials, that have been characterized by violations of due process, and charges for crimes such as: “contempt,” “public disorder,” and “resistance”, all crimes inconsistent with international human rights standards.  
Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara is an artist and member of the San Isidro Movement. Amnesty International had declared him a prisoner of conscience on three previous occasions. On 11 July 2021, he was detained by two state security agents in Havana, shortly after posting a video in which he declared his intention to join the protests.  
Maykel Castillo Pérez, more commonly known by his artistic name: “Maykel Osorbo,” is a Cuban musician and member of the San Isidro Movement. He is also one of the co-authors of the son “Patria y Vida”, that has become a protest anthem for its critical view of the Cuban government. The musician has been subjected to constant harassment by authorities and has been arbitrarily detained on many occasions. On 18 May 2021, state security agents detained the musician at his home, and for the 10 days following his arrest, refused to provide information on his whereabouts to family and loved ones.   
On 19 August 2021, Amnesty International named Otero Alcántara and Castillo Pérez prisoners of conscience, along with other Cubans detained in the context of the protests of 11 July 2021. On 24 March 2022, the organization issued a press release calling authorities to allow it and other human rights observers access to the country to monitor the trials. On 26 May 2022, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued a joint statement calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Otero Alcántara and Castillo Pérez, ahead of the start of their trials.   
Cuba remains the only country in the Americas that does not permit Amnesty International to visit to carry out human rights monitoring work.

The Specialized Criminal Court sentenced them to death in October 2021 following a grossly unfair trial for terrorism-related charges, which include smuggling explosive materials into Saudi Arabia and participating in anti-government protests in Bahrain. In April 2022, the Supreme Court upheld their sentences, rendering their execution imminent as soon as the King ratifies it. Amnesty International calls on the Saudi authorities not to ratify the death sentence, quash their conviction and re-try them in line with international fair trial standards.  
The two men were convicted of a range of offences including: “Joining a terrorist entity … which aims to cause chaos and shake the security of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain”; “Participating in protests in Bahrain”; and smuggling bags of explosives to Saudi Arabia “with the aim of breaching Saudi Arabia’s security”. The Specialized Criminal Court sentenced both men to death in October 2021 after a prolonged and unfair trial which had begun in January 2019. The Appeals Court upheld their sentences in January 2022. The Supreme Court uphold their death sentences, despite the defendants’ claims before the court that they had been subjected to severe beatings during their interrogations.  
Both men were detained incommunicado and in solitary confinement for three-and-a-half months following their arrest on 8 May 2015. They were only allowed to call their families 115 days later, during which time prison officials did not allow them to discuss their detention or interrogation conditions. Their families were allowed their first visit in October 2015. Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadeq Majeed Thamer had no access to legal representation throughout their pre-trial detention and interrogation. According to court documents, they told the court that they were tortured and that their so-called confessions were extracted under duress. Jaafar Mohammad Sultan also told the court that he was beaten with cables and threatened that he would not see his family until he signed the “confession” as formulated by the investigator. According to the court document detailing his defense, he was subsequently transferred to the prison hospital for 10 days due to the torture he endured.

Additional information  
In the absence of transparent information around judicial processes in Saudi Arabia, particularly in death penalty cases, families only find out about the fate of their loved ones through the media. Amnesty International’s assessment of the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the death sentences of Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadeq Majed Thamer indicates that is evident of the men’s imminent risk of execution since families are not informed when the King ratifies death sentences.  
On 13 March 2022, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior announced the execution of 81 people, a shocking mass execution spree of people who had been convicted of a wide range of offences, including “terrorism”- related crimes, murder, armed robbery and arms smuggling. A number of those executed were also convicted of offences such as “disrupting the social fabric and national cohesion” and “participating in and inciting sit-ins and protests” which describe acts that are protected by the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 41 of those executed were from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority.  
Amnesty International has documented the pattern of repression targeting the Shi’a community in Saudi Arabia, namely through the Specialized Criminal Court that has issued harsh prison and death sentences following grossly unfair trials, marred by allegations of torture during detention which the prosecution has failed systematically to investigate.  
In early 2021, the Saudi Arabian authorities announced changes in relation to the death penalty, including a moratorium on executions for drug-related crimes, which are death sentences handed down at the judge’s discretion rather than mandated under Sharia law. While this moratorium appears to have been implemented, it has yet to be formalized and remains unofficial as long as existing narcotics laws carry the death penalty and individuals previously sentenced to death for drug-related crimes remain on death row. Moreover, courts continued to impose death sentences and individuals are executed for other crimes where judges can issue a death sentence at their discretion. Jaafar Mohammad Sultan and Sadiq Majeed Thamer were both sentenced to death in a discretionary sentence.  
The death penalty is a cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of who is accused, the crime, their guilt or innocence or the method of execution.

Carlos Debiais was filming in Falcón state when he was questioned by security personnel of the state-owned oil company PDVSA and later detained by officers of the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM). His fate and whereabouts were unknown on several occasions during his detention. Prison authorities reportedly claim the release warrant cannot be executed on orders of the Minister for Penitentiary Affairs. We call for his release.  
Reports indicate that penitentiary authorities refuse to execute said release warrant on orders of the Minister for Penitentiary Affairs, despite being known that a court order cannot be ignored or blocked by the Executive branch.  
Moreover, Carlos Debiais has been held in appalling conditions with no access to natural sunlight, limited and insufficient food, and monitored communications with his family and lawyers, all of which violate international human rights standards.

Additional information  
Carlos Debiais is a Venezuelan photographer based in Bogota. He returned to Venezuela temporarily to renew his passport, arriving in his home state of Falcón on 8 November 2021. On 12 November, whilst filming using his drone in Amuay Bay, next to the Amuay oil refinery managed by the state-owned oil company PDVSA, he was questioned by security personnel of PDVSA, later joined by officials of the National Guard. Shortly afterwards, officials of the Directorate General for Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) showed up and searched his car and belongings, finding his filming equipment, including a drone, as well as American dollars and some marihuana for personal use. At that point, he was taken to DCGIM offices within the Amuay refinery where he was further questioned.  
Carlos Debiais’ fate and whereabouts where unknown from 12-15 November, when it was made known to his family that he was in the DGCIM headquarters in Boleíta Norte, Caracas, roughly 558km from where he was detained. On that day, he was taken before the Court on Terrorism and accused of ‘terrorism’, association to commit crimes, violation of the regime of the nation, and drug use. The prosecution did not submit any evidence in the 45-day period allowed by law to do so, nor in the 15-day extension. During the preliminary hearing held on 10 February 2022, three months after his detention, he was formally charged with violation of the regime of the nation and drug use. Despite only finding images of the Bay, and none of the refinery or other criminal content, Carlos was found guilty and sentenced to 4.5 years, being allowed to serve the sentence on parole and registering before the court every two months.   
In the meantime, according to his family, Carlos’ fate and whereabouts were once again unknown from 15 November-5 December, at which point he was allowed a phone call to his family. Again, from 5-15 December, he was not allowed any contact with his family or lawyers. On 23 March, he was transferred to the Rodeo II prison in Caracas, although his family was not notified of the transfer, where he has been held ever since.   
On 12 April, the Tenth Court of Control of Sentencing Execution issued a release warrant for Carlos, together with a conditional suspension of his sentence for a three-year period. Prison authorities of Rodeo II reportedly claim this warrant cannot be executed until there is an express order to do so from the Minister for Penitentiary Affairs, Ms Mirelys Contreras.  
This arbitrary detention is being perpetrated in a context of massive human rights violations in Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro’s government has implemented a policy of repression amidst a humanitarian complex crisis and a deep human rights crisis that has forced over 6.1 million Venezuelans to flee in search of safety. The justice system lacks independence and according to the UN independent international Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela, it has been used by authorities to enable and commit human rights violations and crimes under international law, some of which may amount to crimes against humanity.

NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Human rights defender and researcher at the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms Ibrahim Ezz el-Din was released on 26 April 2022, after 34 months in arbitrary detention, stemming solely from his peaceful human rights work. He was never tried or formally charged but held pending investigations into two separate cases over baseless accusations of “membership in a terrorist group”. Security forces subjected him to enforced disappearance for 167 days, during which time he said he was tortured and his health deteriorated. Throughout his detention, he was denied access to adequate specialized healthcare for his multiple health conditions. Amnesty International considered Ibrahim Ezz el-Din a prisoner of conscience, detained solely for his human rights work.  
His release follows sustained global interventions and public campaigning. Amnesty International members and supporters signed petitions and sent letters to the Egyptian authorities calling for his release. Ibrahim Ezz el-Din addressed this message to all those who campaigned for his release, including Amnesty International members and supporters:  
My colleagues, defenders of human dignity and the right to a decent life. Throughout the almost three years I spent in prison, I felt that every day I was losing a part of my soul, and losing hope of returning to life again, to freedom. The only thing that enlightened my days and gave me hope was the news I was receiving that people still remember me and demand my freedom. In the darkest moments of despair that] I lived inside prison, the news of the campaigns calling for my release was my only motivation to keep going and have hope. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to campaigning and defending me from inside and outside Egypt. I especially thank Amnesty International, and all its employees and members: you were the rays of sun in pitch dark. Words of thanks cannot express my gratitude to all of you. We need to keep talking about the detainees, as it will give them hope of escaping the injustice inflicted upon them. Thank you all. 
Amnesty International will continue to campaign for the release of those unjustly held in Egypt solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.

Detained under “inciting subversion of state power”, both of their cases are now with Guangzhou City People’s Procuratorate. They were charged for joining weekly private gatherings held at Wang’s house where they discussed challenges faced by activists and civil society in China. Detained solely for practicing their rights to freedom of expression and association, Sophia Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing should be released immediately. Pending their release, the authorities must ensure that they are not subject to torture and other ill-treatment and ensure that they have access to family members and lawyers of their choice.  
Sophia Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were both arrested in Guangzhou on 19 September 2021 and detained incommunicado for more than 6 months. Wang could only meet with his lawyer for the first time virtually on 1 April 2022. I am also concerned that Sophia Huang still has no access to a lawyer.  
According to Wang’s lawyer, Wang was detained alone at Guangzhou City No.1 Detention Centre during the period of “residential surveillance under a designated location” (RSDL) where the conditions were harsh. His basic meals were not regular, and he was subjected to long hours of interrogation. It is believed that Sophia Huang was also subjected to the same ill-treatment during the period when she was detained under RSDL. I find it further worrying that Sophia Huang reportedly significantly lost weight during this period, especially as she only weighed approximately 50kg before she was detained.

Sophia Huang Xueqin is a journalist who has been involved in several #MeToo campaigns to provide support and assistance to survivors of sexual assault and harassment. She was previously detained between October 2019 and January 2020 and charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” after writing about the 2019 mass protests in Hong Kong.  
Labour activist Wang Jianbing (known to friends as “Pancake”) has provided legal support for people with disabilities and workers with occupational diseases. He is also a prominent supporter of the #MeToo movement in China.  
Sophia Huang Xueqin and Wang Jianbing were arrested in the Chinese city of Guangzhou on 19 September, the day before Sophia Huang was planning to leave China for the UK to study for a master’s degree at the University of Sussex. Both Sophia Huang and Wang’s family only received the notice of their arrest in October 2021, more than a month after their arrest. It is believed that they were subjected to “residential surveillance at a designated location” (RSDL) (指定居所监视居住)for more than six months without access to their family members and lawyers of their choice prior to being formally detained at Guangzhou City No 1 Detention Centre.   
Their detention is believed to be related to the weekly gatherings hosted by Wang at his house. These gatherings had been happening for almost a year before they were arrested. During these gatherings, they discussed the challenges faced by activists under the shrinking space of civil society.     
After they were arrested, police raided Wang’s and Sophia Huang’s residences separately. The authorities took away many items including Sophia’s journal. It was also reported that Wang’s Facebook account was logged into by the police. More than 40 activists were questioned by the police after the arrest of Wang and Sophia Huang.    
“Residential surveillance in a designated location” is a measure that, under certain circumstances, enables criminal investigators to hold individuals for up to six months outside the formal detention system in what can amount to a form of secret incommunicado detention. When held without access to legal counsel of their choice, their families or others, suspects placed under this form of “residential surveillance” are at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. This form of detention has been used to curb the activities of human rights defenders, including lawyers, activists and religious practitioners. Activists and human rights defenders continue to be systematically subjected to monitoring, harassment, intimidation, arrest and detention.

Dual Egyptian-British national activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been on hunger-strike since 2 April in protest of his unjust imprisonment, cruel detention conditions and denial of consular visits. In December 2021, an emergency court sentenced him and human rights lawyer Mohamed Baker to five and four years in prison, respectively, following a grossly unfair trial. They are prisoners of conscience, solely targeted for their activism, and should be immediately and unconditionally released.  
Alaa Abdel Fattah’s health has sharply declined since he began his hunger strike on 2 April, only consuming water and salt, in protest of his unjust imprisonment and cruel and inhuman prison conditions, including being banned from accessing any reading material or outdoor exercise for two and a half years. Prison and security officials only allow him monthly family visits, which are only allowed in their presence and through a glass partition, preventing any physical contact with his loved-ones. Concerns for his life have risen further after he appeared frail and seemed to have lost considerable weight during his mother’s last visit on 12 May. He also told his mother that he was beaten while handcuffed by the deputy prison warden at Tora Maximum Security 2 prison on 7 May for asking to be allowed to exercise outdoors. In a statement on 15 May, the head of the National Council for Human Rights, a state institution, claimed having received official assurances that Alaa Abdel Fattah’s rights were guaranteed. Amnesty International believes that prison officials are torturing him by intentionally keeping him in cruel and inhuman prison condition conditions, causing him severe pain and suffering, to punish him for his activism and prominent role in the 25 January Revolution.  
After Alaa Abdel Fattah obtained British citizenship through his British-born mother, a consular visit was formally requested in December 2021, though the Egyptian authorities’ have failed to grant or even respond to the request.

Additional information  
Mohamed Baker and Alaa Abdel Fattah have been detained since 29 September 2019 pending investigations into charges of “joining a terrorist group”, “funding a terrorist group”, “disseminating false news undermining national security” and “us[ing] social media to commit a publishing offence” under Case No.1356/2019 of the Supreme State Security Prosecution (SSSP), a branch of the Public Prosecution specialized in investigating national security threats. The SSSP opened investigations against them into similar charges under new Case No. 1228/2021 as part of a strategy increasingly used by the authorities, referred to as “rotation”, to circumvent the two-year limit for pre-trial detention allowed under Egyptian law and indefinitely extend the detention of activists.  
The trial of Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker in Case No. 1228/2021 started on 28 October 2021, together with another defendant: blogger and activist Mohamed Ibrahim Radwan “Oxygen”, who was also convicted on charges of “spreading false news” in relation to social media posts and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. Proceedings before emergency courts are inherently unfair as their verdicts are not subject to appeal by a higher tribunal. The defendants were also denied their right to adequate defence as their lawyers were prevented from communicating with them in private and photocopying the casefiles, indictments and verdicts. Their lawyers filed complaints to the office responsible for ratifying Emergency State Security Court (ESSC) verdicts, calling on the president to quash the verdict in accordance to Article 14 of the Emergency Law. On 3 January 2022, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ratified the verdict against all three. A document seen by Amnesty International indicated that the sentence commenced from the date of ratification, rather than the date of their arrests. Mohamed Baker’s lawyers filed a case in front of the State Council, the administrative court, for the 31 months he spent in pre-trial detention to be counted towards his sentence. The next hearing is scheduled for 14 May.  
Alaa Abdel Fattah and Mohamed Baker are held in inhumane conditions at the Tora Maximum Security 2 Prison, in Cairo. Prison authorities hold them in small, poorly ventilated cells and have denied them beds and mattresses. Unlike other prisoners, they are prohibited from exercising in the prison yard and are not allowed to use the prison library nor to receive books or newspapers from outside prison at their own expense. The prison authorities have also been denying them adequate clothing, radios, watches, access to hot water and any personal belongings, including family photos. Mohamed Baker informed his wife during a prison visit that as a result of limited movement and poor prison conditions, he developed pain in his joints and muscles. The families of Mohamed Baker and Alaa Abdel Fattah have lodged official complaints about their treatment in prison, including their exclusion from the Covid-19 vaccine rollout. No information has been made available on the status on their complaints.  
During the last of week of April 2022, the Egyptian authorities released tens of men and women held for political reasons, including journalist Mohamed Salah, human rights defender Ibrahim Ezz El-Din and journalist and politician Hossam Moanis arbitrarily detained for periods ranging between 29 and 34 months. On 26 April, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi called for a “national dialogue” with opposition politicians and announced the reactivation of the “Presidential Pardons Committee” launched in 2016. On 5 May, a group of eight Egyptian NGOs called on the authorities to ensure the release of all those arbitrarily detained, sharing their proposal for a right-based approach for the release process.  
On 23 November 2020, the Official Gazette published the decision of the Cairo Criminal Court to include Mohamed Baker and Alaa Abdel Fattah to the “terrorists list” for five years without any due process as part of case No. 1781/2019 by the SSSP. On 18 January 2022, the Court of Cassation rejected their final appeal against the decision. The effect of the decision includes a travel ban, an asset freeze and prohibition from engaging in political or civic work for five years.  
Alaa Abdel Fattah, a well-known political activist and government critic, has been repeatedly arrested in recent years including for his role in the 25 January Revolution of 2011, which led to the toppling of then president, Hosni Mubarak after nearly 30 years in power. Mohamed Baker is a human rights lawyer and director of Adalah Center for Rights and Freedoms, which he founded in 2014. They are among the thousands of people detained arbitrarily in Egypt solely for peacefully exercising their human rights or following grossly unfair trials, including mass and military trials.

Zhanbolat Mamay, journalist and leader of the unregistered opposition Democratic Party of Kazakhstan will remain in custody for yet another month, until 12 June, as a criminal suspect accused of insulting a government representative (Criminal Code, Article 378.2) and spreading false information (Article 274.2). Amnesty International believes this prosecution is politically motivated and Mamay should be immediately released from detention and the charges dropped.  
The 6 May court decision to extend Mamay’s detention and the criminal cases against him constitute politically motivated retribution for his critical speech and his leadership of the unregistered opposition party, the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan.   
Mamay is currently under investigation on charges of insulting a government representative (Criminal Code, Article 378.2) and spreading false information (Article 274.2) related to two separate incidents dating back to 2021. Previously he was already wrongfully sentenced to 15 days of “administrative detention” for organizing an “unsanctioned” meeting and was due to be released on 12 March but was re-arrested. In addition, Mamay, who attended the protests on 4 and 5 January, is being questioned as “a witness with the right to defense”, in relation to an investigation into calls for participation in mass riots (Criminal Code, Article 272.3).

 Zhanbolat Mamay is a well-known political activist and journalist in Kazakhstan. He is the former editor in chief of Tribuna newspaper (now closed). In 2019 he founded and became the leader of the Democratic Party of Kazakhstan (DPK). To date, the opposition party has been arbitrarily denied registration.   
Mamay took part in peaceful protests in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city, on 4 and 5 January. On 20 January he was summoned to a police station and was interrogated as “a witness with the right to defense”, a legal status which usually leads to an indictment, in relation to authorities’ interest in those protests, signaling the start of an investigation against him on charges of calling for participation in mass riots (Article 272.3, Criminal Code). On 13 February Mamay organized a peaceful public vigil in Almaty to commemorate those killed in the January violence. He was arrested on 25 February and sentenced to 15 days of “administrative detention” for “organizing or participating in an unsanctioned public meeting” (Article 488.11, Code of Administrative Offences). Zhanbolat Mamay’s detention was extended for two months on 14 March. He was due to be released on 12 March; but was instead re-arrested, this time as a criminal suspect under Articles 378.2 and 274.2 of the Criminal Code, following two separate events in 2021. On 6 May his detention was extended again during an online court hearing.   
In addition, authorities have now renewed their interrogations of Mamay in relation to their investigation under Article 272.3 of the Criminal Code. While originally Mamay had the status of “witness with the right to defense” in these proceedings, his recent interrogation by the police suggests they may be planning to bring additional charges against him as a criminal suspect also under Article 272.3, according to his lawyer. Mamay has insisted his participation in the January protest was peaceful. If convicted under Article 272.3 alone, Mamay could face up to three years in prison in addition to the penalties that may be imposed on him if convicted under Articles 378.2 and 274.2, including heavy fines and public or correctional labour. He is currently detained in a facility of temporary detention (SIZO) in Almaty.   
On 4 January 2022 in protest against a dramatic rise in fuel prices, thousands of people took to the streets of Kazakhstan. In Almaty and elsewhere, violence broke out. In an alarming development, as damage to property and the number of casualties grew, troops were sent to the streets, and were instructed by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, in his own admission, to open fire without warning. Additionally, the authorities suppressed freedom of expression and the flow of independent information, including by detaining and harassing journalists and activists, shutting down the Internet, and disabling social media and other means of digital communication. The official figures provided by the government of those killed during the protest are 232 people including 19 of whom they said were identified as law enforcement or army personnel.  
Authorities responded with hostility to the protestors, by targeting and silencing journalists and activists, and by suppressing freedom of expression and the flow of independent information. The government of Kazakhstan has failed to act on calls from Amnesty International and others for an independent international investigation of the January 2022 events.  
The family and supporters of Zhanbolat Mamay have also been arbitrarily targeted by law enforcement authorities for peacefully exercising their right to assembly. On 4 May Inga Imanabay, Mamay’s wife, was arrested when she was leaving the facility of temporary detention in Almaty after visiting her husband and was taken to a local police station. An administrative court of Almaty fined her under Article 488 of the Code of Administrative Offences for violation of the rules of mass gatherings for organizing a peaceful protest on 4 April in support of her husband. Following that, Inga Imanabay attempted to organize a peaceful protest on 7 May in support of political prisoners. On 7 May, before a group of activists including Imanbay reached the location of the protest, she and other supporters were taken to a police station. Again, Imanabay was fined under Article 488 of the Code of Administrative Offences. Seven of Mamay’s supporters and activists from DPK are currently being held in administrative detention for 15-20 days for purported offences under the same Article in relation to the protest on 7 May.

NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
On 24 April 2022, journalist Mohamed Salah, who had been arbitrarily detained since 26 November 2019 without charge or trial solely for the peaceful exercise of his human rights, was released. Even though in July 2020, a court ordered his release in relation to investigations into accusations of “joining a terrorist group” and “spreading false news” in Case No. 488/2019 connected to anti-government protests in March 2019, he remained behind bars pending investigations into similar unfounded terrorism accusations in a new case (Case No. 855/2020).  
Supporters around the world signed petitions and sent letters to the Egyptians authorities to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mohamed Salah.  Following his release,  
he sent this message to Amnesty International members and supporters:  
“I am writing these lines as a free man after spending two years and five months in prison. Throughout this period, you were supportive of my cause by all possible means, not only me but also others who were imprisoned because of their opinions. I thank you all for the constant support and urgent actions for my freedom. You were a voice for us from inside prison, and I invite you to continue your honorable and honest work for the freedom of every human being, especially prisoners of conscience.”  
Amnesty International will continue to campaign for the release of journalists and other unjustly held in Egypt solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.

A team led by High...","The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights must address crimes against humanity and gross human rights violations when her team visits China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region this week, Amnesty International said today as the UN’s long-awaited trip got under way. 
A team led by High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet will spend six days in China including Xinjiang, where Amnesty International has documented systematic arbitrary imprisonment, torture and persecution of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. 
“Michelle Bachelet’s long-delayed visit to Xinjiang is a critical opportunity to address human rights violations in the region, but it will also be a running battle against Chinese government efforts to cover up the truth. The UN must take steps to mitigate against this and resist being used to support blatant propaganda,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Lasting six days, this visit will only be able to scratch the surface of addressing crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. But at the very least Bachelet’s visit must focus on the victims of China’s crackdown: the Uyghurs and other Muslims who have been targeted and the many families overseas who are tormented by not knowing where their relatives are held and how to pursue justice, truth and reparation.” 
Amnesty International and other human rights groups have repeatedly called on the Chinese authorities to allow independent UN human rights experts and other human rights monitors access to Xinjiang – a demand that is finally being granted with this brief visit by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).The UN must avoid becoming complicit 
The High Commissioner committed to speaking to key stakeholders prior to her visit. However, the UN team faces a serious challenge to ensure this visit meets their stated standard of being truly “unfettered”, “meaningful” and “including unsupervised interviews”.  
“Bachelet will be aware of repeated steps taken by the Chinese authorities during previous visits by UN human rights envoys to impose strict surveillance and undermine access, including by detaining identified interviewees and potential interlocutors and warning others to feign absence.”  
Amnesty International has also documented instances of detainees from minority groups in Xinjiang being coached for days in preparation for foreign visitors, instructed to respond to visitors’ questions with pre-scripted lines on threat of punishment. 
“The OHCHR must avoid becoming complicit in the Chinese government’s attempts to cover up human rights violations, potentially by using the visit itself as ‘proof’ of their falsity,” Callamard said. 
“The itinerary of the visit should not be imposed by the Chinese authorities but guided by the mandate of the visit and grounded on human rights methodology, including by being victim-centered. Above all, Bachelet’s team must be able to conduct an impartial assessment of the situation on the ground and be fully transparent about the details of the trip, the terms of their agreement with the government and its delivery on the ground.” 
Since September 2018, when the High Commissioner first sought access to Xinjiang “in light of deeply disturbing allegations of large-scale arbitrary detentions of Uighurs and other Muslim communities”, numerous organizations have published further detailed and well-corroborated information on the situation. In June 2021, Amnesty International launched a comprehensive report documenting how China’s crackdown against predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang amounted to crimes against humanity. 
Based on dozens of testimonies, the report described a “dystopian hellscape” encompassing grave violations against detainees, systematic state surveillance of millions of people, and efforts to root out the religious traditions, cultural practices and local languages of the region’s Muslim ethnic groups. 
Amnesty International launched an international campaign, initially focusing on more than 70 individuals, calling for the release of all people arbitrarily detained in camps and prisons, and for the closure of the internment camps. Just this month Amnesty has collected details of a further 40 missing or detained individuals as news of Bachelet’s visit has prompted more families to come forward seeking justice for relatives in Xinjiang who have disappeared and are believed to be detained. 
Bachelet’s visit is also a chance to secure a long-lasting communication channel between the OHCHR and the local authorities with regards to future queries from families about the fate and whereabouts of their loved ones. 
“Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are looking to Bachelet’s team to start the process of holding China to account over its campaign of terror in Xinjiang,” Callamard said. 
“This UN visit must amplify victims’ efforts to track down their loved ones by actively seeking out known detainees and leaving no stone unturned in trying to find them. It must contribute to uncovering the truth that the Chinese government has long been trying to hide.”Calls to release OHCHR report 
The OHCHR has already compiled its own report on human rights violations in Xinjiang, which Bachelet said was being “finalised” last year. It has not yet been made public, despite repeated requests from Amnesty International and almost 200 other NGOs. 
“It is crucial that the findings of the UN mission to China are released in a timely manner. Their publication must not suffer the same unexplained delays as the OHCHR report on Xinjiang, which the world is still waiting to see. The OHCHR must make public all its findings about human rights violations in China without further delay,” Callamard said.

At least 579 executions were known to have been carried out across 18 countries last year⁠—a 20% increase on the recorded total for 2020⁠. Iran accounted for the biggest portion of this rise, executing at least 314 people (up from at least 246 in 2020), its highest execution total since 2017. This was due in part to a marked increase in drug-related executions—a flagrant violation of international law which prohibits use of the death penalty for crimes other than those involving intentional killing. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia more than doubled its number of executions, a grim trend that continued in 2022 with the execution of 81 people in a single day in March. 
“After the drop in their execution totals in 2020, Iran and Saudi Arabia once again ramped up their use of the death penalty last year, including by shamelessly violating prohibitions put in place under international human rights law. Their appetite for putting the executioner to work has also shown no sign of abating in the early months of 2022,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
As Covid-19 restrictions that had previously delayed judicial processes were steadily lifted in many parts of the world, judges handed down at least 2,052 death sentences in 56 countries—a close to 40% increase on 2020—with big spikes seen in countries including Bangladesh (at least 181, from at least 113), India (144, from 77) and Pakistan (at least 129, from at least 49). 
“Instead of building on the opportunities presented by hiatuses in 2020, a minority of states demonstrated a troubling enthusiasm to choose the death penalty over effective solutions to crime, showing a callous disregard for the right to life even amid urgent and ongoing global human rights crises,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Despite these setbacks, the total number of recorded executions in 2021 constitutes the second-lowest figure, after 2020, that Amnesty International has recorded since at least 2010. 
As in previous years, the recorded global totals for death sentences and executions do not include the thousands of people that Amnesty International believes to have been sentenced to death and executed in China, as well as the extensive number of executions believed to have taken place in North Korea and Viet Nam. Secretive state practices and restricted access to information for these three countries made it impossible to accurately monitor executions, while for several other countries, recorded totals must be regarded as minimum figures. 
Instead of building on the opportunities presented by hiatuses in 2020, a minority of states demonstrated a troubling enthusiasm to choose the death penalty over effective solutions to crime, showing a callous disregard for the right to life even amid urgent and ongoing global human rights crises, 
“China, North Korea and Viet Nam continued to shroud their use of the death penalty behind layers of secrecy, but, as ever, the little we saw is cause for great alarm,” said Agnès Callamard. 
⁠Iran maintains a mandatory death penalty for possession of certain types and quantities of drugs⁠⁠—with the number of executions recorded for drug-related offences rising more than five-fold to 132 in 2021 from 23 the previous year. The known number of women executed also rose from nine to 14, while the Iranian authorities continued their abhorrent assault on children’s rights by executing three people who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime, contrary to their obligations under international law. 
As well as the rise in executions seen in Saudi Arabia (65, from 27 in 2020), significant increases on 2020 were seen in Somalia (at least 21, from at least 11) South Sudan (at least 9, from at least 2) and Yemen (at least 14, from at least 5). Belarus (at least 1), Japan (3) and UAE (at least 1) also carried out executions, having not done so in 2020. 
Significant increases in death sentences compared to 2020 were recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (at least 81, from at least 20), Egypt (at least 356, from at least 264), Iraq (at least 91, from at least 27), Myanmar (at least 86, from at least 1), Viet Nam (at least 119 from at least 54), and Yemen (at least 298, from at least 269). 
In several countries in 2021, the death penalty was deployed as an instrument of state repression against minorities and protestors, with governments showing an utter disregard for safeguards and restrictions on the death penalty established under international human rights law and standards. 
An alarming increase in the use of the death penalty under martial law was recorded in Myanmar, where the military transferred the authority to try civilian cases to military tribunals, which conducted summary proceedings without the right to appeal. Close to 90 people were arbitrarily sentenced to death, several in absentia, in what was widely perceived as a targeted campaign against protestors and journalists. 
Egyptian authorities continued to resort to torture and mass executions, often following unfair trials before Emergency State Security Courts, while in Iran, death sentences were disproportionately used against members of ethnic minorities for vague charges such as “enmity against God”. At least 19% of the recorded executions (61) were members of the Baluchi ethnic minority, who constitute only around 5% of Iran’s population. 
Victims of Saudi Arabia’s deeply flawed justice system included Mustafa al-Darwish, a young Saudi Arabian man from the Shi’a minority who was accused of participating in violent anti-government protests. He was executed on 15 June following a grossly unfair trial based on a “confession” extracted through torture. 
Despite these alarming developments, positive signs of a global trend toward abolition continued throughout 2021. For the second consecutive year, the number of countries known to have executed people was the lowest since Amnesty International began keeping records. 
In Sierra Leone, an Act which abolishes the death penalty for all crimes was unanimously adopted by parliament in July, although it is yet to come into effect. In December, Kazakhstan adopted legislation to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, which came into effect in January 2022. The Government of Papua New Guinea embarked on a national consultation on the death penalty, which resulted in the adoption of an abolition bill in January 2022, which is yet to come into force. At the end of the year, the Government of Malaysia announced that it would table legislative reforms on the death penalty in the third quarter of 2022. And, in Central African Republic and Ghana, lawmakers started legislative processes to abolish the death penalty, which remain ongoing. 
In the US, Virginia became the 23rd abolitionist state and first southern state to have abolished the death penalty, while, for the third consecutive year, Ohio rescheduled or halted all set executions. The new US administration also established a temporary moratorium on federal executions in July. 2021 marked the lowest number of executions in the US since 1988. 
Gambia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan continued to observe official moratoriums on executions. 
The minority of countries that still retain the death penalty are on notice: a world without state-sanctioned killing is not only imaginable, it is within reach and we will continue to fight for it. 
“The minority of countries that still retain the death penalty are on notice: a world without state-sanctioned killing is not only imaginable, it is within reach and we will continue to fight for it. We will continue to expose the inherent arbitrariness, discrimination, and cruelty of this punishment until no one will be left under its shadow. It is high time the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment is consigned to the history books,” said Agnès Callamard.

This figure represents the second lowest number of executions recorded by Amnesty International since at least 2010. 
Most known executions took place in China, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria – in that order. 
China remained the world’s leading executioner – but the true extent of its use of the death penalty is unknown as this data is classified as a state secret; the global figures for executions and death sentences therefore exclude the thousands of people that Amnesty International believes to have been sentenced to death and executed in China. 
Figures for North Korea and Viet Nam, which are believed to have extensively resorted to executions, were also not included in the global executions figure, as secrecy and lack of access to independent information made it impossible to assess trends. 
Amnesty International recorded 24 women among the 579 people known to have been executed in 2021 (4%), in the following countries: Egypt (8), Iran (14), Saudi Arabia (1) and USA (1). 
Belarus, Japan and UAE resumed executions. Amnesty International did not record any executions in India, Qatar and Taiwan, having done so in 2020. 
Iran executed at least 314 people (up from at least 246 in 2020), their highest number of executions since 2017, reversing year-on-year declines since then. 
Recorded executions in Saudi Arabia rose sharply, from 27 to 65, an increase of 140% percent. 
Despite these increases, the 2021 global executions figure constitutes the second-lowest figure recorded by Amnesty International since at least 2010. For the second consecutive year, the number of countries known to have executed people was the lowest the organization has recorded. In 2019, 2020 and 2021 Amnesty International recorded 657, 483 and 579 executions respectively. 
In July, Sierra Leone’s parliament unanimously adopted an Act which abolishes the death penalty for all crimes. Kazakhstan adopted legislation in December abolishing the death penalty for all crimes, which came into effect this year. Papua New Guinea embarked on a national consultation on the death penalty, which resulted in the adoption of an abolition Bill in January 2022, still to come into force. The Government of Malaysia announced that it would table legislative reforms on the death penalty in the third quarter of 2022. 
At the end of 2021, more than two thirds of the world’s countries had abolished the death penalty in law or practice. 108 countries, a majority of the world’s states, had abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes and 144 countries had abolished the death penalty in law or practice. 55 countries still retained the death penalty. 
Amnesty International recorded commutations or pardons of death sentences in 19 countries: Bangladesh, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guyana, India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Taiwan, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, UAE, USA, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 
Amnesty International recorded seven exonerations of people under sentence of death in four countries: Bahrain (1), Kenya (1), USA (2) and Zambia (3). 
Amnesty International recorded 2,052 death sentences imposed in 56 countries, up 39% from at least 1,477 in 54 countries in 2020. 
Ethiopia, Guyana, Maldives, Oman, Tanzania, and Uganda handed down death sentences having not done so in 2020, while the reverse was true of Bahrain, Comoros, Laos and Niger. 
At the end of 2021, at least 28,670 people were known to be under sentence of death. Nine countries held 82% of the known totals: Iraq (8,000+), Pakistan (3,800+), Nigeria (3,036+), USA (2,382), Bangladesh (1,800+), Malaysia (1,359), Viet Nam (1,200+), Algeria (1,000+), Sri Lanka (1,000+). 
The following methods of execution were used across the world in 2021: beheading, hanging, lethal injection and shooting. 
Four people were executed for crimes that occurred when they were below 18 years of age: in Iran (3) and Yemen (1). Amnesty International believes that other people in this category remained on death row in Maldives, Myanmar and Iran. 
At least 134 executions for drug-related offences were known to have been carried out in two countries (China and Iran), an increase of 346% from 2020 (30). Information on Viet Nam, which is very likely to have carried out such executions, was unavailable. 
Death sentences were known to have been imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards in countries including Algeria, Bangladesh, Cameroon, Egypt, Iran, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Singapore and Yemen. 
All 11 of the recorded executions in 2021 took place in the USA. The rest of the Americas region remained execution-free for the 13th consecutive year. 
25 new death sentences were handed down in three countries: USA, Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago. 
Virginia became the 23rd abolitionist state in the USA and first southern state to have abolished the death penalty. For the third consecutive year, Ohio rescheduled or halted all set executions. 
The new US administration also established a temporary moratorium on federal executions in July. 2021 marked the lowest number of executions in the US since 1988. 
Amnesty International recorded executions in five countries⁠—Bangladesh, China, Japan, North Korea and Viet Nam⁠—the lowest number in more than two decades. 
At least 819 new death sentences were handed down in 16 countries, a rise of 58% compared to 2020 (517), largely linked to increases in Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and Viet Nam. 
After a hiatus of 24 months, Japan hanged three people. For the second consecutive year, Pakistan reported no executions and also prohibited the use of the death penalty on those diagnosed with severe mental (psycho-social) disabilities. Thailand continued to commute death sentences. 
The threat of reintroduction of the death penalty in the Philippines diminished as three of its proponents in the Senate announced they would oppose any such move. 
Although Singapore reported no executions for the second consecutive year, the country has resumed executions in 2022. 
Amnesty International recorded one execution and one new death sentence, both in Belarus, which remains the only country in the region carrying out executions. 
Kazakhstan signed into law a bill abolishing the death penalty for all crimes. 
Armenia became a state party to a key international treaty on abolition of the death penalty. 
The Russian Federation and Tajikistan continued to observe moratoriums on executions. 
520 executions were recorded in seven countries–Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen – an increase of 19% on 2020. 
Recorded executions in Iraq more than halved, from 45 to 17, though this may have been the result of a slowdown in the executive approvals of death sentences due to the political turmoil that the state was in for much of the year. 
A mass execution of 24 people in Syria in October made the country the fifth biggest recorded executor in 2021. 
There were at least 834 new death sentences in 17 countries, a jump of 32%, with sharp increases in Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon. This figure does not reflect the many death sentences that were believed to have been imposed in Iran. 
At least 356 people were sentenced to death by Egyptian courts in 2021, a rise of 34% and the highest number of death sentences that Amnesty International was able to record worldwide in 2021. 
The number of executions, recorded in 3 countries, more than doubled to 33, as a result of rises in Somalia and South Sudan. The other country to carry out executions was Botswana. 
At least 373 new death sentences were handed down in 19 countries, an increase of 22%, due to sharp rises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mauritania, and despite a significant drop in Zambia. 
In July, Sierra Leone’s parliament unanimously adopted an Act which abolishes the death penalty for all crimes. In Central African Republic and Ghana, legislative processes to abolish the death penalty were started and remain ongoing. 
At least 5,843 people were held under a sentence of death, with Nigeria holding 52% of them (at least 3,036).

It was a sad moment when Amnesty International closed its Hong Kong offices after standing for more than 40 years in my city. 
This organization is very important to me – and not just because they have campaigned for my release since I was imprisoned last year. 
Amnesty has been the window that gives an international perspective to my human rights work. Seeing its demise is like watching parts of myself disappear, leaving an empty shell floating in the rubble. 
My connection with Amnesty did not start in Hong Kong, but while I was in the UK studying at Cambridge. At that time, as an ignorant college student, I assumed there would be plenty of societies dedicated to the Tiananmen crackdown or other China-related issues. 
But finding none that specialized in that particular area, I enrolled in Cambridge University Amnesty International (CUAI). 
It was only after I joined that I learned that Amnesty is the world’s largest membership-based human rights organization, with millions of members in more than a hundred countries – democratically deciding on the issues and directions it wants to focus on, independent of any political power or national force. I was struck by the notion that the unifying power of an idea could be so great. 
The bottom-up approach in the organization can transcend cultures and borders, bringing together the power of ordinary people into a force that no country can ignore. I got up the nerve to run for the executive committee and became an executive member – organizing letter-writing groups for prisoners of conscience around the world, as well as exhibitions, lectures, debates, screenings, fundraising galas, even competitive letter-writing contests. 
I felt good that I, as an individual and a member of a collective, could do something to fight injustice. 
CUAI’s most iconic event is CAGE! A group of students are locked up in relay in a cage perched on the King’s College lawn for 24 hours a day, while asking people to sign, donate or take action. Now I am one of those prisoners of conscience we were campaigning for, and I really do sleep on a hard bed in jail. But I don’t really feel that uncomfortable. 
The CUAI has a high degree of freedom, and my first attempt to organize a June 4 memorial in Cambridge was under the CUAI umbrella. Amnesty was the inspiration for my advocacy. Without that period of experimentation and experience, I probably would not be the person I am now. 
When I returned to Hong Kong in 2010, I represented Amnesty – working alongside colleagues all over the world. I learned that by listening more to other people’s stories and struggles, you feel less trapped in your own problems. It helps you realize yours is not the only struggle. 
For a decade I have been passionately involved in the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (the Alliance), which organized the city’s Tiananmen vigil – until it was forced to disband last year with many of our most prominent members detained. 
The Alliance is a world away from Amnesty. It was a small, single-issue organization run by dedicated and enthusiastic members, yet it is respected and beloved among people in Hong Kong. 
I had the privilege of experiencing a time when Hong Kong was still open and pluralistic, and when global human rights organizations were not viewed with suspicion and hostility because of their international status. People were able to participate in both local and international organizations, to collaborate and interact with a variety of groups, so that different experiences could complement each other and civil society as a whole could grow and progress in a diverse and communicative way, making Hong Kong truly a world city. 
That is not the Hong Kong the next generation stands to inherit. Hong Kong as a society is going exactly in the opposite direction – denying diversity, hostile to foreign views, with a disjointed and battered civil society increasingly afraid to collaborate with each other. That makes it hard for groups like mine to survive, which is of course the intention. 
The departure of Amnesty is an unmistakable warning sign to the outside world about just how dire the state of human rights is in Hong Kong. There can be no more pretense of freedom.

A year ago today, police officers repressed 93 people, most of them female students from the Escuela Normal Rural Mactumactzá, who had taken to the streets to defend their right to education. 
The students had gathered at the toll booth in the municipality of Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, the state with the highest poverty rate in Mexico, to hand out flyers with information about their simple demand: that the entrance exams for the school be held in-person and not online, because many people who aspire to study there live in remote areas, with little or no access to the internet or a computer. 
The police response to theirs demand was repressive and disproportionate. According to multiple testimonies that Amnesty International gathered, the students protested peacefully, without obstructing traffic or harming public property or third parties. 
According to criminal complaints filed by several protesters, state police officers pulled their hair, grabbed them by the neck, beat them in the head, back, and abdomen, and kicked them in the ribs. They stripped some of their facemasks without their consent and with unnecessary force, and insulted several others using racist, classist, and misogynistic language. They called them “bitches”, “whores” and “sluts” for daring to protest and told them they had no right to study and that “hopefully they learn their lesson”. When a group of students took refuge in a bus, police officers broke down the door and fired tear gas inside, once again using illegal and excessive force. 
In total, they arrested 93 students: 19 men and 74 women; as well as two other teenagers who were not students. Several female detainees said police harassed them and threatened to forcibly strip them and subject them to other forms of sexual violence. One demonstrator reported that, once he got her onboard a vehicle, a policeman made her lie face-down, put his hand between her legs and touched her vagina. Others reported that female police officers touched their buttocks, breasts and vulva. 
The police subjected some detainees to psychological torture. They made allusions to the infamous enforced disappearance of the 43 students from the Escuela Normal Rural Ayotzinapa in 2014, telling them that “now there’ll be 95, instead of 43” disappeared students. The reference to one of the worst atrocities in modern Mexican history was chilling. 
“We were shaking with panic, not knowing what was going to happen to us. We held each other’s hands, and they were telling me: ‘I don’t want to die, I have my whole life ahead of me,’” one student, who requested anonymity for security reasons, told Amnesty International. 
Access to education is a fundamental human right. In remote and marginalized communities, schools like Mactumactzá and Ayotzinapa represent a bastion for the formation of agents of positive change. They are vital sources of social mobility and livelihood in areas where the alternatives are often forced migration, organized crime or precarious work. 
The students at Mactumatzá frequently protest for the school to take on more alumni, or for the authorities to guarantee financial support to allow them to eat and cover the costs of transport and educational materials. Demanding that entrance exams not be exclusively online is part of their constant struggle for access to decent educational conditions. 
The right to peaceful protest is under attack, not only in Mexico but in much of Latin America and the Caribbean. Arbitrary arrests, excessive use of force and even unlawful killings are some of the repressive tactics that security forces resort to in a number of countries across the region to punish and deter those who dare to exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 
We were shaking with panic, not knowing what was going to happen to us. We held each other’s hands, and they were telling me: ‘I don’t want to die, I have my whole life ahead of me. 
In the case of Mactumactzá, the stigmatization and violence against the students exemplifies a wider trend that Amnesty International has documented in the repression of women who protest in Mexico, including the use of sexual violence as a form of oppression by law enforcement authorities in various parts of the country. 
Criminalization is another common tactic to discourage demonstrations. Although the Chiapas State Prosecutor’s Office eventually dropped the criminal charges against the 95 detainees, there is still widespread fear of demonstrating again among the group. Meanwhile, the human rights violations that the police committed that day remain unpunished a year later. 
The Mexican authorities, in every corner of the country, must cease their repressive practices towards those exercising the right to protest. Moreover, they must conduct prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations into the complaints and reports of sexual violence against the women who took part in the protest on 18 May 2021, to guarantee the victims’ rights to justice, truth and reparation.  
We cannot allow fear to overcome our legitimate right to peaceful protest. Taking to the streets and raising our voices in defence of human rights will always be a courageous act, but we should all be able to do it without fear of reprisals.

Three years after his arrest, the now 23-year-old has still not been charged with an offence, and the state has yet to provide any evidence of him committing an internationally recognizable crime. Mohamed Imran must be immediately released, or promptly charged with recognizable offense, in accordance with international standards.  
According to Imran’s family, upon his arrest, no arrest receipt or detention order was provided to them. A detention order was only issued to Imran on 29 March 2022, two years and ten months after Imran’s arrest. These procedural lapses, along with abusive provisions within the PTA, violate due process safeguards and international human rights law.  
Imran has only been produced in court four times since his arrest, the last time being September 2021. The lack of judicial oversight and prolonged administrative detention in this case leaves Imran at risk of torture or other ill-treatment at the hands of the police.   
The prolonged detention without charge of Mohamed Imaam Mohamed Imran is a violation of international fair trial standards and the authorities’ legal obligations in line with Sri Lanka’s obligations under the ICCPR.

Additional information  
23-year-old Mohamed Imaam Mohamed Imran is a computer engineering student and sales representative for electrical bulbs who lives in Kattankudy, a town on the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka. He is the breadwinner who provides for his 54- year-old mother, a single mother who sold her house to pay for Imran’s education, and his late grandmother who passed away while Imran was in detention.  
According to the detention order signed off by the President in his capacity as the Minister of Defence, Imran is detained on suspicion of being “connected with or concerned in unlawful activity” for “aiding and abetting the suicide bombers of the Easter Sunday attacks on 21.04.2019, attending weapon training and extremist lectures conducted by Mohomad Casim Mohamed Saharan and his followers and concealing such information from security forces” – an allegation law enforcement officials are yet to substantiate with any credible evidence, three years after Imran’s arrest. This detention order does not amount to charges against Imran.   
In 2017, then UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism, Ben Emmerson, highlighted the history of Sri Lankan authorities of prosecuting minorities on charges of terrorism and noted that “the PTA had been used to commit some of the worst human rights violations, including widespread torture and arbitrary detention, in the run-up to and during the conflict, particularly to target minorities and suppress dissent”. The report also highlighted the history of Sri Lankan authorities persecuting individuals under terrorism related law with “various real or perceived links or associations with armed groups, and detaining for years without charge or trial, without any judicial review of their detention, and with almost no possibility of release”.  
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), in its 2016 submission to the UN Committee against Torture, highlighted the use of torture in Sri Lanka with “torture being routinely used in all parts of the country regardless of the nature of the suspected offence for which the person is arrested.” Another study conducted by the Commission, published in December 2020, found that PTA detainees faced a continuum of violence. The study documented that “violence in police custody was found to be an inherent element of the investigation process, whereby torture is inflicted to extract information, confessions, and evidence from detainees.” The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has called on the Sri Lankan government to establish a moratorium on the use of the PTA for new arrests until it is replaced by legislation that adheres to international best practices.  
Sri Lankan authorities have a responsibility to investigate and bring to justice in fair trials anyone suspected of being responsible for human rights violations or abuses. But such actions should be in accordance with international standards of fair trial, including unrestricted access to legal counsel and trials in independent courts. These rights are guaranteed under international human rights law, binding on Sri Lanka, and in the Constitution of Sri Lanka.   
Article 14 (3) of ICCPR stipulates that “In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality: (a) To be informed promptly and in detail in a language which he understands of the nature and cause of the charge against him; (b) To have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defence and to communicate with counsel of his own choosing; (c) To be tried without undue delay”, among other rights.”

Since that time, more than 25,000 people have reportedly been arrested, and the human rights of the population are gravely under threat. Amnesty International calls on President Nayib Bukele to take all necessary measures to put an immediate end to human rights violations occurring in the context of the state of emergency, and to design public security strategies that guarantee fundamental rights.   
The legal reforms approved since the start of the state of emergency threaten human rights and do not comply with international standards. The emergency decree suspends fundamental freedoms, such as the right to legal defense. In addition to this, other legal reforms, such as the elimination of maximum time periods for pre-trial detention and the approval of trials without the presence of the accused, are contrary to international law.  
There are  reports of ill treatment of detainees by security forces, with at least five people having allegedly died while in custody. Local organizations have identified incidents where people are being detained for having tattoos or merely being present in areas where gang members traditionally operate. Hundreds of reports of arbitrary detentions have been made.   
Journalists, human rights defenders and judicial actors are under attack in the country. Recent legal reforms threaten the ability of journalists to report on gang-related activity without being subject to prosecution. The government has stigmatized and harassed journalists and human rights defenders. Moreover, judges and defense lawyers appear to be under increased scrutiny.

Additional information  
On 27 March 2022, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly approved a state of emergency at the request of President Nayib Bukele, to respond to reports of a spike in gang-related homicides. The state of emergency, originally due to last 30 days, was renewed by the Legislative Assembly on 24 April. More than 25,000 have been arrested to date and widespread human rights violations have been reported. Amnesty International is particularly concerned about the following issues:   
Legal reforms implemented in the context of the state of emergency threaten human rights and do not comply with international standards.   
 The emergency decree approved by the Legislative Assembly suspends human rights that have been deemed fundamental, and therefore cannot be deferred, under international law. These include the right to legal defense and the right to be informed of the reasons for a detention, among others.   Other legal reforms passed by the Legislative Assembly include the establishment of prison sentences for minors aged between 12 and 16 for gang-related crimes; the ability to try people in absentia – that is, without their presence in the context of a trial; the abolition of maximum time periods for pre-trial detention; and the establishment of trials with “faceless” anonymized judges, which may raise concerns overdue process and judicial independence.   
Reforms also include the establishment of prison sentences for those that “directly or indirectly benefit from relationships of any nature” with gangs, or those that “reproduce…messages or statements originated or supposedly originated” by gangs – both vaguely worded reforms that do not meet the legality requirement under international law. The latter reform, in particular, could lead to the criminalization of journalists that report on gang-related activity.   
There have been widespread reports of arbitrary detentions, as well as concerns over ill treatment and the deaths of prisoners in custody.   
Civil society organizations have received more than 300 reports of human rights violations in the context of the state of emergency, more than 70% of which relate to arbitrary detentions.  
Local organizations and the media report that people are being arrested in poor and marginalized neighborhoods merely for having tattoos or being present in areas where gang members traditionally operate. These people allegedly do not have access to legal defense, and concerns have been raised regarding judicial independence and the ability of these individuals to obtain fair judicial review of their detention. Reports of ill treatment have also surfaced in the context of the state of emergency, and the President has made concerning statements regarding limiting prisoners’ access to food and fresh air. Reports allege that at least five people have died in custody in the context of the state of emergency.   
Journalists, human rights defenders and judicial actors are under attack.   
Journalists and human rights defenders that have spoken out against the state of emergency have been subject to harassment and stigmatization by authorities on social media and other channels. This harassment against journalists in El Salvador has reached such levels that some have felt the need to leave the country, fearing reprisals. Judges and defense lawyers have also reportedly been subject to increased scrutiny.   
The state of emergency and related measures come within a broader context of shrinking civic space in El Salvador. In May 2021, the Legislative Assembly – controlled by Nayib Bukele’s “Nuevas Ideas” Party – voted to remove judges from the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court – a move widely interpreted as an attack on judicial independence in the country. The Legislative Assembly has also tried to introduce legislation restricting foreign funding for civil society organizations, which, if approved, would have significantly hampered the work of NGOs in El Salvador. President Bukele frequently disparages and stigmatizes the work of NGOs and journalists on social media; and in January 2022, it was revealed that least 35 people, mainly independent journalists from outlets critical of the government, had been the object of Pegasus spyware infections.

On 10 May, the Qatari Criminal Court of First Instance convicted and sentenced brothers and lawyers Hazza and Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri to life in prison on charges including contesting laws ratified by the Emir and organizing unauthorized public meetings. Alongside them, two other men were handed life and 15-year prison sentences in absentia. Their convictions and sentences must be quashed and the two lawyers immediately released.  
The four members of the Al Murra tribe were sentenced following a trial marred by a number of due process violations. The charges included “contesting and refusing laws and decisions ratified by the Emir”, “resorting to threats and social media to urge the Emir to carry out work within his legal specialty”, “undertaking actions which would compromise the independence of the state”, “convening and organizing a public meeting without authorization”, and “violating societal values and principles” online and using social media. These charges relate to speeches and poetry they made or published online that were critical of a recently adopted electoral law that is discriminatory to members of al-Marri tribe, as they were calling for equal rights to political participation.  
Protests erupted near Doha in August 2021 after the Qatar’s Emir ratified a law paving the way for the first legislative elections of the Shura Council, which discriminates against members of the Al Murra tribe by excluding thousands of them from voting or running in the election.  
Hazza bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri was arrested at his home on 8 August 2021 after taking part in the protests and tweeting a video-recorded message addressed to the Emir criticizing the law. His brother Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri was arrested on 11 August 2021 after attempting to legally represent his brother. Both men were held in solitary confinement until at least the end of March 2022, during which time they were interrogated by the State Security Prosecution without their lawyers. Their trial was held behind closed doors. Their lawyers were only allowed to peruse the case files and not given copies to prepare their defense. The two men have the right to appeal their sentencing.

The two other Qatari men tried in absentia are poets Mohammed Hamad Mohammed Ftais al-Marri who was sentenced to a 15-year prison term, and Mohammed Rashed Hassan Nasser al-Ajami, also known as Ibn al-Dheeb, who received a life sentence. The latter is a former prisoner on whose behalf Amnesty International had campaigned.  
On 29 July 2021, the Emir ratified Law No. (6) of 2021 regarding the procedures for the election of the Shura Council. The election plans were first approved when the permanent written constitution was adopted following a 2003 referendum. The new electoral law divides Qatari nationals into three categories: 1) Citizens aged 18 and over, and whose grandfather was born in Qatar, can vote in districts in which their tribe or family reside. They can also register their candidature for the Shura Council as long as they are aged 30 or over. 2) Citizens who have acquired the Qatari nationality – provided that their grandfather is Qatari and born in Qatar, can vote in districts in which their tribe or family reside. They cannot register their candidature for the Shura Council 3) Naturalized Qatari citizens do not have the right to vote nor to be candidates for the Shura Council.  
Protests of tribal members affected by the exclusion, mainly from the Al Murra tribe, erupted near Doha around 7 August 2021. On 8 August 2021, the Ministry of Interior stated that seven men were arrested and referred to the Public Prosecution, accused of “using social media to spread false news and stir up racial and tribal strife”.  
On 11 August 2021, following talks between the tribes’ elders and the authorities, further protests were called off. Al Murra members said that the Emir had promised to consider protesters’ demands.  
Arrests continued to take place throughout August and September 2021. Many were released upon signing a pledge, promising not to speak out about their detention and to stop criticizing the new law or calling for their rights. Hazza and Rashed bin Ali Abu Shurayda al-Marri refused to sign the pledge.  
The Al Murra tribe is one of the largest tribes in eastern Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Its members have long faced severe discrimination and been deprived from access to education, employment, and health care. In 2004 and 2005 the entire Ghufran clan, a branch of the Al Murra tribe, were stripped of citizenship, accused of holding Saudi nationality in secret (Qatar does not recognize dual nationality), after some of its senior members were accused of involvement in a counter-coup after Sheikh Hamad – the current Emir’s father – deposed his father in a bloodless coup in 1995. Over 5,000 people were affected, but the measure was eventually reversed for all but a small number believed to have been directly involved in the plot.

On Wednesday, 18 May, the National Criminal Sentencing Court in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, is scheduled to announce the sentence imposed on David Castillo, former manager of the company Desarrollos Energéticos and in charge of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project, who was convicted nine months ago as a co-author of the killing of human rights defender Berta Cáceres in 2016.  
“Knowing the punishment handed down on those who participated in the heinous crime against Indigenous leader Berta Cáceres is a key moment in the search for truth, justice and reparation for her family, who have endured a wait of more than six years for this. The Honduran authorities must show themselves equal to the task and ensure that the sentence, including its implementation, is in line with the highest human rights standards, ensuring that Berta’s killing does not go unpunished,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.  
“Unfortunately, this process does not end here. Around the world, the wait continues to know the full truth about the killing of Berta Cáceres so that all those responsible can be held accountable. Berta Cáceres’ case must set a precedent for access to justice for human rights defenders in Honduras who continue to lose their lives in order to save our planet.”

Further information 
On 2 March 2016, Berta Cáceres, a courageous defender of the environment and Indigenous rights, was shot dead by armed men in her home in Intibucá, Honduras. She was the coordinator of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH) and campaigned against the Agua Zarca hydroelectric dam project and the impact it would have on the territory of the Lenca Indigenous people.  
Human rights defenders in Honduras continue be attacked with impunity. Killings are the biggest danger faced by environmental defenders in the country, which, according to Global Witness has the world’s second-highest homicide rate per capita. The start of 2022 has been particularly deadly for environmental defenders in Honduras, with two activists found dead in January. 
Amnesty International has also documented threats, including disappearances, targeting environmentalists. Today, the whereabouts of four members of the Garifuna Indigenous community belonging to the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), who have been missing since July 2020, remain unknown. 
Despite the seriousness of the attacks on these defenders, Honduras has not yet signed the Escazú Agreement, the first environmental human rights treaty in Latin America and the Caribbean, which obliges signatory states to protect environmental defenders and entered into force on 22 April 2021.

During a speech, the president accused Madi Jobarteh of being a “troublemaker” who wants to bring violence and burn down the country, and the media of being irresponsible for serving as a platform to Madi Jobarteh. In a society guaranteeing human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, such baseless attacks and accusations against human rights defenders and the media raise serious concern.  
His recent statement has stigmatized Madi Jobarteh’s peaceful activism, and dangerously exacerbated the risks he faces in his personal and professional life, making him the target of threats, harassment and criminalization. Madi Jobarteh has already been threatened online and he faces a real risk of further harassment and physical attacks. There have been several incidents of journalists assaulted by supporters of political parties over the past few years, and these comments about Madi Jobarteh and the media risk adding fuel to the fire.  
Human rights defenders play an essential role in standing up for freedom, opposing discrimination, repression, corruption and promoting social justice across West and Central Africa. Many face the risk of threats, harassment and physical violence by security forces and private actors.

The President’s accusations against Madi Jobarteh were made during his annual meeting with the Banjul Muslim Elders for Koriteh on 2 May 2022 at the State House. Madi Jobarteh was accused of being a troublemaker and bringing violence to the country. These accusations appear to be in response to a social media post Madi Jobarteh made on 20 April. In the post, he called for the removal of the Minister of Lands, Musa Drammeh, because of alleged mismanagement of public lands. A few weeks before this post, the government confirmed some state lands had been allocated to the Vice President, several government ministers as well as private individuals after a leaked document circulated on social media. The government claims to have respected the law in doing so.  
President Barrow’s remarks in the same speech that media are contributing to the destabilization of the country by giving a platform to one of his leading critics, contravenes the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association which are guaranteed under section 25 of the Gambian Constitution. This is not the first time that Madi Jobarteh has faced harassment. On 30 June 2020, he was arrested and charged with false information and broadcasting under section 181A of the Criminal Code. On that occasion, he had stated during a Black Lives Matter protest he had organized that the government failed to investigate the killings of three Gambian citizens by police officers. The charges were dropped the following month.  
After President Adama Barrow assumed power following the election in 2016, he vowed to carry out critical reforms to reverse the repression which characterized the government of former President Yahya Jammeh. Nearly five years later, despite some improvements, things have not changed so positively as expected, including the Gambia legislative landscape which has barely changed.  
Although protection of the right to freedom of expression and other rights have improved since 2016, oppressive Jammeh era laws are still on the statute books such as some sections of the Information and Communications Act of 2009. These laws are still used to oppress human rights defenders, activists, journalists and civil society groups.  
In December 2021, President Adama Barrow won the Presidential elections, becoming President for a second five-year term. This kind of statements, like the one against Madi Jobarteh, are a worrying indicator that the President may question and threaten human rights defenders, media and civil society activists for their legitimate work.

He was sentenced to death in 2017 following a grossly unfair trial that relied on torture-tainted “confessions.” The authorities must halt any plans to execute him and release him immediately.   
Eighteen months ago, on 24 November 2020, Ahmadreza Djalali was told his execution would be carried out in a week which led to international calls to halt Ahmadreza Djalali’s execution. On 2 December 2020 after global interventions, his execution was stopped. From late November 2020 to early April 2021, Ministry of Intelligence agents tortured and otherwise ill-treated Ahmadreza Djalali while he was in incommunicado detention in prolonged solitary confinement in section 209 of Evin prison, which is under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence, including by keeping a bright light on in his cell 24 hrs a day, which he said caused him great mental distress, and forcing him to sleep on the floor on a thin blanket for over five months.   
Ahmadreza Djalali was sentenced to death for “corruption on earth” (efsad-e fel-arz) in October 2017 after a grossly unfair trial before Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. The court relied primarily on “confessions” that Ahmadreza Djalali says were obtained under torture and other ill-treatment while he was held in prolonged solitary confinement without access to a lawyer. Amnesty International has consistently held that the offence of “corruption on earth” fails to meet requirements for clarity and precision needed in criminal law and breaches the principle of legality and legal certainty. On 9 December 2018, his lawyers learned that Branch 1 of the Supreme Court had upheld his death sentence without granting them an opportunity to file their defence submissions on his behalf. The Supreme Court has rejected at least three requests for a judicial review of Ahmadreza Djalali’s case. Ahmadreza Djalali has several health conditions for which he has not receive adequate medical treatment and medication. He underwent surgery on 21 January 2022 for his chronic back pain, but was transferred back to prison just one day afterwards, where he has been forced to again sleep on the floor, leading to worsening back pain.

Salutation: Dear Mr. Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei:  
Additional information  
On 4 May 2022, several major state media outlets in Iran simultaneously published identical articles which stated that according to “informed sources, Ahmadreza Djalali’s death sentence has been taken up for implementation and the sentence shall be carried out, at the very latest, by the end of Ordibehesht [21 May 2022].” These articles were published just days after the prosecution authorities in Sweden sought a sentence of life imprisonment for a former Iranian prison official, Hamid Nouri, for his alleged involvement in Iran’s 1988 prison massacres in which thousands of political dissidents were forcibly disappeared and extrajudicially executed in secret. The media outlets stated that according to “some political analysists… in carrying out the sentence of Ahmadreza Djalali, the government of Iran will not only implement a binding judicial order but also bar the government of Sweden from undertaking further actions similar to the detention of Hamid Nouri.” State media reports in Iran concerning high profile political cases are widely known to be issued in close coordination with the country’s judiciary and its intelligence and security apparatus.     
Ahmadreza Djalali is a medical doctor and academic who was living in Sweden and on a business trip to Iran when he was arbitrarily arrested on 26 April 2016. He was held in Evin prison for seven months in section 209, which is under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence. He was held for three months in prolonged solitary confinement, without access to a lawyer. In a letter written from prison in August 2017, Ahmadreza Djalali said that during this period he was subjected to torture and other ill-treatment in order to force him to “confess” to being a spy. This included threats to execute him, kill or otherwise harm his children, who live in Sweden, and his mother, who lived in Iran and died in 2021. He has said that he was forced to read out “confessions” pre-written by his interrogators in front of a video camera. Ahmadreza Djalali denies the accusations against him and says they have been fabricated by the authorities. In the same letter written from inside prison in August 2017, Ahmadreza Djalali said he was held solely because of his refusal to use his academic ties in European institutions to spy for the Iranian authorities. On 17 December 2018 Iran’s state-run TV aired Ahmadreza Djalali’s “confessions” during a programme titled Axing the root, which used dramatic music, graphics and international news footage interspersed with Ahmadreza Djalali’s “confessions”, along with a voiceover presenting him as a “spy”. By extracting and airing these forced “confessions”, Iranian authorities violated Ahmadreza Djalali’s right to the presumption of innocence as well as the right not to be forced into incriminating himself. Ahmadreza Djalali has since said the broadcast “confessions” were filmed while he was being held in solitary confinement, without access to a lawyer.   
In November 2017, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention called on Iran to release Ahmadreza Djalali immediately and accord him an enforceable right to compensation and other reparations, as he had been detained without an arrest warrant, was only formally charged 10 months after his arrest, and had been “effectively prevented from exercising his right to challenge the lawfulness of his detention”. They also found that his right to a fair trial had been violated so gravely “as to give Mr Djalali’s deprivation of liberty an arbitrary character”.   
Amnesty International has documented a pattern of systematic fair trial rights violations in Iran, beginning from the time of arrest right up until when defendants stand trial. Detainees are often arrested without warrants and held in prolonged solitary confinement in undisclosed locations without access to their families. Individuals detained, investigated and prosecuted are subjected to grossly unfair judicial proceedings, including in cases involving politically motivated charges. Prosecution authorities and interrogators belonging to security and intelligence bodies, including the ministry of intelligence, systematically deny detainees their right to access a lawyer from the time of arrest and during the investigation phase. Torture and other ill-treatment are widespread and systematic, especially during interrogations. Iran’s police, intelligence and security forces, and prison officials have subjected detainees to prolonged solitary confinement, beatings, floggings, suspension, forced administration of chemical substances, electric shocks and sexual violence. Amnesty International has also documented how prison and prosecution authorities have deliberately denied prisoners access to adequate health care and committed violations of the right to life by deliberately denying ailing prisoners lifesaving healthcare and refusing to investigate and ensure accountability for unlawful deaths in custody.  
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty violates the right to life as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Political activist Ebrahim Babaei was forcibly disappeared by Iranian authorities amidst his efforts to flee Iran on 21 December 2021 to escape unjust sentences consisting of imprisonment and flogging. His fate and whereabouts remain concealed from his family and he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.   
Political activist Ebrahim Babaei, 56, remains forcibly disappeared more than four months after attempting to flee Iran, where he faces sentences consisting of imprisonment and flogging, to seek asylum in Turkey. He was in regular contact with family and friends until 21 December 2021, when his messages to them abruptly stopped. Earlier that day, he had told his family and friends that he was in Maku, West Azerbaijan province, and that he would contact them as soon as smugglers informed him that they would start moving towards the border with Turkey. Nobody has heard from him since and the smugglers have given conflicting information about his fate to his family.   
Following his disappearance, his family in Tehran visited Evin prison and the investigation unit of Iran’s police (Agahi) in Tehran to ask about his fate and whereabouts but officials refused to give them any information or to confirm whether or not he was detained. The police in Tehran also refused to file a missing person’s report. It was only after several weeks that a relative based in Miandorud, Mazandaran province, was finally able to file a missing person’s report with the authorities there, providing detailed information about his disappearance, including contact details of the smugglers. Since then, the judicial authorities in Miandorud have transferred the case to their counterparts in Maku, but the authorities have failed to conduct any investigations and have refused to interview the smugglers. Ebrahim Babaei’s family first learned informally from an intelligence official that he is alive. Another intelligence official later told the family informally that he is being held in secret detention places known as “safe houses” (khanehay-e amn), which was corroborated by a third source with close ties to intelligence and security bodies. Despite this, to date, no state body has confirmed his detention and the authorities’ official response to his family’s continued attempts to obtain information about his fate and whereabouts is that they should go away and wait to be contacted by them.   
Amnesty International has previously documented a pattern of dissidents being subjected to enforced disappearance and other crimes and serious human rights violations by intelligence and security forces in “safe houses”, including the systematic use of torture and other ill-treatment to elicit forced “confessions” to secure convictions in unfair trials. Ebrahim Babaei has a long history of activism. He faces a prison and flogging sentence in two separate cases stemming from his peaceful activism, including supporting the campaigning of his daughter, women’s rights activist Shima Babaei, against Iran’s discriminatory, degrading and abusive compulsory veiling laws, for which he received a sentence of 74 lashes. He has several health conditions for which he needs medical treatment and medication, including heart disease, a chronic leg injury and mental health issues.

Additional information  
Following Ebrahim Babaei’s disappearance, smugglers initially told his family that he was in the Turkish city of Van but then, several days later, claimed that he had died in the home of one of the smugglers near Van and that his body was in the custody of the Turkish police who transferred it to a hospital where an autopsy was performed. The smugglers’ final explanation to his daughter Shima Babaei was that he had died in the remote Turkish village of Ozalp, which is around 10 miles from the border with Iran, and that she should go to Ozalp to collect his body. According to the family’s lawyer in Turkey, who followed up with the Turkish authorities to verify these claims, including morgues, hospitals and the security police in Van, the city council and police in Ozalp, as well as Turkish border guards, the Turkish authorities confirmed that they had not received a body matching Ebrahim Babaei’s description during this time period. The Turkish authorities also told the family’s lawyer that, based on their investigations, Ebrahim Babaei never entered Turkey.   
In previous years, Ebrahim Babaei was subjected to years of arbitrary arrest and detention, unfair trial, and torture and other ill-treatment in Iran because of the peaceful exercise of his human rights, including political activism and publicly supporting Shima Babaei’s campaign against Iran’s abusive compulsory veiling laws before she fled Iran in 2018. Ebrahim Babaei was first arrested in Sari, Mazandaran province, on 2 February 1984 and spent 16 months in Sari prison after being convicted of spurious national security-related charges stemming from reading “anti-Islamic Republic” leaflets and being in possession of banned books. Over the following two decades, the authorities summoned him for interrogations on numerous occasions in relation to his political activism and detained him for several hours each time.   
Ebrahim Babaei was rearrested on 7 February 2010 in connection with his peaceful participation in protests that took place in December 2009. He was held in a “safe house” for several days before being transferred to Tehran’s Evin prison, where he was held in prolonged solitary confinement for around four months and was moved between sections 209, 240 and the general ward. His health declined in detention as he was denied the adequate medical care he needed, including for a chronic leg injury sustained during his conscripted military service in the Iran-Iraq war. He was unable to walk unassisted without a walking aid and help from other prisoners. He was released on bail around December 2010. Shortly before his release on bail, he was put on trial before a Revolutionary Court in Tehran for charges related to his peaceful participation in the protests in December 2009. In 2011, while he was still out of prison on bail, he was sentenced to five years, nine months and one day in prison and 74 lashes on charges of “gathering and colluding to commit crimes against national security”, “spreading propaganda against the system” and “disturbing public opinion”. He was rearrested in October 2011 to begin serving his sentence.  He spent part of his prison sentence in “internal exile” in Raja’i Shahr prison in Karaj, Alborz province and the rest of his sentence in Evin prison. His flogging sentence of 74 lashes was carried out on 13 August 2013 in Evin prison. He was released in September 2013 after being granted a pardon in light of his medical conditions.   
While held in Raja’i Shahr prison, he found out that the authorities had opened another case against him, without his knowledge, and had sentenced him in absentia, to a five-year suspended sentence in relation to peaceful acts in prison, including joining other prisoners jailed for political reasons in group hunger strikes and writing joint statements about prison conditions. He was also sentenced to 74 lashes in a separate case in September 2018 in relation to his support of Shima Babaei. In the months before he attempted to flee Iran, Ebrahim Babaei lived in hiding and feared that the authorities were seeking to locate and arrest him and carry out his pending sentences.    
Enforced disappearance is a crime under international law that occurs when someone has been arrested, detained, or abducted by state agents, or people acting with their authorization, support or acquiescence, followed by the refusal to acknowledge this or conceal the person’s fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law. Unofficial secret detention places in Iran fall completely outside the protection of the law and facilitate enforced disappearance and other crimes and human rights violations including torture and other ill-treatment. They are often houses or apartment buildings that are unlawfully repurposed by intelligence and security bodies, most often by the Ministry of Intelligence or the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards, to keep individuals in custody. Such decret detention places are not registered under the Prisons Organization and detainees and their relatives never find out the exact location in which they were held. Security and intelligence officials colloquially refer to them as “safe houses” (khanehay-e amn). The detention of individuals in such facilities has been enabled by a flawed legal framework that fails to establish proper oversight over all prisons and detention centres and ensure that authorities responsible for human rights violations are held to account.

The briefing, ‘He’s Not Coming Back’: War Crimes in Northwest Areas of Kyiv Oblast, is based on dozens of interviews and extensive review of material evidence. Amnesty International documented unlawful air strikes on Borodyanka, and extrajudicial executions in other towns and villages including Bucha, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka and Vorzel. 
An Amnesty International delegation, led by the organization’s Secretary General, has been visiting the region in recent days, speaking with survivors and families of victims, and meeting with senior Ukrainian officials. 
“The pattern of crimes committed by Russian forces that we have documented includes both unlawful attacks and wilful killings of civilians,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“We have met families whose loved ones were killed in horrific attacks, and whose lives have changed forever because of the Russian invasion. We support their demands for justice, and call on the Ukrainian authorities, the International Criminal Court and others to ensure evidence is preserved that could support future war crime prosecutions. 
“It is vital that all those responsible, including up the chain of command, are brought to justice.” 
In Borodyanka, Amnesty International found that at least 40 civilians were killed in disproportionate and indiscriminate attacks, which devastated an entire neighbourhood and left thousands of people homeless. 
In Bucha and several other towns and villages located northwest of Kyiv, Amnesty International documented 22 cases of unlawful killings by Russian forces, most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions. 
During 12 days of investigations, Amnesty International researchers interviewed residents of Bucha, Borodyanka, Novyi Korohod, Andriivka, Zdvyzhivka, Vorzel, Makariv and Dmytrivka, and visited sites of numerous killings. 
In total, they interviewed 45 people who witnessed or had first-hand knowledge of unlawful killings of their relatives and neighbours by Russian soldiers, and 39 others who witnessed or had first-hand knowledge of the air strikes that targeted eight residential buildings. 
On 1 and 2 March, a series of Russian air strikes hit eight residential buildings in the town of Borodyanka, approximately 60 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, which were home to more than 600 families. 
The strikes killed at least 40 residents and destroyed the buildings, as well as dozens of surrounding buildings and houses. Most of the victims were killed in the buildings’ basements, where they had sought shelter. Others died in their apartments.  
On the morning of 2 March, a single strike killed at least 23 people in Building 359 on Tsentralna Street. The victims included five of Vadim Zahrebelny’s relatives: his mother Lydia, his brother Volodymyr and wife Yulia, and her parents Lubov and Leonid Hurbanov. 
Vadim told Amnesty International: “We [Vadim and his son] left Building 359 just after 7am. However, my mother and my brother and his wife and her parents insisted on staying in the basement because they were afraid of getting shot by Russian soldiers if they went out on the streets. About 20 minutes after we left, Building 359 was bombed and they were all killed, together with other neighbours.” 
Vasyl Yaroshenko was close to one of the buildings when it was hit. He said: “I left my apartment to go do some work in the garage, as my wife was about to take a couple of older neighbours down to the basement. When I reached the garage, about 150 metres from the building, there was a huge explosion. I ducked behind the garage. When I looked, I saw a large gap in the building. The whole middle section of the building had collapsed – exactly where residents were sheltering in the basement. My wife Halina was among those killed. I still see her by the door of our apartment, the home where we lived for 40 years.” 
On 1 March, a series of air strikes targeted six other buildings nearby. At least seven people were killed in Building 371 on Tsentralna Street, including Vitali Smishchuk, a 39-year-old surgeon, his wife Tetiana, and their four-year-old daughter Yeva. 
Vitali’s mother Ludmila told Amnesty International: “As the situation deteriorated, it became too dangerous to move from one part of the town to another. There were tanks on the streets… People were frightened to be outside. 
“I was speaking to my son and telling him to leave, but he was worried about going outside. They sheltered in the basement for safety – but the bomb destroyed the middle section of the building, where the basement was.” 
No fixed Ukrainian military targets are known to have been located at or around any of the buildings which were struck, though at times armed individuals supporting Ukrainian forces reportedly fired on passing Russian military vehicles from or near some of those buildings. Knowingly launching direct attacks on civilian objects or disproportionate attacks constitute war crimes. 
Amnesty International has created a new interactive 360-degree representation of the extensive damage caused by the air strikes in Borodyanka, which can be viewed here. 
The town of Bucha, approximately 30 kilometres northwest of Kyiv, was occupied by Russian forces in late February. Five men were killed in apparent extrajudicial executions by Russian forces in a compound of five buildings set around a courtyard close to the intersection of Yablunska and Vodoprovidna streets, all between 4 and 19 March. 
Yevhen Petrashenko, a 43-year-old sales manager and father-of-two, was shot dead in his apartment on Yablunska Street on 4 March. 
Yevhen’s wife Tatiana told Amnesty International that she was in their building’s basement, while Yevhen had remained in their apartment. He had gone to help a neighbour when Russian soldiers were conducting door-to-door searches. Tatiana lost contact with Yevhen, whose body was then found in his apartment by a neighbour the next day. 
At her request, Russian soldiers allowed Tatiana to visit the apartment. She said: “Yevhen was lying dead in the kitchen. He had been shot in the back, [near his] lungs and liver. His body remained in the apartment until 10 March, when we were able to bury him in a shallow grave in the courtyard.” 
Amnesty International researchers found two bullets and three cartridge cases at the scene of the killing. The organization’s weapons investigator identified the bullets as black-tipped 7N12 armour-piercing 9x39mm rounds that can only be fired by specialized rifles used by some elite Russian units, including units reported to have been operating in Bucha during this time. 
A collection of Russian military papers recovered in Bucha, which Amnesty International researchers analysed, gives further indications as to the units involved. They included conscription and training records belonging to a driver-mechanic of the 104th Regiment of the VDV, the Russian Airborne Forces. Notably, some VDV units are equipped with specialized rifles that fire the armour-piercing 9x39mm round. 
On 22 or 23 March, Leonid Bodnarchuk, a 44-year-old construction worker who lived in the same building as Yevhen Petrashenko, was also killed. Residents who were sheltering in the basement told Amnesty International that Russian soldiers shot Leonid as he was walking up the stairs, then threw a grenade into the stairwell. They later found his maimed body slumped in a pool of blood on the stairs. 
Amnesty International researchers found large blood stains over several steps on the stairs leading to the basement, as well as burn marks and a pattern of damage on the wall consistent with a grenade explosion. 
In neighbouring towns and villages, Amnesty International collected further evidence and testimony of unlawful killings, including apparent extrajudicial executions: some victims had their hands tied behind their back, while others showed signs of being tortured. 
In the village of Novyi Korohod, Viktor Klokun, a 46-year-old construction worker, was killed. Olena Sakhno, his partner, told Amnesty International that some villagers brought her Viktor’s body on 6 March. She said: “His hands were tied behind his back with a piece of white plastic, and he had been shot in the head.” 
Oleksii Sychevky’s wife Olha, 32, and father Olexandr, 62, were killed when the car convoy they were travelling in was fired upon by what they believed were Russian forces. 
Oleksii told Amnesty International: “The convoy was all fleeing civilians. Almost all of the cars had kids inside. When our car had just reached a line of trees, I heard shots – first single shots, then a burst of gunfire. 
“The shots hit the first vehicle in the convoy, and it stopped. We were the second vehicle and we had to stop, too. Then we were hit. At least six or seven shots hit our car. My dad was killed instantly by a bullet to the head. My wife was hit by metal shrapnel, and my kid [son] was also hit.” 
Amnesty International researchers who visited Bucha, Borodyanka and other nearby towns and villages in April, after victims had been exhumed (either from the rubble of collapsed buildings, or from the shallow, temporary graves in which many had been buried), found that many family members were unhappy with treatment of victims’ remains. Family members were concerned that the processing of remains was chaotic, that they were not kept properly informed, and that remains in some cases were not being correctly identified. 
Extrajudicial executions committed in international armed conflicts constitute wilful killings, which are war crimes. Indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks carried out with criminal intent are also war crimes. 
All those responsible for war crimes should be held criminally responsible for their actions. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, hierarchal superiors – including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers and heads of state – who knew or had reason to know about war crimes committed by their forces, but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible, should also be held criminally responsible. 
Any justice processes or mechanisms should be as comprehensive as possible, and ensure that all perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression in Ukraine, from all parties to the conflict, are brought to justice in fair trials, without recourse to the death penalty. In addition, the rights of victims must be at the forefront of investigating and prosecuting international crimes, and all justice mechanisms should adopt a survivor-centred approach. 
Amnesty International’s documentation of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed during the war in Ukraine is available here. 
Right now, people in Ukraine are facing a catastrophic human rights crisis. People are dying, including children, and many thousands of lives are at risk. Take action to demand that the Russian authorities stop this act of aggression and protect civilians now.

In 2016, she left Chechnya for Ukraine taking her toddler son to flee from political persecution. They lived in Ukraine until early March 2022, when they were forced to flee Russia’s invasion. Amina Gerikhanova was detained at the Romanian border based on Russia’s extradition request and separated from her eight-year-old son. On 18 April, the Suceava Court of Appeal authorized Amina Gerikhanova’s extradition to Russia. Her appeal on that decision is pending. If extradited, Amina Gerikhanova will face a real risk of torture or other ill-treatment. The Romanian authorities must reject the extradition request and grant her international protection.  
On 13 March, Amina crossed the Romanian border fleeing from the violence resulting from the Russian invasion, along with millions of other refugees. She was arrested at the Romanian border based on a Russian extradition request, and her eight-year-old son was temporarily placed in an orphanage. On 18 April, the Suceava Court of Appeal authorized her extradition to Russia, subject to the impending final decision by the High Court of Cassation and Justice. Instead of finding safety and protection, Amina Gerikhanova has been detained in prison in Suceava for over a month and separated from her son for whom she is the sole caregiver.  
Russian authorities have accused Amina Gerikhanova of participating in military operations in Syria, however these charges appear to be baseless. During the time when she allegedly was in Syria, she was peacefully living in Ukraine for over five years without any criminal charges brought against her.  
Even prior to the Russia–Ukraine war, Amnesty International received regular reports of enforced disappearances, torture and other ill-treatment from Chechnya, and has documented a number of such cases over the past years.

Additional information  
Amina Gerikhanova is a Chechen woman who has been living in Ukraine since 2016, where she fled with her young son after facing political persecution in Chechnya. Amina Gerikhanova grew up without her mother who was shot by Russian soldiers in the Novye Aldy massacre in 2000. She is a single mother who has been raising her son alone. Russian authorities have accused her of participating in military operations in Syria as part of ISIS from 2016–2018, even though she was living in Ukraine during this time and did not leave Ukrainian territory. Upon her arrival in Ukraine, the Ukrainian Prosecution Office received an extradition request from Russia, investigated it, and denied Amina Gerikhanova’s extradition. On 13 March, she crossed the Romanian border fleeing from the Russian invasion along with millions of other refugees. She was arrested at the Romanian border based on Russia’s extradition request, and her eight-year-old son was temporarily placed into an orphanage. Subsequently, her son was retrieved from the orphanage by a wheelchair-bound great uncle. On 5 April, the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation sent to Romania an official extradition request. On 18 April, a Romanian court authorised Amina Gerikhanova’s extradition to Russia, subject to appeal. To date, she has been detained in prison in Suceava. She is at imminent threat of extradition to Russia where she would be at real risk of torture and other ill-treatment.  
In similar cases, Chechen refugees who have been returned to Russia were subjected to enforced disappearance, confirming the risk of torture and other ill-treatment. After the start of the Russia–Ukraine war and expulsion of Russia from the Council of Europe, Russia is no longer bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and ethnic Chechens forcibly returned to Russia are at even greater risk. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the human rights situation in Russia has sharply deteriorated and there are even fewer guarantees that the rights of those who are extradited or deported will be respected.  
Amnesty International regularly addresses cases of forcible returns or planned forcible returns to the Russian Federation of ethnic Chechens and others who have fled from the North Caucasus. These cases include forcible returns from member states of the Council of Europe, including France, Hungary and Poland. An internal flight alternative elsewhere in the territory of the Russian Federation is not available to former asylum seekers from Chechnya. The internal flight alternative is not a viable alternative to international protection for those people because the real risk of persecution or other forms of serious harm they face emanates from the federal state authorities and therefore applies in Chechnya and across the territory of the Russian Federation.  
Returning Amina Gerikhanova to a country where her life and safety are at risk would be a clear breach of Romania’s obligations under international human rights law and standards which enshrine the absolute ban on torture and other ill-treatment. This includes a prohibition on sending anyone to a place where they would be at risk of such abuse, regardless of their alleged offence (the principle of non-refoulement). The principle of non-refoulement applies to everyone including persons who are excluded from refugee protection and persons who are suspected of having committed a crime. The European Court of Human Rights has categorically concluded that balancing the risk of harm to the person if removed from the country against the danger a person allegedly presents to the community if not sent back is misconceived and unlawful.

On 25 April, civil society leader Osman Kavala, who has been imprisoned on pretrial detention since November 2017, was convicted for “attempting to overthrow the government” and sentenced to aggravated life in prison; his seven co-defendants each received a sentence of 18 years, allegedly for aiding Osman Kavala and were immediately remanded in prison. Amnesty International calls on the Chief Prosecutor for the Istanbul Regional Appeals Court to support and not to oppose any application or request of Osman Kavala, Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Tayfun Kahraman, and Hakan Altınay all currently in prison while they appeal their unjust convictions.     
Osman Kavala, Mücella Yapıcı, Çiğdem Mater, Mine Özerden, Can Atalay, Tayfun Kahraman, and Hakan Altınay were convicted on 25 April 2022 in the prosecution dubbed the ‘Gezi trial’. Osman Kavala has spent more than 4.5 years in pre-trial detention. In handing down the guilty verdicts, the court also ordered the remand of six other defendants. A warrant for the arrest of Yiğit Ali Ekmekçi, the eighth defendant, has been issued.   
Osman Kavala received an aggravated life sentence for ‘attempting to overthrow the government’ but was acquitted of the ‘political and military espionage’ charge for which he has been in pre-trial detention since February 2020. The acquittal was due to ‘lack of evidence’ after, along with the other seven defendants, he had already been acquitted in the first trial.   
The other seven defendants were convicted for allegedly aiding Osman Kavala and sentenced to 18 years in prison each. The Court ordered their immediate remand on grounds that they are a flight risk.  
Throughout the first and the second trial, the prosecuting authorities failed to present any evidence that would prove the defendants’ guilt of the alleged charges, a fact that was acknowledged in the verdict by one of the three judges who stated in his dissenting opinion that ‘because there is no concrete, certain and believable evidence that would prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, [the court] should rule for the acquittal of the defendants.’

Additional information  
Osman Kavala has spent more than 4.5 years in pre-trial detention under three separate charges since he was first detained in November 2017: attempting to overthrow the constitutional order (Article 309 of the Turkish Penal Code (TPC), in relation to allegations linking him to the 2016 failed coup); attempting to overthrow the government (Article 312 of the TPC in relation to his alleged role in the mass 2013 Gezi Park protests); and political and military espionage (Article 328 of the TPC, also relating to allegations that he had played a role in the failed coup).  The Gezi Park trial in which 16 defendants were indicted began in June 2019. Kavala was accused of financing the protests and organizing them with two of his co-defendants (charged under article 312). Six other people faced a range of other charges. On 18 February 2020, the trial ended with nine defendants acquitted of all the charges, the case against the remaining seven was separated due to their absence during the trial. The court also ordered Osman Kavala’s immediate release from prison, but the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor issued a separate detention order. Osman Kavala was first taken into police detention and returned to prison the next day, having been remanded under Article 309, on charges alleging that he had played a role in the 2016 coup attempt. In March 2020, the charges were changed to ‘political and military espionage’, which allowed the authorities to continue to detain him. Pre-trial detention under a particular criminal charge cannot exceed two years unless an indictment is accepted by a court.   
In January 2021, the Istanbul regional appeals court overturned the acquittals of Osman Kavala and eight others, and a retrial began in May 2021. In the meantime, acquittals in another case related to the Gezi Park protests — the Carsi trial involving 35 football supporters – were also overturned on appeal. The two prosecutions were merged in a legally questionable process over the summer of 2021. The merged, mass trial of 52 defendants began in October 2021. In February 2022, a fourth hearing took place soon after the formal start of the infringement proceedings at the Council of Europe (CoE) for non-implementation of the Kavala ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), after which the cases were again separated on request of the trial prosecutor. The sixth and final hearing concluded on 25 April 2022.  
This politically motivated prosecution and concomitant unjust sentences exemplify how executive control and political influence over the judiciary in Turkey have become widespread and systematic. Courts routinely accept bogus indictments in order to detain and convict individuals and groups that the government regards as political opponents, in the absence of compelling – or any- evidence of criminal activity, particularly in the context of the attempted coup in July 2016.  
The April 2022 conviction was handed down in the absence of any credible evidence to substantiate the charges levelled against Osman Kavala and his co-defendants. This is the latest stark example of the chronic lack of independence of the judiciary in Turkey. The ECtHR, in its December 2019 ruling, found that the Turkish authorities had violated not only Osman Kavala’s right to liberty and security, but that they had the ulterior purpose of silencing him and dissuading other human rights defenders from carrying out legitimate activities.   
Despite the decision in February 2022 by the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers to formally initiate an infringement procedure because of Turkey’s refusal to comply with the ECtHR ruling and immediately release Osman Kavala, Turkey sentenced Kavala to life in prison without parole. As a member state of the Council of Europe, Turkey has the obligation to implement the binding judgments of the Court. Its continued refusal to implement this ECtHR ruling should sound an alarm about the Turkish judiciary’s lack of adherence to international and European human rights and rule of law standards.

At the time of being charged, she was the vice-chair of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China (the Alliance), the organizer of the annual Hong Kong vigil commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown since 1990. Chow Hang-tung was exercising her fundamental human right of freedom of expression through peaceful means, and charges against her must be dropped and they must be released immediately.  
The Hong Kong government claimed on many occasions, including to the UN in the reply to the list of issues in relation to the periodic report of the implementation of the ICCPR in Hong Kong, that freedoms including freedom of assembly and expression may be restricted for the protection of ‘national security’. However, the prosecution of Chow and other activists who peacefully exercised these rights violates international human rights laws and standards. Such standards specifically state that governments cannot restrict these freedoms on the grounds of national security unless their exercise constitutes the use or credible threat of force that threatens a state’s existence or territorial integrity.   
The national security police used the vigil and other peaceful activism of the Hong Kong Alliance as evidence of endangering national security. Demanding justice and remembering victims of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown are peaceful expressions that cannot be restricted under the pretext of national security.

For three decades, the Hong Kong Alliance organized the world’s biggest commemoration of the Tiananmen crackdown, which took place on the evening of 3–4 June 1989, when hundreds – possibly thousands – of people were killed in Beijing when troops opened fire on students and workers who had for months been peacefully calling for political and economic reforms as well as an end to corruption. Thousands across China were also arrested and imprisoned for participating in the demonstrations. Every year on 4 June since 1990, tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of people joined a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong’s Victoria Park to remember those killed. They called on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and take accountability for the fatalities. For the past two years, the vigil was banned on Covid-19 grounds. Before the Hong Kong candlelight vigil was banned in 2020, it was the only large-scale commemoration of the Tiananmen crackdown that took place in the country.   
On 8 September 2021, Chow and three former leaders of the Alliance, Simon Leung Kam-wai, Tang Ngok-kwan and Chan Dor-wai, were arrested after they refused to comply with the authorities’ request to submit information about the Alliance’s members, staff, and partner organizations. Another former leader Tsui Hon-kwong was arrested two days after.  
On 9 September 2021, the Alliance, along with Chow Hang-tung and prominent veteran politicians Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan, were charged with “inciting subversion”. At the time of being charged, Chow was the vicechair of the Alliance.  
Following the initiation of prosecutions against core members and increasing pressure from the government, the Hong Kong Alliance disbanded on 25 September 2021.  
On 29 September 2021, the National Security Department informed the Hong Kong Alliance that its assets, including bank accounts and a property, were frozen under the Implementing Rules of Article 43 of national security law. On 26 October 2021, the Chief Executive ordered the Hong Kong Alliance be removed from Companies Register because the Alliance’s work, including organizing peaceful assemblies, undermines the Central governments’ “ability to safeguard national security and to maintain public safety and order”.   
The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (NSL) was unanimously passed by China’s National People’s Congress Standing Committee and enacted in Hong Kong on 30 June 2020 without any formal, meaningful public or other local consultation. The impact of the NSL has been immediate and sweeping. The law’s expansive definition of “national security”, which follows that of the Chinese central authorities, lacks clarity and legal predictability and has been used arbitrarily as a pretext to restrict the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, among others, and to repress dissent and political opposition. By accusing political parties, academics and other organizations and individuals actually or perceived to be critical of the present government and political system in Hong Kong of threatening national security, the authorities have sought to justify censorship, harassment, arrests and prosecutions that violate human rights. The overly broad definitions of the National Security Law have given the authorities free rein to silent dissent and crack down on civil society organizations. The Hong Kong government increasingly criminalizes the work of civil society organizations, accusing local and overseas activists and groups who form international partnerships or do peaceful international activism of “colluding with foreign forces”.   
Chow Hang-tung is a long-term human rights defender. Prior to becoming a human rights lawyer, she was an advocate for labour rights and human rights defenders in China. As a barrister in Hong Kong, she has defended political activists targeted by the National Security Law. On 13 December 2021, Chow was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for taking part in an unauthorized assembly after joining a peaceful candlelight vigil commemorating the Tiananmen crackdown on 4 June 2020. On 4 January 2022, she received a 15-month prison sentence in a second conviction on the charge of “inciting others to take part in an unauthorised assembly” after she published a social media post asking people to commemorate the Tiananmen crackdown on 4 June 2021.

Authorities and companies in Ecuador threaten the Amazon through legislation, policies and extractive projects – mainly oil and mining – that have not obtained the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous Peoples or that have affected their territories, environment, health, water or food, Amnesty International said today, as it released the report Ecuador: Amazon at Risk. 
“Ecuador must guarantee the consent of Indigenous Peoples to legislation, policies and projects that may put their existence at risk. The Amazon is also a critical ecosystem for overcoming the climate crisis that threatens all life on our planet, and Indigenous Peoples have protected it for centuries. We cannot turn our backs on them,” said Fernanda Doz Costa, deputy director of research for the Americas at Amnesty International. 
Ecuador must guarantee the consent of Indigenous Peoples to legislation, policies and projects that may put their existence at risk. The Amazon is also a critical ecosystem for overcoming the climate crisis that threatens all life on our planet, and Indigenous Peoples have protected it for centuries. We cannot turn our backs on them. 
In this regard, the organization welcomed the victory of the A’i Cofán community of Sinangoe before the Constitutional Court on 27 January 2022. In its ruling, which has not yet been complied with by the relevant authorities, the Court confirmed that the state had violated the community’s “rights to prior consultation, to nature, to water, to a healthy environment, to culture and to territory” by granting 20 mining concessions without their consent and processing 32 others that affected their territory. In addition, the Court ordered comprehensive reparation measures for the community. 
In addition, the authorities have yet to promptly, thoroughly, and impartially investigate the oil spills that occurred on 7 April 2020 and 28 January 2022 in the Amazon, establish the relevant administrative and criminal responsibilities, and guarantee truth, justice and reparation for the affected communities. 
This year the Constitutional Court is expected to rule on the sentences issued in the case of the oil spill of 7 April 2020, and on the extraordinary protection action filed by the affected communities. 
In this report – presented in the context of Ecuador’s Universal Periodic Review before the UN Human Rights Council this year – Amnesty International also analyses the excessive restrictions in the law regulating abortion in cases of rape; the lack of a policy to protect human rights defenders and investigate attacks and threats against them; and impunity for human rights violations committed during the protests of October 2019.

“Overturning Roe vs. Wade would not only be the outcome of decades of hateful campaign against women’s rights; it would also be deeply racist and classist. Women of color and poor women would be disproportionately affected by any decision to end safe and legal abortion. If it overturns Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court would be demonstrating complete disregard for extensive evidence of the life-threatening implications of the criminalization of abortion and the consequential number of deaths resulting from recourse to unsafe abortion. Such a decision would thus constitute a violation of the right to life and the prohibition of torture. 
“While moves to decriminalize and legalize abortion in places like Argentina, Ireland, Mexico and Colombia in the last few years have been a huge win for the global community, there are grim signs that the United States is out of step with the progress that the rest of the world is making in protecting sexual and reproductive rights. We fervently call on the US authorities to protect the right to legal and safe abortion. Anything less would be a gross failure to uphold human rights, including the rights to life, health, bodily autonomy, privacy and dignity. 
Any regression in protection of the right to abortion would not only stand to damage the global perception of the United States; it would also set a terrible example that other governments and anti-rights groups could seize upon around the world in a bid to deny the rights of women, girls and other people who can become pregnant. Overturning Roe vs. Wade would become the symbol of a major backlash all over the world, putting recent progress at risk and endangering the health and lives of millions.”

Huang Qi, founder and director of Sichuan-based human rights website “64 Tianwang”, has had no access to his family since 2020, and his health has significantly deteriorated and is at risk of worsening further. It has been reported that Huang has not been able to access proper medical care recently especially during the period when the pandemic has intensified in China. He has also been unable to access the account where his friends and family deposited money for him to purchase additional supplies. Detained since 2016, Huang was able to see his mother only once on 17 September 2020 through a video call. The authorities must ensure that Huang has access to immediate and proper medical care and allow him to speak with his family and lawyers of his choice.   
Huang Qi (黄琦) is a human rights defender who is currently serving a 12-year sentence in Sichuan Bazhong Prison for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression. Huang was known to suffer from chronic kidney disease and hydrocephalus, as well as other conditions affecting his heart and lungs, before being detained.  Huang’s mother, Pu Wenqing is currently under heavy surveillance and cannot meet with her son. Pu, 89 years old, has repeatedly requested the authorities to allow her to visit Huang, but none of these requests have been granted. The last time she spoke with Huang was through a video call on 17 September 2020. Pu’s health has also been deteriorating rapidly, and she fears she might not be able to speak to Huang again.

Additional information  
Huang Qi founded “64 Tianwang” together with his then wife, Zeng Li, in 1998, and the website continues to publish reports of the human right violations investigated by citizen journalists in China. Huang Qi was charged with “intentionally leaking state secrets” (故意泄露国家秘密罪) and “providing state secrets to a foreign entity” (为境外非法提供情报罪) by the Mianyang City Intermediate People’s Court on 29 July 2019.    
Huang Qi was first taken away in 2016 and has reported incidents of ill-treatment throughout his detention. On 23 October 2018, he told his lawyer that doctors and detention centre officers provided false reports of his blood pressure and understated the extent of his critical medical conditions. Prior to that, on 28 July 2017, Huang Qi told his lawyer that he was made to stand for hours at a time and was repeatedly questioned and insulted by officers since his detention in late 2016. On 3 November 2017 he also shared that he had been beaten up by other detainees at the Mianyang City Detention Centre, Sichuan Province, on 24-26 October, with the knowledge of at least one of the detention centre’s officers.   
Over the years, Huang Qi and other “64 Tianwang” contributors have been frequently detained or harassed by the Chinese authorities. Huang Qi has been put on trial and sentenced to terms of imprisonment twice. He was detained in June 2000 – the 11th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown – before being convicted of “inciting subversion of state power” and sentenced to five years in prison in May 2003. He was again imprisoned for three years after exposing the substandard building scandal following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan.   
In addition, lawyers who have worked on Huang Qi’s case have also faced harassment and intimidation by the authorities. In February 2018, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Justice notified Guangzhou-based lawyer Sui Muqing that he was being disbarred. The lawyer, who had previously represented Huang Qi, believes his disbarment was related to his legal representation of human rights defenders. Another of Huang Qi’s lawyers, Liu Zhengqing, was also disbarred in January 2019.  
There is an alarming pattern of deaths of imprisoned Chinese activists, either in detention or after being belatedly released on medical parole. In July 2017, human rights activist and Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody after the authorities refused his and his family’s requests to receive treatment abroad for his cancer. The same year, Chinese writer and government critic Yang Tongyan (pen name Yang Tianshui) died three months after being released on medical parole and undergoing an operation to remove a brain tumour. Beijing activist and prominent campaigner Cao Shunli died from organ failure after months in custody in March 2014. She was denied appropriate medical treatment while in jail.

On 23 February 2022, the Ambon High Court rejected their appeal and upheld the lower court’s guilty verdict. Amnesty International is calling on President Widodo to immediately and unconditionally release them, as they have been targeted for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly.  
The three activists were convicted of violating Article 106 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP). Prior to their appeal submission, they were arbitrarily arrested on 8 April 2021 and charged with treason. On 28 December 2021, the District Court found them guilty of treason. They have been punished simply for their affiliation with the RMS and expressing their opinion, as guaranteed by Article 19 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Indonesia has also ratified.

Additional information  
On 7 April 2021, as many as twenty fully armed soldiers raided Alexsander Workala’s house. Upon finding a book and the “Benang Raja”, a flag of the Republic of South Maluku (RMS), Alexsander was taken by the troops to the West Seram (SBB) Police. At the police station, Alexsander received a beating to his head. That same night he was questioned, and he confessed to being an activist of the Republic of South Maluku (RMS) and that he got the flag from Pieter Likumahua. The police accused him of treason.   
The next day, 8 April 2021, the police came to Pieter’s house to question him related to Alexsander’s case. However, after one night of investigation, Pieter was named a suspect and detained at the SBB police prison. Benjamin Naene, who accompanied Pieter, was also arrested and detained after confessing to the police that he is an activist of the RMS. Both were charged with treason.     
On 30 June 2021, the police informed the lawyer that Pieter’s detention time would be prolonged until 6 August for the sake of investigation. On 19 August 2021, the trial of Pieter, Alexsander, and Benjamin started at Dataran Hunipopu District Court. During the trial period from August to December 2021, the three activists were detained in West Seram Prison. On 28 December 2021, the judges found the three activists guilty of treason. Pieter was sentenced to three years and three months in prison, while Alexsander and Benjamin were sentenced to three years in prison.   
On 4 January 2022, Pieter, Alexsander, and Benjamin sent an appeal to the Ambon High Court. On 23 February 2022, the Ambon High Court rejected their appeal and upheld the District Court’s guilty verdict. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, geographical situation, and the absence of lawyers, Pieter, Alexsander, and Benjamin missed the deadline to appeal for cassation to the Supreme Court, thus they were legally deemed to have accepted the High Court’s decision.  
The “treason” (makar) articles in the Criminal Code are so broad that they are widely used by the Indonesian government to silence critics and activists. The treason articles in the Indonesian Criminal Code were adopted from those in the Dutch Colonial Criminal Code, which had the purpose to silence critics and pro-independence activists during the colonial era. Now, the same articles have been used by the Indonesian government to imprison political activists in Maluku and Papua.  
The Indonesian authorities have used the criminal code provisions, mainly Articles 106 and 110 KUHP, to prosecute pro-independence political activists in Maluku and Papua simply for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Since 2007, dozens Mollucans have been charged with “treason” (makar) under articles 106 and 110 of the Indonesian Criminal Code (KUHP).   
Amnesty International does not take any position on the political status of any province or region in Indonesia, or any other state, including calls for independence. However, the organization believes that the right to freedom of expression also includes expression of political nature.

In response to the news that the unjust six-month sentence of human rights defender and environmental lawyer Steven Donziger has been completed on 25 April 2022, Daniel Joloy, senior policy advisor at Amnesty International, said: 
“We are relieved that Steven Donziger will finally recover his freedom after almost 1,000 days of arbitrary detention, which included 45 days in prison and over 900 days under house arrest. He should have never been detained for even one day, as it has been clear the whole process against him has been in retaliation for his human rights work that exposed corporate wrongdoings”.  
He should have never been detained for even one day, as it has been clear the whole process against him has been in retaliation for his human rights work that exposed corporate wrongdoings.  
“Unfortunately, the end of this sentence does not mean the end of the injustices Steven has faced. The US government must fully implement the decision of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, including launching an impartial and independent investigation into the circumstances that led to Steven’s arbitrary detention, to prevent something like this from happening again, and to swiftly enact anti-SLAPP laws to protect those brave enough to call out corporate crimes. Corporations must not be allowed to continue abusing the US justice system to silence and intimidate human rights defenders or anyone else exposing their wrongdoing.” 
Background 
Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP) are legal cases brought or threatened to be brought, with the intention of silencing or intimidating public participation. SLAPP suits often target journalists, human rights defenders, civil society organizations, activists or academics with the aim of silencing them and deterring other critical voices. SLAPP suits are not necessarily aimed at protecting the honour or reputation of an individual or a corporation, but rather to intimidate, tire and deplete the financial and psychological resources of their target. The cost of fighting these legal actions can put extreme financial and other pressure on human rights activists forcing them to repurpose the already limited funds and resources from their work to defend the lawsuit. The litigation is often also successful in diverting the attention from the environmental or human rights issue to the legal defamation case itself.

Governments across Latin America and the Caribbean must urgently ramp up spending on the right to social protection and health in order to tackle the region’s obscene socio-economic inequality that has proven fatal during the Covid pandemic, said Amnesty International and the Center for Economic and Social Rights (CESR) in a new joint report released today. 
Unequal and Lethal: Five key actions to recover from the human rights crisis unleashed by the pandemic in Latin America and the Caribbean explains the factors behind the region’s disproportionate death toll from Covid compared to other parts of the world. With only 8.4% of the world’s population, the region has endured 28% of total global deaths due to COVID-19. The report finds that those countries with the highest inequality and lowest public spending on health and social protection suffered most during the pandemic, with the most devasting impacts on historically marginalized groups. 
A human rights-based rethink of economic policies is key to avoiding future calamities in what is, by many measures, the world’s most unequal region. Despite the staggering inequality and poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean, over the last decades governments have failed to collect sufficient tax revenues and to do so in a way that combats inequality, even during times of economic boom. This has inevitably resulted in meagre spending on healthcare services and social protection – including unemployment, pensions and childcare support – which are vital for a life of dignity and to truly uphold human rights for all.  
“Governments have the obligation to proactively mobilize the resources needed to protect their populations from the worst impacts of discrimination, disease and economic disaster. If Latin American countries had done this in the decades before the pandemic, the region could have avoided so much pain and loss of life,” said Kate Donald, Acting Executive Director of CESR. “Now is their chance to prevent the next inequality-induced disaster and make the shift towards a rights-based economy.” 
Countries such as Mexico, Brazil and Peru, where the richest 1% of the population hoards over 30% of national wealth, have recorded the highest numbers of Covid deaths in the region proportional to their populations. Chile, where the richest 20% of the population takes home 10 times more income than the poorest 20%, also has one of the region’s highest death rates per capita. 
While many Latin American countries provided cash transfers during the pandemic, none of them expanded health insurance nor took sufficient action to implement universal social security mechanisms and expand coverage to ensure the most disadvantaged people were covered. 
The impact of these shortcomings across the region fell most severely on women, who lost jobs at a higher rate than men and whose disproportionate role in caring for children and family continues to affect their unequal enjoyment of rights – even more so if they are Indigenous or of African descent. 
“Being born with a certain skin colour or growing up in a certain postcode should not determine your chances of dying of infectious diseases like Covid. Two years into the pandemic, governments in Latin America have still not caught on to the urgency of implementing a human rights-based approach to recovering from the pandemic and tackling inequality,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“Promoting equality does not mean treating everyone in the same way. Latin America’s present situation is the result of hundreds of years of colonial injustices that mean certain groups have been historically and systematically denied their rights. As countries recover from the pandemic governments need to address this head on by adopting a substantive equality approach and affirmative action measures.” 
Although the Pan American Health Organization calls for a minimum of 6% of GDP to be spent on health in order to ensure universal coverage, nearly all the countries in the region spend far less on public health services, which means that they do not have enough hospital beds, doctors or nurses to effectively deal with Covid-19 or other health crises. In Peru, for example, in the decade prior to the pandemic, authorities failed to increase public spending on health despite years of sustained economic growth, only investing 3.3% of its GDP. Meanwhile in Mexico, over 15 million people lost access to health coverage in the two years before the pandemic, due to bureaucratic inefficiencies in government health policies. 
In Chile, taxes and social security contributions only account for half of spending on healthcare, with the other half coming from patients through mandatory prepayment fees and voluntary and out-of-pocket expenses. Chile’s per capita public spending on health represents just a third of the OECD average, and it has half as many hospital beds per 1,000 inhabitants as the OECD average. 
Even when they have adequate policies in theory, governments stumble on implementation, with a key barrier often being the failure to generate sufficient fiscal resources to make them effective. Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean generally collect less revenue from taxes than others with similar levels of development in different parts of the world. In 2019, the region only collected on average 22% of its GDP in taxes, compared to 33% for OECD countries. 
Moreover, many have regressive taxation systems with taxes that do not ask enough from those most able to pay, thus undermining their resources to overcome inequality and redistribute wealth. For example, Latin American countries depend heavily on indirect taxes – which are more regressive as they represent a larger burden for poorer sections of the population – and collect very little from wealth taxes which target economic elites. 
“Without boldly facing the need to tax more and tax better – as is their human rights obligation – countries in Latin America will continue to be dragged down by a malaise of socio-economic inequality, favouring a rich elite while harming society as a whole,” said Kate Donald.

Thirty days after El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly approved a state of emergency in the country in response to reports of rising gang-related killings, and in light of the renewal of this measure on Sunday, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International said: 
“Over the last 30 days, President Bukele’s government has trampled all over the rights of the Salvadoran people. From legal reforms that flout international standards, to mass arbitrary arrests and the ill treatment of detainees, Salvadoran authorities have created a perfect storm of human rights violations, which is now expected to continue with the extension of the emergency decree.  
“The government of El Salvador must stop its hostile posturing against civil society and the international community, and take stock of the appalling effects its policies are having on human rights. 
“In El Salvador today, children aged between 12 and 16 are subject to prison sentences of up to 10 years, people from poor and marginalized communities can be arbitrarily arrested without the right to legal defense, prisoners can be held without sufficient food or fresh air, and journalists can be jailed merely for reporting on gang-related activity.  
“The government must stop its hostile posturing against civil society and the international community and take stock of the appalling effects its policies are having on human rights. 
“We call upon the international community to help avert a nascent human rights crisis in El Salvador, and on authorities in the country to cease abuses and ensure independent investigations into human rights violations that have already occurred.” 
Background 
On 27 March, El Salvador’s Legislative Assembly approved a state of emergency at the request of President Nayib Bukele, following reports of a spike in gang-related killings over the preceding weekend. 
The emergency decree suspends certain fundamental rights – which, according to international law, should not be derogated under any circumstances – including the right to legal defense, and the right to be informed of the reasons behind a detention, among others. 
On 30 March, the Legislative Assembly approved further measures, including the establishment of indefinite time periods for pretrial detention; the ability to try people accused of crimes in absentia – that is without their presence in court; the ability to sentence minors aged between 12 and 16 to up to 10 years in prison for gang-related crimes; and the establishment of prison sentences for those who “directly or indirectly benefit from relationships of any nature” with gangs – a vaguely worded provision that does not meet the requirements of international law. Other measures that do not comply with international standards were also approved. 
On 5 April, the Legislative Assembly again approved concerning reforms to the country’s Criminal Code, establishing prison sentences for all those that reproduce content supposedly originated by gangs. This vaguely worded provision raised fears of censorship and criminalization of journalists who report on gang-related violence in El Salvador. 
According to President Bukele, as of 25 April 2022 – 30 days after the start of the state of emergency – at least 17,000 people had been arrested in the context of the measures. 
Civil society and the families of those detained have reported arbitrary detentions by security forces. 
Videos have also circulated purportedly showing ill treatment of the detained by security forces, such as a video in which a uniformed individual appears to be standing on the head of a subdued prisoner. This video was allegedly posted on the Twitter account of the National Police before being taken down. President Bukele has also made comments on Twitter suggesting that the detained would not receive full food rations or fresh air, in contravention of international standards. 
According to media reports, at least four people have allegedly died in detention in the context of the state of emergency. 
El Salvador’s government has openly attacked those criticizing the measures, using social media to stigmatize civil society representatives and those pertaining to the international community. 
The state of emergency was due to end on 25 April 2022 but was renewed by the Legislative Assembly for another 30-day period.

She has been in pretrial detention since September 2020 and risks a lengthy jail sentence simply for her legitimate human rights work as coordinator of the volunteer network of the NGO Viasna. The prison authorities have been denying her the urgent medical care she requires for months, despite worrying symptoms and a deterioration of her health. Marfa Rabkova must be immediately and unconditionally released.   
Marfa Rabkova’s health is deteriorating rapidly following months of inadequate medical care since she has been in pretrial detention, including being refused treatment for abdominal pain and aching teeth for over nine months. She requires an urgent medical examination and access to the treatment she urgently needs and in accordance with her wishes. She is being targeted for her legitimate activities as a human rights defender, such as observing demonstrations and documenting evidence of human rights violations, including torture and other ill-treatment of peaceful protesters by law enforcement officials. Marfa Rabkova has committed no crime and should be released immediately and unconditionally.  
Marfa Rabkova was detained on 17 September 2020 and was initially charged with ‘training and other preparation of people for participation in mass riots’, ‘incitement of racial, national, religious or other social hatred or discord committed by a group’, and ‘membership of a criminal organization’ and was facing up to 12 years in prison. In late November 2021 she was charged with additional counts, bringing it to a total of 11 and she is now facing up to 20 years in prison.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION   
The detention of human rights defender Marfa Rabkova and other activists came in the context of a drastic deterioration in the human rights situation in Belarus. During the electoral campaign period and following the presidential election on 9 August 2020, there were mass peaceful protests against the widely disputed official results as well as against police violence and widespread human rights violations. Throughout, the authorities engaged in an escalating campaign against the opposition and all dissenting voices. Thousands of people were arbitrarily arrested by police, an overwhelming majority of them peaceful protesters or bystanders, and many apprehended in abduction-style arrests by masked plain-clothed men.  
Marfa Rabkova, a member of the Human Rights Center “Viasna” where she coordinates the organization’s Volunteer Service, and her husband, Vadzim Zharomski, were detained on the evening of 17 September 2020 by officers of the Interior Ministry’s Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime and Corruption (GUBAZIK). Their apartment was searched and money, personal belongings and IT equipment were seized. Vadzim Zharomski was later released but Marfa Rabkova was remanded and held in pre-trial detention. She was indicted for “training or other preparation of persons for participation in mass riots, or financing of this activity” (Part 3 of Art. 293 of the Criminal code), “participation in a criminal organization in any other form” (Part 2 of Art. 285 of the Criminal Code) and “incitement to hatred” (Art. 130 of the Criminal Code).  
On 11 February 2021 Marfa Rabkova faced new criminal charges of “inciting social hostility to the government by a group of unidentified individuals” (Part 3 of Art. 130 of the Criminal Code) and “involvement in a criminal organization” (Part 2 of Art. 285 of the Criminal Code). If found guilty, Marfa Rabkova may be imprisoned for up to 12 years. In late November 2021 she was charged with additional counts, bringing it to a total of 11 and she is now facing up to 20 years in prison.  
While being in pretrial detention Marfa Rabkova’s health has deteriorated significantly due to lack of medical care and it is now extremely concerning – she requires immediate examination and treatment. According to her family, she has not been allowed to treat her aching teeth for over nine months, and a part of her front tooth chipped off. After contracting COVID-19 her lymph nodes became inflamed and she had pain in the lower abdomen for several months.  
According to the Human Rights Center “Viasna”, throughout the presidential election campaign, during and after the 9 August election, 2020 members of Viasna faced harassment from the authorities, including administrative arrest, arbitrary detentions and attempted prosecution in connection with their human rights activities.  
Seven Viasna members are currently in prison: chairperson Ales Bialiatski, deputy chairperson Valiantsin Stefanovich, lawyer Uladzimir Labkovich, Marfa Rabkova, head of Viasna’s office in Homiel Leanid Sudalenka, volunteers Tatsiana Lasitsa and Andrei Chapiuk. On 3 November 2021 the court sentenced the head of Viasna’s Homiel office Leanid Sudalenka and Viasna’s volunteer Tatsiana Lasitsa to three and two and a half years in prison, respectively.  
On 17 September 2021 dozens of Belarusian and international human rights organizations including Amnesty International, launched a campaign of solidarity with the imprisoned human rights activists of Viasna, #FreeViasna.

This came after he declared his intention to go on hunger strike to protest his prison conditions and denial of medical attention. Visits by his lawyer and family have been banned since March 2020. He has been held in solitary confinement since 2017, when he was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment in the unfair “Gdeim Izik” mass trial. 
Mohamed Lamine Haddi told his family in a phone call that on 15 March 2022, five prison guards entered his cell and beat him with batons and used metal pliers to cut his beard against his will. He had announced to the prison guards the previous day that he planned to do a hunger strike on 16 and 17 March to protest his prison conditions and the denial of a medical visit, despite repeated demands, and said that if his demands were still not met, then he intended to go on indefinite hunger strike from 18 March. The beating appears to be retaliation for his planned hunger strike and is a violation of his right to freedom of expression, as well as ill-treatment against a detainee. The authorities should not use measures to punish hunger strikers or to coerce them to end a hunger strike. 
He guards returned to his cell on 17, 18 and 21 March and beat him again with batons. He has a hematoma on the left  side of his face from where the guards beat him, and prison guards have refused his requests to see a doctor and to have medicine for his serious digestive problem. He told the prison guards on 21 March that he wanted to make a complaint to the King’s Prosecutor about the guards’ ill-treatment towards him. The guards said that they would not lodge his complaint and beat him. The phone-call to his family on 21 March lasted a total of four minutes as the guards cut-off the call twice; according to his sister, whenever he begins to tell his family about his ill-treatment by the guards, they cut the phone-line. 
Write to the Head of Government urging him to: 
· end the ill-treatment of Mohamed Lamine Haddi, holding accountable all those responsible, and to remove him from solitary confinement 
· grant him immediate access to adequate medical care, regular and unfettered access to his family and lawyer 
· ensure that his detention conditions conform to international law and standards. 
· take all measures to ensure a fair retrial for Mohamed Lamine Haddi and other Gdeim Izik prisoners to take place soon before an ordinary civilian court, in line with international law

Additional information 
Mohamed Lamine Haddi is a Sahrawi activist who participated in the 2010 Gdeim Izik camp protesting Sahrawis’ social and economic conditions. In November 2010, he was arrested in the violent clashes following the dismantling of the camp. In 2013, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison on charges of participation in and aiding a “criminal organisation,” and participation in violence against public forces which caused intended death under Articles 293, 129 and 267 of the Moroccan Penal Code. The military court which tried him and other Sahrawis, all of them civilians, did not investigate the defendants’ claims that they had been forced to sign confessions under torture. A civilian court confirmed his sentence in 2017, using the statements that he said had been made under torture. 
Since being in Tiflet II prison, prison guards have subjected Mohamed to regular verbal abuse, including death and torture threats. Mohamed is not permitted to leave his cell, even for the one-hour walk that he was previously allowed, and so spends 24 hours per day in his cell. During the winter, he was not allowed hot showers like other prisoners. In March 2022, his family sent him a package containing books and medicine, but the prison director refused to give him anything except for one book. On 4 April 2022, Mohamed Lamine Haddi called his family to tell them that prison guards had transferred him to Kenitra prison on 28 March 2022 and held him there until 4 April 2022, in a small cell the size of a toilet cubicle. 
Mohamed Lamine Haddi’s health severely deteriorated following his 69-day hunger strike in January 2021, which he went on to demand an end to his ill-treatment. During that time, he told his family that he did not receive any medical care during his hunger strike, despite suffering partial paralysis, trembling, memory loss and severe pain. Prison guards force-fed him, ending his hunger strike non-consensually on 23 March 2021. In a phone-call to his family on 9 April 2021, Mohamed Lamine Haddi said that the prison director had threatened to put him in a small, dungeon-like cell if his family 
continued to publicize his case. According to his lawyer, the prison authorities previously detained Mohamed Lamine Haddi in such a cell in 2018 as punishment. His lawyer described the cell as a small room of 2m² with no window, tap nor toilet. It is known as the “punishment cell” or “coffin” because it is the same size. His family called the King’s Prosecutor and the prison director several times, with no response. 
Human rights international standards, such as the United Nations’ Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, define solitary confinement as spending 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact. They provide that prolonged solitary confinement – over 15 consecutive days – is considered cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. Under the Moroccan Prison Law, solitary confinement is an exceptional measure imposed only as a security or protective measure for prisoners. Morocco’s Penal Code also criminalizes torture. 
Western Sahara is the subject of a territorial dispute between Morocco, which annexed the territory in 1975, and claims sovereignty over it, and the Polisario Front, which calls for an independent state in the territory. In recent years, access to Western Sahara has grown increasingly difficult for external monitors as the human rights situation has continued to deteriorate. The UN Security Council has ignored calls by Amnesty International and others to add a human rights component to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which would allow for monitoring and reporting on human rights abuses.

A recently published bill seeks to prohibit abortions after 22 weeks, or when a doctor determines that the foetus is viable, with the only exception being if the pregnant person’s life is in danger. According to international law, any restrictions on access to abortion must be human rights compliant. We call for urgent objective public hearings and meaningful human rights scrutiny of this bill. 
Write to the President of the Commission of Life and Family Affairs urging her to: 
• take a stand against any regression in the human rights protection of women, girls and all others who can become pregnant• ensure that any public hearings that take place regarding Bill #693 are objective, meaning that all interventions from a diversity of stakeholders are equally heard, and subject to meaningful human rights scrutiny. This would help to ensure a suitable process is in place, and avoid potentially grave negative impacts on the rights to life, health, and privacy of girlsand women and all others who can become pregnant. 
Currently in Puerto Rico, there are few legal restrictions on access to abortion, which can take place at any stage in the pregnancy when carried out by a doctor to conserve the life or the health, including mental health, of the pregnant person.However, a recently published bill would restrict access to abortion after 22 weeks, or when a doctor determines that the foetus is viable, with the only exception being if the pregnant persons’ life is in danger. It would not permit a termination after 22 weeks for other reasons, such as where there is a diagnosis of foetal impairment, where the pregnancy is the result of incest and/or sexual violence, or where the pregnant person was unaware of the pregnancy or had limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare and/or abortion services. 
Restrictions on access to abortion would constitute a retrogression in rights and a barrier to accessing public health services, which risks having a disproportionate impact on women and pregnant people in serious situations – such as those who need abortions for medical reasons to safeguard their health, or who have experienced sexual violence or trafficking and who were unable to access abortion earlier -as well as those who are already historically marginalized and for whom access to abortion may be more difficult, for example, due to lack of financial resources. 
International human rights law and standards require states to ensure access to safe and legal abortion to protect women’s and girls’ life and health at all stages of pregnancy without discrimination. The Human Rights Council in its General Comment 36 on the Right to Life has prohibited states from regulating abortion in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do not have to undertake unsafe abortions. As such, people’s ability to make decisions about one’s body, sexuality and reproduction is at the core of gender, economic and social justice, and states must not legislate with the aim to remove any human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights.

Additional information 
In 1973 the US Supreme Court ruled that abortion was legal in the landmark case Roe v. Wade. In Puerto Rico, there are currently limited legal restrictions on access to abortion, which can take place at any stage in the pregnancy when carried out by a doctor to conserve the life or the health, including mental health, of the pregnant person. 
However, a recently published bill would restrict access to abortion after 22 weeks, or when a doctor determines that the foetus is viable, with the only exception being if the pregnant person’s life is in danger. 
This new bill has been proposed in the context of an onslaught of legal challenges by anti-choice groups in the USA which seek to restrict access to abortion. In 2021 alone, more than 100 abortion restrictions were implemented across the USA, according to the Guttmacher Institute. 
Puerto Rico’s Department of Health and Department of Justice have both expressed concerns with the new bill, which among other things, calls for the creation of a government registry of data of people who terminate pregnancies within the period in which the foetus is considered viable, the justification for it, as well as details of the medical professional who practices the abortion, which could undermine the right to privacy and confidentiality of people who choose to opt for an abortion or expose them or medical professionals to sanctions or stigmatization. 
Public health and social science research have demonstrated that time-bound regulation of abortion – or setting “gestational limits” – may constitute an arbitrary and discriminatory barrier to accessing services, which has a disproportionate impact on the human rights of women and girls. The negative impact of gestational limits on access to quality public health care has been recognized by the WHO. For gestational limits to be human rights compliant they must respect and protect the human rights of women and girls and all others who can become pregnant, including their rights to life, health and to bodily integrity and reproductive autonomy. 
Gestational limits can deny people who need abortions access to services, disproportionately impacting those from poorer and/or marginalized backgrounds. Health professionals can also be arbitrarily precluded from considering all medical and clinical options with the best interest of their patient in view and there is a tendency to over apply the legal requirement of gestational limits due to the chilling effect they can have. 
People who access abortions in the USA are disproportionally poor and low income. However, abortions in later pregnancy are quite rare. In the USA, for example, most abortions take place early in pregnancy. In the USA in 2016, only 1.3% of abortions occurred after 21 weeks. Similarly, in Puerto Rico, according to a submission by the Department of Health, the majority of abortions in Puerto Rico take place before 14 weeks. 
Despite this, there are important reasons why some people will need abortions later in pregnancy, such as(1) when the pregnancy poses a risk to health of the pregnant person, (2) where there is a foetal impairment diagnosis, (3) where the pregnancy is the result of incest and/or sexual violence, (4) where the woman or girl was unaware of the pregnancy, or (5) had limited access sexual reproductive healthcare and/or abortion services, or(6) if the pregnant person was in a situation of domestic violence or had been trafficked and where their liberty or freedom of movement was restricted. Puerto Rico’s Department of Health in a submission made on 17 March 2022 related to the bill, raised a series of other situations in which a woman might need to access an abortion later in pregnancy, including if her body is still under development and if she has never experienced a pregnancy before and has no understanding of how it feels, or if she is in pre-menopause and no longer expecting to be able to get pregnant. 
International human rights law and standards require states to ensure access to safe and legal abortion to protect women’s and girls’ life and health at all stages of pregnancy without discrimination. The Human Rights Council in its General Comment 36 on the Right to Life has prohibited states fromregulating abortion in a manner that runs contrary to their duty to ensure that women and girls do nothave to undertake unsafe abortions.

In times of danger, people usually take the quickest and most accessible routes to safety, which may lead them to neighbouring countries. While these countries have the obligation to guarantee prompt access to their territory and provide for immediate humanitarian needs, support and solidarity from other countries is required to meet longer-term protection and assistance needs and to provide for durable solutions.  
In response to the crisis, Canada created an authorization for emergency travel which gives Ukrainian nationals a fee-exempt temporary visitor visa. This program enables an unlimited number of Ukrainians to come to Canada and obtain work and study permits. Amnesty International supports the government’s decision to dispense with typical visa requirements to make it easier for a larger number of people to seek safety in Canada quickly. The government has also committed to prioritizing family sponsorship applications. This approach recognizes the dire situation Ukrainians face and ensures access to protection without delay. It recognizes that Ukrainians, like all refugees, are deserving of empathy and should be welcomed with open arms, as well as the role Canada can play in supporting people fleeing danger.   
However, we are deeply concerned by the federal government’s discriminatory decision to limit the temporary visa program to Ukrainian nationals and their family members. Despite fleeing the same conflict, third-country nationals fleeing Ukraine are not eligible for the visa program. We call on the government to amend its program so that all people fleeing Ukraine can access protection without discrimination. We also note that war is not experienced equally, and that its impacts are felt most acutely by people who are already marginalized. Canada must account for the intersecting vulnerabilities that racialized people, people with disabilities, young people, older adults, LGBTI people, and women, trans and gender diverse people face, and should ensure that its program responds to their needs.  
Canada’s response to the crisis in Ukraine shows that it can receive large numbers of people seeking safety over a short period of time, something it has failed to do in response to other crises. For example, eight months after Canada announced plans to resettle 40,000 Afghans, fewer than 12,000 Afghans have arrived in Canada. While the government notes that the situations in Afghanistan and Ukraine are not comparable, there appears to be a lack of political will to find creative alternatives to bureaucratic processes that have left many Afghans in peril, unable to access protection in Canada. For refugees fleeing the conflict in Yemen, which Canada has fueled through arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, or Tigrayans fleeing a campaign of ethnic cleansing in Ethiopia’s Western Tigray Zone, there are no special migration measures.   
The difference in treatment of refugees provides a stark reminder that Canada’s immigration system is built on racist, exclusionary, and colonial policies. Efficient and effective alternatives, much like those available to Ukrainian citizens, are needed for “forgotten refugees” – most of whom are Black and Brown people, come from Muslim majority countries, or otherwise represent racial and ethnic minorities.   
All refugees deserve to be treated equally and with empathy, dignity, and respect. We welcome Canada’s efforts to support Ukrainian refugees and call on Canada to build a system of refugee protection that is based on equality and fair access for all.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 – now entering the third month with no end in sight – is an act of aggression that has unleashed the gravest human rights and refugee crisis in Europe since World War Two. 
Amnesty International is documenting serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, including the unlawful killing and injury of civilians, destruction of infrastructure, and blocking of desperately needed aid for civilians. Attacks on hospitals and schools, employing “surrender or starve” sieges on civilians, the use of banned weapons such as cluster munitions, and strikes on populated areas using inaccurate weapons may constitute war crimes. 
Exposed to constant attacks and with many cut off from water, electricity and heating, people caught up in conflict in cities such as Izium and Mariupol are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster. Diminishing food, water and medical supplies have left them at breaking point, as remaining civilians seek shelter in their basements. Amnesty International’s on-the-ground reports and digital investigations help ensure that evidence of these attacks reaches the world.

Crowds were forcibly dispersed, protesters arrestFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, thousands of people took to the streets across Russia to denounce the invasion and call for an end to the fighting. The crackdown was immediate and brutal. Crowds were forcibly dispersed, protesters arrested, and independent media censored or closed down. On March 4, new amendments to the criminal code severely limited the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. Over 15,000 people had been arrested. On April 8, the offices of human rights organizations – including Amnesty International’s Moscow office – were forced to close. The authorities have particularly targeted journalists and feminist-led anti-war networks. 
SOLIDARITY ACTION

Further instructions, sample phrases in Russian and examples of posters can be found here. 
For people located on Ottawa, Toronto, and Montreal, we will be organizing photo actions on May 7 outside the Russian embassy and consulates (date and exact time TBC). If you are interested in participating, please RSVP using this form >>>  
RELATED CASE: On March 22, 2002, opposition figure and anti-corruption activist Aleksei Navalny was sentenced to a further 9 years for “fraud on an especially large scale” and “contempt of court”. He was accused of siphoning off approximately US$ 25,000 from donations to organizations he founded. Amnesty International analyzed the case and concluded that this prosecution was politically motivated and based on the arbitrary application of law which wrongfully criminalized Aleksei Navalny. 
Please continue to sign and share the global petition calling for the release of Aleksei Navalny. 
Ongoing Campaigns: End Israeli Apartheid 
After four years of research in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories and building on decades of human rights advocacy in the region, Amnesty International launched a new report, Israel’s Apartheid Against Palestinians, on February 1st, 2022. The report sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law.  
The government of Israel has an obligation under international law to dismantle this system of apartheid, and to repeal or amend all laws, regulations, policies, and practices that discriminate on racial, ethnic, or religious grounds to bring them into line with international human rights law and standards.  
Amnesty’s human rights concerns have always been directed at the policies, laws, and actions of the government of Israel, not the Jewish people. It is crucial not to conflate legitimate criticism of crimes under international law committed by the government of Israel with antisemitism. To do so is inaccurate and dangerous. We stand against antisemitism in the strongest possible terms.

Ethiopia: Ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity in Western Tigray.  
On April 6, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch launched the joint report, ‘We Will Erase You From This Land’: Crimes Against Humanity and Ethnic Cleansing in Ethiopia’s Western Tigray Zone. The extensive research documents how newly-appointed officials in Western Tigray and security forces from the neighbouring Amhara region, with the acquiescence and possible participation of Ethiopian federal forces, systematically expelled several hundred thousand Tigrayan civilians from their homes using threats, unlawful killings, sexual violence, mass arbitrary detention, pillage, forcible transfer, and the denial of humanitarian assistance. These widespread and systematic attacks against the Tigrayan civilian population amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
While our campaign is in development, you are encouraged to read and share this new research on social media. Here are some examples of tweets by @AmnestySecurity and @AmnestyEARO.  
China: June 4 Tiananmen Square anniversary.  
On the evening of June 3-4, 1989, hundreds – possibly thousands – of people were killed in Beijing when troops opened fire on students and workers who had been peacefully calling for political and economic reforms as well as an end to corruption. An unknown number of people were killed and jailed in similar crackdowns throughout the country. No one knows the exact number of fatalities since the Chinese authorities have stifled and censored discussion of the crackdown for the past three decades. 
Hongkongers attending an annual Tiananmen vigil in the city’s Victoria Park since 1990 have called on the Chinese authorities to reveal the truth about what happened and take responsibility for the killings. The vigil has been banned for the past two years, ostensibly on Covid-19 grounds. In December 2021, three Hong Kong activists were convicted for their role in the 2020 Tiananmen Square vigil. 
A short solidarity campaign will start in May (details TBC). 
Saudi Arabia: Raif Badawi and travel bans 
Although Raif Badawi was released in March after completing his ten-year sentence, a travel ban currently prevents him from joining his family in Canada. We are currently monitoring developments. Stay tuned for a campaign on travel bans later this spring.

But this year’s coming of spring may be tinged with a prickle of anxiety.   
Will we get enough rain this spring to replenish our aquifers?  
Will our rivers run dry in August and cook the salmon on their homeward journeys? 
Will there be another killer heat wave? 
Will my community be forced to leave again because of wildfires?  
Climate anxiety is an unwelcome reality for many people, causing fear, helplessness, and guilt and sleep disturbances. According to a 2021 study published by the Lancet, nearly 6 in 10 young people were ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ worried about climate change and felt that governments are not doing enough to protect them or future generations. They told researchers that they find the future frightening. 
We know from reports like this one from UNICEF that half of the world’s children are at extreme risk from the impacts of the climate crisis and pollution. And many of those children that are at highest risk are from countries or communities that contribute least to climate chaos. 
The recent news that the Federal government approved the Bay Du Nord deepwater mega-oil project in eastern Newfoundland and Labrador feels even more of a betrayal, coming as it did on the heels of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report  which warned that unless immediate action is taken, it may be too late to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise by 1.5 degrees.  
In fact, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure would be ‘moral and economic madness’. 
He also said that “climate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals. But the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels”. Like Canada.  
The situation is similar to the one we found ourselves in when the House of Commons declared a climate emergency in 2019 and announced the next day that it had approved the twinning of the TransMountain pipeline project. The pipeline is opposed by the Tsleil Waututh Nation who have extensively documented the cumulative impacts of industrial pollution, shore erosion, and fishing practices on the Burrard Inlet and the effects on their way of life and constitutionally protected rights.  
But as we wrote in our previous blog, there are still reasons to hope. And ways to organize. To sharpen our analysis. And to fight for a just future. 
US thinker and linguist Noam Chomsky famously said, “Changes and progress are very rarely gifts from above. They come out of struggles from below”. And labour leader and civil rights activist, Dolores Huerta said, “Every moment is an organizing opportunity, every person a potential activist, every minute a chance to change the world.”  
Let’s take those words as inspiration for collective action!

Algerian journalist, Merzoug Touati, sentenced to one year in prison and a fine for Facebook posts denouncing deplorable prison conditions of another detained activist, started a hunger strike on 29 March 2022 to protest his detention conditions and demand a transfer to a prison close to his official residence in Bejaia, Algeria. As the prison administration disregarded his hunger strike, Merzoug Touati did not receive any medical care until suffering sharp kidney pain which required his transfer to a hospital. His health has significantly deteriorated according to reports from his family. He must be released immediately and unconditionally.  
Merzoug Touati was previously held in Ghardaia prison during his first instance and appeal trials. He was transferred to the new prison on 16 February 2022 and placed in a crowded transit area dedicated to new incoming prisoners who are supposed to stay there only for two weeks due to Covid-19 regulations. However, Merzoug Touati has already spent more than one month and a half in this transit area, placing his health at further risk.    
On 9 April 2022, his family visited him in prison. They told Amnesty International that he had lost half his weight and was barely able to move. He complained of stomach pain and asked his family to get him medicine from outside prison, as the prison administration has not provided him with any medical attention needed and instead continued to disregard his hunger strike.   Police in Ghardaia summoned Merzoug Touati on 28 December 2021 without mentioning any reason. They kept him in custody for one night before transferring him to Ghardaia prison on 29 December 2021. The first instance court in Ghardaia sentenced him to one year in prison, confirmed on appeal, for “harming public institutions” and publishing “fake news”, under articles 146 and 196 bis of the penal code, respectively, after he posted on Facebook a comment denouncing the prison conditions of a detained activist.

Additional information  
Merzoug Touati is an Algerian journalist. He founded an independent news page called “Al-Hogra” in 2015 where he publishes about political and human rights developments in Algeria. He was also a journalist at L’Avant-Garde, an independent Algerian newspaper. The Algerian authorities targeted him multiple times since 2017 for documenting human rights violations and reporting on political developments.  
In January 2017, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, later reduced to five years, three of them suspended. On that occasion, he faced charges of sharing intelligence with a foreign power “aiming at harming diplomatic ties” and “incitement to gatherings and sit-ins in public spaces”. The charges were based solely on the peaceful exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly stemming from a Facebook post that called for protests against a new law and a video interview with an Israeli spokesperson posted on YouTube. He spent more than two years in prison and was released on 7 March 2019.   Merzoug Touati actively participated in the Hirak, both as a journalist and an activist. Police arrested him on 12 June 2020 while he was about to cover a protest in the city of Béjaïa. He was presented before the prosecutor the following day and was accused of “incitement to a gathering” along with two other activists. On 8 July 2020, he was sentenced to a fine of 100.000 Algerian dinars (around 749 USD).  
On 15 November 2021, Merzoug Touati received summons at his home notifying him to show up at the Bejaia cybercrime department. On 16 November 2021, he went to the central police station in Bejaia, where he was ordered to go to the cybercrime department of Ghardaia. On 27 December 2021, Merzoug Touati travelled more than 700 km from his place of residence in Bejaia to Ghardaia. The day after, he called his wife to let her know that he was being held in custody in Ghardaia.  On 29 December 2021, Merzoug Touati was presented before the prosecutor, and charged with publishing fake news and harming public institutions. On 3 January 2022, he was sentenced to one year in prison and a fine. The sentence was upheld after appeal.  
At least two people detained solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression have died in Algeria following hunger strikes. Mohamed Tamalt, a journalist, died in prison on 11 December 2016, following a hunger strike to protest against a two-year prison sentenced stemming from articles and posts criticizing or insulting President Bouteflika. On 28 May 2019, Kamaleddine Fekhar, who was active in defending the rights of the Mozabites, an Amazigh community in the region of Ghardaïa, doctor and local president of the section of the Algerian League for the defence of human rights died in the Blida hospital while detained after 50 days of a hunger strike to protest his detention for Facebook posts critical of the authorities.

Amnesty Canada has launched a new online action that calls on Canada and Export Development Canada to protect human rights by stopping its financing for fossil fuel expansion in Canada and around the world. 
It couldn’t be more urgent! Amnesty’s report, Stop Burning Our Rights, documents the massive role that fossil fuels play in the unprecedented human rights emergency caused by climate change. Canada’s export bank, Export Development Canada, continues to direct billions of dollars in loans, insurance and other support to fossil fuel activity in Canada and other countries. The Canadian government also continues to approve new fossil fuel projects like the controversial Bay du Nord project. Speak up for human rights! Call on Canada to stop bankrolling climate disaster. Add your voice here 
As efforts continue in Colombia to stop fossil fuel fracking because of its impact on the right to a healthy environment, death threats have increased against leaders who speak out. Afro-Colombian defender Yuvelis Morales was forced to leave the country. Others remain at grave risk. Please sign our Urgent Action to send a message urging Colombian authorities to act. Please encourage your friends to send a message too! 
Amnesty International remains deeply concerned about ongoing RCMP and private security harassment and criminalization of peaceful land and water defenders on Wet’suwet’en territory, who are trying to protect clean drinking water and salmon spawning grounds from an unwanted gas pipeline. United Nations bodies have called on Canada to withdraw RCMP and security forces, yet police continue to patrol the territory. Please sign our online action calling on Canada to withdraw the police and respect Wet’suwet’en law. Learn more here. For more action suggestions, visit this blog. 
Determined human rights defenders in Honduras tell us that the tens of thousands of messages of concern from Canada, together with hundreds of thousands more from around the world, played a huge role in enabling them to achieve partial justice for the murder of Lenca Indigenous leader Berta Cáceres. Her assassination, amidst a campaign to stop construction of a hydro-electric dam on the Gualcarque River, has come to symbolize the violence faced by so many other land, water and Indigenous territory defenders across the Americas. That violence is fuelled by the reality that the perpetrators are rarely, if ever, brought to justice. Sustained efforts in Honduras, supported by the solidarity of Amnesty Canada activists, have achieved an important precedent. Seven men are now in jail for carrying out the assassination, and David Castillo, an executive with the company that was building the dam, was convicted last July as a co-author of the crime. Still, almost a year later, Castillo has not been sentenced and other powerful people who plotted and paid for the assassination have yet to be prosecuted. 
It’s vitally important to keep the pressure on Honduras to ensure the truth and justice for all behind the murder of Berta. Send your message via this action. Personalize it, for greater impact! 
Honour Berta Cáceres and other defenders of water, land, forests and climate justice by planting or adopting a tree in a public space. Create signage that will inspire others, perhaps including the powerful words of Berta: “We have no replacement planet. We have only this one. We have to take action!” Hold an event around your tree and hang blue ribbons from its branches to symbolize the vital efforts of those who defend water and life on our beautiful, blue planet. Reach out to community media so they cover what you do. So far, four groups have shared their plans to move forward with this creative way to engage others in their communities.

In the Winter Activism Guide, we asked you to raise your voice for eight Guapinol River defenders in Honduras, who were arbitrarily jailed for 914 days, accused of crimes they did not commit in order to paralyse community resistance to a mining operation in a controversially re-zoned protected area. 
Good News! The defenders were released on February 24, after the Supreme Court of Honduras ruled there was no case against them. “We are so happy. Actually, we are euphoric! We have won at last!” said Orbin Hernández, one of the eight defenders whom Amnesty had declared to be prisoners of conscience. Read more here. 
“It is thanks to support from inside and outside Honduras that we are now free from criminal persecution.” 
Maya Q’eqchi’ rights and river defender Bernardo Caal Xol, unjustly imprisoned for more than four years, was released on March 24 and reunited with his family. Read our statement here. 
“I want to thank international organizations like Amnesty International for such important work to make visible how I was treated like a criminal, even though I committed no crime … I express my gratitude to the people who sent letters, who wrote to send greetings and to encourage me. Justice for the Maya Q’eqchi’ people! Justice for the Cahabón River! The struggle continues!” 
Supporters of the English speaking and francophone sections of Amnesty International in Canada together delivered more than 26,500 messages calling for the release of Bernardo Caal Xol and respect for the rights of Maya Q’eqchi’ communities. Our solidarity action is still needed, since the wrongful conviction of Bernardo has yet to be overturned. Instead, authorities said he was released for “good behaviour”. Meanwhile, dam-affected communities continue to denounce violations of their rights. Click here to view Bernardo’s video message after his release, with thanks and an appeal for us to continue to stand with defenders of rights and the environment in Guatemala. 
We are consulting with Bernardo and his legal team about follow up action. Meanwhile, click to tweet this message to authorities in Guatemala.

However, this right is far from the reality for racialized or marginalized communities across Canada. Canada has a shameful legacy of environmental racism. For decades, racialized communities have been exposed to environmental toxins from garbage dumps, chemical plants, oil and gas developments, and other industrial activities without regard for their human rights. Black and Indigenous communities have paid steep prices with their health and wellbeing as a result of planning and decision-making by people outside of those communities. 
Environmental Justice for Black, Indigenous, and racialized communities is Climate Justice 
Climate change affects everyone but Black, Indigenous and other racialized communities are disproportionally affected. In North America, for example, the neighbourhoods of poor and racialized communities are most likely to be situated next to packaging depots, highways, power plants and refineries. These communities breathe toxic air and experience significantly higher rates of respiratory illnesses and cancers. 
Women and girls are also deeply affected by the climate crisis, further exacerbating health concerns, and limiting access to land ownership, safety, and livelihoods. 
Indigenous peoples often live in and care for sensitive ecosystems, which they depend upon for their livelihoods, identities, and ancestral laws. However, they may be exposed to forced evictions, crop failures, or pollution from industrial activities that encroach on their lives and territories. Indigenous defenders who speak out to protect their rights and territories face enormous risks and threats to their human rights. Acts of solidarity and allyship, as requested by Indigenous leaders, that centre Indigenous voices are urgently needed.

Compounding matters, for over half a century, government policy has been geared towards highway and road expansion, resulting in higher greenhouse gas pollution, more private and transport vehicle traffic, and worsening health and safety issues. The global pandemic and the climate crisis have brought us to a tipping point: people want better, cleaner mobility options for getting around our communities that don’t deepen existing inequalities. 
We know that when more space is allocated to public transit lanes, protected bike lanes, and space for walking, traffic evaporates. A variety of travel options for people on the move equates to fewer cars, healthier, cooler, more inclusive and more pleasant cities and towns. 
Plus, walking, cycling and rolling options – in addition to better public transit – throughout urban and suburban areas would relieve a huge financial burden for many people. Young people and recent immigrants would not have to bear the financial burden of buying and operating their own car to get to work or access post-secondary education. 
Some North American communities, like Front and Centered in Washington State, are working with their communities and elected officials to develop a Transportation Bill of Rights on the need to transition justly from fossil fuels to clean public transit for everyone – and that puts people at the centre. 
In British Columbia, the BC government’s new CleanBC Roadmap envisions a 25 percent reduction in light-duty vehicle traffic by 2030 compared to 2020. 
We think this is achievable. And a great idea!

Community spokespeople report that starting in February, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Coastal Gaslink increased surveillance and presence on the yintah (territory) and are going onto people’s residential properties at Coyote Camp. Residents report that the RCMP are cutting chains and locks on peoples’ gates and holding them at their detachment in Houston, BC. Spokespeople also tell Amnesty International staff that they are threatened with arrest and charges of obstruction when they tell officers to leave, that community members are pulled over and ticketed on roads into the area, and that officers are trying to prevent community organizing. Amnesty International continues to investigate.

With the increased labour of the care work force and the rise in domestic gender-based violence being two of the greatest gendered impacts during the pandemic, the highlights of the federal budget are its commitment of $625 million over four years towards building a Child Care Infrastructure Fund and $539.3 million over five years to implement the forthcoming National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. 
Many aspects of the budget also focused on Indigenous women, girls, and Two-Spirit individuals, and the government continues to craft its response to improve gendered health care, take action on the ongoing tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, and to implement the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Actions. Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, the National Association of Friendship Centres, and the National Family and Survivors Circle share their responses to the budget and expose some of the gaps and inadequacies in the government’s commitment, including the absence of any measures addressing the Calls for Justice in the final report of the National Inquiry on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people. 
On the international front, last month Amnesty collected 6,900 signatures and took part in a global petition handover urging Canada and governments of the world to speak up for Afghan women and girls. Since then, the situation in Afghanistan has regressed even more. Heartbreaking images and recordings of girls being turned away at the very gates of their schools were circulated all over the world when the Taliban failed to deliver on their promise to reopen schools on March 23rd. 4 million girls in grade six and above have now missed one full year of education. With 4 million girls not getting an education, they then become 4 million women who may not end up not working (or likely only in precarious forms of employment), who may also be facing violence in their homes, and who won’t be socially and culturally engaged. Fundamental to our understanding of the situation must be that Taliban leaders have created regressive conditions for an entire generation of girls in a country whose former generations of women had, for over 100 years, enjoyed the equal right to education, right to work, and right to political participation. That is the context in which we’re now seeing women being removed from all social, economic, and political spaces, and the dissolution of the Afghan Human Rights Commission and the Women Affairs Ministry resulting in emboldening threats and acts of violence against women. The situation remains immensely critical. 
Canada recently announced an additional $50 million for life-saving humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan, such as emergency health care and food and nutrition. Absent from this announcement was any mention of direct support for women or girls, particularly for the economic impact for single women heads of households who have now been without an income for 8 months, or protections for women as rates of violence increase. Unless funding is explicitly stated and allocated to women and girls, we must remain vigilant in calling on Canada to uphold women and girl’s rights as a non-negotiable issue in our international response.

Magai was a 15-year-old secondary student when he was sentenced to death by hanging on November 14, 2017 after being convicted of a murder that he claims was an accident. He spent two years and eight months on death rows, more than two years of that when he was still a child.  
The sentencing and Magai’s presence on death row when he was still a child constituted a clear violation of South Sudan’s obligations under South Sudanese law and international human rights law.  
Magai Matiop Ngong was featured in Amnesty’s Write for Rights campaign in 2019. More than 765,000 people, including thousands of people in Canada, took action and wrote to the South Sudanese government expressing solidarity with Magai. The South Sudan Court of Appeal eventually quashed the death sentence imposed on Magai because he was a child at the time of the crime, and sent his case back to the High Court to rule on an appropriate sentence.

Additionally, after a hiatus during winter, more asylum-seekers are now trying to enter Poland from Belarus, where they are unable to access further funds due to international sanctions and risk harassment or apprehension by Belarusian police due their irregular immigration status. At the Polish border they face razor wire fences and repeated pushbacks by border guards sometimes up to 20-30 times. 
Asylum-seekers who crossed the Belarus border into Poland, including many forced to do so by Belarusian Border Guards, are now detained in filthy, overcrowded detention centres where guards subject them to abusive  treatment and deny them contact with the outside world, 
“This violent and degrading treatment stands in stark contrast to the warm welcome Poland is offering to displaced people arriving from Ukraine. The behaviour of the Polish authorities smacks of racism and hypocrisy. Poland must urgently extend its admirable compassion for those entering the country from Ukraine to all those crossing its borders to seek safety.” 
Arbitrary detention and abysmal detention conditions 
Polish border guards have systematically rounded up and violently pushed back people crossing from Belarus, sometimes threatening them with guns. The vast majority of those who have been fortunate enough to avoid being pushed back to Belarus and to apply for asylum in Poland are forced into automatic detention, without a proper assessment of their individual situation and the impact detention would have on their physical and mental health. They are often held for prolonged and indefinite periods of time in overcrowded centres that offer little privacy and only limited access to sanitary facilities, doctors, psychologists, or legal assistance. 
Almost all of the people Amnesty International interviewed said they were  traumatized after fleeing areas of conflict and being trapped for months on the Belarusian-Polish border. They also suffered from serious psychological problems, including anxiety, insomnia, depression and frequent suicidal thoughts, undoubtedly exacerbated by their unnecessary metres. For most, psychological support was unavailable. 
Retraumatized inside a military base 
Many of the people who Amnesty spoke to had been in Wędrzyn detention centre, which holds up to 600 people. Overcrowding is particularly acute in this facility, where up to 24 men are detained in rooms measuring just eight square metres. 
In 2021, the Polish authorities decreased the minimum required space for foreign detainees from three square meters per person to just two. The Council of Europe minimum standard for personal living space in prisons and detention centres is four square meters per person. 
People held in Wędrzyn recounted how guards greeted new detainees  by saying “welcome to Guantánamo”. Many of them were victims of torture in their home countries before enduring harrowing experiences both in Belarus and on the border of Poland. The detention centre in Wędrzyn forms part of an active military base. The facility’s barbed wire walls — and the persistent sound of armoured vehicles, helicopters and gunfire from military exercises in the area — only serves to retraumatize them. 
“Most days we were woken up by the sounds of tanks and helicopters, followed by gunshots and explosions. This would go on all day, sometimes. When you have nowhere to go, no activities [to] take your mind off it or a space for even a brief respite, this was intolerable. After all the torture in prison in Syria, threats to my family, and then months on the road, I think I was finally broken in Wędrzyn,” Khafiz, a Syrian refugee, told Amnesty International. 
In Lesznowola Detention Centre, detainees said that guards’ treatment left them feeling dehumanized. The staff called detainees by their case numbers instead of using their names and meted out excessive punishments, including isolation, for simple requests, such as asking for a towel or more food. 
Nearly all those interviewed reported consistently disrespectful and verbally abusive behaviour, racist remarks and other practices that indicated psychological ill-treatment.  
Men who Amnesty International interviewed uniformly  complained about the manner in which body searches were  conducted. When people were  transferred from one detention centre to another, they were forced to undergo a strip search at each facility, even though they were in state custody at all times. In Wędrzyn, people recounted abusive searches. For example, all newly admitted foreigners are kept together in a room, required to remove all of their clothes and ordered to perform squats longer than necessary for a legitimate check. 
Violent forcible returns 
Amnesty International interviewed several people who were forcibly returned as well as some who avoided return and remain in detention in Poland. Many said the Polish border guards who conducted the returns coerced them into signing documents in Polish that they suspected included incriminating information in order to justify their returns. They also said that, in some cases, border guards used excessive force, such as tasers, restrained people with handcuffs, and even sedated those being returned.  
Authorities attempted to forcibly return Yezda, a 30-year old Kurdish woman , with her husband and three small children. After being told that the family would be returned to Iraq, Yezda panicked and screamed and pleaded with the guards not to take them. She threatened to take her life and became extremely agitated. “I knew I could not go back to Iraq and I was ready to die in Poland. While I was crying like that, two guards restrained me and my husband, tied our hands behind our backs, and a doctor gave us an injection that made us very weak and sleepy. My head was not clear, but I could hear my children, who were in the room with us, crying and screaming.” 
“We were asked to go through the airport security and the guards told us to behave on the plane. But I refused to go. I remember noticing that I didn’t even have any shoes on, as in the chaos at the camp, they slipped of my feet. My head was not clear, and I couldn’t see my husband or the children, but I remember that they forced me on the plane that was full of people. I was still crying and pleading with the police not to take us.” Yezda said that she broke her foot as she fought the guards who tried to put her on the plane. Yezda and her family were returned to Warsaw after the airline refused to take them to Iraq. They remain in a camp in Poland for now. 
Volunteers and activists have been barred from accessing the border of Poland and Belarus, and some have even faced prosecution for trying to help people cross the border. In March, activists who had helped people both on Poland’s borders with Ukraine and with Belarus were detained for providing life-saving assistance to refugees and migrants on the Belarussian border, and now face potentially serious charges. 
Stranded at the border 
On 20 March, the Belarusian authorities reportedly evicted close to 700 refugees and migrants, including many families with young children and people suffering from severe illnesses and disabilities, from the warehouse in the Belarusian village of Bruzgi which had accommodated several thousand people in 2021. 
People who were evicted from the warehouse suddenly found themselves stranded in the forest, trying to survive in sub-zero temperatures without shelter, food, water or access to medical care. Many remain in the forest and experience daily abuse from the Belarusian border guards, who use dogs and violence to force people to cross the border into Poland. 
“Hundreds of people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and other parts of the world remain stranded on the border between Belarus and Poland. The Polish government must immediately stop pushbacks. They are illegal no matter how the government tries to justify them. The international community – including the EU – must demand that those trapped on Poland’s border with Belarus be afforded the same access to EU territory as any other group seeking refuge in Europe,” said Jelena Sesar.

Security forces surrounding their home repeatedly and violently forced Sultana Khaya and her sister Luaara back inside their house when they attempt to leave. Security forces have also broken into their homes on several occasions, physically assaulting and raping the sisters. On 16 March, a group of American activists successfully accessed Sultana Khaya’s house but refrained from disclosing details of the visit for security reasons. While conditions of the house arrest were recently eased, police presence around Sultana Khaya’s house have not been completely lifted.  
On 16 March, a group of at least four American activists from ‘Unarmed Civilian Protection’ and ‘Human Rights Action Center’, two international non-profit organizations working to promote human rights and peace building worldwide, managed to visit the home of Sultana Khaya, a peaceful activist for Sawhrawi self-determination who has been arbitrarily confined to her home in Boujdour, Morocco, since November 2020.  
Since then, security forces have decreased their presence outside Sultana Khaya’s house but have reportedly increased their presence in the peripheries of her neighbourhood. Between 17 and 20 March, neighbours, activists and family members were able to access Sultana Khaya’s house and stand in solidarity with her despite the presence of security agents in the neighbourhood. This soon changed as security forces in plain clothes began assaulting and harassing women as they left Sultana Khaya’s house. On 21 March, at least five women were stopped on their way out of Sultana Khaya’s house; they were pushed around by security agents in plain clothes. A woman activist told Amnesty International that security forces beat her and snatched her phone as she left Sultana Khaya’s house on 21 March. She said that the security agents insulted her and refused to give her back her phone. Sultana Khaya’s sister Luaara Khaya, who together with another sister and their mother, is also being held in the same house under de facto house arrest, has been able to leave the house to run errands on several occasions since 16 March and on 5 April, she was able to go to a local administration to renew her passport and came back into the house without being stopped. Sultana Khaya’s mother was able to leave her house and go to Laayoune for medical treatment of shoulder and muscles injuries resulting from police violence.

Additional information  
 Sultana Khaya is the president of an organization called the ‘League for the Defense of Human Rights and against Plunder of Natural Resources’ and is known for her vocal activism in defense of the right of self-determination for the Sahrawi people. She is also a member of the Sahrawi Organ against Moroccan Repression (ISACOM). The unlawful detention of Sultana Khaya and her family is part of a wider crackdown by the Moroccan authorities on Sahrawi activists and critical voices within Western Sahara, which escalated following clashes between Morocco and the Polisario Front in November 2020. A growing number of Sahrawi activists have been subjected to targeted attacks in the past year by the security forces, away from the attention of international media.  
On 10 May 2021, Security forces raided Sultana Khaya’s home, cuffed her sister’s arms and legs and stole valuables, including Sultana Khaya’s phone and computer, after she started a campaign called “my flag on my rooftop” #منزلي_فوق_علمي. They also arrested and tortured three activists who were there to support her and her family. Two days later, on 12 May 2021, dozens of masked members of the security forces raided Sultana Khaya’s house, assaulted and attempted to rape her, and raped her sister. Security forces have previously removed the electricity meter to leave Sultana Khaya and her family with no electricity. From the start of her house arrest, the authorities have failed to present Sultana Khaya with an arrest warrant or a court order, or to inform her of the reason for her arrest. She was only told verbally, by the head of the police forces in Boujdour, that she was forbidden from leaving her house.  
In February 2022, the Moroccan National Council for Human Rights declared having visited Khaya’s house and the latter’s refusal to meet with them. This declaration was followed by a denial by Sultana Khaya that the delegation visited her or communicated with her. In her statement Khaya affirms that “the CNDH is part of the security system in Western Sahara. It serves the occupation agenda and not human rights”.  
Under international human rights law, house arrest is considered as a form of detention and requires certain safeguards to be considered lawful. According to the UN Human Rights Committee’s General Comment 35 on Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, liberty-depriving measures, including house arrest, must not be arbitrary and must be carried out with respect for the rule of law and allow a meaningful and prompt judicial review of detention. Deprivation of liberty, including house arrest, is arbitrary when it results from the exercise of human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.  
Western Sahara is the subject of a territorial dispute between Morocco, which annexed the territory in 1975 and claims sovereignty over it, and the Polisario Front, which calls for an independent state in the territory and has set up a self-proclaimed government-in-exile in the refugee camps in Tindouf, south-west Algeria. A UN settlement in 1991, which ended fighting between Morocco and the Polisario Front, called for a referendum for people of Western Sahara to choose independence or integration into Morocco. The referendum has not yet been held. In recent years, access to Western Sahara has grown increasingly difficult for external monitors as the human rights situation deteriorates. In 2020, Moroccan authorities prevented at least nine lawyers, activists, politicians and journalists from accessing Western Sahara. The UN Security Council has ignored calls by Amnesty International and others to add a human rights component to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO), which would allow for monitoring and reporting on human rights abuses.

Uyghur woman Buheliqiemu Abula and her 13-year-old daughter were detained near Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on 31 March and told by police they faced deportation to China along with two Uyghur men already held. Buheliqiemu Abula is the former wife of Nuermaimaiti Ruze, who with Aimidoula Waili has been detained without charge in Saudi Arabia since November 2020. All four of them are now at risk of deportation to China, where they will highly likely be subjected to arbitrary detention, torture and persecution. Pursuant to the international law, the Saudi authorities must immediately stop their deportation.  
The Chinese government has gone to great lengths to cover up the human rights violations taking place in Xinjiang, and to prevent members of the Uyghur diaspora from speaking up about them. To that end, the Chinese government has been requesting extradition of many Uyghur people living abroad branding them “terrorist” or “extremist” simply for their peaceful activism. Chinese law defines “terrorism” and “extremism” in an overly broad and vague manner, and these laws have been used to crack down on Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.  
There is now ample evidence, including leaked government documents, hundreds of testimonies, as well as drone videos and satellite imagery that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang based on their religion and ethnicity.

Additional information  
54-year-old Uyghur woman Buheliqiemu Abula, who has long-term residence permits in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, had been able to maintain regular contact with her ex-husband Nuermaimaiti Ruze until two weeks ago. The last time she received a phone call from Nuermaimaiti Ruze was on 20 March, when Nuermaimaiti Ruze recounted that he had told the Saudi authorities he and Aimidoula Waili “would rather die here than be sent back to China”.Nuermaimaiti Ruze, a 46-year-old father of five, travelled to Saudi Arabia from China for the first time in June 2013 to perform Umrah and eventually settled down in Mecca, working in a restaurant with a sponsored residence permit.Aimidoula Waili is a Chinese religious scholar of the Uyghur Muslim minority that has been brutally persecuted by the Chinese government since 2017 in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang) in northwestern China.  Aimidoula Waili, a 54-year-old father of four, was previously arrested in Xinjiang in August 2013 because one of the employees at his factory had allegedly incited an uprising. He told Amnesty International that he had been tortured in prison: being electrocuted and forced to stand on ice while wearing nothing but slippers and underwear for up to three hours every day. After completing his sentence, he was released in 2016 and went to Turkey where he was granted residency documents that allowed him to remain in the country indefinitely. In February 2020, he travelled to Saudi Arabia from Turkey on a tourist visa to perform Umrah, a religious pilgrimage, with his friend Nuermaimaiti Ruze.  
Xinjiang is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. More than half of the region’s population of 22 million people belong to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million) and other populations whose languages, cultures and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han who are the majority in “interior” China.  
Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against “terrorism” and “religious extremism”, the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against Muslims living in Xinjiang. It is estimated that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps throughout Xinjiang since 2017.  
In June 2021, Amnesty International published a report revealing how hundreds of thousands of Muslim men and women in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are being subjected to arbitrary mass detention, torture, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation. Testimonies from former internment camp detainees detailed the extreme measures taken by Chinese authorities since 2017 to essentially root out Islamic religious beliefs and traditions, as well as the cultural practices and local languages of the region’s Muslim ethnic groups. Earlier the same year, another piece of Amnesty research described how the children of internment camp detainees are often sent to state-run “orphan camps” where they face indoctrination and are cut off from their parents.  
Amnesty International has documented numerous cases where Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other Turkic Muslim people in Xinjiang had been detained simply for living, travelling, or studying abroad or for communicating with people abroad. Many were detained simply for being “connected” with people who lived, travelled, studied, or communicated with people abroad.   
Amnesty International has launched an international campaign calling for the closure of the internment camps, with more than 70 detailed casefiles on some of those thought to be currently detained. As of September 2021, more than 300,000 signatures had been collected from all over the world to demand the release all those currently detained in internment camps and prisons in Xinjiang.  
The evidence Amnesty International has gathered provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.

Additional information  
Haris Azhar and Fatia Maulidiyanti are well-known Indonesian human rights defenders. Azhar is also a lecturer, an advocate, and the executive director of Lokataru Foundation, a civil society organization defending human rights. Maulidiyanti is the coordinator of KontraS, an organization well-known for exposing human rights violations and advocating on behalf of victims of human rights violations since Indonesia’s Soeharto era.   
On 20 August 2021, Haris Azhar uploaded a video on his YouTube channel containing a conversation between himself and Fatia Maulidiyanti about a report that mentioned that some companies were allegedly involved in the exploration of Wabu Block gold mine in Intan Jaya, Papua.  The report is entitled “Political Economy Study of Military Placement in Papua: The Case of Intan Jaya,” which was launched on 12 August 2021. The research was conducted by researchers from nine organizations, including KontraS. The research argues the existence of a relationship between concessions granted by the Indonesian government to some companies and the deployment of the military in Papua.  
Following the release of the video, the Coordinating Minister for Maritime and Investment Affairs, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, sent two subpoenas on 26 August and 2 September. According to his spokesperson, the summons were aimed at asking Haris and Fatia to explain the motive, intention, and purpose behind the video’s dialogue. The Minister felt that the video reflects untrue opinions, character assassinations, and fake news.  
On 29 August, Haris explained that the data mentioned in the dialogue came from the report produced by multiple civil society organizations, which outlined the alleged involvement of several military figures in the mining industry.   
On 21 October, Haris Azhar and Fatia Maulidiyanti were summoned by Jakarta’s Police for mediation. Haris Azhar and Fatia Maulidiyanti were present, but the Coordinating Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan was not. The mediation was postponed indefinitely.  
On 17 March 2022, Haris Azhar and Fatia Maulidiyanti were accused of defamation and charged under article 27 of ITE Law. On 21 March, both were summoned by Jakarta’s Police for the investigation process.  
Amnesty International Indonesia has recorded at least 367 cases of prosecution, arrest, attack and intimidation of human rights defenders by various actors from January to December 2021. Meanwhile, over 100 people have been reported under the ITE Law, most of them accused of defamation, during the same period.

Amnesty International’s Crisis Response investigators interviewed more than 20 people from villages and towns close to Kyiv, several of whom had witnessed or had direct knowledge of horrifying violence committed by Russian forces. 
They repeatedly told of deliberate killings, unlawful violence, and widespread intimidation by Russian forces against unarmed civilians across the Kyiv region. 
In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes, 
“Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality. 
“The intentional killing of civilians is a human rights violation and a war crime. These deaths must be thoroughly investigated, and those responsible must be prosecuted, including up the chain of command.” 
To date, Amnesty International has obtained evidence that civilians were killed in  indiscriminate attacks in Kharkiv and Sumy Oblast, documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv, and gathered evidence from civilians living under siege in Kharkiv, Izium and Mariupol. 
Locations where Amnesty International has documented extrajudicial executions and unlawful killings by Russian forces 
One 46-year-old woman, from the village of Bohdanivka, said Russian forces entered her village on 7 or 8 March, and parked their tanks on the streets. 
In the evening of 9 March, the woman – who lived with her husband, 10-year-old daughter and mother-in-law – heard shooting through their downstairs windows. She and her husband shouted that they were civilians, and that they were unarmed. When they came downstairs, two Russian soldiers pushed them and their daughter into a boiler room. 
She told Amnesty International: “They forced us in and slammed the door. After just a minute they opened the door, they asked my husband if he had cigarettes. He said no, he hadn’t smoked for a couple of weeks. They shot him in his right arm. The other said, ‘Finish him,’ and they shot him in the head. 
“He didn’t die right away. From 9.30pm to 4am he was still breathing, though he wasn’t conscious. I begged him… ’If you can hear me, please move your finger’. He didn’t move his finger, but I put his hand on my knee and squeezed it. Blood was flowing out of him. When he took his last breath, I turned to my daughter and said, ‘It seems daddy has died’.” 
A neighbour witnessed Russian forces breaking into the woman’s house that night, and confirmed he had seen her husband’s body slumped in the corner of the boiler room. The woman and her child escaped from Bohdanivka later that day. The woman’s mother-in-law, aged 81, has limited mobility and was left behind. 
On 3 March, Kateryna Tkachova, 18, was at home in the village of Vorzel with her parents when several tanks displaying the letter ‘Z’ – which Russian forces have used to mark their vehicles during the invasion of Ukraine – were driven down their street. 
Her mother Nataliya and father Valeryi left the cellar where they were hiding to go into the street, after telling Katerina to stay where she was. Kateryna then heard gunshots. 
She told Amnesty International: “Once the tanks had passed by, I jumped over the fence to the neighbour’s house. I wanted to check if they’re alive. I looked over the fence and saw my mother lying on her back on one side of the road, and my father was face down on the other side of the street. I saw large holes in his coat. The next day I went to them. My father had six large holes in his back, my mother had a smaller hole in her chest.” 
Kateryna said that her parents were dressed in civilian clothing and unarmed. On 10 March, a volunteer involved in evacuations from areas around Kyiv helped Kateryna leave Vorzel. The volunteer told Amnesty International he had seen the bodies of Kateryna’s parents lying in the street near her house. In a video verified by Amnesty International, the pair can be seen writing Kateryna’s parents’ names, dates of birth, and dates of death on a piece of cardboard, before placing it beside their bodies, which are covered with blankets. 
During the first days of Russian occupation of the city of Hostomel, Taras Kuzmak was driving around delivering food and medication to bomb shelters where civilians were gathering. 
At 1.30pm on 3 March, he was with the city’s mayor, Yuryi Prylypko, and two other men, when their car came under gunfire from the direction of a large residential complex that had been seized by Russian forces. The men tried to jump out of the car, but one man, Ivan Zorya, was killed immediately, while Yuryi Prylypko fell to the ground injured after being shot. Taras Kuzmak and the other surviving man hid behind an excavator for hours as shooting continued. 
He told Amnesty International: “They noticed us and immediately opened fire, there was no warning. I could only hear the mayor [Prylypko]. I knew he was injured, but I didn’t know if it was fatal or not. I just told him to lie still, not to make any moves… They shot at us again at around 3pm, and about half-an-hour after that, I understood there was no life from him. There is a kind of breathing somebody has only right before they die, their last breath. Ivan Zorya’s head was taken off, I think they must have been using something high-calibre.” 
Two other Hostomel residents told Amnesty International they had seen Yuryi Prylypko’s body near a church when an impromptu funeral was held for him several days later. Other residents confirmed that in the days leading up to his death, Yuryi Prylypko had been delivering food and medication around the city, always driving a civilian vehicle. 
Amnesty International collected three additional accounts of unlawful killings of civilians, including the account of a survivor of rape whose husband was extrajudicially executed, by Russian forces. 
A woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty International that, on 9 March, two Russian soldiers had entered her house, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. The woman was able to escape from the village to Ukrainian-controlled territory with her son. 
Milena, a 24-year-old from Bucha, told Amnesty International that she saw the body of a woman who had lived on her street lying outside her house. The woman’s mother told Milena that her daughter was shot in the initial days of the invasion while looking over her fence at a Russian military vehicle. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab independently verified video footage that confirmed the location of the shallow grave in which she was buried. 
Volodymyr Zakhliupanyy and his wife fled the city of Hostomel in the first few days of the invasion, but their son Serhiy, 39, was determined to stay. 
Initially, they spoke by telephone every day, and Serhiy described the heavy fighting in the city. On 4 March, Volodymyr could no longer contact his son. Friends who remained in the city then tried to find Serhiy, and went to the building where he had been sheltering in the basement. 
Volodymyr told Amnesty International: “When they asked the neighbours, they said that on 13 March my son was taken away [from the basement] by the Russians. When they went looking for Serhiy, they found him behind the garages of the same building… they said he had been shot in the head.” 
Interviewees told Amnesty International they had lost access to electricity, water, and gas in the early days of the invasion, and there was very limited access to food. There was little mobile phone connectivity, and some interviewees said Russian soldiers had confiscated or destroyed mobile phones whenever they saw residents carrying them, or threatened them with violence for having a phone. 
Threats of violence and intimidation were also widespread. One man in Hostomel said that he saw an entire dormitory of people who were sheltering from shelling who were forced to go outside, where Russian military officers immediately fired gunshots over their heads, forcing them to drop to the ground. Two men from Bucha also said snipers regularly shot at them when they went to salvage food from a destroyed grocery store near their home. 
“As these horrendous accounts of life under Russian occupation continue to emerge, the victims in Ukraine must know that the international community is determined to secure accountability for their suffering,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Deliberate killings of civilians, rape, torture, and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war are human rights violations and war crimes. Those who directly commit war crimes should be held criminally responsible for them. Under the doctrine of command responsibility, hierarchal superiors – including commanders and civilian leaders, such as ministers and heads of state – who knew or had reason to know about war crimes committed by their forces, but did not attempt to stop them or punish those responsible, should also be held criminally responsible. 
Amnesty International is documenting violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the war in Ukraine. All of Amnesty International’s outputs published to date – including news updates, briefings and investigations – can be found here.

Amhara regional security forces and civilian authorities in Ethiopia’s Western Tigray Zone have committed widespread abuses against Tigrayans since November 2020 that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today (6 April). Ethiopian authorities have severely restricted access and independent scrutiny of the region, keeping the campaign of ethnic cleansing largely hidden. 
The report, ‘We Will Erase You From This Land’: Crimes Against Humanity and Ethnic Cleansing in Ethiopia’s Western Tigray Zone, documents how newly-appointed officials in Western Tigray and security forces from the neighbouring Amhara region, with the acquiescence and possible participation of Ethiopian federal forces, systematically expelled several hundred thousand Tigrayan civilians from their homes using threats, unlawful killings, sexual violence, mass arbitrary detention, pillage, forcible transfer, and the denial of humanitarian assistance. These widespread and systematic attacks against the Tigrayan civilian population amount to crimes against humanity, as well as war crimes. 
Since November 2020, Amhara officials and security forces have engaged in a relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing to force Tigrayans in Western Tigray from their homes,

Although the declaration of emergency was revoked nine days later, questions remain about the circumstances leading up to the use of the Emergencies Act and whether its use was legally justified. 
Amnesty International previously expressed concern about the impacts of the protest on people from marginalized communities. We emphasized that peaceful protests are a fundamental part of a vibrant society and noted that protecting the right to protest contributes to the protection of other human rights. However, the rights to free expression and assembly under international law are not absolute. 
Amnesty International questions the government’s reliance on the Emergencies Act to address the Ottawa convoy protests. The powers contained in the Act are extraordinary, which is why they can only be resorted to in extremely narrow, prescribed circumstances. To invoke the Public Order Emergency, as the government did, it must have believed that the lives, health, or safety of Canadians had been seriously endangered, and that neither the provinces, nor existing laws, could deal with that danger. Without knowing the evidence that the government relied on to support this belief, it is difficult to assess whether the threshold was met. 
However, Amnesty previously noted with concern the largely permissive response the Ottawa police had to the protest in the weeks leading up to the invocation of the emergency. The apparent inaction by the Ottawa police does not lead to the conclusion that expanded powers were necessary, and instead calls into question whether existing powers could have been used to appropriately address the situation. The rule of law does not allow the government to expand its powers when it is convenient, even when faced with a difficult situation. Until the legal threshold is met, governments and police are required to respond using their existing powers. 
International law also recognizes the possibility that certain rights may be limited if an emergency “threatens the life of the nation”, but only allows rights to be limited to the extent required by the situation. While it is again difficult to assess whether the threshold was met, it is apparent that the rights of people in Canada were not narrowly limited, as the emergency was not limited to specific protests or geographic locations and instead applied across the country. 
Amnesty International is concerned about whether the use of the Emergencies Act was legally justified in this instance, and about the implications of the use of the Act for future protests. Because law enforcement powers are used disproportionately against marginalized groups, normalizing the expansion of these powers sets a dangerous precedent for future protests by marginalized groups, who may rely on disruptive tactics to exercise their freedom of assembly and right to protest. 
Under the Emergencies Act, the government is now required to hold an inquiry into the circumstances that led to the declaration of an emergency and the measures taken for dealing with the emergency. Amnesty International calls on the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of the Emergency to carry out the inquiry in a transparent, timely, and non-partisan manner and to ensure that meetings are held in public, except where explicitly prohibited by the Act. We urge the Committee to recall Canada’s obligations under international and domestic law, and to consider whether the restrictions implemented under the Emergencies Act were rights-maximizing and legally justified.

(Ottawa, April 4, 2022) – Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees in provincial jails is inconsistent with international human rights standards, and jail conditions potentially breach federal-provincial immigration detention contracts, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. The groups released a legal memorandum about the practice today, on Canada’s Refugee Rights Day.  
The federal-provincial contracts, which are not public but were obtained through access to information requests, obligate the provinces to provide just and humane treatment to immigration detainees in provincial jails and to avoid co-mingling them with people imprisoned under the criminal justice system, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. Conditions in provincial jails are abusive, and these facilities are also inherently punitive and should not be used for immigration detention. 
“Canada should get on the path to abolishing immigration detention, and immediately end the incarceration of immigration detainees in provincial jails,” said Samer Muscati, acting deputy disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The provinces should urgently cancel these detention contracts and stop their complicity in the abuses taking places in their jails.” 
Every year, Canada incarcerates hundreds of people on immigration-related grounds in dozens of provincial jails across the country, including in maximum-security facilities. People in immigration detention are regularly handcuffed, shackled, restricted to small spaces with rigid routines, and placed under constant surveillance. They are routinely held in the same wings and cells as people held on criminal charges or convictions. 
Migrants and refugee claimants in immigration detention who have mental health conditions may be placed in provincial jails and in solitary confinement specifically because of their health conditions, the groups said. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has justified this discriminatory and abusive practice by claiming that people with these health conditions have “access to specialized care” in provincial jails, and that the authorities can “effectively manage them in light of their behavior” in these facilities. 
In October 2021, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International launched the #WelcomeToCanada campaign in British Columbia, calling on provincial authorities to terminate their agreements with the federal government and to stop allowing the border agency to transfer immigration detainees to provincial jails. 
In a positive development, the British Columbia government said in January that it will review its agreement and conclude the review in June. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International made a joint submission to the review, along with local and national grassroots organizations, advocates, and people with lived experiences in immigration detention. 
On April 4, the #WelcomeToCanada campaign delivered a petition to Quebec provincial authorities with more than 7,000 signatures from the public calling on the province to end its agreement with the border agency. 
The campaign is now broadening to the province of Nova Scotia, where immigration detainees are held in provincial jails by default because the province has no dedicated immigration holding center. According to access to information requests, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have learned that the federal government pays Nova Scotia one of the highest per diem rates in the country, at nearly $400 per person. 
“The first thing I saw in Canada was jail,” said a refugee claimant from Afghanistan who was detained in a provincial jail in Nova Scotia upon his arrival in 2017. “I thought Canada was better than this… We are human like you, but we have no country.” 
The border agency has full discretion over where people in immigration detention are held, with no legal standard guiding the agency’s decision to hold a person in a provincial jail rather than an immigration holding center. Following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the agency has relied more heavily on provincial jails, holding 40 percent of immigration detainees in those facilities in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. This was double the percentage in previous years. 
The scope of the border agency’s authority is immense compared with other law enforcement agencies in Canada, such as the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International found. The agency is empowered to enter arrangements with foreign states and international organizations, as well as agreements or arrangements with provincial governments, departments or agencies of the Canadian government, or “any person or organization.” It also remains the only major law enforcement agency in Canada without independent civilian oversight, despite documented abuses in immigration detention. 
In January 2022, a person died in the border agency’s custody at the immigration detention center in Laval. The agency has refused to release any information regarding the person’s identity, why they were detained, and the circumstances of their death. Since 2000, at least 16 people have died in the border agency’s custody, and most were held in a provincial jail at the time. 
“CBSA lacks independent civilian oversight to monitor the exercise of its immense powers, which makes it difficult to hold it to account,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, secretary general of Amnesty International Canada. “It is clear that serious human rights abuses take place within the immigration detention system, which is why provincial authorities should end their involvement with this reprehensible regime.”

On 25 April 2022, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals granted an indefinite stay of execution to Melissa Lucio, two days before she was scheduled to be put to death.  It remanded the case to the trial court to consider her innocence and other claims in the light of new expert and scientific evidence. Amnesty International believes that her trial did not meet international fair trial standards, that there are serious doubts about the reliability of her conviction, and that her execution in such circumstances would violate international law.    
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Melissa Lucio was convicted in July 2008 of the capital murder of her two-year-old daughter in February 2007. When the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined on 31 March 2022 to revisit its earlier rulings upholding the death sentence and conviction of Melissa Lucio, one of the judges described the case as a “systematic failure, producing a train of injustice”, one “shadowed” by the subsequent federal conviction for corruption of the prosecutor (who is “now serving a 13-year federal sentence for selling his office over a time-period in which this indictment [of Melissa Lucio] was returned”).  
On 15 April 2022, Melissa Lucio’s lawyers filed a 242-page habeas corpus petition asking the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) to stay the execution and vacate her conviction and death sentence. The petition contained new scientific and expert evidence casting serious doubt on the reliability of incriminating statements Melissa Lucio made during a five-hour interrogation conducted immediately after her child’s death, explained why her life history of trauma and abuse at the hands of men left her particularly susceptible to making a false confession under such an interrogation, described the state’s investigative tunnel vision and use of scientifically invalid testimony, and raised further doubts about whether there was a crime at all, rather than the child’s death being the result of an accidental fall.  
In its order on 25 April 2022, the TCCA ruled that four of the nine claims raised in the habeas corpus petition met the requirements of Texas statutory law for review on the merits by the trial court.  These four issues are: “but for the State’s use of false testimony, no jury would have convicted her”; “previously unavailable scientific evidence would preclude her conviction”; “she is actually innocent”; “the State suppressed favourable, material evidence”.  The TCCA remanded those four claims to the trial court for review and stayed the execution pending resolution of the claims.   
The TCCA’s decision came shortly before the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (BPP) was due to vote on whether to recommend that Governor Greg Abbott commute the death sentence or issue a 120-day reprieve from execution. The clemency petition filed before them in March 2008, containing the new scientific and expert evidence, was supplemented on 12 April by Melissa Lucio’s lawyers, to include further expert evidence, and a declaration from a fifth trial juror (who had served as the jury foreperson) to join the four others and an alternate juror who had already declared their opposition to the execution or support for a new trial.   
Melissa Lucio’s lawyers have expressed their gratitude “to the hundreds of thousands of Texans and people around the US and the world who advocated for Melissa”.

Additional Information:  
On 7 May 2021, the Prosecutor in Warszawa – Praga issued a warrant to confiscate several items from Justyna’s home, including all “means of telecommunication” after receiving information about her involvement in supporting a pregnant woman who sought help to obtain abortion pills for a self-managed abortion at the start of the health pandemic in 2020. On 1 June 2021, the police carried out a house-search of Justina’s house, during which medicines in the form of pills, a computer, pen drives and mobile phones of her and her two children were confiscated. On 22 November 2021, the prosecutor brought charges against Justyna for helping with an abortion (Article 152.2 Penal Code) and for possession of medicines without authorization for the purpose of introducing them into the market (Article 124 Pharmaceutical Code). The pills confiscated by the police in Justyna’s flat contained mifepristone and misoprostol, two medicines included in the Essential Medicines List of the World Health Organization (WHO). The prosecutor has argued that two of the medicines confiscated do not have authorization in Poland. The first court hearing on the case is expected for 8 April in Warsaw.  
Justyna Wydrzyńska is an activist and a doula that accompanies people throughout abortions. She is one of the four founders of Abortion Dream Team, an activist collective that campaigns against abortion stigma in Poland and offers trainings and non-judgmental advice on how to get a safe abortion. Since 2019 Abortion Dream Team is part of Abortion Without Borders, a grassroot feminist network formed by six organizations from Poland and other parts of Europe that provides information, counselling, funding and practical support to people in Poland who need an abortion abroad, or access to reliable online sources to obtain abortion medicines that enable safe self-managed abortions at home, as doing your own abortion is not a crime in Poland. The activities of Abortion Dream Team have been on the radar of the Polish authorities for the past few years. and the activists operate in an increasingly hostile environment, exposed to misogynistic and smear campaigns.  
Poland’s abortion legislation is among the most restrictive in Europe. On 22 October 2020, a highly questioned Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled that abortion on the grounds of fatal or severe fetal impairment was unconstitutional and eliminated one of the few remaining legal grounds for abortion. Prior to the ruling entering into force on 27 January 2021 over 90 percent of the approximately 1,000 legal abortions in the health system annually performed in Poland were on this ground.  
Currently, abortions under the scope of the health system are only permitted on two grounds: when the pregnancy endangers the life or health of the pregnant woman and when it is the result of a rape or incest. Even in those situations, multiple barriers combine to limit pregnant peoples ‘access to abortion in practice, particularly those from low-income and rural communities. In addition, activists and women’s rights organizations report that the 2020 court ruling is having a significant chilling effect as medical professionals, fear repercussions even in situations where abortion remains legal, exacerbating the health risks for women and all pregnant people seeking an abortion.    
Mere possession or self-management of abortion-inducing medicines is not a crime in Poland but any person or doctor who helps pregnant people to obtain an abortion outside the limited grounds permitted in the law is liable to up to three-years in prison. Legal restrictions and other barriers, including abortion stigma, mean that women and all pregnant people find it difficult or impossible to access medicines and quality abortion care and they risk inducing abortion themselves using unsafe methods or seeking abortion from unskilled providers. Against this backdrop, people in Poland in need of a safe abortion rely on Justyna and other members of Abortion Dream Team and Abortion Without Borders for trustworthy information and lifesaving support. Between January 2021 and 2022, Abortion Without Borders was contacted by more than 32.000 people in Poland, a fivefold increase from the previous year, and supported over 1,500 individuals to travel abroad for an abortion. Their work remains crucial now as thousands of refugees fleeing from the war in Ukraine are arriving in Poland with critical healthcare needs, including around sexual and reproductive health.   
Access to safe abortion is a human right. No one should be punished for obtaining an abortion or providing abortion medication or services or in any way helping people obtaining abortion medication or services. Full decriminalization of abortion is an essential component of respecting, protecting, and fulfilling the human rights of all people who can become pregnant.  
The Polish authorities should drop all charges against Justyna, carry out the necessary reforms to repeal Article 152 in the Penal Code and ensure access to safe abortion care respecting pregnant person’s rights, autonomy, dignity, privacy, and confidentiality. Polish authorities should also ensure adequate access to essential medicines required for the purpose of safe self-management of abortions in an affordable and non-discriminatory manner, including by using telemedicine in line with recent WHO guidelines on abortion care.

Prominent lawyer and former president of the Tunisian Bar Association Abderazzak Kilani will appear before the Military Court of First Instance in Tunis on 12 May. On 2 January 2022, security forces prevented him from exercising his duties as a lawyer by not allowing him to visit his arbitrarily detained client, former Justice Minister Noureddine Bhiri. He is prosecuted on the basis of a “verbal exchange” with police officers following that incident. He faces up to six years imprisonment if convicted. His trial is a dangerous precedent and an assault on fair trial rights in Tunisia. Amnesty International calls on the authorities to drop the baseless charges against him and stop prosecuting civilians before military courts.  
The prosecution of civilians before military courts is contrary to international law, as ratified by Tunisia. Moreover, his prosecution is in an assault on the right to legal representation as he was not only prevented from visiting his client but is also now on trial for trying to do so.  
On 21 January, a military prosecutor charged Abderrazak Kilani under Penal Code articles 79, 125 and 136. He stands accused of participating in a gathering that disturbs public order, insulting state officials and obstructing the work of police officers carrying their duty. The accusations are based on a filmed “verbal exchange” Abderazzak Kilani had with the police on 2 January, outside of the Habib Bougatfa Hospital in Bizerte, north of Tunis, where he was visiting his client, former Justice Minister, Noureddine Bhir. Amnesty International has reviewed a video of the incident and considers neither Abderrazak Kilani’s actions nor his words to constitute threats, incitement to violence, or obstruction of police work.  
At a hearing on 2 March, an investigative judge at the Military Court of First Instance in Tunis ordered Abderazzak Kilani’s imprisonment in Mornaguia prison. On 21 March, he was released after 19 days of unjust detention. The case has since been moved to trial, which is scheduled to start on 12 May. If convicted, Abderazzak Kilani faces up to six years in prison.  
Abderazzak Kilani’s prosecution by a military court violates Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Tunisia has ratified. That article guarantees the right to “a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.” His prosecution also undermines his right to freedom of expression and his right to exercise his profession as a lawyer seeking to have access to his client which creates a dangerous precedent for lawyers and undermines fair trial guarantees.

Additional information  
Abderazzak Kilani is a lawyer, former president of the Tunisian Bar Association, former minister in charge of government’s relations with the parliament from 2011 to 2013, and Tunisian ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva from 2013 to 2014. He is also a member of legal defense team of Noureddine Bhiri, a former justice minister and senior official of the Ennahdha party whom authorities detained arbitrarily for 67 days before releasing him without charge on 7 March 2022. Throughout his detention, he was denied his right to have access to his lawyers.  
On 31 December 2021, the authorities detained Noureddine Bhiri outside his home in Tunis and carried him off to an undisclosed location. His wife, also a lawyer, who witnessed the arrest, immediately called on fellow lawyers for help. Abderazzak Kilani began coordinating Noureddine Bhiri’s legal defence team. On 2 January, Abderazzak Kilani and Noureddine Bhiri’s wife, together with other lawyers, went to Bougatfa Hospital, in the city of Bizerte, where they had learned that Bhiri had been brought by authorities, and attempted to go inside and visit him. Abderrazak Kilani and Akremi told Amnesty International how police who were deployed outside the hospital barred Akremi from entering to see Bhiri unless she agreed to sign a document whose contents she did not know, and barred Abderazzak Kilani from entering to see Bhiri entirely.

Abderrazak Kilani and Akremi told Amnesty International how police who were deployed outside the hospital barred Akremi from entering to see Bhiri unless she agreed to sign a document whose contents she did not know, and barred Abderazzak Kilani from entering to see Bhiri entirely.  
Abderrazak Kilani told the police that in barring him from the hospital they risked exposing themselves to prosecution, comparing the situation to that of security officers tried for human rights violations committed under former presidents Habib Bourguiba and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali before specialized transitional justice courts set up after the 2011 revolution that ousted Ben Ali. The exchange was filmed and posted on social media, in a video that Abderazzak Kilani confirmed to Amnesty International showed his encounter with police outside the hospital.  
A military judge investigated the incident at Habib Bougatfa Hospital, on which the charges brought against Abderazzak Kilani are based on and confirmed that the “verbal exchange” Abderazzak Kilani had with police officers on 2 January outside of the Habib Bougatfa Hospital, in Bizerte served as basis for his prosecution.   
Tunisian law grants military courts jurisdiction to prosecute civilians in some circumstances, including for offenses under the penal code that are committed in certain circumstances against security personnel as per Article 22 of Law 1982-70 regulating the status of internal security forces.  
Legal representation is fundamental to fair trial rights as guaranteed by treaties that Tunisia has ratified. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. According to the United Nation’s Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, governments should ensure lawyers “are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference”.  
Tunisia’s military courts do not fulfil the requirement of independence because the president has final say over the appointment of judges and prosecutors to military courts. In addition, both the general prosecutor who heads the military justice system, as well as all prosecutors in the military courts, who play a pivotal role in initiating proceedings, are serving members of the military and subject to military disciplinary procedures. This places them under the influence of the executive branch, since the president is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces under Tunisia’s constitution.  
Since President Saied’s power grab on 25 July 2021, military courts have increasingly investigated and prosecuted civilians, including a journalist, a blogger and opposition politicians.

Amnesty International published an open letter to President Nayib Bukele today, expressing concern about the actions of the Salvadoran authorities in response to the dramatic increase in homicides reported last weekend. 
“The drastic rise in homicides has made it clear that public security challenges remain. Amnesty International stands in solidarity with the families and communities of those who died violently last weekend, and with all victims of violence and human rights abuses in El Salvador,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“Undoubtedly, the critical levels of violence that the country has been facing for years demand urgent action to protect the lives and safety of people in the face of criminality. To this end, the state is obliged to design and implement measures that are necessary, effective, proportional and in accordance with human rights. However, many of the actions that the Salvadoran authorities have implemented so far are unacceptable and in no way justified.” 
 Critical levels of violence demand urgent action to protect the lives and safety of people in the face of criminality. However, many of the actions that the Salvadoran authorities have implemented so far are unacceptable and in no way justified.”  
The Emergency Decree and the legal reforms undertaken to instruments such as the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure contain precepts that flagrantly violate the rights to due process and judicial guarantees. The Salvadoran authorities must guarantee the population a comprehensive response that respects human rights. 
“In 2019, when Amnesty International met with President Bukele, he pledged to be a fresh voice and to distance himself from models of governance that disrespect human rights in Central America. However, throughout his term in office we have observed consistent non-compliance with his commitments and a context where human rights are constantly at risk and deteriorating,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“President Bukele has shown that, not only has he not changed the failed policies of past governments in El Salvador, but he repeats them despite knowing the outcome. Human rights violations cannot be the solution to violence; they only worsen the grave situation, generating a context of abuses and arbitrariness from which there is no return.”

For the first time, Amnesty International field investigators in Ukraine have independently verified physical evidence of banned cluster munitions, the use of which violates international law. They have also collected testimony that documents Russian siege tactics, including unlawful indiscriminate attacks, disruption of basic utilities, cuts to communication, destruction of civilian infrastructure, and restrictions on access to medicine and healthcare.   
In recent weeks, Russian forces have been using inherently indiscriminate weapons – such as cluster munitions, and inaccurate weapons with wide-area effects such as unguided ‘dumb’ bombs and Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) salvos – in attacks on densely-populated civilian areas. 
As such, Russian forces’ assaults on towns and cities and wanton destruction of the infrastructure of daily life violates international humanitarian law and international human rights law. Launching indiscriminate attacks which kill or injure civilians also constitute war crimes. 
A defining feature of these cruel sieges is Russia’s relentless indiscriminate attacks, which cause utterly devastating harm over time, 
“For five weeks now, civilians across Ukraine have seen their cities razed day-by-day. Our on-the-ground research has documented how some of society’s most at-risk people are disproportionately suffering as these brutal siege tactics continue. 
“Civilians trapped in cities under siege must urgently have access to humanitarian corridors to enable the safe evacuation of all who wish to leave. Humanitarian supplies must also be allowed to reach those who remain behind.” 
Amnesty International conducted in-person and remote interviews with people who experienced sieges in five cities, including Kharkiv and Mariupol. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed relevant satellite imagery, and verified videos and photos of the incidents described below. In the coming weeks, Amnesty International will publish further evidence gathered during on-the-ground investigations in Ukraine. 
Russian forces reached the northern suburbs of Kharkiv in the first days of the invasion, and quickly implemented siege tactics, attempting to encircle the city and firing inaccurate weapons into populated areas. 
Amnesty International has documented a broad pattern of unlawful indiscriminate attacks across populated areas in Kharkiv. On 28 February, three MLRS salvos struck the northern part of the city and killed at least nine civilians, including children, and wounded at least another 18. 
In an attack on the morning of 4 March, Olesky Stovba, a 41-year-old father, was injured by a cluster munition while buying groceries on Zaliznychna Street in Kharkiv’s Mala-Danylivka district. 
He told Amnesty International: “We found some food, and we stood outside the food shop and I heard a great sound. I turned myself and I saw a lot of little fire. It was the height of my knees, 50 metres from me. I fell down, and my wife too, and I felt something hit my right leg… I pulled down my trousers and saw lots of blood.” 
Surgeons later removed three fragments from his right groin, calf, and foot. Amnesty International’s Crisis Response weapons investigator examined the physical evidence in person, and confirmed the largest fragment was from either a 9N210 or 9N235 cluster munition. 
Kharkiv’s Saltivka district has also been repeatedly targeted during the siege of the city. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified 22 incidents in the district, showing damage to civilian areas including schools, residential blocks, food markets, and a tram depot, between 27 February and 16 March. Photos from strikes depict remnants of Smerch rockets and cluster munitions across the area. 
One man*, who has been running a bomb shelter in Saltivka, told Amnesty International: “It has become my new reality — shootings and bombings, helping old women out of the rubble, no gas, no water, no electricity. Once every three days, we boil ice for water. There are 300 people in the shelter. The majority are older, fragile, [they have] asthma, diabetes. There are some who haven’t left the shelter in three weeks. The biggest problem in Saltivka is that the elderly die for lack of medicine, from shock, from a heart attack. It is important to get them in the ground and bury them, it will get warmer soon and they will decompose.” 
In a shelter in Lviv, Amnesty International researchers interviewed a 16-year-old girl who had been evacuated alone from Kharkiv. The organization verified a photo showing the remains of a 220mm Uragan rocket that struck close to her family’s apartment complex, which is near a school. 
She told Amnesty International: “The missile struck at night, and I smelled the fire and felt the waves. All of my family, we all live in the corridor of the apartment building from the first day of the war.” 
Amnesty International has previously confirmed that cluster munitions killed a child and two other civilians taking shelter at a preschool in Sumy Oblast, and documented an airstrike that killed civilians queueing for food in Chernihiv. 
Communication with civilians in besieged cities is extremely difficult due to disrupted mobile and internet service. Many people spend the majority of their time in underground bomb shelters with weak or no signal. Access to communications and the internet are essential for safety, and for access to vital information regarding possible evacuation routes. 
In the cities of Kharkiv and Izium, compounds containing TV towers were damaged by strikes. Open-source research and satellite imagery analysis by Amnesty International shows that Kharkiv’s TV tower compound was likely damaged twice between 27 February and 17 March, and service outages were reported from 6 March. A building associated with Izium’s TV tower was damaged on 12 March, then further damaged by 20 March. Open-source reports again confirmed disruption to broadcasting. Many older residents rely on television for news and for emergency information from the government. 
Amnesty International previously documented how civilians in Izium are on the brink of a humanitarian disaster as Russian forces have bombarded the town since the invasion began. 
The conflict continues to have a significant impact on older people and people with disabilities, which siege warfare further exacerbates. 
Alexander Mihta, a 39-year-old in Kharkiv, is diabetic and has severe trouble walking due to the damage the disease has caused to his feet. He drove his wife and daughter to the Polish border, but then had to stay in Ukraine following the implementation of martial law. His apartment building in Kharkiv was struck by Smerch rockets, which smashed steam pipes, cutting heating and flooding the lower floors. Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified 21 photos that confirmed damage to the residential building. Mihta later escaped to a shelter in Lviv with his father. 
He told Amnesty International: “The shelling worsened the whole time. I needed food, so I left and went to shop. I have diabetes and I ran when the shelling worsened, and I twisted my leg. I was trying to get to the bomb shelter but couldn’t. I broke six bones, and they [doctors] want to amputate.” 
Amnesty International also interviewed a 61-year-old woman* who has stayed in Kharkiv to care for her mother, aged 84, who has dementia and is unable to travel. 
She said: “The old people, we are staying. My mother can hardly move… We are from Luhansk and had to get my mother from Luhansk… We left for my daughter’s flat in Kharkiv and we are stuck here. One in every 24 hours we spend outside. 
“I talk to my mother. I take her to the toilet and help her undress. I have to always explain to her why we are in Kharkiv, and why we are in the basement. She has dementia and always forgets why she is in the basement, and I have to tell her all day long. She used to have a decent life, she could walk in the garden. Not anymore.” 
Older people and people with disabilities, as well as other groups who may face particular risks and challenges when fleeing, should be prioritized for evacuation, as specificied in international humanitarian law. Planning and communication about evacuations and safe humanitarian corridors must also be undertaken in an inclusive way, including by ensuring that information, transportation, and services are all accessible.

More than a thousand environmental and land defenders have been killed since the Paris Agreement was signed, many of them Indigenous defenders. Thousands more defenders have been threatened with death, attacked or unjustly thrown in jail to silence them. Nowhere is the situation more dangerous than in countries of Latin America, with Indigenous, racialized and women defenders at particular risk.  
Solidarity action is vital to support those whose efforts protect us all. 
Solidarity is important. When Canadians speak out,       it carries a lot of weight … 
Bernardo Caal Xol is a Maya Q’eqchi’ teacher in northern Guatemala who was chosen by his people to take legal action against the construction of hydroelectric dams that violate Indigenous rights and have dried up water of vital importance to Indigenous communities. To silence Bernardo’s voice of leadership, authorities charged him with crimes he did not commit and sentenced him to more than 7 years in jail, without any evidence. 
These injustices continue to be courageously challenged by Bernardo’s family and the communities he represents. Amnesty International Canada is working with them to echo their voices and press for Bernardo’s release so he can continue to defend Indigenous rights and the water that guarantees life for all. 
It has been an honor to have your accompaniment. It gives us a lot of hope, a lot of strength and fortitude. 
Sign our e-action. If you are one of the more than 18,000 people who have already signed, THANK YOU! Now, please be a champion and encourage others to sign too so that we can gather more than 20,000 signatures and increase pressure for Bernardo’s release. Consider approaching teachers or professors in your community explaining that Bernardo is honoured in his community as a dedicated teacher. If you belong to a trade union or have friends who are, encourage sign-ons by union members, explaining that Bernardo has also been an active leader in the union that represents teachers in Guatemala. 
Write a letter. It’s a powerful, personal way to put pressure on Guatemalan authorities. Find the instructions here. You may want to mention that January 30 marks 4 years since Bernardo was jailed unjustly for a crime he did not commit. 
Organize an online film screening of Water: The Blood of Mother Nature, a powerful 40-minute documentary from Guatemala about the inspiring struggle of Bernardo Caal Xol and the Q’eqchi communities he represents. You can also screen a beautiful 3-minute short in which Bernardo’s teenaged daughter Ni’kte’ explains what is at stake. Then invite viewers to take action. For more information, contact Elena Dumitru via edumitru@amnesty.ca 
Create a powerful solidarity message. Take a photo with a sign beside water that is important in your community. Post your photo message, tagging Bernardo’s social media account – so he knows he is not alone. Not on social media? Send your photo message to us via kprice@amnesty.ca so we can share it for you. 
Here is a sample post that Bernardo’s family shared with him and publicly to show international support for their cause:

Beautiful, resource rich, bio-diverse Colombia is arguably the deadliest country in the world to defend the planet. Hundreds of defenders have been killed in the last three years, and the bloodshed continues. The non-governmental organization Somos Defensores (We Are Defenders) reported more than 500 death threats and assassination attempts in the first nine months of 2021 alone. 
With the help of Amnesty Canada supporters, a campaign entitled Protect Those Who Protect Us delivered 180,000 calls to Colombia’s Congress last November, requesting action to ensure that authorities comply with obligations to protect defenders from harm.  
Members of Congress held a special hearing on November 19 and committed to expedite the creation of a commission to guarantee protection for threatened defenders.    
Meanwhile, the crisis for defenders continues. Jani Silva, leader of the Association for the Integral and Sustainable Development of the Amazonian Pearl Reserve (known by its acronym ADISPA), is amongst those who face constant danger as she seeks to protect a unique and vitally important ecosystem from contamination by oil companies. Jani has had to move away from her isolated home in the Amazonian Pearl to a city where a protection scheme, including regular police patrols around her home, has been provided thanks to thousands of messages of concern sent to Colombian authorities by activists in Canada and around the world.   
The accompaniment of Amnesty International has allowed me to remain alive and for ADISPA to continue to exist. I have no words to express what I feel.             If it were not for you and all those who accompany me, I would not be here …

Known as the “Guapinol 8”, José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández, Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz have been wrongfully imprisoned for more than two years solely for peacefully defending the right to clean water. The defenders belong to the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Goods. The committee has mobilized communities in and around Tocoa to peacefully challenge the legality of iron mining concessions awarded to a powerful company in a protected national park. Local people are worried about the impact on the quality of the Guapinol and San Pedro river waters. In December, Amnesty declared the Guapinol defenders to be prisoners of conscience who should be freed immediately. 
After more than 914 days in illegal, unjust, arbitrary detention for peacefully defending water, the Supreme Court ruled that the Guapinol River defenders should not have spent one day in jail. On February 24, the defenders were released and reunited with their families. They have pledged to renew efforts to defend the Guapinol River from the contaminating impact of an iron ore project that was granted a concession in a protected area.  
At a time of such pain in the 🌎, images of the @guapinolre defenders of #Honduras free at last, reunited with their families and companions in the struggle to protect the Guapinol River is incredibly heartening!#LibertadParaGuapinol #JusticiaParaGuapinol ✊🏾💧🇭🇳 https://t.co/oXMpW1yDLM 
Thank you to everyone who wrote letters or posted social media messages calling for the release of the Guapinol River defenders! No further action is currently requested. 
March 2 will mark 6 years since Lenca Indigenous leader Berta Cáceres was gunned down to silence her leadership of efforts by Lenca communities to stop the damming of the Gualcarque River. Berta’s family and her organization COPINH have campaigned relentlessly to bring to justice those who carried out the assassination – seven men are now in jail for this crime – as well as those who ordered and paid for it. Lack of justice is a green light for more killings in a country of enormous natural resources and equally enormous violence against those who seek to protect them. 
There was jubilation last July when a court found David Castillo guilty as a co-author of the assassination of Berta. Castillo is a former military intelligence officer and manager of the company awarded the contract to dam the river. While the guilty verdict was considered a huge step forward, Castillo is yet to be sentenced for the crime and authorities also have yet to act on evidence that other powerful people connected to the dam were involved in the plot to murder Berta. Meanwhile, COPINH is challenging the legality of the dam contract and financing pledged by banks in other countries. 
Sign our Justice for Berta E-Action 
Twitter Action. Authorities in Honduras are active on Twitter and mindful of their international image. Tweet the Ministerio Público, tagging COPINH.  
Film Screening. On March 22, World Water Day, watch a documentary entitled Berta Didn’t Die, She Multiplied! This film celebrates the life and legacy of Berta Cáceres, and victory in the Indigenous struggle to protect the Gualcarque River. The screening is part of a virtual film festival organized by World BEYOND War, and co-sponsored by Mutual Aid Media and Peace Brigades International. Post-film discussion will feature director Sam Vinal. Click here to register. 
Plant/Adopt a Tree. Plan to celebrate Earth Day on April 22 or World Environment Day on June 5 by planting or adopting a tree in a visible place to honour Berta and other environment defenders. Create signage to share their stories. Use the branches of the tree to create an eye-catching display and as the focus for a ceremony or action gathering, when that is a safe option. Take photos to share on social media. Approach local media to cover what you do – read this inspiring CBC story about what activists in New Brunswick did. 
Environmental defenders with the Women’s Movement for the Defense of Access to Water, Land and Environmental Protection in Chile, known as Mujeres Modatima, continue to be threatened as they courageously confront a water crisis and its disproportionate impact on women and their families.  
The women of Mujeres Modatima are explicitly anti-patriarchal and their defense of water as a human right has led them to challenge powerful economic interests behind extractivist projects which they say have “dried up entire communities, depriving them of such a vital element”. 
In response, women water defenders have suffered smear campaigns, break-ins, attacks and death threats like the one painted on the building where Mujeres Modatima leader Verónica Vilches, President of the Rural Drinking Water Committee (APR), works (see below). The long time water defender has accused agro-industry of water theft. 
Authorities have done little or nothing to investigate the threats and attacks, and bring the perpetrators to justice. Police have failed to provide protection and have told the women there is nothing they can do. 
Write a letter in support of the threatened women defenders of Mujeres Modatima. Tell Chilean authorities they must investigate all threats and attacks, bring the perpetrators to justice, and ensure that Mujeres Modatima can protect the right to water without fear of harm to them.

In response to the adoption today of a resolution by the United Nations Human Rights Council that establishes an independent accountability mechanism for human rights violations and crimes against humanity in Nicaragua, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said:  
The establishment of an independent accountability mechanism for Nicaragua is a crucial step towards ensuring justice, truth and reparation for the horrific crimes and abuses that have been perpetrated in the country since 2018. 
“We commend the Human Rights Council for taking this vital action, and for sending a strong message to victims and survivors that they are not alone in their fight against impunity. Perpetrators must now be aware that accountability for human rights violations cannot be avoided. The Nicaraguan authorities must put an immediate end to the ongoing repression.”  
Background 
On 31 March 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution that establishes an independent accountability mechanism for Nicaragua with a mandate to investigate, collect evidence and determine responsibilities for human rights violations and crimes under international law perpetrated since 2018. 
The adoption of this resolution follows an appeal by over 20 Nicaraguan, regional and international human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, issued last month, urging the Human Rights Council to step up its approach to the crisis. 
Since 2018, Nicaragua has been immersed in a deep human rights crisis. More than 300 people have been killed, hundreds arbitrarily detained, and thousands have been forced to flee the country. The government has cancelled the legal permits of dozens of civil society organizations, and mounted attacks on numerous independent media outlets.  
Last year, in the context of elections, the situation worsened further, as security forces detained dozens of perceived opponents, including independent journalists, potential election candidates, political activists and others. Some of these individuals were subjected to enforced disappearance – a crime under international law – for a period of weeks or months. 
The government of Nicaragua has repeatedly refused to co-operate with regional or international human rights mechanisms in order to put an end to the country’s ongoing human rights crisis.

Amnesty International Report 2021/22: The State of the World’s Human Rights finds that these states, alongside corporate titans, have in fact driven deeper global inequality. It details root causes including noxious corporate greed and brutal national selfishness, as well as neglect of health and public infrastructure by governments around the world. 
 2021 should have been a year of healing and recuperation. Instead, it became an incubator for deeper inequality and greater instability, a legacy caustic for years to come, 
“Leader after leader dangled promises to ‘build back better’ to address deep-seated inequalities that exacerbated the impact of the pandemic. Instead, they have performed a tragic fable of betrayal and greed in cahoots with corporate titans. Whilst this has played out around the world, the effects have been most damaging to the most marginalized communities, including those on the front lines of endemic poverty.” 
Vaccine successes undercut by self-interested nationalism and corporate greed 
The rapid roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines appeared to be a scientific silver bullet, offering hope of an end to the pandemic for all. 
However, despite enough production to fully vaccinate the world in 2021, by year’s end less than 4% of those living in low-income countries had been fully vaccinated. 
“At the G7, G20 and COP26 summits, grandstanding on a global stage, political and economic leaders paid lip service to policies that could generate a sea change in vaccine access, reverse under-investment in social protection, and tackle the impact of climate change. Heads of Big Pharma and Big Tech spun us lines about corporate responsibility. At this watershed movement, the stage was set for recovery, and genuine meaningful change for a more equal world,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“However, they squandered the opportunity, reverting to type with policies and practice that drove further inequality. Members of the Rich Boys Club offered promises publicly that they reneged on privately.” 
Wealthy states such as EU member states, the UK and the USA stockpiled more doses than needed, whilst turning a blind eye as Big Pharma put profits ahead of people, refusing to share their technology to enable wider distribution of vaccines. In 2021, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna projected eye-watering profits of up to US$54 billion yet supplied less than 2% of their vaccines to low-income countries. 
Big Pharma were not the only corporate giants to undermine pandemic recovery for profit. Social media companies such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter provided fertile ground for Covid-19 misinformation, allowing vaccine hesitancy to flourish. Some political leaders also acted as super-spreaders of misinformation, breeding distrust and fear for their own political gain. 
“Social media companies’ allowed their lucrative algorithms to spread harmful misinformation about the pandemic, prioritizing the sensationalist and the discriminatory over truth,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“The extent of their profiteering from that misinformation and the impact of that on the lives of millions mean those companies have a serious case to answer.” 
Marginalized hit hardest by pandemic responses 
Whilst many countries in the Global South reaped the consequences of collusion between corporate giants and western governments, devastation was compounded by health systems and economic and social support crumbling under the weight of decades of neglect. Nowhere was this felt more clearly and cruelly than in Africa, which is why Amnesty International launches its report today from South Africa. 
With less than 8% of the continent’s population fully vaccinated by the end of 2021, it holds the lowest vaccination rate in the world, beleaguered by insufficient supplies provided to the COVAX facility, the Africa Vaccine Acquisition Trust and through bilateral donations. Populations have been left exposed as roll-out campaigns have faltered or failed in countries with already inadequate healthcare systems. 
In South Africa, approximately 750,000 children had dropped out of school by May, over three times the pre-pandemic number. In Viet Nam women migrant workers were particularly impacted, reporting food insecurity and inability to meet other basic needs. In Venezuela, the pandemic worsened a pre-existing humanitarian emergency: 94.5% of the population was living in income poverty and 76.6% in extreme poverty. 
“In many countries around the world, already marginalized people paid the highest cost for the deliberate policy choices of a privileged few. The right to health and to life were violated on a massive scale, millions were left struggling to make ends meet, many were made homeless, children were left out of education, poverty rose,” said Agnès Callamard.   
“The global failure to build a global response to the pandemic also sowed the seeds of greater conflict and greater injustice. Rising poverty, food insecurity, and government instrumentalization of the pandemic to repress dissent and protests – all were well planted in 2021, watered by vaccine nationalism and fertilized by greed of the richer countries.” 
Conflict contagious in face of perilously weak international response 
In 2021, new and unresolved conflicts erupted or persisted in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Libya, Myanmar and Yemen, with warring parties violating international human rights and humanitarian law. In their wake, civilians were made collateral damage, millions were displaced, thousands killed, hundreds subjected to sexual violence, and already fragile healthcare and economic systems were brought to the brink. 
The global failure to address these multiplying conflicts provoked greater instability and devastation. The ineffectiveness of international response to these crises was most evident with the paralysis at the UN Security Council. It failed to act on atrocities in Myanmar, human rights violations in Afghanistan, war crimes in Syria. This shameful inaction, continued paralysis of multilateral bodies and lack of accountability of powerful states helped pave the way for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has flagrantly violated international law. 
“In far too few instances did the needed international response come; in far too few cases were justice and accountability provided. Instead, conflict expanded. Extending over time, its impacts worsened. The numbers and diversity of intervening parties rose. New theatres of conflict opened. New weapons were tested. More deaths and injury were exacted. Life was cheapened. Global stability was brought to the brink,” said Agnès Callamard.   
When we needed independent voices most, retrograde trend to stifle dissent flourished 
Global trends to stifle independent and critical voices gathered steam in 2021 as governments deployed a widening gamut of tools and tactics. Human rights defenders, NGOs, media outlets and opposition leaders were the targets of unlawful detention, torture and enforced disappearance, many under the smokescreen of the pandemic. 
At least 67 countries introduced new laws in 2021 to restrict freedom of expression, association or assembly.  In the USA, at least 36 states introduced more than 80 pieces of draft legislation limiting freedom of assembly, whilst the UK government proposed the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which would drastically curtail the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, including by expanding police powers. 
Surreptitious digital technologies were further weaponized.  In Russia, the government turned to facial recognition to undertake mass arrests of peaceful protesters. In China, the authorities ordered internet service providers to sever access to websites that “endangered national security”, and blocked apps on which controversial topics such as Xinjiang and Hong Kong were discussed. In Cuba, Eswatini, Iran, Myanmar, Niger, Senegal, South Sudan and Sudan, authorities resorted to internet shutdowns and disruptions to prevent people from sharing information about repression and organizing in response. 
“Instead of providing room for discussion and debate so sorely needed on how best to meet the challenges of 2021, many states redoubled efforts to muzzle critical voices,” said Agnès Callamard. 
If those in power want to build back broken, we must stand up to betrayal 
If in 2021 those in power lacked the ambition and imagination to tackle one of the gravest threats to humanity, the same cannot be said for the people they should have represented.   
Protesters took to the streets in Colombia after the government decided to raise taxes even as people were struggling to feed their families during the pandemic. In Russia, opposition rallies went ahead in the face of mass arbitrary arrests and prosecutions. Indian farmers protested new laws that they said would hurt their livelihood.  
Youth and Indigenous activists around the world called out leaders for their failure to act on the climate crisis.  Civil society organizations, including Amnesty International, successfully lobbied for the recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. Innovative strategic litigation cases and criminal complaints were filed by NGOs against multinational companies including Nike, Patagonia and C&A for their complicity in forced labour in the Xinjiang region of China. 
In a great example of cooperation, the Pegasus Project – a collaboration of more than 80 journalists, with technical support from Amnesty International – revealed that the spyware of Israel’s NSO Group had been used against heads of state, activists and journalists in Azerbaijan, Hungary, Morocco, Rwanda and Saudi Arabia. 
“Despite promises and pledges to the contrary, at almost every turn, leaders and corporations opted for a non-transformative path, choosing to entrench rather than overturn the systemic inequalities behind the pandemic. Yet, people the world over have made it abundantly clear that a more just world, grounded in human rights, is what they want,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“The palpable and persistent resistance offered by people’s movements the world over is a beacon of hope. Uncowed and undaunted, theirs is a clarion call for a more equal world. If governments won’t build back better – if they seemingly are intent on building back broken – then we are left with little option.  We must fight their every attempt to muzzle our voices and we must stand up to their every betrayal. It is why, in the coming weeks, we are launching a global campaign of solidarity with people’s movements, a campaign demanding respect for the right to protest. We must build and harness global solidarity, even if our leaders won’t.”

Amnesty International’s annual report on the state of the world’s human rights in 2021, published in March 2022, shows that promises to “build back better” after the Covid-19 pandemic were little more than lip service. Hopes of global cooperation withered in the face of vaccine hoarding and corporate greed. 
Governments suppressed independent and critical voices, with some even using the pandemic as a pretext to shrink further the civic space. New and unresolved conflicts erupted or persisted. Those forced to flee were subjected to a litany of abuses, including pushbacks by countries in the Global North. 
But hopes for a better post-pandemic world were kept alive by courageous individuals, social movements and civil society organizations. 
2021 should have been a year of healing and recuperation. Instead, it became an incubator for greater inequality and instability 
The annual report highlights the impact of these dynamics at a global, regional and national level, as well as more broadly covering the human rights situation in 154 countries.

Bernardo Caal Xol was released from the penitentiary centre in Cobán on March 24, 2022 after more than four years of imprisonment. The defender’s lawyers reported that a judge had ordered his release for “good behaviour”. 
“It’s great news for Bernardo, his family and Guatemala’s Indigenous Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities that he can leave prison and be reunited with his loved ones after more than four years of being a prisoner of conscience. However, Bernardo remains convicted of a crime he did not commit and thus the Guatemalan authorities continue to criminalize him for his work in defence of human rights and the environment,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
After reviewing the criminal case against Bernardo Caal Xol, Amnesty International found that there was no evidence of the crimes he was accused of. The proceedings against him show similar patterns of criminalization that the organization has documented against other human rights defenders in Guatemala. Amnesty International therefore considers Bernardo Caal Xol a prisoner of conscience and has been campaigning globally for years for his immediate and unconditional release. 
It’s great news for Bernardo, his family and Guatemala’s Indigenous Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities that he can leave prison and be reunited with his loved ones after more than four years of being a prisoner of conscience. 
“It’s regrettable that in Guatemala unfounded criminal prosecutions aimed at harassing and obstructing the work of human rights defenders – particularly environmentalists and Indigenous people, and those who fight against impunity and corruption – are such a common tactic. The people of Guatemala have suffered an unprecedented regression in human rights in recent years. The authorities have tried to dismantle the justice system and the social fabric, criminalizing everyone who fights for a more just and dignified country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Additional information 
Bernardo Caal Xol, a 50-year-old indigenous teacher, trade unionist and defender of the rights of the Indigenous Maya Q’eqchi’ people and of land, territorial and environmental rights, has been wrongfully imprisoned since 30 January 2018 for defending the rights of the Maya Q’eqchi’ communities affected by the construction of a hydroelectric project on the sacred Cahabón river, in the department of Alta Verapaz, northern Guatemala. Despite the lack of factual evidence to support the charges, on 9 November 2018, the court in Cobán sentenced him to 7 years and 4 months in prison for the crimes of aggravated robbery and aggravated illegal detention. 
It’s regrettable that in Guatemala unfounded criminal prosecutions aimed at harassing and obstructing the work of human rights defenders – particularly environmentalists and Indigenous people, and those who fight against impunity and corruption – are such a common tactic. 
On 16 July 2020, Amnesty International named Bernardo Caal a prisoner of conscience. The Guatemalan human rights defender was one of the individuals included in Amnesty International’s annual and global Write for Rights campaign in 2021, during which people around the world took around half a million actions calling for Bernardo Caal’s release. 
Bernardo Caal and his lawyers filed a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court in September 2021 to review the sentence for human rights violations, but the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court rejected it. Immediately afterwards, Bernardo Caal and his lawyers filed an injunction against this decision, which has not yet been resolved. 
In Guatemala, local and international organizations have recorded high levels of attacks against human rights defenders, especially those involved in the fight against impunity and corruption, as well as journalists. The Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders – Guatemala (UDEFEGUA) recorded 839 attacks against human rights defenders from January to November 2021. Guatemala is also one of the most dangerous countries in the world for defenders of land, territory and the environment, according to the latest Global Witness report. Thirteen environmental activists were killed in 2020, again the fourth highest rate of killings of land and environmental defenders per capita.

The video details how Amnesty International’s Security Lab played a crucial role in exposing the forensic evidence that proved the data could be connected to NSO Group’s Pegasus surveillance software. 
The short film features interviews with Amnesty Tech staff who worked on the months-long investigation before the story made headlines around the world in July 2021. 
Danna Ingleton, Amnesty Tech’s Deputy Director, said: “The Pegasus Project was the culmination of years of work investigating NSO Group’s shadowy Pegasus software. 
“Our new video provides an insight into how we developed our forensic tools to expose the vast scale of unlawful surveillance and human rights abuses that were ongoing, and also what needs to be done next to regulate an industry that is clearly out of control.” 
The Pegasus Project is a ground-breaking collaboration by more than 80 journalists from 17 media organizations in 10 countries coordinated by Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based media non-profit, with the technical support of Amnesty International, which conducted cutting-edge forensic tests on mobile phones to identify traces of the spyware. 
The collaboration revealed how NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware has been used to facilitate human rights violations around the world on a massive scale, following the revelation of 50,000 phone numbers of potential surveillance targets. 
The Pegasus Project had significant impact that continues to reverberate around the world. On 11 March, the European Parliament voted to create a new “committee of inquiry” to investigate abuses of Pegasus by European member states. The Pegasus Project has also resulted in numerous criminal cases being brought by those who discovered their devices had been targeted with the spyware, including in France, Mexico and India. 
In November 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced NSO Group was being placed on a blocklist due to its “malicious cyber activity”. A few weeks later, Apple launched a legal action against NSO Group to “curb the abuse of state-sponsored spyware”. The company praised Amnesty Tech and Citizen Lab for their ground-breaking work to identify cybersurveillance abuses. 
The video is available now on Amnesty International’s ‘Investigating the Truth’ YouTube channel here.

This night was sleepless for many in Ukraine. 
I was reloading my newsfeed again and again, reading increasingly disturbing news “the sky above all areas of the eastern Ukrainian border has been closed to flights”; “Russian diplomats have left their embassy in Ukraine in a hurry”. Hours were passing by. After updating my newsfeed once more, CCTV video footage popped up, showing tanks crossing one of the border checkpoints into Ukraine. “It has started” – messages were appearing one by one.  
Just a few breaths after I saw the news, something started to explode loudly. At the same moment everyone in my home woke up in shock and disbelief. In matter of minutes, we took the two backpacks that had been prepared weeks ago “just in case”, dressed our sleepy daughter in a winter coat over her pyjamas and left our little family home without looking back. It was a very dark and foggy morning. A cup of tea I made in the early hours of the morning remained untouched on the table. 
Even though the possibility of a Russian invasion had been discussed for months, people in Ukraine believed that an event like that would be impossible. And not just in Ukraine. It would lead to tremendous consequences that would affect not only my country, but also Russia as well, and so many other countries around the world. Surely, no-one would allow this to happen. 
For months, despite the disturbing news, people in Ukraine were trying to live their lives. However, it is easy to see now that all the signs of an imminent invasion had been developing rapidly. 
In January 2022, Russia placed an estimated 100,000 troops, and military equipment near the Ukrainian border. It was claimed that these troops were participating in military exercises and were about to leave and go back to their bases soon. 
On 15 February Russia’s State Duma asked President Vladimir Putin to recognize independence of the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, territories controlled by Russia-backed armed groups in the east of Ukraine. 
Less than a week after that, Putin convened and chaired a televised meeting of Russia’s Security Council. At that meeting the members of the Council were asked, one by one, to express their opinion regarding the recognition of the “Republics”. Unsurprisingly, all of the members expressed their strong support, although some were visibly nervous. 
On the same day, 21 February, in his televised address Putin stated that Ukraine had never been a real state, but had been “artificially” created in the 20th century. It was a long address, dismissing Ukrainian nationhood, blaming NATO and promising to restore “historical justice” for Russia. 
“Is he declaring war?” – asked some foreign journalists on Twitter after listening to his speech. The answer was soon clear. 
On 24 February the Russian invasion started with the shelling of military facilities in many parts of Ukraine, Russian troops crossing borders from the north and east of Ukraine, and from the south through occupied Crimea. Russian ships blocked the Black Sea. 
In the last month Russian troops have, and continue to, repeatedly violate International Humanitarian Law (the ‘laws of war’), systematically launching indiscriminate attacks killing and injuring civilians and destroying homes, hospitals, schools and other civilian infrastructure. 
The scale and impact of this war in Europe is unprecedented since the Second World War. Hundreds, an in all likelihood thousands, of civilians have been killed or injured in attacks by Russian forces. More than 10 million people have been displaced, with over 3 million having fled Ukraine to other countries. 
Although Putin claimed in the beginning that the Russian military targets only military infrastructure, this never appeared to be true. 
Within hours of the invasion, Amnesty International verified reports and video footage that showed indiscriminate attacks across the country. Numerous strikes on hospitals and schools were documented. Russian troops were using inaccurate explosive weapons such as ballistic missiles and banned weapons such as cluster bombs. Russian forces carried out attacks that struck and destroyed residential houses, schools, kindergartens, medical facilities, and food stores. 
More reports are emerging that point to further war crimes committed by Russian troops. 
If you’ve seen the news, you know big cities such as Kharkiv, Kyiv and Mariupol, as well as dozens of small towns and villages in Ukraine, are under relentless attack.  Their desperate inhabitants are caught in the crossfire or under siege by attacking Russian forces. 
Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine, located about 30 km from the border with Russia is under constant bombardment with dozens killed and injured, civilian infrastructure widely damaged or destroyed and people struggling for their lives in unbearable conditions. 
Several towns near Kyiv, like Irpin and Bucha, used to be picturesque and quiet neighbourhoods to which young families would move. But now they are largely destroyed, on the verge of being wiped out, leaving hundreds dead and thousands displaced. Those peaceful suburbs are now a humanitarian catastrophe. 
In the east of Ukraine, the city Izyum, was a town of over 40,000 inhabitants. It has now been widely damaged and largely devastated. 
According to testimonies collected by Amnesty International people in Izyum don’t have access to electricity, gas, or heating. Any form of communication has been cut off, and they are also suffering from the lack of sanitation and clean water. 
People who have managed to flee the town are sharing their stories. 
Tetyana, who took cover in a shelter in the town with her five-month-old baby, said: “When we were leaving [evacuating], there were three five-litre containers [of water] left for 55 people. I don’t know how they are going to survive.” 
Natalia, a resident of a private house, said: “We spent six days in a cellar. It’s very small, you have to stand in it, it’s impossible to lie down. As soon as there was a pause [in attacks], we would quickly run out, and get some eggs from the hens… Our child was hungry, since we hardly ate. All we had was leftover dry bread, apples from the cellar, canned pickles, and jam… We couldn’t get any other food anywhere; we couldn’t leave our house. Everything was under fire.”  
The Russian war against Ukraine has brought the destruction of lives, cities, families, and the hopes and dreams of many people. 
However, the destruction ordered by Putin is not only the destruction of Ukraine and Ukrainians. It is also the destruction of the hopes and aspirations of many Russians. 
This war is also causing the destruction of the lives of people far beyond these two countries, as the food crisis escalates and the environment is damaged. With ever more people being forced to leave their homes to seek a safer life. 
However, as it was during the Maidan revolution, Ukrainian society shows an incredible resilience and ability to unite in the darkest hours and spread hope. 
Civil society organizations, that have been the backbone of Ukrainian society for years, are now focused on helping civilians – they organize evacuations, the delivery of humanitarian aid from other countries and try and distribute it to affected areas, doing it under constant shelling, at risk to their lives. 
The director of one of the grass roots NGOs that operates in the east of Ukraine, is now together with her colleagues evacuating civilians from the most affected regions.  Every day she writes a post on Facebook saying “We are alive. Working”. 
Although the many lives lost in this war will remain a wound for Ukrainians and others for decades to come, as long as activists, volunteers and civil society organizations are alive and working, the restoration of Ukraine, peace and human rights is possible. 
I still harbour hopes to come back home and see that cup of cold tea on the table.

Activists in countries across the world will take part in actions and events to mark one month since the start of an invasion that has had myriad devastating consequences for the people of Ukraine, for freedom of expression in Russia, and on the international human rights framework.  
“Russia’s actions have unleashed a human rights catastrophe. In Ukraine, in the space of just four weeks, lives, livelihoods, homes and infrastructure have been destroyed, families have been torn apart, and millions have been displaced. At home, Russia’s authorities have embarked on an unprecedented crackdown on dissent that has seen anti-war protesters beaten up and imprisoned and the few remaining independent media outlets forced to close. Acute shortages of essential supplies caused by the invasion could yet precipitate a broader humanitarian disaster across the globe,” said Bruce Millar, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director of Campaigns for Eastern Europe and Central Asia.  
One month since the start of the invasion, activists from all corners of the globe are speaking in one voice to demand that the Russian authorities put a stop to this wanton destruction by ending their illegal aggression, protecting civilians, and respecting international law. 
Since the start of the invasion, Amnesty International has documented indiscriminate attacks that have killed or injured civilians, possible unlawful attacks that have destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure, including strikes on hospitals and schools, and the use of banned cluster munitions — which may constitute war crimes under international law. Amnesty International is determined to ensure there is justice for these crimes and to provide essential evidence, which can be used to hold perpetrators accountable.  
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter and an act of aggression that is a crime under international law, while its decision to leave the Council of Europe and denounce the European Convention on Human Rights removes some of the last safeguards against human rights abuses for those who need them most in today’s Russia.  
Actions and events will take place outside Russian embassies and at emblematic sites in countries including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan and the U.S. Amnesty’s global action, calling on the Russian authorities to stop this act of aggression and protect civilians, has already been signed by more than 340,000 people.

Esther has spent 27 years seeking justice for her husband Dr Barinem Kiobel, who was hanged along with eight other men in connection with widespread protests against oil pollution in the Niger Delta. 
These extraordinarily brave women are not giving up. Their voices have been heard. They should be commended for the invaluable work they have done to highlight the global culture of impunity for multinationals accused of human rights abuses 
At a witness hearing in 2019, three men told the Dutch court that Shell and the Nigerian government had given them money and offered them other bribes in order to incriminate Esther’s husband and eight other men, known collectively as the “Ogoni Nine”. But today, the court ruled that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Shell had been involved. 
Esther Kiobel brought the case against Shell along with three other women, Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula, whose husbands were also executed in 1995. Amnesty International’s research into the historic injustice has revealed how Shell’s requests for ‘assistance’ in handling environmental protests led to a brutal government crackdown, culminating in the arrests and unlawful executions of the women’s husbands, as well as renowned activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and four other men. 
“This is a disappointing outcome, but these extraordinarily brave women are not giving up. Their voices have been heard. They should be commended for their resilience and unbreaking commitment to exposing the truth, and for the invaluable work they have done to highlight the global culture of impunity for multinationals accused of human rights abuses,” said Mark Dummett, Head of Business and Human Rights at Amnesty International. 
The fact that it took more than twenty years for a court to hear Esther’s argument is a grim indictment of how corporations are able to evade accountability for terrible crimes and human rights abuses 
“It has taken years of legal wrangling for Esther Kiobel to get Shell to face her in a courtroom. Shell tried every trick in the book, from disputing jurisdiction to refusing to hand over crucial documents. The fact that it took more than twenty years for a court to hear Esther’s argument is a grim indictment of how corporations are able to evade accountability for terrible crimes and human rights abuses. Despite the ruling today, Esther’s battle for justice has not been in vain – her persistence represents a powerful argument for change. Governments must do more to hold companies accountable for human rights abuses, and make it possible for the victims to seek justice.” 
Esther Kiobel fled Nigeria and settled in the US following her husband’s killing. She first filed a case against Shell in New York in 2002, but in 2013 the US Supreme Court ruled that the US did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. In 2017, Amnesty International supported Esther Kiobel, Victoria Bera, Blessing Eawo and Charity Levula in bringing a new case against Shell in the Netherlands. The four plaintiffs accused Shell of being instrumental in the unlawful arrest and detention of their husbands; the violation of their husbands’ physical integrity; and the violation of their right to a fair trial and to life, and their own right to a family life. The case was held up when Shell refused to hand over crucial documents relating to the case, and it was not until 2019 that the District Court of The Hague heard the women’s arguments for the first time. 
One of the many tragedies in this case is that spills from Shell’s oil fields are still wreaking havoc in the Niger Delta 
Amnesty International has extensively detailed Shell’s role in the crackdown in Ogoniland. In a 2017 report, it found that Shell repeatedly encouraged the Nigerian military to deal with protests, even when it knew this would lead to atrocities including killings, rape, torture, and the burning of villages. In the midst of these horrors, Shell provided the military with material support, and in at least one instance paid a military commander notorious for human rights violations. 
Amnesty International has also exposed evidence of serious negligence by Shell, whose irresponsible approach to oil spills in the Niger Delta has exacerbated an environmental crisis and led to devastating pollution for Ogoni communities. 
“One of the many tragedies in this case is that spills from Shell’s oil fields are still wreaking havoc in the Niger Delta. The company says it is now leaving the region and is looking for a buyer. Before doing so it needs to finally pay heed to the demands of the communities there – and clean up its dirty legacy,” said Mark Dummett. 
“Shell has thrown millions at the multiple lawsuits it is facing, but money will not be enough to clear its name.”

0,Poland: Authorities must act to protect people fleeing Ukraine from further suffering,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/poland-authorities-must-act-to-protect-people-fleeing-ukraine-from-further-suffering/,"The Polish authorities must relieve volunteers from the responsibility of receiving people fleeing from Ukraine and address the chaotic and dangerous situation in Poland to ensure that they do not face further suffering, said Amnesty International after the organization concluded a 10-day visit to...","The Polish authorities must relieve volunteers from the responsibility of receiving people fleeing from Ukraine and address the chaotic and dangerous situation in Poland to ensure that they do not face further suffering, said Amnesty International after the organization concluded a 10-day visit to the country. 
The number of people fleeing within Europe is unprecedented since World War Two, with Poland receiving the majority. The openness to assist them displayed by volunteers has been outstanding. This has been facilitated by the government’s much more open approach to people fleeing Ukraine, which is in contrast to the push back and lock up policies which they have been applying to people fleeing other conflicts and entering Poland through Belarus. The life-saving assistance that NGOs and volunteers are now providing to people fleeing Ukraine was previously obstructed and criminalized on the border with Belarus. Primary responsibility for assisting people fleeing Ukraine has largely fallen on ordinary citizens, non-governmental organisations and municipalities, resulting in enormous challenges. 
“Solidarity shown by volunteers in Poland has been remarkable, but without central authorities taking responsibility and concerted action, people in need of protection and assistance risk falling through the cracks. People fleeing Ukraine are anxious to get reliable information about shelter, transportation and their legal status, but without coordination, people risk being deprived of such essentials, and being harassed or preyed upon by criminals. The Polish government must now step up to meet these challenges and keep people safe,” said Nils Muižnieks, Europe Regional Director at Amnesty International. 
Volunteers have stepped up 
Thousands of volunteers have provided assistance to people at the Polish borders with Ukraine and in train stations. This has included food, housing, interpretation, and offering free transport across Europe. 
Volunteers were far more visible and active than government authorities in all the places Amnesty International visited, including the reception points in the immediate proximity of Medyka, the main border crossing point used by people fleeing Ukraine, and Korczowa (Hala Kijowska), and in reception centres and train stations in Przemysl and Warsaw. 
However, it is not sustainable to rely on volunteers in the long term and the central government must act quickly to provide proper registration, longer-term accommodation, psycho-social support, transport and other assistance. 
Despite the commendable efforts of volunteers, critical gaps remain, including the provision of information on people’s legal status. The lack of such information creates significant anxiety, particularly among non-Ukrainian nationals, and the government should provide information to all people fleeing Ukraine regarding their legal status in Poland or possibilities to move regularly to other EU countries. 
“Many non-Ukrainian people, including those in need of international protection, are unsure of their status in Poland. Everyone fleeing the conflict must be treated with humanity and offered opportunities to carry on with their lives, regardless of their passport,” said Nils Muižnieks. 
Protecting people fleeing Ukraine from predatory crimes and violence  
A lack of state intervention also leaves those fleeing Ukraine open to violence and trafficking. Amnesty International visited several temporary reception facilities, including in Przemysl (“Tesco centre”) and Korczowa (Hala Kijowska), close to the borders with Ukraine. These were organized to facilitate further transportation as soon as possible, often relying on private individuals to offer such transport and/or accommodation. 
Volunteers have struggled to register new arrivals. But without formal procedures to register and track them, women, men and children who have fled Ukraine – especially those who do not speak Polish or English – are potentially at risk of abuses by people or criminal gangs looking to exploit the chaotic situation. 
The Amnesty International delegation observed first-hand how people arrived in Poland and immediately sought assistance from anyone willing to help. Emerging reports of gender-based violence against women and girls are of particular concern. It has been reported that the Wroclaw police arrested a 49-year old Polish man who allegedly sexually abused a Ukrainian woman whom he had offered to host in his apartment after she had fled Ukraine. 
Polish human rights organisations also said that they are receiving reports of additional cases of sexual violence, which remain confidential. They are concerned that people fleeing Ukraine, including unaccompanied children, may become victims of trafficking. 
“Children are entering Poland from Ukraine but authorities are not registering with whom many of them are staying. In some cases, parents send them to relatives in Poland. In one case, an 11-year old was travelling with her uncle, but the uncle was stopped at the border, so she travelled alone,” said Irena Dawid-Olczyk, President of NGO La Strada. 
Karolina Wierzbińska from Homo Faber, reported to police that a woman was approaching women and children arriving at Lublin’s train station, offering money if they gave her their passports. Staff from her organization also observed men in Lublin aggressively approaching women coming from Ukraine and offering them transport and accommodation. 
Amnesty International is calling for the introduction of a standardised, institutional registration system of the whereabouts, family composition and destination of those fleeing, and the identities of the people offering them transport or accommodation. 
Discrimination in Ukraine 
Ukraine’s martial law prohibits men aged between 18 and 60 from leaving the country. People leaving Ukraine are therefore overwhelmingly women and children, as families are being separated. 
These limitations have especially problematic effects on disabled men, and men with sole responsibility for their children. Some men with disabilities and in possession of certain documentation have been allowed to leave the country. However, in practice, this isn’t always happening. 
“My son lost one arm and his hearing in the previous conflict area. We were in the same car with him and my husband, but Ukrainian border officers only let women through. My son is officially [recognized as] a person with disabilities caused by the war, he officially cannot work, still they didn’t let him through,” recounted Sofia, a hair-dresser from Dnipro. She and two women travelling with her also recounted seeing many other men being stopped by Ukrainian border guards. “One man was travelling with his two children, maybe about 5- and 1-year old, and was turned down. He looked like he didn’t have a wife, maybe he was a widower. The Ukrainian border guards said they [the border guards] could take the children, but not him.” 
Amnesty International also spoke to 27 non-Ukrainian nationals who fled Ukraine following the Russian invasion, including many international students and people who had been living in Ukraine for up to 20 years. Racialized people, in particular Black people, reported suffering discrimination and violence by Ukrainian forces when trying to leave Ukraine. 
Many reported discriminatory treatment both when trying to board trains or buses and near border check points, while some detailed physical and verbal aggressions by Ukrainian forces and volunteers. 
Racialized people from a number of countries in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia recounted how Ukrainian forces and staff repeatedly prevented them from boarding trains towards Poland in Lviv train station. They were told that there was a need to give priority to women and children, but African and South Asian women were reportedly also not allowed to board trains in some instances. 
“Some face racism, some don’t, it’s based on colour of skin and gender,” said Bilal, a 24-year old student from Pakistan. “My friend who is black faced racism… There is a line, if you are Ukrainian it’s easy to get across, if not, it takes a long time. The border guards used a stick on my friend, he was hurt.” 
Protecting all people from discrimination in Poland 
While Poland and other European countries have opened their borders to people from Ukraine, Poland has a dismal record in its treatment of people coming from other conflict areas, focusing on policies and infrastructure to deter and contain people at borders. 
Foreigners have already been subjected to hatred and violence, as vividly demonstrated by an attack reported in Przemysl on 1 March, when a group of nationalist men assaulted three Indian students who had just arrived from Ukraine, in what appears to be a hatred-motivated attack. 
“The Polish authorities must ensure that all people who have fled Ukraine are treated with the same level of respect to protect their human rights and dignity. Racism, hate speech and attacks must not be tolerated and perpetrators must he held accountable,” said Nils Muižnieks of Amnesty International.

Slovenian theatre director Jaša Jenull is facing exorbitant claims to cover the costs associated with policing protests he joined in 2020 against restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly imposed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Claims for compensation and lawsuits against Jaša Jenull and other peaceful protesters are punitive in nature and aimed at silencing people exercising their human rights. Requiring participants to pay for the costs of policing is a violation of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. The Slovenian authorities must withdraw their claims for compensation and refrain from imposing penalties against peaceful protesters.

Additional information  
On 9 March 2022, Jaša Jenull, an activist and theatre director, received a ‘call for payment before filing a lawsuit’ from Slovenia’s State Attorney for the amount of 34,340.56 Euros to cover for the costs for policing a protest. The costs relate to a protest held on 19 June 2020, when Jaša Jenull and several dozen others sat on the ground on Republic Square in Ljubljana to read the Constitution aloud in protest against restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly imposed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. According to information widely reported, police forcibly removed protesters who did not leave the square voluntarily. The public reading of the Constitution was then followed by a protest. To date, Jaša Jenull has three open proceedings for costs associated with the policing of protests. The overall amount claimed by the authorities amounts to over 40,000 Euros. The financial claims against Jaša Jenull for reimbursement of the costs for policing is not an isolated case. According to official data provided by Slovenian authorities during a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on Internal Affairs and the Committee on Justice on 4 October 2021, the authorities have claimed 972,166 Euros in civil lawsuits to be filed against protesters. To date, according to information provided by the State Attorney’s Office to Amnesty International, 28 claims for policing costs are being processed for the amount of 269,778.48 Euros.  
The authorities have justified their claims to reimburse the costs of policing costs on the basis that the protests were held without notifying the authorities. According to the police, the lack of notification required additional resources in order to ensure public safety. Invoking a lack of notification to impose financial sanctions to claim back the costs of policing is an illegitimate interference with the right to peaceful assembly and violates international and regional human rights standards. Moreover, it is of further concern that it appears that some individuals with more public visibility, like Jaša Jenull who has repeatedly rejected claims that he was the organizer of the protests, have been particularly targeted by the authorities in an attempt to amplify the intimidatory message to other protestors.  
The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is protected under various international human rights treaties to which Slovenia is a state party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention of Human Rights. States have an obligation to actively facilitate the right to peaceful assembly, which requires providing adequate services that should not be expected to be covered by the organizers or the participants. Requirements for participants or organizers either to arrange or to contribute towards the costs of policing or security, medical assistance or cleaning are a barrier to the realization of this right and could also create a significant deterrent for those wishing to exercise their rights.   
The duty to facilitate peaceful protests also applies in cases of spontaneous assemblies. Even if domestic legislation establishes the requirement for organizers to notify authorities in advance of an assembly, when people decide spontaneously to take their views to the streets police should facilitate such assemblies as long as they are peaceful. Failure to notify the authorities of the intention to assemble must not render an otherwise peaceful assembly unlawful nor should be used as a justification for its dispersal.   
Amnesty International has been concerned over numerous measures taken by the Slovenian authorities in the last years to curb people’s participation in protests, including through the application of fines and intimidation, closing public spaces for protests and imposing a blanket ban on all protests for several months in the context of Covid-19. For example, just Jaša Jenull was issued over 10,000 euros of fines for minor offences related to protests (this is in addition to the claims for policing the protests in over 40,000 euros). Since May 2020 police conducted random identity checks, detained and fined peaceful protesters simply for carrying anti-government placards and subjected them to legal proceedings. In November 2020, the authorities considerably increased fines for organizing public gatherings in defiance of a blanket ban, which was in place between October 2020 until April 2021, except for a 12-day hiatus, when protests of maximum 10 persons were allowed. In July 2021, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government’s decisions to prohibit public gatherings and limit the number of protesters were unconstitutional and represented a disproportionate infringement of human rights.

French-Palestinian lawyer Salah Hammouri has been issued a four-month administrative detention order. He is a field researcher for Palestinian NGO Addameer and has been held without charge or trial since 7 March. Since 2002, Israeli authorities have persistently harassed Salah Hammouri, who has been detained several times. He is also at risk of deportation as Israel’s Ministry of Interior has taken action to revoke his residency status in East Jerusalem. The Israeli authorities must release Salah Hammouri immediately and ensure that he is allowed to keep his residency status in Jerusalem and continue with his human rights work without fear of reprisals.  
Salah Hammouri was taken to Ofer military detention center and then transferred to a detention centre within the Russian compound in Jerusalem, where he remains held without charge or trial. On 10 March, the Military Commander of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) in the occupied West Bank issued a four-month administrative order, extending his detention without charge or trial until 6 July 2022 and without any means to effectively challenge the detention. The order, which an Israeli military judge is due to confirm during the week of 14 March, can be renewed indefinitely.  
Israel’s systematic use of administrative detention violates international human rights law. Its use as such results in arbitrary detention, and if prolonged or repeated can amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. This could constitute as an inhuman act perpetrated to maintain a system of apartheid, which is crime against humanity.  
Salah Hammouri is also at risk of deportation as the authorities have been taking steps since September 2020 to revoke his permanent residency status on the grounds of “breach of allegiance” to the State of Israel. He is currently waiting for the ruling by the Israeli High Court. According to his lawyer, there is concern that this most recent administrative detention order will be used against him to expedite actions towards his forcible deportation. Salah Hammouri is a lawyer and field researcher at the prominent Palestinian human rights organization, Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association. This is not the first time he has been arbitrarily detained in connection to his human rights work.

Additional information  
Salah Hammouri is a French-Palestinian lawyer who lives in the neighbourhood of Kufr Aqab in East Jerusalem. He holds a Jerusalem residency permit and works as a field researcher for Addameer, a legal aid and prisoners’ rights NGO that, together with five other civil society groups, was declared by the Israeli government a “terrorist organization” in October 2021. UN human rights experts condemned this move as a misuse of counterterrorism measures and a “frontal attack on the Palestinian human rights movement, and on human rights everywhere”.  
The Israeli authorities have persistently harassed and targeted Salah Hammouri. Since 2000, he has been detained multiple times, including twice when he was placed under administrative detention – for five months in 2004 and for 13 months in 2017.  
The Israeli authorities have also violated his rights to freedom of movement and to family. He is also at risk of forcible deportation as the Israeli authorities have taken action to revoke his residency status. On 3 September 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Interior notified Salah Hammouri of its intention to revoke his permanent residency status on the grounds of “breach of allegiance” to the State of Israel. Salah Hammouri awaits a final ruling by the Israeli High Court, after exhausting the appeals process. According to his lawyer, there is concern that this most recent administrative detention order will be used against him to expedite actions towards his forcible deportation. Israel’s discriminatory state policies, regulations and conduct against Palestinians in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories have involved the crime against humanity of deportation or forcible transfer under both the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention.  
In 2021, Salah Hammouri—along with five other Palestinian human rights defenders—was hacked with Pegasus, a spyware developed by Israeli cyber-surveillance company NSO Group.  
Under administrative detention, individuals are detained by state authorities without intent to prosecute them in a criminal trial. Orders can be renewed indefinitely, and evidence is kept secret, meaning that detainees are not able to effectively challenge their detention and do not know when they will be released. Since 1 January 2022, hundreds of Palestinians held in administrative detention have been boycotting Israeli military courts in protest of their detention without charge or trial. According to his lawyer, Salah Hammouri will be joining the boycott and will not attend hearings at the Israeli military court.  
Evidence collected by Amnesty International and other human rights groups over the decades indicates that administrative detention is used as an intentional Israeli policy to detain individuals, including prisoners of conscience held solely for the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and association and to punish them for their views and activism challenging the policies of occupation and Israel’s system of apartheid. According to Addameer, as of February 2022, there were 500 people in administrative detention, including one child, held without charge or trial by Israel.

On 15 March, the Guatemalan Congress shelved Decree 18-2022, which would have toughened the criminalization of abortion, including for miscarriages, prohibited inclusive sex education and discriminated against LGBTIQ+ people.   
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
In 2017, the Guatemalan Congress received Bill 5272. After several rounds of review, Congress passed the law (then Decree 18-2022) on 8 March 2022, International Women’s Day, by a majority of 101 votes in favor, with 8 against.  
The passing of this discriminatory law by Congress led to widespread protests in Guatemala, as well as international condemnation, including by Amnesty International, due to the risk it posed to the rights and lives of thousands of girls, woman and LGBTIQ+ people in the country.  
Reacting to mounting public pressure, on March 10, Guatemala’s president, Alejandro Giammattei, denounced that the Decree 18-2022 would violate the Constitution and Guatemala’s international human rights obligations. He therefore announced that he would exercise his presidential veto power over the Decree, requesting that Congress shelve the bill.  
Congress acquiesced to the President’s request, as well as national and international pressure, and shelved the bill on 15 March.   
This is a bill that should have never been debated, let alone passed, by Congress in the first place. The Congress of Guatemala must refrain from pursuing the approval of any other decree or similar pieces of legislation that violates the rights of women, girls or LGBTIQ+ persons.

Residents of Izium have been under a constant siege-like situation since 28 February, and warned that diminishing food and water supplies have left them at breaking point, as remaining civilians hide in their basements. 
Between 9 and 12 March, Amnesty International interviewed 26 residents of Izium, immediately after their evacuation to Svyatohirsk, a town in Donetsk Region that largely remains under Ukrainian control and has been under incessant Russian fire. 
 Dozens of small towns and villages in Ukraine are under relentless attack, with their desperate inhabitants finding themselves caught in the crossfire or under siege by attacking Russian forces,  
“The testimonies we have gathered from Izium reveal the terror experienced by the town’s civilian population, trapped in their basements with almost no food or water, and under constant attack. 
“Izium and other towns on the frontline now urgently need humanitarian corridors to enable the safe evacuation of civilians wishing to leave, and the delivery of humanitarian supplies to reach those who remain behind.” 
Reports of Russian military attacks on Izium first appeared on 28 February, and the town has been exposed to constant rocket fire since 3 March. 
Most of the town’s residential areas are cut off from electricity, gas, heating, and mobile communication as a result of attacks. According to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office, eight civilians, including two children, were killed in strikes on 3 March, which also caused significant damage to the town’s central hospital. Further casualties have been reported since that time. 
‘Everything was under fire’ 
Interviewees told Amnesty International that Russian forces carried out attacks that have killed and injured civilians, and destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure, including residential houses, schools, kindergartens, medical facilities, and food stores. Some of the attacks appear to have been indiscriminate, and therefore unlawful. 
Satellite imagery from 12 March reviewed by Amnesty International clearly showed craters and damage close to locations reported by open street maps as children’s schools and hospitals. 
Svitlana, a 72-year-old internally displaced person, has been living in Izium since relocating from Donetsk, which has been controlled by Russian-backed armed groups since 2014. 
She told Amnesty International: “When they began to bomb us, on 3 or 4 [March], we couldn’t go outside anymore. Day and night, rockets were being shot… If this continues for a few more days, the people and the town will be finished off.” 
Since the attacks began and several grocery stores were closed or destroyed, Izium’s population has been completely dependent on humanitarian aid and personal food supplies. Access to electricity, gas, heating and any form of communication has been cut, and they are also suffering due to lack of sanitation and water shortage. 
Tetyana, who stayed in a shelter in the town with her five-month-old baby, said: “When we were leaving [evacuating], there were three five-litre containers left for 55 people. I don’t know how they are going to survive.” 
Humanitarian aid and bread have been delivered to the town sporadically. However, due to shortages and the ongoing lack of communications, this has only reached some civilians, mainly those hiding in larger bomb shelters, which are often located in schools. 
Interviewees told Amnesty International that people who lived in residential neighbourhoods in individual family houses were struggling to access food as their neighbourhoods were among the most damaged, and most houses had no basement or just a very small basement to seek safety.  
Natalia, a resident of a private house, said: “We spent six days in the cellar. It’s very small, you have to stand in it, it’s impossible to lie down. As soon as there was a pause [in attacks], we would quickly run out, and get some eggs from the hens… Our child was hungry, since we hardly ate. All we had was leftover dry bread, apples from the cellar, canned pickles, and jam… We couldn’t get any other food anywhere; we couldn’t leave our house. Everything was under fire.” 
Two interviewees said they were caught in crossfire as battle raged in the town’s populated urban setting. One man said that several Ukrainian fighters – who would be considered lawful targets of attack under the rules of war – were based in one of the flats in their building which came under attack. Other Izium residents told Amnesty International that there were no military bases or other military objectives in the vicinity of their bombed-out neighbourhoods. 
Humanitarian corridors urgently needed 
On 9 March, according to local sources, constant strikes and indirect fire meant that local authorities were able to evacuate only 250 people from Izium, instead of the planned 5,000. On 10 March, a further 2,000 people were evacuated. Along with local authorities, local volunteers and activists used private cars to evacuate civilians. Many civilians, primarily older people and people with disabilities, chose to stay or were not able to leave. 
International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Russian forces must take all feasible precautions to spare civilians and civilian objects. 
Ukrainian forces should also take all feasible precautions to protect the civilian population and civilian objects under their control from the effects of attacks. In particular, they should avoid operating from civilian neighbourhoods, where they could draw fire that results in harm to civilians and civilian objects. 
Amnesty International has previously called for civilians whose homes have been destroyed and others fearing for their lives because of Russian bombardment to be granted access to safe humanitarian corridors. Amnesty International considers the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an act of aggression.

It helps to ensure that information emerging from conflict areas is timely, accurate and meets the needs of human rights work in crises situations. 
This is particularly important in situations where it is dangerous for researchers to be on the ground, and in an era when disinformation and misinformation can spread rapidly.   
The Evidence Lab has been working hard to identify and verify the details of possible unlawful attacks which have killed or injured civilians, and destroyed or damaged civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. This documentation provides essential evidence which can later be used to hold perpetrators of violations accountable. 
The Evidence Lab collects audio-visual material and analyzes it for evidence of violations of international law. This material includes satellite imagery, video footage and photos of air strikes and other attacks, and of the aftermath of these attacks, as well as images of weapons remnants. Where possible, evidence is corroborated by interviewing witnesses to the attacks. 
Below is a list of attacks by Russian forces in Ukraine which the Evidence Lab has verified to date. Some of these – including strikes on hospitals and schools, indiscriminate attacks which killed or injured civilians, and the use of banned cluster munitions – may constitute war crimes under international law. 
What is the Evidence Lab? 
Part of Amnesty’s Crisis Response Programme, the Evidence Lab brings together open source and visual investigators, remote sensing experts, weapons analysts, data scientists, developers and other experts to conduct digital investigations and tell the stories of people most affected by conflict. 
The Evidence Lab website provides an online space to share best practices, new techniques, resources and guides, helping human rights investigators to take advantage of the vast amount of information which is shared online every day. 
Find out more about their work here. 
The Evidence Lab receives information from a variety of sources, including what is known as “citizen evidence” – material that has been collected by someone other than an established human rights investigator. 
This sort of documentation is frequently shared publicly through social media networks such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and often exposes in great detail abuses which might have otherwise gone unnoticed. The Lab also receives evidence directly from witnesses on the ground. 
Depending on what they are looking for, Evidence Lab researchers use a range of verification methods. These include: 
Geo and chrono-location 
Confirming where and when a video or photo was taken. This can be done by cross-checking the material with satellite imagery, ground level photography and other publicly available information. A researcher can look at the landscape, trees, buildings, and streets in the images, and check if they match with street views or other photos from a known location. 
The researchers can also analyze weather patterns and shadows to see if they match the conditions that prevailed when the photo or video was claimed to have been taken. 
Remote sensing 
The researchers use satellite imagery and other sensors such as Radar and LiDAR to look for tell-tale signs of attacks like destroyed buildings, craters, debris, troop or weapon movements.  A bird’s eye view is also important to cross-check and verify potential targets and understand the dynamics of these attacks. 
Weapons identification 
Amnesty International’s arms experts analyze photos, videos and other data to verify which weapons are being used and if they lead to human rights violations. This could include studying the shape of a crater left by a missile, watching footage of air strikes, or examining photos of weapons remnants. The researchers also analyze weapons trade data to understand ownerships of these weapons 
Eyewitnesses 
Importantly, the Evidence Lab works with researchers who interview eyewitnesses to attacks and collect testimonies that might corroborate the digital evidence. 
Preservation 
The Evidence Lab catalogues and preserves all the original evidence, together with all its verification and analysis for accountability and justice mechanisms. We aim to support relevant justice actors, and hand over our evidence to ensure perpetrators are held to account. 
The Evidence Lab works both intensively, documenting individual attacks in great detail, and in a big picture way, looking for broad patterns of violations and building a detailed timeline of events. A key goal is to provide an accurate account of events, combating the misinformation and disinformation that is often rampant during conflicts and other crisis situations. 
These documentation efforts are also useful in compiling a log of reliable evidence that could later be used to hold perpetrators of human rights violations to account. 
More broadly, we help to tell the stories of people who are directly affected by these crises and to give them a voice.

“Russia’s withdrawal from the Council of Europe comes on the heels of its act of aggression against Ukraine, where its troops have committed possible war crimes and serious human rights violations. Though it came ahead of a vote by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe leading to its departure, Russia’s preemptive decision to leave Europe’s principal guardian of human rights and the rule of law and denounce the European Convention on Human Rights is a tragedy for the victims of the Kremlin’s human rights abuses.   
“Outside the Council of Europe and given the further degradation of Russia’s rule of law, some of the last safeguards against human rights abuses and will be off limits to those who need them most in today’s Russia.    
“All stakeholders in Russia, including its legislators, should take steps to oppose this reckless move and prevent the country sliding ever deeper into an abyss defined by a total disregard for human rights.”   
Background  
During an emergency session on 15 March 2022, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe voted in favour of Russia’s departure from the organization. Earlier the same day, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Secretary General of the Council of Europe (CoE) of the Russian Federation’s withdrawal from the organization, under Article 7 of the Statute of the Council of Europe, as well as its intention to denounce the European Convention on Human Rights.   
Earlier, on 25 February, the CoE Committee of Ministers suspended the Russian Federation from its rights of representation in with immediate effect as a result of the Russian Federation’s military invasion of Ukraine. The CoE Committee of Ministers described Russia’s actions as “a breach of peace of unprecedented magnitude on the European continent since the creation of the Council of Europe” and a breach of Article 3 of the Statute.  
Only one state, Greece, has withdrawn from the Council of Europe, in 1969, during the Regime of the Colonels. In 1974, after the fall of the Greek junta, the country was re-admitted to the Council of Europe.

  The unlawful use of Pegasus in El Salvador is part of a wider pattern of harassment and threats against journalists and human rights defenders, who work in an increasingly hostile environment.  
Technical experts from Amnesty International’s Security Lab peer-reviewed the findings and independently verified forensic evidence showing that Pegasus has been abused in the country. 
“NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware is being used as a weapon to silence journalists in El Salvador and across the world. The IACHR hearing is a key step towards accountability for people who have been unlawfully targeted by spyware,” said Belissa Guerrero Rivas, Regional Advocacy Coordinator for the Americas at Amnesty International. 
“The unlawful use of Pegasus in El Salvador is part of a wider pattern of harassment and threats against journalists and human rights defenders, who work in an increasingly hostile environment. This underscores the need for a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation into the unlawful use of this technology in the country. There also needs to be an immediate moratorium on the use of spyware technology until a regulatory framework that protects human rights is implemented.” 
Wednesday’s hearing is the first by the IACHR on cyber-surveillance in the country. The hearing was requested by the Asociación de Periodistas de El Salvador Periódico Digital El Faro, Revista Gato Encerrado, Fundación para el Debido Proceso and the Centro por la Justicia y el Derecho Internacional), following January’s revelations. 
The IACHR hearing will be available to watch here

0,Member Perspectives on IWD:  Reflections on the Anniversary of the Atlanta Spa Shootings and Ongoing Attacks on Asian Women,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/member-perspectives-on-iwd-reflections-on-the-anniversary-of-the-atlanta-spa-shootings-and-ongoing-attacks-on-asian-women/,"Content Warning: Anti-Asian racism and hate crimes, (sexual) gender-based violence, gun violence, death Note: ‘Asian’ is often misused to refer to only people of East Asian descent, reinforcing a monolith and ignoring the several other cultures represented across the continent of Asia. ...","Content Warning: Anti-Asian racism and hate crimes, (sexual) gender-based violence, gun violence, death 
Note: ‘Asian’ is often misused to refer to only people of East Asian descent, reinforcing a monolith and ignoring the several other cultures represented across the continent of Asia.  
March 16, 2022, marks the 1-year anniversary of the Atlanta Spa Shootings, where a gunman took eight innocent lives (6 of which were Asian women).  
This tragedy came during a period of significant increase in hate crimes against people of Asian descent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, with major cities reporting crime rates of six to seven hundred percent higher than the previous year.  
While not all instances of violence against Asians are necessarily rooted in racism, it is still extremely difficult to digest seeing another one of us dying amid this concurrent surge in hate crimes. 
Despite this sudden increase, the roots of anti-Asian violence have can be traced far earlier than just the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of the hate is rooted in North America’s long and sordid history of anti-Asian racism (influenced by Eurocentrism and Orientalism), demonstrated by government and organizational policies and actions rooted in xenophobia and sinophobia. From the exploitation of Chinese labourers in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1881-1885) to the Chinese Head Tax of the Chinese Immigration/ Exclusion Act (1923), prejudices and stereotypical views against Asians has been ingrained in our systems and institutions, and the latest surge in anti-Asian violence should not be surprising. 
The sinophobic rhetoric spewed by politicians and anti-Chinese people alike is compounded by misinformation related to COVID-19, which has provoked the attacks, harassment, and murders of many members of Asian diaspora communities. While sinophobia refers to the fear and hatred of China, the attitude contributes to racism against other nationalities and ethnicities due to the West’s misconception of Asia as a monolith dominated by China. For example, not all victims of these attacks have necessarily been of East or Southeast Asian descent but merely held physical features which resembled these ethnicities.  
The Model Minority Myth: How it Breeds Racism, Xenophobia and Sexual Violence  
The myth of the model minority is built on perceptions and stereotypes that views all Asians as hard-working, independent, intelligent, and economically prosperous. In labelling Asians with these traits, the view is that they are positioned more closely to whiteness, and therefore less othered. This myth causes a separation from the perceptions of other minority groups, creating the harmful “Oppression Olympics,” that  degrades and undermines other racialized peoples. For more context, please read Unboxing the Model Minority Myth | Meegan Lim. 
Behaviours that treat all Asians as simply rule-abiding or as not holding the kinds of needs that would warrant societal or government policy concerns, manifest unrealistic expectations. For members of Asian communities, the stereotype also develops a fear among them of failing to conform to those so-called positive stereotypes.  
Western imperialism has contributed to many other inequalities and injustices. One of the most overlooked examples of this is the objectification, fetishization and exoticism of ‘Asian’ women. This hypersexualiziation of East and Southeast Asian women and girls is not only degrading, but is rooted in views stemming from the fears of yellow peril. In fact, there is a direct connection between the gunman and the Atlanta Spa Shootings, whose actions he justified by claiming his need to eliminate his sexual addiction. Anti-Asian racism is undeniably embedded in this kind of mentality, which also results in the added harm of heightening the stigma of sex work. 
Asian: The US Census Bureau defines a person of the Asian race as “having origins in any of the original inhabitants of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.” 
Yellow Peril: A racial construct that emerged from Europe during the end of the 19th century in response to rising fears of Asian invasion. The theory states that Asians were uncivilized, of lower intelligence, and dangerous, this posing a serious threat to the more civilized white nations of the west. 
Yellow Fever: The fetishization of predominantly East Asian women because they are perceived as docile, feminine, and submissive. 
It Could Have Been Us: Personal Reflections from the Authors 
Reflections from Linnea Nguyen:  
I answer the question “Where are you from?” quite often; in school, at work, almost everywhere. Some are more subtle than others, some are even more polite than others. I am an 18 year old student, born and raised in Montreal, QC. Naturally, I assume that they mean to ask about my ethnicity. I reply that I am half Vietnamese. The most common response is “Wow! So exotic!” What they mean is that I’m comfortably white enough, but with a dash of something else that they find intriguing – something that reminds them of the unrelenting fetishization of Asian women. I’m the right mix of white and “exotic” to them.  
There is a line drawn in the sand for the image of Asian women. On one side, a nerdy girl studies at her desk under artificial light, studying tirelessly for a test the next day that she must get an A on. On the other side, the same girl stands in a short skirt, pigtails, glasses, and a button-down blouse. This is a typical example of the image of duality created for Asian women. Exotic, submissive, and docile.  
I am proud to say I am half Vietnamese. But the suggestive grins that follow our answers to their questions work to shrink, silence, and sexualize Asian women. This incessant dehumanization primes Asian women to be targets of abuse and violence.  
The expectation of docility must be eliminated, but the only means of doing so is by reclaiming our identities, our sexualities, and our bodies. We must speak out when issues like such go untreated for too long. We must keep breaking barriers by setting a new standard of who Asian women are and what we can do. By rewriting narratives, we can better escape these dangerous tropes and hold perpetrators accountable.  
Reflections from Trisha mae-Capistrano: 
I am a 19 year old student who has now lived in two of the most multicultural cities in Canada: Vancouver and Montreal. Growing up amidst such diversity, I was made to believe that racist attacks were events that happened to people out there, in places unlike where I lived where people of all backgrounds seemingly lived in harmony. But when I read headlines on the assaults and murders of Asian women, I now think, “that could have been me.” And that can still be me. I know that these women were not attacked simply for being women, but also for their Asian identity and that is what motivated their attackers and murderers. I know that if I had been at that same location at any of those same times, it could have been me in any of their places. Headline after headline has inevitably instilled in me profound fears. When I am on public transportation, I wonder whether someone might utter a derogatory comment to me. When I pass through metro doors, I quickly scan to see if anyone is staring at me and hope no one will hate me for simply being there on the train. When I walk home alone, I wonder whether any of the strangers I walk past might want to harm me. It has become instinctive now to glance behind me after I have passed someone to check if they might follow me or be gearing up for an attack.  
Knowing that many people blame Asians for “bringing COVID to the country” makes me wonder if I should enter certain public spaces. I take deep, anxious breaths as I walk down busy city streets, into cafes, or grocery stores where I might encounter someone who would blame the pandemic on me and “my people.” As I enter predominantly white spaces, I wonder if everyone will have already made up their mind about the kind of person I am as soon as I walk in.  
I can imagine that the same fears cross the minds of other Asian women. I, and perhaps others, have come to the realization that these incidents of targeted Asian violence do not just happen out there, but they can happen to us. Statistics and reports indicate that targeted assaults on Asians are not just one-off experiences but that a pattern of this violence has formed, and is increasing. Asian women have for years, advocated for themselves and their safety, but they have yet to be fully heard. Action must be taken to prevent more headlines on anti-Asian hate, to prevent the continued rise of statistics of assaults and deaths, and to continue pushing for anti-Asian hate awareness so that these instances of hate are not simply added to reports and then forgotten.  
Reflections from Rachel Lim:  
Having grown up in Brampton, ON, one of Canada’s most multicultural and ethnically diverse cities, I learned to appreciate the beauty of other cultures and languages. Despite the city’s large immigrant and South Asian population, I still faced racial discrimination as it intersected with misogyny. Now, a 20-year old student living in Ottawa, I continue to struggle with my Chinese-Malaysian identity, especially in an environment where the city’s Chinatown constantly undergoes gentrification, including plastering the streets with orientalist murals that fetishize our women, our histories, and our cultures. Many of these murals are painted by white male tattoo artists who profit from cultural appropriation. They use their status to manipulate narratives and dialogue around who Asian people are and what they look and act like, further contributing to the hyper-sexualization and infantilization of Asian women. 
The only admiration or affection I received growing up was through upholding the model minority myth and stereotypes that came with it. I infantilized myself to please my former partners, who often had yellow fever. To feel accepted and respected, I laughed with my friends as they spewed racist jokes and called me offensive terms. No matter how hard I tried to socially conform and feel accepted, I only felt disgusting, degraded, and dehumanized. The intersections of misogyny and racism convince men that Asian women and girls are uniquely vulnerable, exotic, and, unfortunately, youthful. As young girls, we have been socialized to accept this highly toxic culture where grooming and pedophilia are normalized, and no one ever called it out. 
After the Atlanta Spa Shootings, I felt more open to discussing the intersections of my identity and the lived experiences that have shaped the person I am today. Debriefing my trauma and proposing ways to implement action has become therapeutic because it keeps me hopeful. However, as March 16, 2022 approaches, my anxiety has noticeably spiked. 
The only way for me to find peace within myself and ensure that our voices are heard is through writing, activism, and art. With bottled-up anger and frustration over the accumulation of such pain, tragedy, regret, and shame, I wrote Your Yellow Fever Lives On, an expressive spoken word poem. 
Amnesty Canada’s Position 
Amnesty Canada has campaigns and statements condemning gun violence, racism, and gender-based violence. We must recognize all women, girls and gender diverse people and their many intersections of identity that put them at risk of human rights abuses.

One year on after the Atlanta Spa shootings, attention on anti-Asian hate and violence against women has been largely absent. Nearly every media story or report still centers the narrative only on the tragedy, exposing a wider gap in the media coverage and awareness of the larger systemic conditions that pre-empted the attack itself. There is a longer path forward in securing the freedom for women and girls, and in enhancing the rights for Asian and Pacific Islander communities.

As a young Indigenous woman I feel a responsibility to educate myself on the issues facing Canadian Indigenous populations. The fact that Indigenous women in Canada are 3 times more likely to experience violence and 6 times more likely to be murdered, regardless of age, socioeconomic status, and whether or not they live on or off a reserve, is astounding to me. I felt very strongly that I wanted to do something to help. I have always felt very inspired by Sarah McLachlan’s Lilith Fair featuring all female musicians. I thought having a local Lilith Fair concert was the perfect way to raise money and awareness for this important issue so I decided to call the concert “Lilith”. The goal of the event was to educate people about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, to raise money to help support this cause and to also honour the spirits of these women in a celebration of song.  
The response I received was so overwhelming. Performers volunteered their time and donated their talents, local businesses agreed to sponsor the event, the poster design was contributed by a local artist, and the staff and crew at the concert venue were very supportive. Everyone involved was eager to help make this happen. To be honest, I wasn’t quite sure what kind of response I would receive. I am 15 years old and despite having some experience as a performer, I had no experience directing a show. I was so grateful for how much faith everyone had in me to accomplish this.  
A local female Elder opened the show with a prayer followed by a song from 4 female drummers. The six female musicians that performed were all very intentional with their song choices making it very clear this was an issue that was important to them as well. The show was filled with tears but also laughter. One of the most impactful moments of the evening was when performer Allison Crowe sang “Lisa’s Song”. The song is a tribute to Allison’s friend Lisa Marie Young, a young Indigenous woman who went missing almost 20 years ago. It was such an honour to have Allison share Lisa’s song and story. For the finale, all the performers gathered on stage to sing Sarah McLachlans’s Angel. It was a perfect way to end the show.  
The sold out concert was a huge success and we surpassed my goal, raising over $5000 for Amnesty. The evening was powerful and one I will never forget. I am so proud of everything that was accomplished. The issue of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls is the result of many factors including racist and sexist stereotypes and decades of government inaction so it is easy to feel like there is nothing you can do to help. But this concert helped me realize that learning the true history of Indigenous people in Canada, and listening to their voices and stories is a great first step in the right direction.

Some of the most devastating human rights violations happen to those who are out of sight and out of mind. Canada’s prided reputation as a multicultural haven has long hidden some of the country’s most serious abuses against those who come here seeking protection or a better life. Over the past decade, Canada has incarcerated tens of thousands of immigration detainees, including children and refugee claimants, for non-criminal reasons. This structural violence disproportionately hurts communities of colour. 
Now, B.C. has the chance to stop the incarceration of immigration detainees in the province’s jails — a move that will put a dent in the racist and punitive foundation of the immigration detention system. 
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has the power to decide who is detained, for what reason, and under what conditions — whether in an immigration detention facility or a provincial jail. Although immigration detainees are held exclusively under immigration law, they regularly endure criminal law measures when jailed, including handcuffs, shackles, lockdowns, constant surveillance, and even solitary confinement. Because there are no legal time limits on immigration detention, detainees may languish in jail for months or years. The longest instance of detention lasted 11 years and involved a Black man with apparent mental health conditions. 
The racism that underpins the immigration detention regime is structural — it is embedded in the system’s very fabric and manifests at every level of its operation. In a scathing recent report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called on authorities to acknowledge and address systemic racism within CBSA and the immigration detention system. The report raises serious concerns about the fact that immigration detainees from communities of colour, and in particular Black men, are confined in more restrictive conditions, including maximum-security provincial jails, and for more prolonged periods of time. According to CBSA data, in 2019 most immigration detainees held for 90 days or longer were from countries in Africa or the Caribbean. And the longer people were detained, the more likely they were to be incarcerated in provincial jails rather than dedicated immigration detention facilities. 
The horrific practice of jailing immigration detainees in provincial facilities seems to be getting worse. From April 2017 until the onset of the pandemic, CBSA jailed about 5,400 immigration detainees across the country. In the year after the onset of the pandemic, despite releasing immigration detainees at unprecedented rates for public health reasons, CBSA has relied more heavily on provincial jails for those who remained behind bars. The portion of immigration detainees held in provincial jails and the average length of detention both doubled as compared to previous years. 
But there is reason for hope. B.C. recently agreed to review its agreement with CBSA that authorizes locking up immigration detainees in B.C. jails. This is a laudable move, and a much-needed development. But the province has yet to release any details about this review — its terms, scope, or focus. Crucially, the province has not released any details about whether, and the method by which, the review will inquire into structural racism in the composition and administration of these arrangements, or the disproportionate impact these arrangements have on communities of colour. 
The violations taking place in immigration detention are not abstract. They dehumanize, traumatize, and devastate. One former detainee from a country in Africa who was quoted in the report stated, “I didn’t feel like a human in there; I felt like a dog. The guards would just open the latch to feed me.” Another man from Africa described the powerlessness he felt in detention: “We didn’t feel like we had any hope. … A lot of people were ready to die. … I gave myself a time limit: that if I’m not released by a certain date, I’m going to find a way (to commit suicide).” 
B.C. stands at a crossroads. It can continue business as usual. Or it can end its complicity in CBSA’s systemic racism by cancelling its immigration detention contract with the agency that has facilitated discrimination and the serious human rights violations perpetrated within the immigration detention system.

Thank you to everyone who has mobilized in solidarity with Raif and his family over the past ten years!  
“The release of Raif Badawi after being imprisoned in Saudi Arabia is a great relief, but does not erase the cruel treatment Raif suffered or the injustice of his imprisonment. The Saudi authorities must ensure that he is not subject to any other punitive measures, such as a ban on travel or the use of social media,” said Colette Lelièvre, head of campaigns at Amnistie Internationale Canada.    
In fact, Raif Badawi is still stuck in Saudi Arabia, as he is currently banned from leaving the country for the next 10 years, while his family lives in Sherbrooke, Quebec. He is also banned from using any social media for the next 10 years, which greatly limits his ability to express himself.  
Raif must be allowed to reunite with his family in Canada. Amnesty International is calling for the travel and social media bans to be lifted from Raif and other affected human rights activists in Saudi Arabia.  
FURTHER INFORMATION  
Raif Badawi was detained on June 17, 2012 and sentenced in 2014 to 10 years in prison, followed by a 10-year travel ban and a 1 million Saudi Arabian riyal (about USD 267,000) fine for creating an online forum for public debate and accusations that he insulted Islam. He was also sentenced to a cruel and inhuman punishment of 1,000 lashes, the first 50 of which were meted out in a public square in Jeddah in January 2015.  
Over the last few years, the Saudi Arabian authorities have invested heavily in public relations stunts to rebrand their image and attempt to deflect attention from their brutal crackdown on activists and human rights defenders. Although there was a brief lull in executions and prosecutions of activists during Saudi Arabia’s presidency of the G20 summit, that ended immediately after the event when the authorities ramped up their repression once again.  
Dozens of people are currently incarcerated in Saudi Arabia for their activism, human rights work or for expressing dissenting views. Human rights defenders who have been released from prison, such as Raif Badawi, remain subject to court orders banning travel and banning the use of social media.

Bernardo led a legal challenge over failure on the part of authorities to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples to meaningful consultation and decision making about hydro-electric projects that impact their land and access to water. Amnesty International has declared Bernardo to be a prisoner of conscience and is campaigning for his release. Scroll down to the bottom of this blog for solidarity action you can take. 
I write to express my gratitude to the people, the friends, who sent me letters and greetings to encourage me in this struggle … Everything you wrote strengthens me. Your letters will not be read just once, but many times for strength to continue resisting. Justice for the Maya Q’eqchi’ people! Justice for the Cahabón River! The struggle continues and continues! 
“Rivers are alive, they sing, breathe, laugh and also get angry. Rivers are fed. They give life to thousands of living beings. Rivers cry. March 14, International Day of Action for Rivers, is a special date to speak out and demand that they do not turn our running rivers into dams. Rivers know their way where they have passed for thousands of years. It is a crime against humanity to be diverting and cutting off the life of our rivers. It is humanity’s obligation to defend our rivers.  
I have been in prison for four years. They fabricated crimes against me for denouncing the diversion of the Cahabón River for hydroelectric plants, most of them built by Grupo ACS of Florentino Pérez, president of Real Madrid. 
It’s been four years that I have resisted inside these four walls. Four years that I have been separated from my family. Four years that I have not been able to live with my two daughters Ni’kte’ and Yaretzi, who have grown up without me. Four years of confinement that has greatly affected my health. 
Despite all these circumstances, I continue to resist. I continue our struggle. I continue to denounce and to demand justice for my people and for the Cahabón River. 
Approximately 50 kilometers of the river have been diverted and taken over by hydroelectric plants. As a result, how many people have been denied the right to water? How many living beings have been killed by diverting an ancient river into a tunnel? 
I also denounce that the majority of Mayan Q’eqchi’ communities are in darkness. They do not have electricity. The electricity produced by the companies is taken to other countries to be sold, while the communities suffer the dispossession and looting of natural resources, the rivers and springs. Development is for the companies and not for the communities. 
Prosecutors of the Ministerio Público, judges, magistrates and owners of companies have to be celebrating. They must be congratulating themselves for the criminalization plan they carried out against me and against my people. But history is recording their actions. What they do to my people today will be discussed, analyzed and condemned for hundreds of years, for many generations. The people and history do not forget their executioners. 
I will never tire of telling people that the fabricated crimes and prosecution files against me are in the public domain. Anyone can review them, verify all the falsehoods there and conclude that the only goal of imprisoning me is to create fear in Q’eqchi’ communities so that they do not claim their rights, while the predators appropriate the rivers. The legal proceedings against me are intended to teach us a “lesson”. 
 The only goal of imprisoning me is to create fear in Q’eqchi’ communities so that they do not claim their rights, while the predators appropriate the rivers.  
It is early morning as I write these lines and very cold here in the jail in Cobán, Alta Verapaz. Four years I have been imprisoned … I will not give up this struggle. I embrace all my people, who have not abandoned me and continue this struggle, who continue to resist. My people will not give up. 
My thanks to all the organizations inside and outside Guatemala that have offered their solidarity and accompanied me in this struggle, during all the difficult moments of criminalization and persecution … For our future and the future of new generations, we must struggle in unity.”

0,Russia: Authorities block Amnesty International’s Russian-language website,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/russia-authorities-block-amnesty-internationals-russian-language-website/,"Responding to the Russian authorities’ decision to block access to Amnesty International’s Russian-language website as part of the Kremlin’s assault on freedom of expression following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia...","Responding to the Russian authorities’ decision to block access to Amnesty International’s Russian-language website as part of the Kremlin’s assault on freedom of expression following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director, said:  
“People in Russia have the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds and from all available sources. By blocking Amnesty’s Russian-language site, along with those of many other human rights organizations, independent media outlets and social media platforms, the Kremlin is showing that it can’t stomach the truth about the horror Russia has unleased in Ukraine.    
This is just the latest attempt by the Russian authorities to suppress information about the possible war crimes its troops are committing in Ukraine and hide them from internet users across the country. We call on Russia to immediately unblock Amnesty’s Russian language website and allow people to freely decide what sources of information they want to access.”   
Background  
On 11 March, it transpired that the Russian media regulator, Roskomnadzor, blocked access to Amnesty International’s Russian-language website (eurasia.amnesty.org), as well as the websites of Human Rights Movement Golos (an independent election watchdog) and two independent media outlets, Colta and Vazhnye Istorii (Important Stories). Last week, the latter was designated as an “undesirable organization”, which criminalized its operations and barred it from working in Russia. The blocking of all these websites was implemented at the request of the Prosecutor General.  
Over the last three weeks, the Russian authorities have unleashed an unprecedented nationwide crackdown on independent journalism, anti-war protests and any voices opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including by effectively banning the use of such terms as “war” and “invasion” and criminalizing independent reporting on the conflict.

“We are so happy. Actually, we are euphoric! We have won at last!” said Orbin Hernández, a teacher and leader of the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Assets in the northern Honduran municipality of Tocoa. “It is thanks to support from inside and outside Honduras that we are now free from criminal persecution by the justice system and the oligarchy behind it.” 
“My heart is overflowing with joy,” added Daniel Márquez, a farmer and member of the Guapinol Water Board. “We are very thankful to the national and international organizations who always believed in our innocence.” 
During their unjust detention, Amnesty International issued multiple Urgent Actions mobilizing supporters to write letters calling for the release of the defenders.  
Amnesty publicly declared that the eight were prisoners of conscience, jailed in retaliation for their involvement in peaceful efforts to protect their community’s source of water from contamination by a controversial mine operation owned by one of the most powerful couples in Honduras. 
On February 9, following a trial plagued with illegalities, a sentencing court in Trujillo found six of the eight Guapinol River defenders guilty of crimes against Inversiones Los Pinares, the company operating the iron-ore mine and processing concession in a formerly protected national park, crimes punishable with up to 14 years in jail.  
The verdict provoked widespread indignation. The UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, Mary Lawlor, said she was “appalled”. Amnesty International called the verdict “outrageous” and urged that it be quashed. “The defenders are victims of arbitrary detention and unfounded criminal prosecution, stemming solely from their legitimate work defending the right to water and a healthy environment,” said Amnesty’s Americas director Erika Guevara-Rosas. Concluded defence lawyer Edy Tabora: “The prosecutors failed to provide any evidence of a crime …This is a political verdict that demonstrates the power of economic elites in this country.”  
But outrage turned to jubilation on February 10. The Supreme Court finally responded to an appeal submitted two years earlier, and ruled that the Guapinol River defenders should never have spent one day in jail. On February 24, all eight defenders were free at last and reunited with their families. 
Scenes of joy in #Honduras as the Guapinol River defenders are reunited with their families, ordered free at last after 914 days in illegal, unjust, arbitrary detention for peacefully defending water that is life for their communities. Justice. Finally. #LibertadParaGuapinol https://t.co/s4CGfjma70 
The Guapinol River defenders have inspired many with their David and Goliath struggle against a mining operation and its powerful backers, who voted to rezone a protected area, provided permits and misused the justice system to lock up opponents. 
Just hours after regaining their freedom, the Guapinol River defenders were undeterred and pledged to renew their campaign. 
“Our struggle continues, said Daniel Márquez: “We invite others to join us.”   
“We are protecting the right to water, the right to life,” added Orbin Hernández.

The health of Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari (84) continues to deteriorate while in detention. He is being deprived of adequate medical treatment for his advanced prostate cancer. His and his son, Dr. Hani al-Khudari’s prison sentences ended on 28 February, but they remain detained until the Supreme Court reviews the appealed sentences of all the defendants in the mass trial which both men are part of. Meanwhile, Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari’s life is at serious risk in prison. Amnesty International urges the Saudi Arabian authorities to release both men immediately. Pending their release, they must be granted immediate access to adequate medical care.  
The health situation of Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari (84) is rapidly deteriorating in detention in Abha prison, in Saudi Arabia’s ‘Asir Region, where prison authorities continue to deprive him of the urgent specialized medical care he requires for his advanced prostate cancer. Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari is now completely deprived of any cancer medication and has not seen a specialist for the past two years, since his transfer from Dahban prison to Abha prison, which lacks medical care for detainees. In addition, he urgently needs to see a cardiologist, a bone doctor and a dentist to treat his numerous ailments. Depriving him of adequate medical care is a violation of his right to health and puts his life at risk. His son, Dr. Hani al-Khudari also requires urgent medical care to remove kidney stones in addition to urgent dental care.  
On 28 December 2021, the Specialized Criminal Court of Appeal in Riyadh recommended decreasing Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari’s sentence from 15 to six years in prison; and sentenced Dr. Hani al-Khudari to three years in prison including time served. Based on this, both men finished their prison sentences on 28 February 2022. Yet they remain in detention since the case is still with the Court of Appeal and has not been sent to the Supreme Court for a final decision. The authorities have justified this delay by the bureaucratic work required for a mass trial which involves 68 defendants, among them Dr. Mohammed and Hani al-Khudari.  
The Al-Khudari family submitted a request to the court in 2021 to release Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari on grounds of his old age and deteriorating health. Despite the request being approved in February 2022 by both the Specialized Criminal Court and the State Security, the Abha prison authorities have yet to grant Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari’s release.

Additional information  
Palestinian nationals Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari and Dr. Hani al-Khudari were arbitrarily arrested on 4 April 2019 and remained in detention without charges until 8 March 2020. Both men were subjected to gross human rights violations including enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and detention, being held incommunicado and in solitary confinement. Furthermore, both men were interrogated behind closed doors without the presence or participation of their lawyers. In November 2020, they were transferred to Abha prison, which lacks medical specialists and the standard care necessary.  
On 8 March 2020, both men were charged before the Specialized Criminal Court with “joining a terrorist entity” – understood to be Hamas de facto authorities – as part a mass trial of 68 individuals. Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari was additionally charged with holding several leadership positions within the entity. This trial was marred by numerous and serious violations of their due process rights, including enforced disappearance, arbitrary arrest and detention, being held incommunicado and solitary confinement. On 8 August 2021, the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh sentenced Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari to 15 years in prison, with half the term discounted given his age; leaving him with seven and a half years to serve in detention; and sentenced Dr. Hani al-Khudari to three years in prison including time served, followed by deportation from Saudi Arabia. Following the appeal, on 28 December 2021, the Court of Appeal in Riyadh reduced the sentence of Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari to six years in prison, with half the term discounted given his age; and upheld Dr. Hani al-Khudari’s sentence. Based on this, both men should have been released from prison on 28 February 2022.  
Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari suffers from prostate cancer and has lost mobility in his right arm due to the harsh sleeping conditions in his cell, and he has lost half of his hearing. Furthermore, he suffers dental problems on the left side of his mouth, resulting in teeth loss and difficulty eating. Consequently, Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari has significantly lost weight. Recently, the family reported to Amnesty International that Dr. Mohammed’s health has further deteriorated, as he now suffers incontinence, herniated discs, knee pains, bone fragility and general frailty. Despite his life-threatening situation, Dr. al-Khudari has not been granted access to a cancer specialist nor to a dentist, even though he has been admitted to hospital a few times. Similarly, Dr. Hani al-Khudari, suffers anaemia and kidney stones, and has been refused adequate medical care. Furthermore, both men contracted COVID-19 in prison.  
Dr. Mohammed and Hani al-Khudari’s family is especially concerned given the history of death in detention in Saudi Arabian prisons. In April 2020, a leading Saudi human rights activist, Dr. Abdullah al-Hamid entered a coma and passed away after suffering a stroke in detention. Then, in October 2021, prominent Saudi cleric Musa al-Qarni was brutally beaten and murdered in prison by another inmate. “We are very concerned for their lives. We pleaded with the authorities to provide them with proper medical care, or place Dr. Mohammed under house arrest so that he can receive treatment, or expedite the release process, but no response so far… This is like a death sentence”, a relative told Amnesty International.  
The treatment and detention conditions have placed a great deal of stress and psychological pressure on both men, especially Dr. Mohammed al-Khudari. Such conduct violates the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment. Furthermore, both men continue to be deprived of regular communication with their family, as prison authorities can simply cancel their weekly call or monthly family visit without explanation.  
The arrests of the two Palestinian nationals is part of a wider crackdown by the Saudi Arabian authorities on Palestinian, Jordanian and Saudi Arabian nationals residing in Saudi Arabia with a perceived link to Hamas de facto authorities.  
Amnesty International has documented the Saudi Arabian authorities’ use of the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) since 2011 to systematically silence dissent, concluding that SCC judges have presided over grossly unfair trials, handing down prison sentences of up to 30 years and numerous death sentences under vague provisions of the counter-terror and anti-cybercrime laws.

Idris Hasan, an ethnic Uyghur living in Turkey, was arrested in July 2021 in Morocco on the basis of an Interpol red notice, which has since been cancelled. The Chinese government reportedly considers him a “terrorist”, which Chinese law defines in an overly broad and vague manner, because of the work he had previously done for Uyghur organizations. On 15 December 2021, the Moroccan Court of Cassation ruled in favour of Idris Hasan’s extradition. Idris Hasan remains in detention and at high risk of being extradited to China where he will face a real risk of arbitrary detention and torture. The Moroccan authorities must immediately cancel his extradition.  
Idris Hasan (official name Yidiresi Aishan), a Uyghur Muslim Chinese national, was arrested on the night of 19 July 2021 at Casablanca airport on the basis of an Interpol red notice issued at the request of the Chinese authorities. He was subsequently taken to a prison near the town of Tiflet, in northwestern Morocco, where he remains held.  
The Chinese government reportedly considers him to be a “terrorist”, because of the work he had previously done for Uyghur organizations and requested Idris Hasan’s extradition based on an extradition treaty China signed with Morocco in 2016. Chinese law defines “terrorism” and “extremism” in an overly broad and vague manner which has been used to persecute Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities.  
There is detailed testimonial and documentary evidence that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang on the basis of their religion and ethnicity.  
Morocco is obliged under international law not to transfer any individual, including through deportation or extradition, to a country where that person would be at real risk of torture or other serious human rights violations. Despite Interpol having since cancelled the red notice, due to non-compliance with its Constitution, Idris Hasan has remained in prison and on 15 December 2021 the Moroccan Court of Cassation ruled in favour of his extradition to China (ruling No. 1799). If extradited to China, he will be at real risk of arbitrary detention and torture and his extradition would violate Morocco’s obligations under international law.

Additional Information:  
Idris Hasan is a 34-year-old computer designer who has been living in Turkey since 2012, with his wife and three children. He is a Chinese national from Korla, Xinjiang, and belongs to the Uyghur ethnic group. He was arrested on the night of 19 July 2021 at Casablanca airport where he was in transit to Western Europe after leaving Turkey, where he no longer felt safe.  
In August 2021, several UN Special Procedures mandate holders recalled the absolute and non-derogable prohibition on returning persons to a place where they would be in danger of being subjected to torture or other ill-treatment, in accordance with Article 3 of the UN Convention against Torture, to which Morocco is a party. The principle of non-refoulement is also contained in the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (ICPPED). As a party to the above legal instruments, Morocco has an obligation to abide by their provisions.  
However, on 15 December 2021, the Moroccan Court of Cassation issued a favourable opinion on the extradition request in its ruling No. 1799. The day after, on 16 December 2021, four UN Special Rapporteurs urged the Moroccan government not to implement the Court of Cassation’s decision citing the risk of “serious human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, or torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.  
On 20 December 2021, the UN Committee against Torture (CAT) granted interim measures, requesting that Morocco not extradite Idris Hasan to China. Thanks also to international pressure, he is still in Morocco, but the Moroccan authorities have still to reply to the CAT request of interim measures. Idris Hasan remains at high risk of extradition to China where he will likely face serious human rights violations including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, or torture.  
Xinjiang is one of the most ethnically diverse regions in China. More than half of the region’s population of 22 million people belong to mostly Turkic and predominantly Muslim ethnic groups, including Uyghurs (around 11.3 million), Kazakhs (around 1.6 million) and other populations whose languages, cultures and ways of life vary distinctly from those of the Han who are the majority in “interior” China.  
Since 2017, under the guise of a campaign against “terrorism” and “religious extremism”, the government of China has carried out massive and systematic abuses against Muslims living in Xinjiang. It is estimated that over a million people have been arbitrarily detained in internment camps throughout Xinjiang since 2017.  
Amnesty International’s 2021 report, “Like We Were Enemies in a War”: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang is the most comprehensive account to date of the crushing repression faced by Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. Amnesty International’s investigation details human rights violations committed by the Chinese government in Xinjiang between 2017 and 2021, including those occurring outside the internment camps. The evidence Amnesty International has gathered provides a factual basis for the conclusion that the Chinese government has committed at least the crimes against humanity of imprisonment, torture and persecution against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.

The Magdalena Medio is a region rich in natural resources, where Colombia’s armed conflict continues to impact the livelihoods of the communities in the area, who also have suffered the consequences of the exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits in the region. The Santander’s Regional Corporation for the Defence 
of Human Rights (CREDHOS) was founded in 1987 in the city of Barrancabermeja. For more than thirty years, CREDHOS has worked for the defence, promotion and protection of human rights, with its work extending to eight municipalities of the Magdalena Medio region of Colombia (North). In recent years, addressing socio-environmental conflicts in the region has gained great importance within the 
organization. CREDHOS defends the communities’ rights to a healthy environment and works closely together with environmental organizations such as the Committee for the Defence of Water, Life and Land (Comité para la defensa del Agua, la vida y el Territorio) and Free Alliance Against Fracking (Alianza Libre contra el Fracking). 
Due to their work environmental defenders in the region of the Magdalena Medio have been threatened, harassed and killed. The latest security incidents faced CREDHOS and other environmental defenders in the Magdalena Medio during the last two years have been: 
According to the Institute for Development and Peace Studies (Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz), 13 human rights defenders were killed in Colombia in January of this year alone, all of them linked to the defence of land, territory and the environment. The Institute has documented thirteen massacres resulting in the deaths of 40 people living in rural areas in Colombia. Amnesty International has reported on the failed prevention and protection policies that contribute to an unsafe environment for the protection of human rights defenders in the country.

To date, thousands of people have been living under unlawful bombardment, while millions of people have been forcibly displaced over the course of two weeks of conflict in Ukraine. Russian forces’ assault on civilian populations and wanton destruction of the infrastructure of daily life violate the Geneva Conventions and international human rights law and must cease.  
At a bare minimum, safe evacuation routes must be provided and yet, to date, many such corridors have proven both unreliable and dangerous. Ukraine and Russia first agreed on 3 March to establish humanitarian corridors for civilian evacuation and humanitarian aid delivery, but implementation to date has been slow and limited. It is urgent that civilians seeking safety from the bombardments, including those whose homes have been destroyed be provided safe passage. They further should not be forced to relocate to Russian-controlled territory. 
 Genuine humanitarian corridors must be established quickly, effectively, and safely. Civilians must not be put at even more risk as they seek to escape the conflict,  
“The deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian objects and indiscriminate attacks are prohibited under international law. All unlawful attacks must cease.  This pressing need for humanitarian corridors is a direct result of Russia’s betrayal of its legal obligations. Regrettably humanitarian corridors are needed urgently. 
“The parties to the conflict must give absolute priority to civilians’ safe passage out of the conflict areas and into safe havens, meaning also not to those under Russian control. Russian forces must also immediately allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians who remain in their homes.” 
Ukrainian authorities have requested that the routes should allow civilians from heavily bombed Mariupol, Enerhodar, Sumy, Izyum and Volnovakha to escape, and for residents of several towns close to Kyiv – including Bucha, Irpin and Hostomel – to reach the capital. Testimonies that Amnesty International have collected to date from civilians in several of these locations indicate they were prevented from leaving by continuous Russian shelling. 
Amnesty International is calling on the parties to agree on establishing well-planned, safe humanitarian corridors and to respect such agreements in good faith; for civilians to be provided accessible transportation as well as sufficient time to safely exit, and for international observers to be granted access to monitor their safe passage. 
“Civilians must be protected at all times. Safe and secure humanitarian corridors are a must, but unlawful attacks which are killing and injuring civilians must cease forthwith and comprehensively.” said Agnès Callamard. 
“International humanitarian law prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian objects, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks. Hospitals, schools and civilian infrastructure must be protected. Even wars have laws.” 
The parties must grant impartial humanitarian relief organizations access to all civilians in need, including those who remain after evacuations. Russian forces must not employ the types of illegal sieges of civilians reminiscent of those they carried out in Grozny and Syria, subjecting them to indiscriminate bombardment, destroying infrastructure and leaving them with the choice to surrender or starve. Amnesty International also objects to any plan which would require civilians to relocate to areas they consider unsafe, including the occupied Crimea or Donbass regions of Ukraine, or Russia. 
Attacks in Irpin 
On Sunday 6 March, near the town of Irpin, a Kyiv suburb, Russian fire hit an evacuation crossing point, killing several civilians who were trying to flee. 
One woman, who was in a convoy of 12 cars of civilians with signs marked ‘kids’ leaving Irpin, told Amnesty International they came under attack from Russian soldiers. 
She said: “In two, three minutes [after they passed a destroyed tank] the shooting began. We know for sure that a 30-year-old woman died, [and a relative’s] mother died: she was 60, she was with me in the car. 
“A shard or a bullet went two millimetres from my brother-in-law’s eye, [and] his arm is broken. Our driver has an issue with his ribs. I’m OK, a small wound close to my head, just blood… but in general, everything is fine with me. The other woman, who lost her mother… everything is OK with her too.” 
Journalists filming in the area reported that another Russian attack occurred as civilians were streaming through an intersection, killing four people, including a woman and two of her children. Media also reported repeated firing and shelling in the area, raising concerns that these attacks were indiscriminate or disproportionate, violating the rules of international humanitarian law. 
‘It isn’t possible to leave’ 
Amnesty International is concerned that certain groups will face particular challenges if they try to escape the conflict. In interviews with Ukrainian residents of threatened cities, the organization learned of people with disabilities, older people, and people with health conditions who are less able to easily evacuate their homes, seek safety during attacks, or get medical care. 
Elena Kozachenko, a 38-year-old from Chernihiv, has breast cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy. She said: “I have cancer and I need to get medication. I had my last round of chemotherapy on 23 February. My next chemotherapy is supposed to be 16 April. I need check-ups, but they are bombing all the time in the neighbourhood where the cancer hospital is, it’s too scary to go there.” 
“I want to leave because staying in Ukraine [now] with my diagnosis is suicide. [But] it isn’t possible to leave… I’m afraid to evacuate because I’m a living target.” 
Many older people impacted by the conflict face great difficulty in trying to flee or in seeking safety during attacks, and are often less willing to leave homes where they have lived for decades, or even their whole lives. 
Rita, a 64-year-old family doctor in Kyiv, explained: “Kyiv is an old city, all of the older people, people with limited mobility, can’t get from their apartments to the basement. In our building they wanted to turn off the electricity [at night] so as not to attract bombardment… We said it would be a death sentence for the older people; if they can’t use the lift, they can’t leave their apartments at all.” 
A member of the Kyiv regional council – who represents Irpin, Bucha, and other communities under Russian siege – added: “It’s mostly [older people] who are staying… It is more safe for them to stay than to go without money or food, because it’s in their native town – they know their neighbours. If they move out, they’re not sure somebody will help them; they don’t have the money to move.” 
Tatyana Sobko, a 70-year-old in Kyiv, told Amnesty International: “We don’t want to leave, our children have tried to take us away many times… This is our home, how can you abandon your home and go sit somewhere abroad? How is that possible?… It’s our land and we won’t run away.” 
Older people and people with disabilities, as well as other groups who may face particular risks and challenges in fleeing, should be prioritized for evacuation, as is outlined under international humanitarian law. Planning and communication about evacuations and safe humanitarian corridors must also be undertaken in an inclusive way, including by ensuring that information, transportation, and services are all accessible.  
Interviewees across Ukraine also told Amnesty International of living in cramped conditions, and suffering severe shortages of food, water and medicine. Some have been unable to leave basements for days on end, due to relentless Russian shelling. They have also been experiencing loss of electricity, heating and communications for days.

By blocking the most popular critical media outlets, closing independent radio stations and forcing dozens of journalists to halt their work or leave the country, the authorities have almost completely deprived people in Russia of access to objective, unbiased and trustworthy information. Roskomnadzor, Russia’s media regulator, has also blocked access to Facebook and Twitter.  
 For two decades, the Russian authorities have waged a covert war against dissenting voices by arresting journalists, cracking down on independent newsrooms and forcing media owners to impose self-censorship. Yet, after Russian tanks entered Ukraine, the authorities switched to a scorched-earth strategy that has turned Russia’s media landscape into a wasteland,  
Critical reporting and social media silenced  
Since the start of the invasion, Roskomnadzor began to establish war-like censorship to silence dissent. On 24 February, the regulator ordered all media outlets to only use official, state-sanctioned sources of information or else face severe punishments for spreading “fake news”. The words ‘war’, ‘invasion’ and ‘attack’ were all banned from use when describing Russia’s military actions in Ukraine.    
On 28 February, Roskomnadzor blocked Nastoyashchee Vremya (Current Times), a subsidiary of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, for spreading “unreliable” information about the invasion. On 1 March, almost all Ukrainian news outlets were inaccessible to internet users in Russia.  
Over the days that followed, the Kremlin ruthlessly censored a swathe of independent media, including broadcaster TV Rain, the Echo of Moscow radio station, Latvia-based Meduza, critical Russian news outlets Mediazona, Republic and Sobesednik, grassroots activism portal Activatica and the Russian-language services of the BBC, Voice of America and Deutsche Welle.   
The blocking of news sites and the threat of criminal prosecutions has also led to an exodus of journalists from Russia. According to Agentstvo, an investigative journalism site now inaccessible in Russia, at least 150 journalists have fled the country since the beginning of the war.   
TV Rain chose to suspend broadcasting amidst fears of reprisals. Znak.com, a significant regional news channel, halted its operations citing censorship fears. The Echo of Moscow radio station was taken off the air; shortly after, its state-aligned owners decided to liquidate the company. Even Novaya Gazeta, a beacon of independent journalism led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, announced on 4 March that it would remove articles on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.   
From 1 March, Roskomnadzor began to slow traffic on Twitter and Facebook to a crawl, before accusing the two companies of disseminating “inaccurate” information about the conflict in Ukraine. On 4 March, both social media platforms were blocked.   
“The free press in Russia has not died despite the authorities’ relentless efforts. The brave journalists continue their crucial work, not in newsrooms but as exiled reporters scattered around the world. One may not see their reports on TV or hear them on the radio, yet their truth is livestreamed on YouTube. Their words do not grace the pages of newspapers, but are spread to the world through Telegram-channels. Vital updates from all of these correspondents must be shared and valued,” said Marie Struthers.   
Weaponizing of “foreign agents” and “undesirable organizations” laws  
The Russian authorities also used notorious repressive legislation to crackdown on media and dissenting voices. On 5 March, two investigative reporting outlets, Vazhnye Istorii (Important Stories) and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), were designated as “undesirable organizations”, which criminalized their operations and barred them from working in Russia.  
On 9 March, a new bill was introduced in the State Duma creating a “unified register” of all current and former employees or members of NGOs, public associations and media entities labelled as “foreign agents” and persons labelled as such individually.  
Crackdown on anti-war protests  
Despite the introduction of draconian restrictions and a ferocious police response to peaceful protests, Russia’s anti-war movement continues to fill the streets with rallies even though the authorities immediately and brutally disperse them.   
According to OVD-Info, a police watchdog NGO, around 13,800 peaceful protesters have been arbitrarily detained after anti-war rallies across Russia since 24 February. This figure includes more than 5,000 peaceful protesters who were detained across 70 cities on 6 March alone.   
People deprived of their liberty in Russia are routinely subjected to beatings, humiliation and other forms of ill-treatment. Many people have also said they were denied access to lawyers and deprived of food, water or bedding.   
In one particular case, at Brateyevo police station in Moscow on 6 March, a protester recorded a policeman telling her: “It’s over. Putin is on our side. You are the enemies of Russia. You are the enemies of the people.” He then said “we’re gonna kill you all here and that’s it. We’ll get another reward for it” as they dragged her by her hair and smashed her in the face with a plastic water bottle.   
“The courageous people in Russia who oppose the war face serious personal risk. When they take to the streets, which is already a crime in the eyes of the authorities, and demand an end to the war, their message represents such a glaring contrast with state propaganda that it places them firmly in the crosshairs of the security forces. Yet these people should be celebrated for daring to raise their voices against the injustice of the invasion,” said Marie Struthers.  
Criminalization of “fake news”  
On 4 March, Russia’s parliament introduced legislation that further criminalizes sharing “false information” about the activities of the Russian Armed Forces or “discredits” Russian troops. Anyone accused of committing these “crimes” could face extortionate fines or a prison sentence of up to 15 years. Over the following three days, more than 140 people were detained under the new law effectively banning the word “war” and calls for “peace”.  
“In dark times like these, only solidarity and goodwill can challenge the onslaught of state violence and rampant lawlessness. We call on the Russian authorities to end their relentless assault against civil society organizations and journalists. And we ask the international community to provide all possible support to Russian reporters, human rights defenders and activists who continue to deliver the truth and stand up against injustice despite suffering terribly for their cause,” said Marie Struthers.

The “Life and Family Protection Law” (Law 5272) represents a grave threat to lives, human rights and families in Guatemala, said Amnesty International after Congress approved the law with a large majority on 8 March. 
“This law will not protect families or lives; it will foment hate and discrimination, putting the lives and rights of countless people at risk. It is disturbing that Guatemala’s Congress is intent on wasting time and resources on passing laws that will only compound the myriad of social problems and human rights violations that afflict so many people in the country, instead of actually trying to resolve them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director for Amnesty International. 
The law would modify the penal code to criminalize miscarriages and impose prison sentences on anyone who “promotes or facilitates access to abortion.” It also expressly prohibits same-sex marriage, as well as the teaching of sexual diversity and gender equality in schools, and outlaws prosecuting people or groups for discriminating against others for their sexual orientation. 
 “This law will not protect families or lives; it will foment hate and discrimination, putting the lives and rights of countless people at risk. It is disturbing that Guatemala’s Congress is intent on wasting time and resources on passing laws that will only compound the myriad of social problems and human rights violations that afflict so many people in the country, instead of actually trying to resolve them” 
At least 32 LGBTIQ+ people were murdered in Guatemala last year as a result of their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the National Observatory of LGBTIQ+ Rights, with another nine killings reported so far in 2022. The country has also suffered from alarming levels of pregnancies amongst girls and adolescents; only last year, 2,041 girls aged 14 and under gave birth, and the country registered over 65,000 pregnancies in girls and adolescents aged between 10 and 19. 
“Guatemala already suffers from shocking levels of violence against women, girls and LGBTIQ+ people. By criminalizing miscarriages, prohibiting schools from teaching students about non-heterosexual relationships, and sanctioning discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, Guatemala’s Congress is legalizing institutionalized violence and discrimination against women, girls and the LGBTIQ+ community,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.  
“Access to legal abortion and comprehensive sexuality education are not only human rights, but also critical policy tools for addressing adolescent pregnancies, as well as gender-based violence and discrimination. If President Giammattei wants to tackle these issues, and ensure his government complies with its human rights obligations, he must veto this indefensible bill.”

0,Ukraine: Russian ‘dumb bomb’ airstrike killed civilians in Chernihiv – new investigation and testimony,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/ukraine-russian-dumb-bomb-airstrike-killed-civilians-in-chernihiv-new-investigation-and-testimony/,"Attack on March 3 killed people as they queued for bread Lethal air strike may constitute a war crime A Russian airstrike that reportedly killed 47 civilians in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said today following an investigation into the attack....","A Russian airstrike that reportedly killed 47 civilians in the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv may constitute a war crime, Amnesty International said today following an investigation into the attack. 
At approximately 12.15 pm on Thursday 3 March, the small public square formed by Chernihiv’s Viacheslava Chornovola and Kruhova streets was hit by multiple bombs, killing civilians and severely damaging nearby buildings. 
Based on new interviews and the verification and analysis of video evidence, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response team has concluded the attack was most likely a Russian airstrike in which at least eight unguided aerial bombs – known as ‘dumb bombs’ – were used. 
“The air strike that hit the streets of Chernihiv shocks the conscience. This was a merciless, indiscriminate attack on people as they went about their daily business in their homes, streets and shops,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Director. 
“This shocking attack is one of the deadliest that the people of Ukraine have endured yet. The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court should investigate this air strike as a war crime. Those responsible for such crimes must be brought to justice, and victims and their families must receive full reparation.” 
The Chernihiv Regional Administration reported that 47 people (38 men and nine women) were killed in the strike. Verified footage of the strike shows eight munitions being dropped in close succession and falling in a line, as is typical in a bombing run. 
Amnesty International was not able to identify a legitimate military target at, or close to, the scene of the strike. Satellite imagery from 28 February shows a queue of people outside the building that was impacted by the strike. Based on this imagery and testimony gathered from witnesses, Amnesty International believes the majority of victims were queuing for food when the missiles struck. 
‘Everything was destroyed’ 
When the bombs struck, Alina, a 21-year-old student, was in her home on nearby Ivana Bohuna Street with her family. 
She told Amnesty International: “I heard a very, very loud buzzing, and I felt our building shaking. It was as if our flat was inflating… And then after two seconds, I heard the windows get blown out into the courtyard. Our building shook a lot; I thought there would be no walls left. 
“When I heard the buzz, I called my grandma into the corridor with me. We laid on the ground and that’s likely what saved us.” 
Alina’s parents were in the street when the blast happened, and they survived the attack. She added: “At [a nearby] yellow building, there had been a line for bread, and that’s where they had wanted to go… I don’t remember whether it was my mother or my father, one of them said, ‘No the line is too long, let’s go.’ And so they left. The people who were in that line are no more.” 
Yulia Matvienko, a 33-year-old mother-of-three, was at home with her children, also on Ivana Bohuna Street, when the attack happened. 
She suffered a head injury, telling Amnesty International: “I was walking along the corridor and hadn’t even made it into the kitchen when I was suddenly deafened – I didn’t understand what was happening. 
“Everything started to suddenly crumble and fall. The children screamed. For several seconds, it was like there was silence and time stood still. Then I dragged my children out from under the rubble. Blood was flowing down me, and I dragged my children out. 
“Everything was destroyed, and the door [to their building] was knocked off. Not a single window was left, and some balconies were totally torn off. There is not a scratch on the children. It’s a miracle… [there was] only my blood on them.” 
In dashcam footage of the strike, falling munitions are visible and the sound of what is likely a low quick-passing aircraft can be heard, consistent with the tactics of conducting a strike of this type. Dropping unguided bombs in populated areas violates the prohibition of carrying out indiscriminate attacks. Such bombs have wide-area effects and are far less accurate than precision-guided munitions. 
Crisis Evidence Lab verification 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified footage of the aftermath of the strike that showed damage to buildings and bodies in the street. Footage from the State Emergency Service of Ukraine also showed damage and the rescue effort. 
Other verified videos of the aftermath show widespread destruction and at least one distinctive bomb crater, of a size consistent with surface impacted munitions of approximately 500kg. 
Other verified content from another airstrike location in Ukraine shows an unguided dud FAB-500 M62 bomb being removed by civil defence forces. In addition, an official video released by the Russian military on 6 March shows the sortie launch of Su-34 Fullback aircraft loaded with eight FAB-500 bombs, an indicator of the typical combat load in current Russian operations. 
“All states should cooperate with the ICC and the new Commission of Inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council to help ensure accountability for grave violations and crimes such as this attack. Victims of this conflict must have justice,” said Joanne Mariner. 
Amnesty International has previously called for international humanitarian and human rights law to be respected by all parties as the conflict in Ukraine continues.

0,International Women’s Day: Dramatic deterioration in respect for women’s rights and gender equality must be decisively reversed,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/international-womens-day-dramatic-deterioration-in-respect-for-womens-rights-and-gender-equality-must-be-decisively-reversed/,"Alarming assaults on women’s rights around the world in 2021/22.   Legal protections dismantled, and women human rights defenders now at unprecedented risk.  Protection and promotion of women’s and girls’ rights and support for women human rights defenders crucial, including...","Catastrophic attacks on human rights and gender equality over the past twelve months have lowered protection for and upped threats against women and girls across the globe, Amnesty International said today.   
On International Women’s Day, the organization called for bold action to reverse erosions of human rights for women and girls.    
Events in 2021 and in the early months of 2022 have conspired to crush the rights and dignity of millions of women and girls.  The world’s crises do not impact equally, let alone fairly. The disproportionate impacts on women’s and girls’ rights are well-documented yet still neglected, when not ignored outright.  But the facts are clear. The Covid-19 pandemic, the overwhelming rollback on women’s rights in Afghanistan, the widespread sexual violence characterizing the conflict in Ethiopia, attacks on abortion access in the US and Turkey’s withdrawal from the landmark Istanbul Convention on Gender Based Violence: each is a grave erosion of rights in its own terms but taken together? We must stand up to and stare down this global assault on women’s and girls’ dignity 
The past two years – dominated by the Covid-19 pandemic – have impacted women and girls disproportionately. Domestic violence has increased, job insecurity for women has worsened, access to sexual and reproductive health services has been eroded, girls’ enrollment in schools has reduced dramatically in many places. Those already the most marginalized have been impacted the hardest.  Decisions taken by governments and authorities that have worsened the situation of women and girls, must be revoked.  
Crisis in Ukraine  
This year International Women’s Day falls as armed conflict in Europe plunges the world into renewed crisis. Images of women giving birth while sheltering from airstrikes; of women fleeing the bombs – children in their arms; of grieving mothers; of newly orphaned children, underscore just what conflict and humanitarian crisis mean for women and children. The women and girls caught up in the conflict in Ukraine now join the ranks of millions more who have suffered the unrelenting human costs of armed conflict from Syria to Yemen and Afghanistan and far beyond.    
Increased militarization of daily life, as weapons proliferate, violence escalates, and public resources are re-directed to support military expenditure – all exact a high and unsustainable price on the daily lives of women and girls.  Today across Ukraine and the broader region, once again women and girls are at grave risk.  Amnesty International has already documented how the last few years’ militarization in conflict-affected eastern areas of Ukraine have led to increased rates of gender-based violence and reduced access to essential services. It is a pattern now set to spread across the country as a whole.  
Massive restrictions on women’s and girls’ rights imposed in Afghanistan  
Since seizing Kabul in August 2021, the Taliban have imposed gross restrictions on the rights of women and girls across Afghanistan.  Women have been told they cannot return to their workplace or travel in public unless accompanied by a male guardian.  Girls over the age of twelve are now barred from education. An albeit imperfect system, painstakingly negotiated, to enhance protection for women from gender-based violence has been decimated. Lawyers, judges, shelter workers and others who worked for years to enable that system to operate effectively are now at risk of attack themselves.  
“The Tailiban’s laws, policies and practices have worked to unravel the human rights gains that the people of Afghanistan struggled for over decades.  Despite brave protestations by women across the country, the Taliban remain bent on constituting a society in which women are rendered second class citizens.  Restricted in movement, deprived of education, denied opportunities for work and income, and left without protection from gender-based violence?  That is unconscionable.  It brings only shame to all who are responsible and to all who are silent about it too,” said Agnès Callamard.   
“Governments around the world must put the rights of women and girls at the very centre of their foreign policy for Afghanistan.  They must take their lead from Afghan women’s rights defenders, and insist, for example, on women’s and girls’ equal access to education, to employment and to essential services, without discrimination.”  
Gender-based violence in Ethiopia  
Gender-based violence has been a persistent feature of the armed conflicts that have continued and expanded over the past twelve months. In Ethiopia, Amnesty International has reported on widespread acts of sexual violence perpetrated in the Tigray region by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, and in the Amhara region by Tigrayan forces. These attacks constitute war crimes and may have amounted to crimes against humanity.  Many of the attacks documented by Amnesty International – such as gang rape – were committed by multiple perpetrators in front of family members.  In some cases, those attacked involved acts of sexual mutilation, or were accompanied by ethnic slurs and threats.  
Legal protections dismantled  
The past twelve months have also seen significant damage to the international human rights legal framework that exists to combat gender-based violence.   
On 1 July 2021, Turkey withdrew from the landmark Istanbul Convention – a groundbreaking and comprehensive framework for combatting gender-based violence and ensuring the rights of survivors in Europe. The decision marks a massive regression for women’s and girls’ human rights in Turkey and has also emboldened anti-rights advocates across several other countries in the region.   
Sexual and reproductive rights have also come under fire. In the United States there has been an all-out attack on abortion rights, with state governments introducing more abortion restrictions in 2021 than in any other year. In Texas, a near-total ban was enacted and subsequently permitted to go into effect by the Supreme Court, criminalizing abortion as early as six weeks into pregnancy – before most women even realize they are pregnant. This ban denies millions the right to access safe and legal abortion. The future of the constitutional protection to a safe and legal abortion across the country is also at grave risk as it comes before the Supreme Court in June 2022.   
Such attacks on legal protections for the rights of women and girls are particularly devastating in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has seen a steep increase in incidences of gender-based violence and further attacks on sexual and reproductive rights reported across the world.  
Women human rights defenders are driving resistance and positive change  
Amid these setbacks, still the tireless efforts of women human rights defenders have paid off. Human rights advocacy, campaigning and mobilization led to key victories for abortion rights in Colombia, Mexico and San Marino.  And while Turkey pulled out of the Istanbul Convention, two other states, Moldova and Liechtenstein, have ratified it.   
Women’s rights activists in Slovenia successfully pushed for reforms to bring the country’s rape law in line with international standards, following similar positive developments in Denmark, Malta, Croatia, Greece, Iceland and Sweden, while reforms are underway in the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. 
Women activists and human rights defenders have also been on the frontlines of resistance and protest for human rights in many other countries, including Ukraine, Poland, Belarus, Russia, USA and Afghanistan.  In many cases, they have done so even in the face of threats on their lives and to their families or threats of imprisonment and actual bodily harm. They deserve global support.   
“Governments know well what is needed to uphold the human rights of women and girls. Those who support them, including donors and investors, must insist that the relevant authorities act now and decisively – regressive laws must be repealed. Essential services must be provided.  Girls and women must have equal access to education and employment. Gender-based violence must be condemned and protections from it be strengthened, not weakened.  Targeting of women human rights defenders must cease.  No society can afford or should ever tolerate such erosions of dignity for more than half its population.  There can be no excuses for failing to govern justly and fairly for women and girls,” said Agnès Callamard.

The petition, which calls for states to prioritize, monitor and support women’s and girl’s rights in Afghanistan, has been delivered to governments across the globe.   
Over the last six months, the Taliban have systematically discriminated against women and girls by introducing policies that have severely restricted women’s freedom of movement and expression and undermined girls’ access to education and employment. In the space of just half a year, they have eroded two decades of women’s contributions to the country, 
“The speed at which the Taliban are dismantling the hard-fought human rights gains of Afghan women should send a chilling reminder to the international community of their responsibility to safeguard the women and girls of Afghanistan, many of whom are being silenced through reprisal attacks, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and torture. As this petition makes clear, the Taliban must be held accountable for their actions.”  
The fall of the Taliban regime in 2001 led to significant improvements in women’s rights. Over the last two decades, around 3.3 million girls have gained access to education while women have been able to actively participate in the political, economic, and social life of the country. Afghan women have found work as lawyers, doctors, judges, teachers, engineers, athletes, activists, politicians, journalists, bureaucrats, business owners, police officers, and members of the military.  
But now, as the world celebrates International Women’s Day, Afghan women and girls are unable to fully exercise their human rights. Instead, they are facing unfettered oppression by the Taliban. Recently, they have suffered an unprecedented number of reprisal attacks, with the Taliban evading any form of accountability. Seven months after the Taliban takeover, the fears that Afghan women harboured for decades have turned into a grim daily reality.  
Since taking power, the Taliban have dismantled the Afghan Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MOWA) and the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC). They have also blocked female employees of government institutions and NGOs from returning to work, prevented three million girls from accessing education and imposed severe restrictions on women’s and girls’ rights. These repressive actions break international human rights law.    
“There is a need for multi-level interventions, including local, regional and international efforts to ensure women and girls’ rights are protected. A UN-led monitoring mechanism, for instance, should be established to oversee women’s situation and hold the Taliban accountable,” said Shabnam Salehi, former Women’s Rights Commissioner at AIHRC.   
Mahbouba Seraj, Executive Director of Afghan Women Skills Development Center, said: “Do not forget the Afghan women. Be our voice and raise your voice with your own governments. The rest of the struggle is on us, and we will continue”.   
Background  
On 25 November 2021, which marks the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and the start of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, Amnesty International launched a campaign to advocate for the rights of Afghan women.

The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by...","Ottawa, ON, March 2, 2022 – The Federal Court has ruled that the Canadian government is not legally required to disclose details about its diplomatic interventions on behalf of a Canadian mining firm accused of human rights abuse in Guatemala. 
The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Shin Imai, a York University law professor and co-founder of the Justice and Corporate Accountability Project, requesting that Ottawa be ordered to remove redactions from documents it provided in response to an access-to- information request. 
Hidden in those documents are details about Canadian officials’ communications with Goldcorp, the Guatemalan government and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) after the IACHR called for Guatemala to temporarily suspend Goldcorp’s mining operations in 2010. It made this unprecedented request in response to alleged human rights abuses, environmental damages and health impacts. 
The details that Ottawa did reveal in the emails, meeting notes and other documents it released suggest that Canadian officials swiftly intervened on Goldcorp’s behalf, lobbying decision-makers in Guatemala and at the IACHR for months. In the end, Guatemala declined to shut down the mine, and the commission retracted its request. 
“What did Canadian ambassadors and cabinet ministers say in their flurry of meetings and phone calls with Goldcorp, with IACHR officials, with Guatemala’s vice president? says Karen Hamilton, director of Above Ground. “The public should have access to such information, to know just how far Canadian officials went to influence this outcome, which had devastating effects for communities near the mine.” 
The court found Ottawa was justified in blacking out key details in the documents it released because revealing them would reasonably be expected to bring “harm to Canada’s international relations.” The court initially issued a confidential decision, several weeks before making it public in February. 
“If Canadians can’t obtain meaningful information about the diplomatic support our government is providing to companies overseas, then our public disclosure rules are out of date and in need of reform,” says Emily Dwyer, Policy Director at the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability. 
“People living near Goldcorp’s mine continue to suffer from a legacy of pollution and other harms,” says Jean Symes, co-manager and policy analyst at Inter Pares. “Beyond the transparency concerns it raises, this case demonstrates the need for binding rules requiring that Canadian diplomats prioritize protecting human rights over protecting commercial interests.”

Procedural hearings were held for a small group of defenders in Smithers and a larger group of defenders in Prince George on February 14. The defenders were charged in November 2021 with violating an injunction obtained by Coastal Gaslink (CGL), a subsidiary of TC Energy. During this hearing, defenders and their supporters hoped to learn if Coastal Gaslink would pursue criminal charges against them. Instead, the company asked for a month-long adjournment and is expected to be back in BC Court in March with its decision. 
If CGL wishes to pursue criminal charges against those arrested in November, it must ask BC’s Attorney General to do so, at which time the BC Prosecution Service would take responsibility for moving the case forward. In the past, the AG has declined to press criminal charges against Wet’suwet’en land defenders.Coastal Gaslink’s lawyer, Kevin O’Callaghan, said the company would decide by March 11 if it will seek criminal charges. A brief court appearance has been set for March to determine a date for a future hearing should CGL request the AG pursue criminal charges.  
The defenders must abide by their bail conditions which prohibit those charged from being allowed to go into the territory or yintah or engaging in further protest. 
We asked, you responded: Thank you

In recent days, the Ukrainian authorities have brought Russian prisoners of war to press conferences to discuss their roles in the military invasion, and videos on social media have also shown captured soldiers contacting family members in Russia. 
Videos of captured Ukrainian soldiers have also appeared on social media, though it is not yet clear if these have official sanction. 
“As the conflict continues, it is essential that all parties to the conflict fully respect the rights of prisoners of war,” said Joanne Mariner, Director of Amnesty International’s Crisis Response Program. 
 As the conflict continues, it is essential that all parties to the conflict fully respect the rights of prisoners of war, 
“Any public appearances can put prisoners of war at risk when they are returned to their home country, and also prove problematic for their families whilst they are detained. 
“Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention explicitly states that prisoners of war must be protected at all times, particularly from public curiosity. It is duty of the detaining power to ensure these prisoners’ rights are properly respected from the moment they are captured.” 
The Geneva Convention 
Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention states: “Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. Any unlawful act or omission by the Detaining Power causing death or seriously endangering the health of a prisoner of war in its custody is prohibited, and will be regarded as a serious breach of the present Convention. In particular, no prisoner of war may be subjected to physical mutilation or to medical or scientific experiments of any kind which are not justified by the medical, dental or hospital treatment of the prisoner concerned and carried out in his interest. Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity.”  
The authoritative commentary by the International Committee of the Red Cross specifies that “any materials that enable individual prisoners to be identified must normally be regarded as subjecting them to public curiosity and, therefore, may not be transmitted, published or broadcast”. 
Amnesty International has previously called for international humanitarian and human rights law to be respected as the conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate.

“Raif Badawi has spent a decade behind bars solely for exercising his right to freedom of expression. The Saudi Arabian authorities must ensure his immediate and unconditional release and lift the unlawful travel ban imposed on him so he can finally reunite with his family. 
“Raif Badawi’s ongoing detention reveals the Saudi Arabian authorities’ utter contempt for the right to liberty, freedom of expression and even their own laws. It also shows that their attempts to present a progressive image to the world serve as little more than a smokescreen to hide their repression. 
“The Saudi Arabian authorities’ crackdown on civil society and freedom of expression must end. Raif Badawi and all prisoners of conscience detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights must be released immediately and unconditionally.” 
Background: 
Raif Badawi was detained on 17 June 2012 and sentenced in 2014 to 10 years in prison, followed by a 10-year travel ban and a 1 million Saudi Arabian riyal (about USD 267,000) fine for creating an online forum for public debate and accusations that he insulted Islam. He was also sentenced to a cruel and inhuman punishment of 1,000 lashes, the first 50 of which were meted out in a public square in Jeddah on 9 January 2015.  
Over the last few years, the Saudi Arabian authorities have invested heavily in PR stunts to rebrand their image and attempt to deflect attention from their brutal crackdown on activists and human rights defenders. Although there was a brief lull in executions and prosecutions of activists during Saudi Arabia’s presidency of the G20 summit, that ended immediately after the event when the authorities ramped up their repression once again.

“Everybody fleeing conflict must be provided with protection and help to establish themselves and we welcome that Ukrainians will be swiftly protected. But by restricting that assistance principally to Ukrainians fleeing conflict, the Council has also exposed the limitations of Europe’s solidarity. 
“Today’s decision means that Ukrainians seeking safety in the EU will quickly get residence permits, be able to work, and be provided with suitable accommodation, welfare assistance, medical assistance, and education. It is now up to member states to decide if they will extend that to others fleeing Ukraine. We call on them to treat everyone fleeing this conflict equally. 
“The Council’s decision today is a reminder that Europe has long had the tools to protect people fleeing war and help new arrivals, and the usual ‘Fortress Europe’ approach is a politically motivated choice. That this is happening for the first time but principally for displaced Ukrainian nationals shows that the EU’s approach is riddled with double standards.” 
Background 
The TPD was created in 2001, in the aftermath of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, when, for the first time since the Second World War, Europe was confronted with mass displacements of people resulting from a conflict in Europe. However, it has never been activated. 
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for its activation, most recently in the framework of the EU response to the crises in Afghanistan and Ukraine.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei,  
Additional information  
Iranian Sunni Kurdish men Anwar Khezri, Ayoub Karimi, Davoud Abdollahi, Farhad Salimi, Ghassem Abesteh, Kamran Sheikheh and Khosrow Basharat are at risk of execution in Raja’i Shahr prison in Karaj, Alborz province. They were convicted of “corruption on earth” (efsad-e fel-arz) and national security offences and sentenced to death by Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran following a grossly unfair trial around June 2018, during which the presiding judge barred their lawyer from speaking.   
Following their arrests between early December 2009 and late January 2010 in West Azerbaijan province, northwest Iran, the seven men were taken to a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Urumieh, West Azerbaijan province, and accused of membership in “Salafist groups”, which they all deny. Anwar Khezri, Kamran Sheikheh and Khosrow Basharat were also later accused of fatally hitting a man by a car – they deny involvement in his death. At least four of the men say in open letters that Ministry of Intelligence agents repeatedly subjected them to torture during interrogations. Anwar Khezri wrote in February 2020 that he had attempted suicide after being subjected to 56 days of torture following his arrest, including repeated beatings to his chest, head and soles of his feet in a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility – to which he referred as a “torture chamber”. After receiving blood transfusions in hospital for blood loss related to his suicide attempt, agents returned him to prison the next day against medical advice. He said he was then forced to sign “confessions” after his torture resumed. According to an informed source, following arrest, Khosrow Basharat was repeatedly beaten with electric cables while tied to a bed, suspended by his cuffed hands from the ceiling for prolonged periods, and forced to listen to the screams of what sounded like others being tortured at night, which led to sleep deprivation and severe distress. After three weeks of such torture, he was forced to sign a pre-written “confession”.   
Despite claims of serious fair trial violations, on 3 February 2020, Branch 41 of the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and death sentences and, in early September 2020, Branch 38 of the Supreme Court rejected their request for retrial. In September 2017, another court in West Azerbaijan province convicted Kamran Sheikheh of murdering the man who died after being hit by a car and sentenced him to death, while Anwar Khezri and Khosrow Basharat were sentenced to prison terms as alleged accomplices.  
Following their arrests, the seven men were held separately in a Ministry of Intelligence detention facility in Urumieh before being transferred to prisons in West Azerbaijan province. Between late 2010 and 2012, they were separately transferred initially to Tehran’s Evin prison and then to Raja’i Shahr prison. In an open letter written in August 2019, Farhad Salimi described how these multiple transfers in themselves caused him mental distress, as each transfer meant adjusting to new prison guards, prisoners and systems. After spending over six years in pre-trial detention, they were first sentenced to death in late May 2016 for “corruption on earth” by Branch 28 of the Revolutionary court of Tehran. The Court also convicted them of national security offences for their alleged “membership in Salafist groups”, which Ministry of Intelligence agents alleged included al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Kurdish opposition groups. The trial was grossly unfair and consisted of one hearing in mid-March 2016 that lasted just five minutes. On appeal to Branch 41 of the Supreme Court, their sentences and convictions were overturned around March 2017 and the Court remanded their cases to Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court for re-trial. In an open letter from February 2020, Farhad Salimi wrote that around this time he was repeatedly put under pressure to make forced “confessions” to incriminate himself and to dismiss the lawyer of his own choosing. In mid-2018, Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court of Tehran convicted all seven men of “corruption on earth” and sentenced them to death. On 3 February 2020, on appeal, Branch 41 of the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and sentences. In a separate case, on 19 September 2017, Anwar Khezri, Kamran Sheikheh and Khosrow Basharat were transferred from Raja’i Shahr prison to Urumieh prison to stand trial before a criminal court in Urumieh for murder. In early July 2018, this court convicted Kamran Sheikheh of murder and sentenced him to death as well as to 10 years’ imprisonment, and Anwar Khezri and Khosrow Basharat were convicted of complicity to murder and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment.   
In his open letter written in February 2020 to the then Head of the Judiciary, Ebrahim Raisi, Anwar Khezri outlined the multiple serious human rights violations to which he was subjected by Ministry of Intelligence agents, judges and prison authorities. He described being taken out of his cell while blindfolded and handcuffed and subjected to a mock execution in August 2017. No investigations are known to have been conducted into his and others’ claims of torture.   
Under international human rights law and standards, all proceedings in capital cases must scrupulously observe fair trial standards, and particularly in view of the irreversible nature of the death penalty. All individuals who risk facing the death penalty must benefit from the services of competent defence counsel at every stage of the proceedings. They must be presumed innocent until their guilt has been proved based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts, in strict application of the highest standards for gathering and assessing evidence. In addition, all mitigating factors must be taken into account. The proceedings must guarantee the right to review of both the factual and the legal aspects of the case by a higher tribunal. Imposition of the death penalty following criminal proceedings that fall seriously short of fair trial standards constitutes an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life and may amount to an extrajudicial execution.   
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life and the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty International has consistently called on all countries that retain the death penalty including Iran to establish an official moratorium on executions, with a view to completely abolishing the death penalty.  
Ethnic minorities in Iran, including Kurds, Ahwazi Arabs, Azerbaijani Turks, Baluchis and Turkmen face discrimination which curtails their access to education, employment and political office. Ethnic minorities, including Kurds, are also disproportionately affected by death sentences imposed for vague charges such as “corruption on earth” and also being executed in secret with the authorities then refusing to return their bodies for burial to their families. Additionally, religious minorities, including Sunni Muslims, Baha’is, Christians, Gonabadi Dervishes, Jews, and Yaresan suffer discrimination in law and practice, including in access to education, employment, child adoption, political office and places of worship. Authorities also subject religious minorities to arbitrary detention, unjust prosecutions, torture and other ill-treatment for professing or practising their faith.

Abdul Hafeez, 37, who ran an appliance installation and servicing company in Dubai, was apprehended by Emirati authorities outside his home on January 27,2022 and subsequently detained. Just eight days later, Abdul was forcibly deported back to Pakistan. Emirati police did not give his family any information about his arrest, and only asked for his passport. Since then, they remain in the dark about his whereabouts, the charges against him or what legal recourse they have, if any. Abdul’s family believes he is in extreme danger in Pakistan, which is why he immigrated to the UAE in 2012 following deadly attacks against other family members in the past. Pakistani authorities must reveal Abdul Hafeez’s whereabouts, allow him regular contact with his family and lawyer, and guarantee his rights to fair trial and due process of law.

Additional information  
On 27 January 2022, men who identified themselves as Dubai police and officials of the Security Industry Regulatory Agency showed up at the apartment building where Abdul Hafeez lived with his family in Dubai and asked the security guard of his whereabouts. They waited until he arrived home, stopped him at the gate and arrested him from the parking area.  
Abdul’s family went to the Khawaneej Police Station to report his detention where they were only told to come later. On 31 January 2022, the police called them to ask for his passport. When pressed for more information, they denied having him in their custody.   
According to his family, Abdul moved to Dubai in 2012 after he began facing threats to his life. His father was shot dead in February 2012 in Khuzdar, Balochistan. In October 2010, his younger brother was abducted allegedly by the country’s security agencies and his body was found two weeks later. In December 2018, Abdul’s cousin Rashid Hussain was commuting with three colleagues to his workplace when Emirati security forces detained him in Dubai. He was deported back to Pakistan a few weeks later, where he has not been heard from since. Rashid was declared the prime suspect in an armed attack on the Consulate of China in Karachi in 2018.  
Extended incommunicado detention of this sort meets the principal international legal definition of enforced disappearance, contained in Article 2 of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. Neither Pakistan nor the UAE is a party to this treaty, but both are State Parties to the Convention Against Torture – and there are credible reports of the disappeared being subject to torture and other ill treatment). In addition, Pakistan has also ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  
If there are criminal charges against Abdul Hafeez, either in Pakistan or the UAE, extradition or other legal proceedings against him must be held in public court proceedings with full respect for the right to fair trial, which includes confidential access to an attorney from the very outset of detention. Refoulement – the forcible return of a migrant who has a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of origin – is forbidden under international law.  
The human rights crisis in Balochistan continues with reports of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings by the security forces of suspected Baloch militants and opposition activists who are accused by the government of terrorist activities. Amnesty International takes no position on the guilt or innocence of those alleged to have taken part in attacks characterized by governments as acts of terrorism. However, everyone must be able to enjoy the full range of human rights guaranteed under national and international law. Amnesty International denounces indiscriminate attacks and attacks targeting civilians carried out by armed groups, and fully recognizes the duty of the Pakistani authorities to prevent and punish crimes, including violent crimes such as acts of terrorism, and to bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for committing such crimes. However, by subjecting persons suspected of terrorist activities or links with terrorist groups to enforced disappearance, Pakistan has not only gravely violated their human rights but also failed in its duty to charge and try such individuals and to punish them if found guilty in a fair trial.

Mohammed Adam (17) and Mohammed al-Fatih (18) have been arbitrarily detained by security authorities in Sudan for over a month in connection with the killing of a policeman earlier this year. There are credible concerns the youths were abducted and held without charge, in violation of their due process rights, and subjected to torture while in detention. The Sudanese authorities must release them unless they are charged and remanded by an independent court.  
Mohammed Adam (17) and Mohammed al-Fatih (18) were violently arrested on January 14 with five of their friends by a group of plain-clothed security agents as they were leaving a hospital in eastern Khartoum. Mohammed Adam was seeking treatment at the hospital for a gunshot wound in his leg which he had sustained the previous day, on 13 January, during a protest they attended demanding an end to the army’s coup since 25 October 2021. The seven teenage protestors were taken to the Northern Police station in downtown Khartoum, where they were interrogated about their alleged involvement with grassroots youth groups responsible for organizing the 13 January protests. All those arrested were subsequently released, except for Mohammed Adam and Mohammed al-Fatih who remain detained.  
Until 20 January, the two were held at an undisclosed location. On 20 January, it was confirmed that they were being held at the premises of the Federal Investigation Department in Khartoum North. For the first three weeks of their detention, they were held incommunicado – without access to their families, lawyer, or a doctor. On 8 February, Mohammed Adam’s mother was allowed to visit him for the first time since his arrest, but he has yet to be seen by a doctor or granted access to his lawyer. He is now on hunger strike in protest of their arbitrary detention. Furthermore, Mohammed Adam and Mohammed al-Fatih have allegedly been tortured by police and security agents in custody. One of the friends who was detained with him reported seeing Mohammed Adam being beaten on his injured leg, and his mother reports that she saw that two nails had been hammered into his legs, which had also been beaten, leaving him unable to walk.  
Their arrest is believed, although not confirmed, to be in connection to the killing of a Police Brigadier during the 13 January protests in Khartoum, which it is widely believed the authorities suspect Mohammed Adam and Mohammed al-Fatih of being responsible for, though no evidence to support this has been provided and the two have still not been charged.

Additional information  
Mohammed Adam and Mohammed al-Fatih’s arrests were carried out one day after Sudan’s Ministry of Interior released a brief statement announcing the killing of a Police Brigadier during protests in Khartoum, on 13 January. A longer statement released by the Ministry of Interior on 25 January stated that the victim died from injuries sustained as a result of knife stabbings in his left arm and back when he attempted to control protesters. The statement added that police teams managed to track down the perpetrators, and captured a number of suspects, adding that that eye- witnesses had identified the suspects, who were then interrogated, confessed to stabbing the victim and revealed the whereabouts of the murder weapon. The statement went on to say that all technical legal procedures were observed, the accused re-enacted their actions in the crime scene and their judicial confessions were recorded. Although the police statement did not identify the suspects by name, it is widely believed that it was in reference to Mohammed Adam and Mohammed al-Fatih.  
A wave of protests has been sweeping Sudan ever since the country’s army staged a coup in October 2021. In response, security forces engaged in a wide range of repressive and violent tactics, including the unnecessary or excessive use of lethal force and arbitrary detentions, to counter acts of opposition to the coup. To date, security forces have killed 81 people and injured hundreds using live ammunition. Hundreds of political activists and protesters have been arbitrarily detained since the coup, which ended more than two years of an uneasy partnership between military and civilian leaders in a transitional government born out of a power-sharing compromise. The compromise was reached following the ouster by military leaders of long-time authoritarian ruler, Omer al-Bashir in April 2019, which followed months of protests orchestrated by civilian opposition leaders, with active participation of women and youth.

Would you like to see the government speed up its commitment to a just transition in our society, from an economy based on fossil fuels to one based on more sustainable types of energy? Would you like the government to ensure that no worker loses their job in that transition? Crucially, would you like to see the Prime Minister pass a Just Transition Act that takes into account our climate crisis as well as the needs of working people?  
If so, don’t miss the Day of Action for a Just Transition on March 12. This action is organized by 350.org and the Council of Canadians. Amnesty Canada is fully behind it. The Day of Action is taking place in various locations across the country. Come out and support it! 
Its been nearly three years since Prime Minister Trudeau first promised a Just Transition Act. Since the government is dragging its feet on implementing a Just Transition, participants are going to visit their MP offices or gather in public spaces and visually demonstrate how our communities would thrive under a Just Transition Act. The time to act is now!  
Learn more about the vision for a Just Transition here, here, and here.  
Check our support and all the resources you need >> 350.org toolkit.  
How: Using creative visuals, theatrics, and art, participants will show Parliament the kinds of programs we need to transition away from fossil fuels, and in a way that leaves no one behind and respects human rights. 
Imagine: ribbon cutting ceremonies to mark the opening of a new Just Transition Ministry; holding a green jobs fair for workers seeking support to transition away from the fossil fuel industry; a press conference announcing new free rapid transit systems. Your imagination is the limit! 
Where: Here are a few locations around the country where actions are being planned.  Check out the Day of Action map here. 
Do you live in or near any of these locations? If so, will you join us? Once you RSVP for the action, the hosts will contact you directly. 
Order posters: If you do not plan to make your own visuals, you can order them here. Hurry!  
Make your own:  Make a sign announcing a new program that you would like to see. Write a news headline! Have fun with it!   
Examples: 
The government is nationalizing General Motors in order to speed up production of electric vehicles 
Corporate subsidies to end: Government uses windfall to make public transit free 
Government cancels highway expansion: announces new EV charging stations, rural bus service  
Keep in mind: It is important to make up programs that will resonate with the local people who will see your action. Please refer to our policy document, Stop Burning Our Rights! for ideas. 
Visuals:Please add an Amnesty candle to your artwork. Here is where you can find our style guide for ways to make visible Amnesty’s support – whether you are participating in person on March 12 or on line (idea: make a statement by creating a Just Transition background for your online calls!).  
Please note that we are being asked to ensure we use these colours for the signs (you can still add in the Amnesty candle): The colour scheme for this action is teal (#40D7D4), white (#ffffff) and dark grey (#17292E) 
For more information on printing and ordering signs, making your own and how to make other visual props, see the Arts and Visuals Toolkit. 
A script will soon be available for suggestions as to what to say at an event. Here is an example to give you ideas: https://www.sethklein.ca/blog/the-throne-speech-premier-john-horgan-means-to-give  
Keep in mind: Organizers of other events have found that trying to spoof or use satire often falls flat – onlookers can’t always tell the difference. Be clear about when you’re being funny! 
Hint: if this is the first time you’re joining a national Day of Action, ask people in your networks if they’ve been to an action like this before and to share what kinds of communications or visuals they found helped get the message across clearly and memorably.

Detained citizen journalist Zhang Zhan was able to speak to her mother through a 20-minute video call on 28 January 2022. During the call, Zhang Zhan mentioned that she had stopped the partial hunger strike so that the authorities won’t force-feed her anymore. While Zhang’s mother noticed that her health may have slightly improved, it is unclear whether Zhang Zhan has access to adequate medical care, including an assessment by a medical professional even after she fell critically ill for a few months in 2021. Chinese authorities must ensure that Zhang Zhan has access to adequate medical care, including a thorough medical check-up. Pending her release, she must also be allowed regular access to her family and a lawyer of her choice, and she must not be subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.  A prisoner of conscience imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression when she reported about COVID-19, Zhang Zhan should be released immediately and unconditionally.

Additional information  
Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, is a citizen journalist who has actively spoken out about politics and human rights issues in China. In February 2020, she travelled to Wuhan, then the centre of the Covid-19 outbreaks in China. She used online platforms (including WeChat, Twitter and YouTube) to report on the detention of other independent reporters as well as the harassment of the victims’ families who were seeking investigations and accountability for events in Wuhan. Zhang Zhan went missing on 14 May 2020? in Wuhan and was subsequently revealed to have been detained by police in Shanghai, more than 640 km away.  
Zhang Zhan was able to have a video call with her family on 14 October 2021 for four minutes and nine seconds. The mandated duration of the call is supposed to be five minutes. Her family said she looked incredibly thin and was determined to continue her partial hunger strike, and that they did not expect her to live through the winter if she was not released on medical grounds. Zhang Zhan was again able to speak to her family through another video call on 29 October 2021. They shared that her condition had further worsened, and she had no energy to walk nor raise her head. A further concern was the yellow colour of her skin, a sign of a potential life-threatening condition.   
Worried about Zhang Zhan, her family submitted a medical bail application for her on 15 November to Shanghai’s Women’s Prison and have not received a response yet. The application was submitted pursuant to the criteria listed in the “Notice of the Supreme People’s Court, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and Other Ministries on Issuing the Provisions on Temporary Service of Sentences Outside Prisons”, (最高人民法院、最高人民检察院、公安部等关于印发《暂予监外执行规定》的通知) through which a prisoner can apply for medical bail when he/she is facing a critical health condition.  
Since the news that Zhang Zhan’s health was in critical condition, many organisations and states have spoken up and called on the Chinese authorities to release Zhang Zhan. This includes the EU and the US. Amnesty International also joined Reporters Without Borders (RSF) in a statement to urge China to release Zhang Zhan in September 2021. Zhang Zhan is one of the cases of the Write for Rights 2021 and featured in the Free the Five Campaign.   
Zhang Zhan started a hunger strike in June 2020 to protest her detention and assert her innocence. Despite her intention to continue with her protest, detention centre authorities reportedly began forcibly feeding her through a feeding tube, and it was reported that her cellmates were also involved in the act of forcibly feeding her. In December 2020, Zhang’s defence lawyer said she was physically very weak and suffering from stomach pain, dizziness and weakness while walking. It was also reported that Zhang Zhan was forced to wear shackles and that her hands were restrained 24 hours a day for more than three months as punishment for her hunger strike.   
Citizen journalists were the primary, if not the only, source of uncensored and first-hand information about the Covid-19 outbreak in China. There are not many citizen journalists in China, as they are not able to obtain official accreditation and face consistent harassment and repression for reporting news and disseminating information that is censored by the government.   
There have been many reports of independent journalists and activists harassed by authorities for sharing information about Covid-19 on social media. These include outspoken lawyer and citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, who reported being harassed by the authorities after posting footage from hospitals in Wuhan, and Wuhan resident Fang Bin, who was taken by the authorities and is now believed to be detained in Wuhan after posting a video purporting to show corpses of COVID-19 victims.  
The crime of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” (寻衅滋事罪) under Article 293 of the Chinese Criminal Law is a broadly defined and vaguely worded offence that has been widely used to target activists and human rights defenders. Although the crime originally applied to acts that disrupted order in public places, the scope has expanded since 2013 to include online spaces as well. Anyone convicted could face a maximum of five years in prison.

“For too long, Black employees have faced dehumanizing experiences of racist exclusion at the hands of the government. Amnesty International supports the work led by the Black Class Action to bring justice to Black federal employees in Canada and prevent further harm from taking place”  
Since the launch of the Black Class Action in December 2020, 1,300 Black employees have courageously shared deeply personal stories of their experiences working for the Public Service of Canada. They describe how they were denied promotions, mentorship, and other opportunities that were available to non-Black colleagues and were confined to low-level positions. 
These dehumanizing experiences send the message that Black employees are not fit for public service in Canada and perpetuate stereotypes and biases about Black people’s worth and capabilities. As a result, current and former employees continue to suffer deeply painful and significant harms. For Black employees who are members of other marginalized groups, such as Black women, Black people with disabilities, and Black LGBTQ2S+ individuals, the impacts of discrimination are even greater. 
“We are grateful for the support of Amnesty International as together we call on the Government of Canada to take real action against anti-Black discrimination within its workforce”, said Nicholas Marcus Thompson, spokesperson for the Black Class Action. “This government has repeatedly acknowledged the existence of anti-Black racism in its institutions but has failed to take real action in response. Black public service workers deserve better and expect no less.” 
Despite calls to address anti-Black racism from Black employees, the United Nations Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, and the Prime Minister, it persists in the Public Service. Black employees continue to face denials of their rights under Canadian and international human rights law, including the right to be free from discrimination and the right to have equal promotion opportunities based only on seniority and competence. 
Amnesty International supports the efforts of the Black Class Action in pressing the Government of Canada to implement long term solutions that address systemic racism and discrimination in Canada’s Public Service. This includes the establishment of a fund to compensate Black employees for the harms experienced because of workplace discrimination; the establishment of a Black Equity Commission to investigate and address systemic barriers and to create a framework for Black employees to be heard; and the establishment of a designated category for Black employees under the Employment Equity Act. It also includes the immediate establishment of culturally sensitive, trauma informed counselling and mental health supports for current, former, and future Black employees. 
Together, the Black Class Action and Amnesty International urge the government to answer its own call to recognize the daily contributions that Black Canadians make to Canada, by comprehensively implementing the measures called for by the Black Class Action. 
The Black Class Action lawsuit is a landmark case formally known as Nicholas Marcus Thompson et al v. Her Majesty The Queen, filed with the Federal Court of Canada on December 1, 2020. The claim filed by both current and former Black public servants seeks to represent thousands of workers who have faced systemic discrimination in the hiring and promotion process in the Federal Public Service of Canada.

In less than a week, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered a massive human rights, humanitarian, and displacement crisis that could become the worst catastrophe in recent European history. 
Since the invasion began on February 24, Amnesty has been documenting the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure. The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas. 
Amnesty’s Crisis Evidence Lab is analyzing digital evidence – including photos, videos and satellite imagery – and has verified several indiscriminate attacks. The deadliest was a ballistic missile strike on February 24 near a hospital building in Vuhledar, in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, killing four civilians and wounding ten more including health care workers. In another attack on February 25, a preschool in north-eastern Ukraine was hit with widely-banned cluster munitions while civilians sheltered inside, killing three – including a child – and wounding another child. 
Strikes on protected objects such as hospitals and schools, the use of indiscriminate weapons such as ballistic missiles and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs, may all qualify as war crimes. 
On February 28, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced the opening of an investigation, saying he was “satisfied that there is a reasonable basis to believe that both alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed in Ukraine.” 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter and an act of aggression that is a crime under international law. Russia’s aggression must not be allowed to push the world closer towards an abyss of violence, violations and insecurity. 
Write to the Russian ambassador in Canada: 
· Express concern that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been marked by indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas, striking protected objects such as hospitals and schools. Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law. 
· The continued use of ballistic missiles, cluster munitions, and other inaccurate explosive weapons causing civilian deaths and injuries is inexcusable. 
· Call on him to use his power as Ambassador to urge the government of Russia to respect international law, protect civilians, and stop Russian aggression in Ukraine.

Their personal,...","Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a manifest violation of the United Nations Charter and an act of aggression that is a crime under international law, said Amnesty International as it called for all those involved in this crime to be held accountable for those violations. Their personal, individual, and collective liability should be invoked for that, and for all the many crimes that have characterised their invasion of Ukraine thus far. 
Emphasizing the gravity of the Ukraine crisis, the organisation called on UN member states to uphold and defend the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state. It noted that the only exceptions to those provisions are self-defense and such use of force as is authorized by the UN Security Council – neither of which applies to this crisis.  
Amnesty further stressed that, under international law, it is incumbent on all states to settle international disputes by peaceful means and in such a manner that international peace, security, and justice, are not endangered.  
 “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is grave, severe and defined by one characteristic only: aggression. Russia is invading into the heart of Ukraine, seeking to depose its lawfully elected government, with a real and potential massive impact on civilians’ lives, safety and well-being; its acts cannot remotely be justified on any of the grounds that Russia has offered. Yet all of this is being committed by a permanent member of the UN Security Council,”  
“Russia is in clear breach of its international obligations. Its actions are blatantly against the rules and principles on which the United Nations was founded. All members of the United Nations should condemn that conduct unequivocally.  Russia’s flagrant disregard cannot be allowed to embolden others to follow suit and nor should the UN’s ability to contain such behaviour be undermined.” 
Since the Russia invasion began on 24 February, Amnesty has been documenting the escalation in violations of humanitarian and human rights law, including deaths of civilians resulting from indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure.  Strikes on protected objects such as hospitals and schools, the use of indiscriminate weapons such as ballistic missiles and the use of banned weapons such as cluster bombs, may all qualify as war crimes. 
Amnesty International urged UN Member States to stand together in condemnation of Russia’s crimes of aggression, in providing relief and assistance to the citizens of Ukraine including those fleeing the conflict, and to ensure the consequences of Russia’s aggression are not allowed to push the world closer towards an abyss of violence, violations and insecurity.  
“In less than a week, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has triggered a massive human rights, humanitarian, and displacement crisis that has the makings of the worst such catastrophe in recent European history. Russia is not only breaching the sovereignty of a neighbour and its people, it is also challenging the global security architecture and exploiting its frailty, including a dysfunctional UN Security Council.  There are long-lasting consequences from this for us all. We must not allow aggression and violations of international law to be their architect,” said Agnes Callamard. 
Yesterday’s welcome announcement by the ICC Prosecutor that his office will seek to open an investigation in Ukraine puts all perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine– including those in senior positions and most responsible – on notice that they will be held individually accountable. 
“Amnesty International calls on all states parties to the ICC and the international community at large to cooperate with the ICC’s investigation. The ICC’s investigation cannot take place alone. Comprehensive accountability in Ukraine requires the concerted and innovative efforts of the UN and its organs, as well as initiatives at the national-level pursuant to the principle of universal jurisdiction,” said Agnes Callamard. 
“At this early stage, the collection and preservation of evidence is crucial to successful future investigations. Above all, we must ensure that the tragically increasing number of victims of war crimes in Ukraine hear a message that the international community is already determined to secure redress for their suffering.”

Background 
Serious violations of the rules of conflict constitute war crimes. Some of those are codified as such by the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The ICC would have jurisdiction over war crimes committed in Ukraine, which made a declaration in 2015 accepting ICC jurisdiction over crimes committed on its territory since 20 February 2014. Russia signed the Rome Statute in 2000 but withdrew its signature in 2016. 
The military intervention appears to meet the definition of aggression under the Rome Statute of the ICC. Art. 8bis(1) of the Rome Statute defines, in relevant part, a “crime of aggression” as “an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.”  Although the Court, barring an unlikely Security Council referral, will not have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in this situation a number of states, including Ukraine, have domestic laws that would allow prosecution of those responsible for this crime. 
The invasion of Ukraine has already resulted in indiscriminate strikes on residential areas, medical institutions, social infrastructure and other civilian objects and infrastructure, and produced civilian deaths and injuries. It has led to mass displacement and destruction of civilian housing. In the fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk, particularly in 2014-2015, there have been extrajudicial executions, torture and other ill-treatment, enforced disappearances, and unlawful deprivation of liberty.

Multiple cities are under attack, including the capital Kyiv.   
The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons in densely populated areas. On the first day of the attack, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab verified three incidents, in which at least six civilians were killed and at least twelve injured from missile strikes outside a hospital and in residential areas. Some of these attacks may constitute war crimes.  
Ukranian civilians are fleeing for their lives. Our Amnesty Ukraine colleagues are reporting that civilians are being urged to hide in defunct bomb shelters. People on the streets are frantically ducking into underground parking lots and metro stations. Many families can’t find shelter.   
Our hearts go out to all who are already living with the consequences of this attack, including those in Canada who are worried about their loved ones.    
Armed conflict is devastating for human rights. This invasion is an immediate threat to civilian lives, livelihoods and infrastructure, and could cause acute food shortages. As millions are forced to leave their homes, mass displacement will likely create a refugee crisis in addition to the disaster we are currently witnessing.   
Anyone who has lived through a war also knows that it most heavily impacts those already marginalized, including members of minority groups. As always, it is the children, older persons, the sick, the poor, the homeless, those living with disabilities and so many more whose lives will be disrupted by this senseless attack. And women who will pick up and rebuild the broken pieces with their bare hands. 
Some individuals are also at elevated risk of being targeted, including human rights activists, LGBTI Ukrainians, and journalists.  
Today, Amnesty is pressing the UN General Assembly to meet in an emergency session and adopt a resolution denouncing Russia’s unlawful attack and calling for an end to all violations of humanitarian law and human rights. The lives, safety and well-being of millions of civilians are at stake.

In the past year, the global pandemic has endured and exposed more of its gendered impacts on women, girls, and gender diverse individuals. Unpaid care labour still falls largely to women, intimate partner violence increased, and income supports for sex workers were denied by the government. Women are also still recovering from unemployment, having lost more than twice the jobs as men at the start of the pandemic, and employment insecurity has further affected over half of Canada’s LGBTI households.   
While it’s important to continue examining the ripple effects of COVID-19 in all areas of daily life, it’s important to look back critically on a year that was also rampant with many forms of gendered violence.   
After being delayed in the first year of the pandemic, the federal government launched its long awaited 2021 National Action Plan (NAP) on ending violence against First Nations, Inuit, and Métis women, girls, and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people, and with it, a commitment of $2.2 billion to address the violence. Responses to the NAP by Indigenous groups and organizations were largely critical, calling the NAP inadequate in its explanation on how exactly Indigenous women and girls would be kept safe, nor clear on the precise timelines on when and by whom specific actions would be taken. Direct accountability from the government on its own role in creating the conditions for the violence were absent from the NAP as well. Needless to express, the urgency of this issue remains, and it’s essential we remain vigilant in our commitment to advance the 231 Calls for Justice in the National Inquiry’s Final Report into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.   
Last August, our hearts paused once again as we saw the Taliban’s seizure of power in Afghanistan, and we rightly feared that Afghan women and girls would bear the brunt of the offensive. Right away, fundamental rights were restricted – girls above the age of 12 were not permitted to go to school, women were immediately excluded from holding government positions and faced severe restrictions on their rights to freedom of movement and freedom of assembly and expression. Economic challenges are also being experienced as one of the most pressing issues in the country, and women, especially those who are heads of households, are even more disproportionately affected. This blatant institutionalized discrimination against women threatens their safety and economic prosperity, and effective governance in the country It demands that we in the international community remain firm in our commitment to support women’s rights in Afghanistan.   
The struggles for Muslim women and the gendered experience of Islamophobia have been especially difficult to ignore. Last year’s string of targeted and violent hate crimes against Somali women in Edmonton was a painful reminder that Muslim – and especially, racialized – women’s safety is perpetually at risk. We saw this manifest again in a horrific fatal attack against a Muslim family – three of its members were women – in London, Ontario last June. And having barely recovered from the grief of this tragedy, Muslim women grimaced once again upon hearing the news that a hijab-wearing teacher was forced out of her job because her headscarf was deemed to be a violation of Quebec’s Bill 21.   
Descriptions of the faceless experience of racist gender-based violence can go on and on, and it’s difficult not to wonder when International Women’s Day can be celebrated with the secure knowledge that all women and girls are thriving and have their wellbeing protected. What we do know is that this journey is paved by the work of activists demanding accountability and change from their governments, and by the resiliency of those who engage in all forms of protest. In our ultimate vision for women and girls, their rights and lives are fully upheld and protected, and weighted with the value they have always deserved. It’s our actions that will bring us there.

A preschool in north-eastern Ukraine was hit on the morning of 25 February with widely-banned cluster munitions while civilians took shelter inside, killing three of them, including a child, and wounding another child, Amnesty International said today. The attack appears to have been carried out by Russian forces, which were operating nearby, and which have a shameful record of using cluster munitions in populated areas.  
Amnesty International has confirmed that a 220mm Uragan rocket dropped cluster munitions on the Sonechko nursery and kindergarten in the town of Okhtyrka in Sumy Oblast, where local people were seeking safety from the fighting. The strike may constitute a war crime.   
“There is no possible justification for dropping cluster munitions in populated areas, let alone near a school,” said Agnès Callamard, Secretary-General of Amnesty International. “This attack bears all the hallmarks of Russia’s use of this inherently indiscriminate and internationally-banned weapon, and shows flagrant disregard for civilian life.”  
The strike violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks and damaged a school, a structure legally entitled to special protection. Under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions — a treaty backed by more than 100 states, but which Ukraine and Russia have not joined — the use, development, production, acquisition, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions is prohibited under all circumstances. Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of inherently indiscriminate weapons such as cluster munitions. Launching indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitutes a war crime.  
Drone video footage taken from the scene shows that cluster munitions struck at least seven locations on or near the building, four on the roof and three on the pavement immediately outside the school. Two injured or dead civilians are also visible in the footage, as are pools of blood. An additional 65 photos and videos that Amnesty International acquired from a local source shows more details of the scene, the victims and their family members, and the damage to the school.  
“While I was walking down [with] my wife, there were immediate explosions,” an older man told a contact working with Amnesty International. “You see, everyone is covered with blood, everything. Look at it…[expletive], it kills me the fact it’s a kindergarten. What’s this they shoot at? At military objects? Where are those?”  
The 220mm Uragan rocket, either a 9M27K or 9M27K1, carries 30 9N210 or 9N235 cluster munitions, which are nearly identical and differ only in the length of the time delay of their self-destruct feature. The seven impacts on and near the school show damage, including distinctive spalling on the ground, consistent with the expected damage from 9N210/9N235 cluster munitions.  
As first reported by the open source investigation organization Bellingcat, the remains of the nose cone and cargo compartment of the 9M27K rocket were discovered 200 metres to the east. Open source reports indicate there were Russian forces to the west of Okhtyrka, the source of the rocket launch based upon the flight trajectory, at the time of the attack. A logistics storage yard 300 metres north of the school may have been the target of the attack. However, Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS), like the 220mm Uragan rockets used in this attack, are unguided and notoriously inaccurate, and should never be used in civilian populated areas.   
In addition, because they scatter munitions over a wide area and have an extremely high dud rate of up to 20% — and because of the consequent threat they pose to civilians — cluster munitions are inherently indiscriminate weapons that are internationally banned by a treaty backed by more than 100 states. The use of these weapons violates the prohibition on indiscriminate attacks. 
Attacks on schools  
This is the fourth attack in this conflict that has struck a school that Amnesty International has verified.   
On 17 February, during increased shelling along the line of control, Russian-backed forces struck a kindergarten in the town of Stanytsia Luhanska, wounding three civilians. On the evening of 25 February, a missile damaged School No. 48 in Mariupol, blowing in windows and pockmarking the walls with metal fragments. And, on 26 February, an explosive weapon, most likely an artillery shell, hit the second story of a kindergarten in Chernihiv, starting a fire that was likely detected by VIIRS environmental satellite sensors.  
Under international humanitarian law, educational facilities are entitled to heightened protections as long as they are not used for military purposes. (None of the schools damaged in the incidents documented by Amnesty International appear to have been used for military purposes.) Parties to a conflict are required to take special care to avoid destroying or damaging them, a requirement that Russian forces do not appear to be meeting, judging from the growing number of attacks.   
In 2019, Ukraine endorsed the Safe Schools Declaration, which includes commitments to strengthen the protection of schools during armed conflict and to restrict their use for military purposes. All parties to the current conflict should respect the Safe Schools Declaration and its Guidelines.   
“It is stomach turning to see an indiscriminate attack on a nursery and kindergarten where civilians are seeking safe-haven. Plain and simple, this should be investigated as a war crime,” said Agnès Callamard.  
“As this human tragedy unfolds in Ukraine, any person who commits war crimes should be held individually accountable before the International Criminal Court (ICC) or another international criminal justice process at the national or international level. It is imperative that UN member states and the ICC urgently consider how to ensure the timely and effective collection and preservation of evidence of any crimes under international law committed in Ukraine.”  
While Russia and Ukraine are not parties to the ICC, in 2015 Ukraine accepted the court’s jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed on its territory from 20 February 2014.

An event reconstruction by SITU Research and Amnesty International details how Colombian security forces assaulted peaceful protesters in the Siloé neighbourhood of the city of Cali on 3 May. In the midst of this violence, three young people were shot and killed. 
“Our meticulous digital reconstruction of the events in Siloe reveals how the Colombian security forces intentionally attacked people who were demonstrating peacefully in order to punish, injure and kill them. Crucially, through the large volume of data that we synthesized, we were able to show that the police did not face an imminent threat of violence, and that their use of lethal weapons was unjustified. The toll of their excessive use of force was the lives of Kevin Agudelo and two other young men.” 
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab and SITU Research analysed more than 200 pieces of audiovisual material and interviewed multiple witnesses to verify details about “Operation Siloé”. This joint incursion by members of the National Police, the Mobile Anti-Riot Squad (ESMAD) and the Special Operations Group of the Colombian National Police (GOES) targeted people taking part in a vigil at the La Glorieta roundabout in the Siloé neighbourhood. That night, several people were arbitrarily detained and hundreds were injured, with three people dying of gunshot wounds, including Kevin Agudelo, a promising 22-year-old football player. 
“Each video and witness testimony recounts a unique perspective of the night. Some describe communal moments of remembrance, others show chaotic scenes of weapons deployed from seemingly all directions, yet others capture the bloody injuries of protesters carried away to receive treatment. When aggregated in time and space, these experiences build a synthesized picture of what unfolded on May 3: a carefully orchestrated assault on a peaceful vigil,” said Bora Erden, Senior Researcher at SITU Research. 
Amnesty International found evidence indicating that live ammunition was used against protesters, such as photos of shell casings, bullet holes and the sound of gunfire. The organization verified videos taken prior to the attack and was able to determine that there were police officers present close to where Kevin died and that they were firing 5.56mm Tavor rifles. The evidence shows that there was no imminent threat of violence that could not reasonably have been addressed by the security forces with more proportionate measures. 
“We didn’t have any kind of protection and we couldn’t get away before the gunshots and tear gas started streaming out from different directions… it was excessive, we were not armed nor did we have any way to respond to that arsenal… they used rifles that are used in war, the only thing we could do was run for our lives, Kevin was with us,” a witness told Amnesty International. 
Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps confirmed the presence of two helicopters in the area, while witnesses described the unlawful and excessive deployment of tear gas using Venom, a weapons system whose prescribed use is to disperse a violent crowd. Since the security forces used it at night, from above, and on peaceful protesters who did not know where to disperse, its use was unjustified and inappropriate. Rather than a legitimate attempt to restore public order, using tear gas in this way indicates the intention to facilitate a military attack. 
“The security forces were aware of the deadly capability of their weapons and yet they fired at will in a place where there were young people, children and adults who had to run for their lives. The launch of an operation of this magnitude, as if it were a confrontation with armed actors and not a peaceful protest, is indicative of the warlike nature of the response to the protests related to the national strike in Cali”, said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“We hope that the Attorney General’s Office will make advances in the investigation into the death of Kevin Agudelo and the other serious human rights violations committed during Operation Siloé and, if there is sufficient and admissible evidence against those suspected of criminal responsibility, bring them to justice in a fair trial before ordinary civilian courts. This is the first step towards building a Colombia where human rights are respected; it is imperative that impunity does not prevail for these serious crimes.” 
Additional information: 
Amnesty International has documented extensively the repressive actions of the National Police in the context of the 2021 National Strike, including excessive use of force, disappearances and sexual violence against protesters, and attacks against Indigenous peoples. 
In the report Cali: In the Epicenter of Repression published last July, Amnesty International documented unlawful repression, urban paramilitarism, unlawful detention and torture of peaceful protesters and pointed to the real goals behind this repression: to instil fear, discourage peaceful protest and ultimately punish those demanding change in the country. 
In November, together with the local organizations Temblores and PAIIS, Amnesty International published another report, Shoot on sight, which documented the cases of 13 victims of eye trauma and analysed more than 300 pieces of audiovisual material on the disproportionate and repressive actions of ESMAD between 28 April and 20 October. 
In June 2021, Amnesty International Canada called on the Canadian government to suspend weapons exports to Colombia. “Given horrendous human rights violations committed by security forces against protesters in Colombia, and in line with international obligations under the Arms Trade Treaty, Canada must immediately cease the direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of equipment that could be used against civilians,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada – English-speaking Section. 
Military exports from Canada to Colombia in the past have included helicopters and armoured vehicles. In light of the troubling human rights record of Colombian police and military, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations call into question such exports. In 2020, the value of Canadian military exports to Colombia was $460,338.87, according to the Government of Canada’s 2020 Report on Exports of Military Goods from Canada.

Bookseller Gui Minhai was sentenced on 24 February 2020 to 10 years’ imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for five years, on the charge of “illegally providing intelligence to foreign entities”. Since then, he has been denied access to his family and, having obtained Swedish citizenship in 1996, to Swedish consular assistance. There are grave concerns over Gui Minhai’s poor health, and that he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. The Chinese government must release Gui Minhai immediately; pending his release, he must be granted access to his family, lawyers of his choice, consular support, and adequate medical care.   
Since his imprisonment, the authorities have rejected the Swedish consulate’s request to read the verdict and meet Gui Minhai. He has not been able to see his family members and consular officials, or even speak to a lawyer of his own choice since 2018. There is no way to verify his wishes or conditions. Given his poor health, which requires regular and urgent medical care, his family is particularly concerned about his wellbeing. Gui Minhai was tried and convicted in secret. Despite the authorities’ claim that he was prosecuted for handing over ‘intelligence’ to overseas parties, it appears that his conviction is primarily based on his attempted trip with two Swedish diplomats in January 2018 to help him get medical care.  
Without any further information provided, a court notice announcing Gui Minhai’s conviction and sentence in 2020 stated that he had reapplied for Chinese citizenship in 2018, which would nullify his Swedish citizenship under Chinese law. As he has been held in custody since 2018 without access to his family or lawyers, the veracity of this information is highly questionable.

Additional Information  
Gui Minhai was one of the five Hong Kong–based publishers and booksellers who disappeared in 2015 after printing books critical of the Chinese government. Mighty Current Media and the Causeway Bay Bookstore that Gui Minhai led were known for their books on Chinese leaders and political scandals, which are banned in mainland China but are popular with mainland Chinese tourists visiting Hong Kong. The detention and disappearance of Gui Minhai and the other booksellers had a chilling effect on the climate for freedom of expression and publishing in Hong Kong and the Chinese-speaking world.  
Gui Minhai’s case drew international attention after he first went missing in Thailand on 17 October 2015, about the same time that three of his company colleagues also went missing. Another associate, Lee Bo, was taken away from Hong Kong on 30 December 2015. Gui Minhai later appeared on Chinese state television in January 2016 to give a choreographed “confession” regarding an alleged traffic incident that took place in 2003. Many believe that the drunk driving charge was simply a pretence to detain Gui Minhai and shut down his publishing business.  
In October 2017, Gui Minhai was “released” after he had, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, “completely served the sentence imposed for a traffic offence”; however, his daughter Angela Gui has since raised concerns that Gui Minhai remained under state surveillance and monitoring after his supposed release. On 20 January 2018 while on a train from Ningbo to Beijing and accompanied by two Swedish diplomats helping him to get medical care, Gui Minhai was suddenly taken away by approximately 10 plainclothes officers. He has not been seen since. On 25 February 2022, Angela renewed her call for the immediate release of her father after Olympic speed skating champion Nils van der Poel handed her his Beijing 2022 gold medal in protest of human rights violations in China.  
In China, dissidents including writers, academics and journalists are systematically subjected to monitoring, harassment, intimidation, arrest, and prosecution. The Hong Kong National Security Law enacted on 1 July 2020 has also given the Hong Kong government free rein to crack down on freedom of expression in an unprecedented manner. Numerous [or give the figure] activists have been charged under the law for their peaceful activities. Many civil society organizations, trade unions and news organizations have closed under the threat of the NSL In a major censorship purge, numerous books were removed from the city’s public libraries. Three speech therapists were charged with conspiring to publish and circulate seditious material after publishing children’s books mocking the government.

The Omani Internal Security Agency has subjected Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi, a member of the Shuhuh tribe, to an enforced disappearance, a crime under international law, since his arbitrary arrest on 19 December 2021. His whereabouts are unknown and he is at risk of torture or ill-treatment. Amnesty International urges the Omani authorities to disclose Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi’s whereabouts and release him immediately.  
On 19 December 2021, Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi went to the police station in the town of Dibba al-Baya, Musandam governorate, Oman, with his wife and three of their children to collect ID cards for their children. His wife stayed in the car outside the police station. At the station, police officers acting under orders of officers from the Internal Security Agency, detained Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi without presenting a warrant or any other legal document, then searched his car and confiscated his phone. His family was not informed about the reason for his arrest, and they have not heard from him since that day.   
Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi is a relative of one of the members of the Shuhuh tribe previously subjected to an unfair trial. Trial documents revealed that the authorities had targeted the individuals based on their online browsing habits in relation to Oman’s Musandam province and the Shuhuh tribe that lives there.   
On 24 January 2022, Amnesty International wrote to the Omani Human Rights Commission seeking their assistance in confirming Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi’s whereabouts, the reason for his arrest and any charges he may be facing. They have yet to respond.

Additional information  
Masoud Ali Abdullah al-Shahi (48) is a member of the Shuhuh tribe. In the course of 2020, he lost his job in a private company in the UAE due to the pandemic and returned to Musandam. The Shuhuh tribe exists on both sides of the UAE-Omani border and its members make up the majority of the residents of Musandam, known locally as Ru’us al-Jibal, which is a territorial exclave of Oman. The Shuhuh tribe and Musandam province have culturally distinct practices from mainland Oman, including the manner of dress and agricultural and animal husbandry practices. Their practice of Islam also differs from the Ibadi sect that predominates in Oman.  
There have been waves of arbitrary detentions of Musandam residents championing the region’s local history and culture since 2015, and reliable reports of arbitrary detention of Shuhuh tribe members in Musandam dating back at least to 1991. In addition, the government has repeatedly undertaken demolitions of homes on the pretext that they are in violation of building codes. Authorities have often expropriated lands for state use after demolishing the homes built on them. Since September 2014, the “immediate removal team” of the Ministry of Regional Municipalities & Water Resources has announced the imminent or completed demolition of dwellings and other local structures in Musandam’s Dibba, Khasab, and Bukha municipalities on at least 15 occasions.  
Between May and April 2018, five men, all from the Shuhuh tribe and including a national of the United Arab Emirates, were arrested and subject to enforced disappearance for several months. Between August and October 2018, following an unfair trial, a court in Muscat sentenced the five men to life imprisonment on charges that included “using information technology to prejudice the security and unity of the country and its territories”. On 17 November 2019, the Sultan pardoned four of the five prisoners who were released a year later. The fifth man was released in April 2021. One of the victims, after his release, spoke with Amnesty International and confirmed that he was tortured.  
Oman severely curtails freedom of expression in the country resulting in the prosecution of critics, activists and peaceful demonstrators.

•         Amnesty International research verifies violations in international humanitarian law  
•         Russian attacks could constitute war crimes  
•         Russian claims to use precision guided weapons are patently false  
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has been marked by indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas and strikes on protected objects such as hospitals, Amnesty International said today, after documenting three incidents that it believes to have killed at least six civilians and injured at least 12 more. Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law (the laws of war) and can constitute war crimes.    
“The Russian military has shown a blatant disregard for civilian lives by using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas. Some of these attacks may be war crimes. The Russian government, which falsely claims to use only precision-guided weapons, should take responsibility for these acts,” said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.   
“The Russian troops should immediately stop carrying out indiscriminate attacks in violation of the laws of war. The continuation of the use of ballistic missiles and other inaccurate explosive weapons causing civilian deaths and injuries is inexcusable.”  
Indiscriminate attacks  
Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab analyzed digital evidence—including photos, videos and satellite imagery— of three such attacks carried out in the early hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. The attacks occurred in Vuhledar, Kharkiv and Uman.  
In the deadliest strike documented by Amnesty International, at approximately 10.30 am local time, a ballistic missile struck near a hospital building in Vuhledar, in Donetsk region, eastern Ukraine, killing four civilians and wounding ten more. According to a local source who spoke to Amnesty International researchers, two women and two men were killed, and six healthcare workers were among the injured. Analyzing photos of the weapon scrap linked to the incident, Amnesty International’s weapons investigator determined that a 9M79 Tochka ballistic missile was used in the attack. These weapons are extremely inaccurate, regularly missing their targets by half a kilometre or more and should never be used in populated areas.  
Another of the attacks was carried out at approximately 8 am local time, in the Kharkiv region, northeastern Ukraine. The likely target was the nearby Chuhuiv Air Base, but instead Russian weapon struck a residential block, causing extensive fire damage and apparently killing at least one civilian man and injuring at least two civilian women. A single large crater in the ground between apartment buildings indicates the weapon was most likely a single large missile or rocket.  
In another attack occurring at 7 am on the 24 February in Uman, Cherkasy region, a civilian man appears to have been killed by a strike that also damaged a nearby restaurant.   
UN General Assembly must hold an emergency meeting  
Amnesty International’s verification of the use of indiscriminate attacks by the Russian forces in their military operations in Ukraine, provides irrefutable evidence of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law.   
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is scheduled to meet later today to discuss the situation and Russia will most likely veto any resolution put forward by other member states. Therefore, Amnesty International is calling for an emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.    
“If the Security Council is paralyzed through veto, it is up to the entire membership to step up,” said Agnes Callamard.   
“We call on the UN General Assembly to meet in an emergency session and adopt a resolution denouncing Russia unlawful attack and calling for an end to all violations of humanitarian law and human rights. The lives, safety and well-being of millions of civilians is at stake.”

Amnesty International calls for unerring respect for international human rights and humanitarian law, following Russia’s multi-pronged attack on Ukraine this morning. 
“Our worst fears have been realized. After weeks of escalation, a Russian invasion that is likely to lead to the most horrific consequences for human lives and human rights has begun,” said Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard. 
“As bombs and rockets are falling on Ukrainian military bases, and the first reports are coming in of the use of indiscriminate weapons by the Russian army, Amnesty International re-iterates its call on all parties to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law andinternational human rights law. Civilian lives, homes and infrastructure must be protected; indiscriminate attacks and the use of prohibited weapons such as cluster munitions must not take place. We also repeat our call to allow and facilitate access for humanitarian agencies to provide assistance to civilians affected by the hostilities. 
As rockets are falling on Ukrainian military bases, and the first reports are coming in of the use of indiscriminate weapons by the Russian army, Amnesty International re-iterates its call on all parties to adhere strictly to international humanitarian law and international human rights law 
“Amnesty International will be monitoring the situation closely to expose violations of international law by all parties.” 
Expanded armed conflict between the two countries erupted in the early morning on 24 February with the Russian army subjecting Ukrainian military and air bases to heavy shelling, rocket artillery, and missile attacks. Meanwhile tank columns invaded Ukraine’sterritory along the entire length of the border. 
Background 
Early in the morning of 24 February, Russia launched an invasion on Ukraine, with reports of troops crossing the border to the north and south, explosions in multiple cities including the capital Kyiv. On at least one occasion, in Kharkiv, video footage shows the tail section of a rocket fired from a Smerch heavy multiple rocket launcher left sticking out of the pavement. Deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian property, and indiscriminate attacks that kill or injure civilians constitute war crimes. 
Amnesty International has previously warned of the devastating human rights risks of further armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including threats to civilian lives, livelihoods and infrastructure, and potential acute food shortages and mass displacement. The organization has documented the severe human rights toll of the 2014-2015 conflict in eastern Ukraine, in which war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed.

On 25 February, a Russian court in south-western Siberia will consider the prolongation of the forcible psychiatric hospitalization of shaman Aleksandr Gabyshev. The hearing will take place inside the psychiatric hospital. Aleksandr Gabyshev has been arbitrarily declared “insane” and incarcerated in a mental institution for his vocal criticism of President Vladimir Putin.  
On 25 February, the Zayeltsovsky District Court of Novosibirsk will consider the prolongation of Aleksandr Gabyshev’s forcible hospitalization at Novosibirsk Specialized Type Psychiatric Inpatient Hospital With Intensive Supervision. According to international law and standards, deprivation of liberty on grounds of mental illness is unjustified if not strictly necessary to protect the safety of the person or of others. During the initial hearings on forced hospitalization of Aleksandr Gabyshev in Yakutsk City Court and Supreme Court of the Republic of Yakutia (Sakha) in July and September 2021, no sufficient evidence was presented in court to determine if he was a danger to himself or to others, and fair trial guarantees were not respected during the proceedings.  
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Russia is a state party, forbids the deprivation of liberty based on the existence of any disability, including mental or intellectual. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur on torture has said that medical treatment administered in the absence of free and informed consent may amount to torture or other ill-treatment  
By depriving Aleksandr Gabyshev of liberty for his peaceful activism, the Russian authorities are in violation of their obligations under international human rights law, including in relation to the rights to freedom of expression and association, and the right to a fair trial.

On 25 February, the Zayeltsovsky District Court of Novosibirsk will consider prolongation of forcible psychiatric hospitalization of shaman Aleksandr Gabyshev. The decision to hospitalize him was taken in July 2021 by Yakutsk City Court and upheld in appeal in September 2021 by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Yakutia (Sakha), on account of him being recognized “insane” in connection with his peaceful criticism of President Putin and his promise to use his shamanic powers “to purge” Putin from the Kremlin.   
After his first attempt to walk on foot 8,500 kilometres from Yakutsk to Moscow to “purge” Russian President Vladimir Putin from Kremlin “using shamanic powers” in September 2019, Aleksandr Gabyshev has been targeted multiple times by the authorities. He was first arrested in September 2019 by armed and masked law enforcement officials who took him away from a camping site without revealing their identities or explaining their actions. He was placed in a psychiatric institution but released shortly and placed under surveillance as he was designated a suspect in a case of “public calls for extremist activities” (Article 280(1) of the Criminal Code). The second attempt to confine Aleksandr Gabyshev took place in May 2020, when the authorities held him in a psychiatric ward for two months, allegedly for refusing to be tested for COVID-19. He was medically examined and found to be “suffering from over-valuing of his personality” because he had expressed ideas intended “to harm the government,” and the court approved his forcible hospitalization. After an international solidarity campaign, he was released on 22 July 2020.  
The latest round of Aleksandr Gabyshev’s persecution started on 27 January 2021, days after he had announced that he was again preparing to walk to Moscow. Under the pretext of Aleksandr Gabyshev having missed his visits to a psychiatrist, the authorities sent some 50 law enforcement officers in riot gear, lead by the Deputy Interior Minister of Yakutia and accompanied by doctors, to his home in Yakusts, and detained him. In the process, Gabyshev allegedly tore a riot police officer’s uniform and injured him with a ceremonial Yakut sword. On 2 February, the Yakutsk City Court ruled to confine Gabyshev to a psychiatric ward for medical examination, and three weeks later, the Investigative Committee announced that he was officially charged with making “calls for extremism” and “using violence against police officers”. On 18 March, the medical experts announced that they had discovered “signs of insanity”.  
On 26 July, the Yakutsk City Court decided to confine Aleksandr Gabyshev to the Yakut Republican Psychoneurological Dispensary for an indefinite period while the investigation into his case was ongoing. On 23 September, the Supreme Court of the Republic of Yakutia (Sakha) upheld the decision. After that, Gabyshev was transferred to Novosibirsk Specialized Type Psychiatric Inpatient Hospital With Intensive Supervision, some 1,000 km from his home in Yakutsk, and has remained there since.

In October 2021 the BC government adopted an ambitious new target to reduce “distances travelled in light-duty vehicles by 25% by 2030, compared to 2020.” 
Decreasing traffic in BC will require a shift in thinking: for over half a century, provincial policy has been geared towards highway and road expansion. The result? More cars and trucks on our roads. More greenhouse gas pollution. Worsening health and safety issues. 
We know that when more space is allocated to public transit lanes, protected bike lanes, and space for walking, traffic evaporates. More and safer options for people on the move equates to fewer cars, healthier, cooler, more inclusive and more pleasant cities and towns. 
Owning a private car is a huge expense for many people, yet due to lack of other options, many people feel stuck in their cars. Walking, cycling and rolling options – in addition to better public transit – throughout urban and suburban areas would relieve a huge financial burden for many people. Young people and recent immigrants would not have to bear the financial burden of buying and operating their own car to get to work or access post secondary education. 
BC’s new target of 25 per cent fewer cars on our roads by 2030 is achievable. It is up to us to show the BC government that the public supports this ambitious target and that we would like to see a rapid plan for its implementation. 
Please write to Ministers Fleming & Heyman and Minister of State Ma and thank them for adopting the ambitious target of reducing vehicle travel 25% by 2030. 
Honorable Rob Fleming, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure: Minister.Transportation@gov.bc.ca  
Honorable Bowinn Ma, Minister of State for Infrastructure: Minister.SI@gov.bc.ca 
Honorable George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change: ENV.minister@gov.bc.ca 
Climate change is not only the great environmental emergency of our time, but also an unprecedented human rights crisis. It threatens a wide range of human rights, including the rights to water, to health, and to life itself. The BC government must implement policies to reduce reliance on car travel and the number of cars on the road while quickly ending sales of new fossil fuel vehicles. The number of cars on our roads needs to shrink quickly to make the rapid transition to electric cars practical and just.  
It is time to leave the injustices of the fossil fuel economy behind. There are no shortcuts to saving the planet and humanity. The only option is to end the fossil fuel era and ensure a just transition for all. Reducing the number of vehicles on our roads and increasing clean-fuelled public transit is an achievable step forward for human rights.

Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz had been acquitted and released immediately on 9 February 2022.  
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
On 24 February 2022, the sentencing court of Trujillo ordered the release of the six Guapinol defenders (José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo and Orbin Nahún Hernández). They were found guilty of the crimes of illegal deprivation of liberty and aggravated damages against the contractor of the company Inversiones Los Pinares (ILP), and simple and aggravated damages against ILP on 9 February 2022. The six prisoners of conscience spent two years and a half wrongfully detained.  
Only two of the eight members of the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Assets (CMDBCP) were acquitted and immediately released on 9 February 2022. One day after, on 10 February 2022, the Honduras Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJ) issued two resolutions in favor of the eight defenders, in relation to two amparos writs filed in 2020 and in 2021 for violations of due process of law and their pre-trial detention. Following this resolution, on 24 February 2022, the sentencing court of Trujillo ordered the release of the six Guapinol defenders, who were freed later on the same day.  
We believe that the public campaign on behalf of the eight Guapinol defenders, including appeals sent by Amnesty International members, have contributed to this positive outcome. After their release, the people who accompanied them deeply thanked Amnesty International for all the support.

Rivers State authorities have forcibly evicted thousands of residents of waterfront communities from their homes in the Diobu area of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in southern Nigeria. The area is home to an estimated population of 60,000 people. The Governor must halt any plans for further demolitions and urgently provide relief and ensure access to justice and effective remedies for all those already affected.  
On 19 January, a Rivers State Government Task Force visited several waterfront communities in Port Harcourt and marked homes for demolition. According to the residents, task force officials told residents to vacate their homes within 7 days, that is by 26 January. On 29 January, the Rivers State Task Force and security agents, including members of the Rivers State Police Command, began demolishing homes belonging to the Elechi Phase 1 waterfront community, some with excessive use of force – beating up residents and leaving many injured. The forced evictions have made thousands of women, men and children homeless, forcing them to live in deplorable conditions without access to water and sanitation among other essential services.  
The mass forced evictions in the Diobu axis of Port Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria, have left thousands homeless in 10 communities namely: Elechi Phase 1, Urualla, Ojike, Akwuzu, Afikpo, Abba, Akowka, Nanka, Egede and Soku. When the evictions started on 29 January, 2,000 people in Elechi Phase 1 were rendered homeless while their properties and livelihoods were destroyed. By 3 February, the authorities had expanded the demolitions to the other nine waterfront communities. The ten communities are home to an estimated 60,000 people.  
The forced evictions have not only violated people’s right to adequate housing, which the Nigerian government as a state party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, has a duty to respect, protect and fulfil, but also negatively impacted other human rights such as their rights to education and health, having left residents in a position of increased vulnerability to Covid-19. Access to adequate housing in times of a global pandemic is critical in protecting people from Covid-19, stopping its spread; and recovering from it. Governments must also ensure that no one is rendered homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights as a consequence of eviction.

Additional information  
Port Harcourt is the capital and largest city of Rivers State, Nigeria. It is a metropolitan city with a population of over 3 million people. It lies along the Bonny River. Despite being an oil producing region of Niger Delta, thousands of people in the region live below the poverty line amidst inadequate and affordable housing. The forced evictions in Port Harcourt across waterfront communities has affected the lives and livelihood of its residents. The forced evictions followed an announcement by the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, in his 2022 New Year message, that the state government would, from the second week of January, commence the demolition of all shanties and makeshift structures in criminal hotspots in Port Harcourt.  
Under international law, evictions may only be carried out as a last resort, once all other feasible alternatives to eviction have been explored and appropriate procedural safeguards have been put in place. Such procedural safeguards include provision of adequate notice, opportunities for genuine consultations and access to legal remedies. Governments must also ensure that no one is rendered homeless or vulnerable to the violation of other human rights as a consequence of eviction. In cases where evictions may be justifiable, it is incumbent upon the relevant authorities to ensure that they are carried out in a manner warranted by law and which is compatible with international human rights laws and standards.  
Although the Nigerian Constitution directs the state to ensure that adequate shelter is provided for all citizens, this provision is in the Constitution’s ‘directive principles’ and therefore not enforceable in Nigerian Courts. However, Nigeria is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international and regional human rights treaties which require states parties to realize the right to adequate housing, and to prevent and refrain from carrying out forced evictions.

The attacks were often characterized by additional acts of violence and brutality, death threats, and the use of ethnic slurs and derogatory remarks. In Kobo, Tigrayan forces were apparently lashing out at the civilian population in retaliation for increased resistance from local militias and armed residents.“Tigrayan forces have shown utter disregard for fundamental rules of international humanitarian law which all warring parties must follow. Evidence is mounting of a pattern of Tigrayan forces committing war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in areas under their control in the Amhara region from July 2021 onwards. This includes repeated incidents of widespread rape, summary killings and looting, including from hospitals,” said Sarah Jackson, Deputy Regional Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes at Amnesty International.“The TPLF leadership must put an immediate end to the atrocities we have documented and remove from its forces anyone suspected of involvement in such crimes.”Summary killings in KoboIn Kobo, a town in the north-east of the Amhara region, Tigrayan fighters deliberately killed unarmed civilians, seemingly in revenge for losses among their ranks at the hands of Amhara militias and armed farmers. Amnesty International interviewed 27 witnesses and survivors, including some who helped to collect and bury the bodies.Ten Kobo residents told Amnesty International that in the afternoon of 9 September 2021, Tigrayan fighters summarily killed their relatives and neighbours outside their homes. 
“First they shot my brother Taddese… He died on the spot. My other brother and my brother-in-law tried to move away and were both shot in the back and killed… they shot me in my left shoulder… I stayed down, pretending to be dead,” a survivor told Amnesty International.Twelve other Kobo residents said that they found the bodies of local residents and labourers who had been killed execution-style – shot in the head, chest or back, some with their hands tied behind their backs.“The first dead bodies we saw were by the school fence. There were 20 bodies lying in their underwear and facing the fence and three more bodies in the school compound. Most were shot at the back of their heads and some in the back. Those who were shot at the back of their heads could not be recognized because their faces were partially blown off,” one male resident said.Satellite imagery analysis by Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab shows evidence of new burial sites on the grounds of St. George’s Church and St. Michael’s Church, where residents said they had buried those killed on 9 September.Deliberate killings of civilians – or of captured, surrendered, or wounded fighters – constitute war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity.Sexual violence in Chenna 
From July 2021 onwards, in and around Chenna, a village north of Bahir Dar, the capital of the Amhara region, Tigrayan forces raped dozens of women and girls as young as 14, often in the victims’ own homes after having forced them to provide food and cook for them.The sexual violence was accompanied by shocking levels of brutality, including beatings, death threats, and ethnic slurs. Fourteen of the 30 survivors interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were gang-raped by multiple Tigrayan fighters, and some were raped in front of their children. Seven of the survivors were girls under the age of 18.Lucy, a 14-year-old seventh-grade student, and her mother were both raped by Tigrayan fighters in their home in Did-Bahr. She told Amnesty International: “I was at home with my mother and my grandmother when two young men with rifles came to our home in the morning at about 11. One of them wore military clothes and the other wore civilian clothes. They spoke a mix of Tigrinya and some Amharic. They said ‘Our families were raped and now it is our turn to rape you.’ One of them raped me in the courtyard and the other raped my mother inside the house. My mother is very sick now, she is very depressed and desperate. We don’t speak about what happened; it is impossible.”Salam, a 29-year-old woman, described how four Tigrayan fighters locked her older parents in a separate room and then gang-raped her over a 15-hour period.Many of the survivors suffered severe and long-term physical and psychological damage, including 10 who remained hospitalized three months after they were raped. Doctors who provided medical care to rape survivors told Amnesty International that two rape survivors had to be treated for lacerations likely caused by having the bayonets of rifles inserted into their genitals.Amnesty International has previously documented similar patterns of Tigrayan fighters raping Amhara women and girls in Nifas Mewcha, and has received credible reports of rape from other areas of the Amhara region. Such atrocities constitute war crimes and, potentially, crimes against humanity.  Looting of civilian propertyIn both Kobo and the Chenna area, residents told Amnesty International that Tigrayan fighters stole possessions from their homes and shops and looted and vandalized public properties, including medical clinics and schools.The looting and damage to medical facilities made it impossible for rape survivors and other residents in need of medical care to obtain treatment locally, forcing them to wait until they could reach hospitals in Debark, Gondar and Bahir Dar weeks later. For rape survivors, this was far too late to receive crucial post-rape care, some of which needs to be administered within 72 hours. “These atrocities yet again drive home the need for swift action by the international community to investigate abuses by all sides, bring those responsible to account and ensure that survivors can realise their rights,” said Sarah Jackson.“For too long, the international community has been failing victims and survivors of crimes under international law in Ethiopia. The United Nations and African Union must deploy relevant investigation teams to the region. The international commission of human rights experts on Ethiopia, established by the UN Human Rights Council in December, must also be permitted to start its work and be granted access to the country as soon as possible.”BackgroundThe conflict in Tigray broke out in November 2020 and spread to other regions of northern Ethiopia from July 2021. Amnesty International has documented a range of violations by all parties to the conflict, including massacres, extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, sexual and other gender-based violence and arbitrary detentions by Ethiopian government forces and allied militias and by Eritrean forces acting alongside them.To download satellite imagery and exclusive photo evidence corroborating the testimonies of burial sites and looting in Kobo, please visit: https://adam.amnesty.org/asset-bank/images/assetbox/327c9752-12ad-4bc6-acec-b5e6f94d2fdb/assetbox.html

New analysis as part of the global Ban The Scan campaign has proven how the New York Police Department’s vast surveillance operation particularly affects people already targeted for stop-and-frisk across all five boroughs of New York City. 
In the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, the research also showed that the higher the proportion of non-white residents, the higher the concentration of facial recognition compatible CCTV cameras. 
“Our analysis shows that the NYPD’s use of facial recognition technology helps to reinforce discriminatory policing against minority communities in New York City,” said Matt Mahmoudi, Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights Researcher at Amnesty International. 
“We have long known that stop-and-frisk in New York is a racist policing tactic. We now know that the communities most targeted with stop-and-frisk are also at greater risk of discriminatory policing through invasive surveillance. 
“The shocking reach of facial recognition technology in the city leaves entire neighbourhoods exposed to mass surveillance. The NYPD must now disclose exactly how this invasive technology is used. 
“Banning facial recognition for mass surveillance is a much-needed first step towards dismantling racist policing, and the New York City Council must now immediately move towards a comprehensive ban.” 
The findings are based on crowdsourced data obtained by thousands of digital volunteers as part of the Decode Surveillance NYC project, who mapped more than 25,500 CCTV cameras across New York City. Amnesty International worked with data scientists to compare this data with statistics on stop-and-frisk and demographic data.   
Facial recognition technologies (FRT) for identification are systems of mass surveillance that violate the right to privacy, and threaten the rights to freedom of assembly, equality and non-discrimination. 
The NYPD used FRT in at least 22,000 cases between 2016 and 2019. Data on incidents of stop-and-frisk by the NYPD since 2002 shows Black and Latinx communities have been the overwhelming target of such tactics.   
Last year, Amnesty International sued the NYPD after it refused to disclose public records regarding its acquisition of FRT and other surveillance tools. The case is ongoing. 
New interactive website detailing FRT exposure 
Amnesty International is today also launching a new website that allows users to discover how much of any potential walking route between two locations in New York City might be exposed to FRT surveillance. 
During the Black Lives Matter movement of mid-2020, New Yorkers attending protests experienced higher levels of exposure to FRT. For example, a protester walking from the nearest subway station to Washington Square Park would be under surveillance by NYPD Argus cameras for the entirety of their route. 
“When we looked at routes that people would have walked to get to and from protests from nearby subway stations, we found nearly total surveillance coverage by publicly-owned CCTV cameras, mostly NYPD Argus cameras,” said Matt Mahmoudi. 
“The pervasive use of facial recognition technology is effectively a digital stop-and-frisk. The use of mass surveillance technology at protest sites is being used to identify, track and harass people who are simply exercising their human rights. 
“This is a deliberate scare tactic by the NYPD that has no place in a free society, and must be stopped immediately.” 
The website also allows users to track how much FRT is used between any of the major tourist attractions in the city by plotting the distance and possible route taken. 
Amnesty International encourages New Yorkers to take action by sending a letter of protest to their council member demanding the introduction of a bill that prohibits FRT to help protect their communities. Global users can sign Amnesty International’s petition calling for regulation of when and where public FRT systems are used. 
Research partners that Amnesty International worked with include: Julien Cornebise of the Computer Science Department, University College London; BetaNYC, a civic organisation using data and technology to hold government to account; and Dr Damon Wischik, an independent data scientist. 
The research marks the latest phase of the Ban The Scan campaign, following investigations into surveillance in New York and Hyderabad in India last year. Amnesty International is calling for a total ban on the use, development, production, sales, and export of FRT for mass surveillance purposes by both states and the private sector.

Instead, they monopolized technology, blocked and lobbied against the sharing of intellectual property, charged high prices for vaccines and prioritized supplies to wealthy countries, said Amnesty International today in a new assessment of the leading Covid-19 vaccine developers. 
Ten billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines were produced last year, more than enough to reach the 40% target of global vaccination set by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the end of 2021. Yet Money calls the shots: Pharma’s response to the Covid-19 vaccines crisis  – an update on Amnesty International’s September 2021 report  A double dose of inequality: Pharma companies and the Covid-19 vaccines crisis – reveals that just over 4% of those living in low-income countries had been fully vaccinated by the end of last year. 
“More than 1.2 billion people in low and lower-middle income countries could have been vaccinated by the end of 2021 if high-income countries and vaccine makers took their human rights obligations and responsibilities to heart,” said Rajat Khosla, Amnesty International’s Senior Director of Research, Advocacy and Policy. 
“While high income countries hoarded vaccines, callously choking supply to poorer parts of the world, pharma companies played a pivotal role in this unfolding human rights catastrophe – leaving those most in need to cope on their own. These companies could have been the heroes of 2021. Instead, they turned their back on those who needed vaccines the most and just continued with business as usual, putting profits before people. If we want 2022 to be the last year of this pandemic, we need to shift course now to reach the 70% WHO-target by July of this year.” 
In 2021, Pfizer, BioNTech and Moderna projected revenues of up to US$54 billion, yet supplied less than 2% of their vaccines to low-income countries. Chinese companies Sinovac and Sinopharm delivered just 0.5% and 1.5% respectively of their vaccines to low-income countries. 
Johnson & Johnson’s and AstraZeneca’s records on distribution were better – with 50% of their stock reaching low and lower-middle-income countries (with many of these doses provided as “donations” from upper-income countries, not as part of sales agreements). However, both companies still refuse to share their technology and intellectual property through World Health Organization-coordinated initiatives and are now abandoning their not-for-profit pricing model. 
“Despite billions in public funding, these companies are continuing to put their own greed before their human rights responsibilities. It’s deeply concerning that profits are being prioritised over people – even in the face of more than 5.6 million people dead from Covid-19 to date. How many more variants do we have to live through before high-income countries and pharmaceutical companies realize that those in low-income countries must have access to vaccines – not just those living in rich ones?” said Rajat Khosla. 
Further findings provided by Airfinity, a science and analytics company, up to 31 December 2021, include: 
Amnesty’s report also shows how these companies don’t share their intellectual property, knowledge and technology, putting in place obstacles to fair vaccine access, as well as actively lobbying against the relaxation of intellectual property rights. 
“The fight for equitable vaccines is far from over,” said Rajat Khosla. “We will continue to call on pharmaceutical companies to prioritise delivery to low-income countries in order to meet the WHO’s target of 70% global vaccination before mid-2022. Everyone deserves a fair shot at a vaccine and as we enter our third year of the pandemic, it’s time that indeed everyone, living anywhere in this world, has immediate access.” 
Amnesty International is also calling on companies to share intellectual property by issuing open and non-exclusive licences or participating in the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP), established to support the sharing of open and non-exclusive licences, publicly disclose all terms and conditions, and price vaccine doses so profit does not stand in the way of access to Covid-19 vaccines. 
“Investors have also played a huge role in this global crisis. Their lack of meaningful action shows that while Covid-19 unleashed unimaginable suffering on millions around the world, they thrived, but did nothing to ensure their investments did not result in human rights harm on account of the profit-driven approach taken by pharmaceutical companies,” said Rajat Khosla. “We’re calling on investors to face up to their actions immediately and use their considerable leverage to pressure pharmaceutical companies to lift obstacles to fair access to vaccines, as well as promote accountability and transparency.”

Leonard Peltier has always maintained his innocence of the murder of two FBI agents during a confrontation with members of the American Indian Movement on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota in 1975. There are serious concerns about the fairness and reliability of proceedings leading to his trial and conviction in 1977. These concerns have led the former US Attorney who supervised the prosecution team post-trial to call for clemency. Even without the serious additional serious factor of COVID-19, there remain deep concerns about Leonard Peltier’s deteriorating health.

Additional information  
Two US Supreme Court Justices noted in 2020 that in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, “inmates everywhere have been rendered vulnerable and often powerless to protect themselves from harm”, and in January 2021 a federal judge in Washington, DC pointed out that “Among the most susceptible to the spread of COVID-19 is the prison inmate population”. Leonard Peltier is held in federal prison in Florida (US Penitentiary Coleman I). He has said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged lockdowns and lack of a vaccine booster have left him feeling severely isolated and anxious about his health. On 13 January 2022, his lawyers again wrote to the Warden of USP Coleman I to seek a recommendation for Leonard Peltier’s release, a request they said had assumed “heightened urgency” with the appearance and spread throughout the prison complex of COVID-19, which “carries potentially deadly consequences for someone of Mr. Peltier’s age and medical conditions”. Leonard Peltier tested positive for COVID-19 on 28 January and was placed in quarantine for 10 days.    
Leonard Peltier, an Anishinaabe-Lakota Native American, was a member of the American Indian Movement (AIM), which promotes Native American rights. On 26 June 1975, during a confrontation involving AIM members on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota, two FBI agents were shot dead. Leonard Peltier was convicted of their murders in 1977 and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. Leonard Peltier has always denied killing the agents.   
A key alleged eyewitness to the shootings was Myrtle Poor Bear, a Lakota Native woman. Her statement that she saw Leonard Peltier kill both FBI agents led to his extradition from Canada, where he had fled. However, Myrtle Poor Bear later retracted her statement. She was not called as a prosecution witness at trial, but the trial judge refused to allow the defense to call her as a witness on the grounds that her testimony “could be highly prejudicial to the government”. In 2000, Myrtle Poor Bear said that her original statement was the result of months of threats and harassment from FBI agents.   
In 1980 documents were released to Leonard Peltier’s lawyers containing ballistics evidence which might have assisted his case, but which had been withheld by the prosecution at trial. However, in 1986, the US Court of Appeal for the Eighth Circuit denied a retrial, stating that: “We recognize that there is some evidence in this record of improper conduct on the part of some FBI agents, but we are reluctant to impute even further improprieties to them.”   
Leonard Peltier is not eligible for another parole hearing until 2024. To date, the US Parole Commission has denied him parole on the grounds that he did not accept criminal responsibility for the two murders. This is despite the Commission acknowledging that “the prosecution has conceded the lack of any direct evidence that you personally participated in the executions of two FBI agents”. In a letter to President Biden in July 2021, James H. Reynolds, the US Attorney whose office handled the prosecution and appeal of Leonard Peltier, urged the President to commute the sentence of a man “I helped to put behind bars”. He said that Leonard Peltier’s “conviction and continued incarceration is a testament to a time and a system of justice that no longer has a place in our society”. He urged the President to “chart a different path in the history of the government’s relationship with its Native people through a show of mercy rather than continued indifference”.   
Leonard Peltier has a variety of ailments, including kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, a heart condition, a degenerative joint disease, and constant shortness of breath and dizziness. A stroke in 1986 left him virtually blind in one eye. In January 2016, doctors diagnosed him with a life-threatening condition: a large and potentially fatal abdominal aortic aneurysm that could rupture at any time and would result in his death.   
Leonard Peltier was denied clemency by President George W. Bush in January 2009, and by President Barack Obama in January 2017. His attorney filed a new clemency petition before President Joe Biden in July 2021. A decision is still pending. On 26 January 2022, the Chairperson of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Brian Schatz, wrote to the President urging him to commute Leonard Peltier’s sentence, due to “(1) his old age and critical illness, (2) the amount of time he has already served, and (3) the unavailability of other remedies.” Senator Schatz commended the Biden administration’s “commitment to righting past wrongs in our criminal justice system” and urged commutation of Leonard Peltier’s sentence in keeping with this work for “a fair and constitutionally sound justice system”. In October 2021 eleven members of the US Congress called on President Biden to release him. In November 2021, Senator Patrick Leahy had also said that he supported Leonard Peltier’s release from prison.   
In 2015, several Nobel Peace Prize winners—including the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu—called for Leonard Peltier’s release. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the National Congress of American Indians have also called for his release. Due to the numerous issues at trial, the exhaustion of legal avenues for appeal, the amount of time he has already served, along with his chronic health issues, Amnesty International has long supported clemency for Leonard Peltier.

Jordanian national Abdullah Ibhais is serving a three-year prison sentence following an unfair trial in Qatar, that was based on his so-called confession which he claims was obtained coercively. On 15 December 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld his conviction on charges including misuse of public funds and reduced his prison sentence from five to three years.

Additional Information  
Abdullah Ibhais (36) is a Jordanian national and father of two boys, aged four and six. He is the former communications director for Qatar’s 2022 World Cup organizers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, a government body in charge of planning and delivering the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  
Officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and of the State Security arrested Abdullah Ibhais at his place of work on 12 November 2019. He was taken to the CID offices in Duhail, in northern Doha, the capital, and interrogated by State Security officers who denied him access to a lawyer despite his requests. Later that day, Abdullah Ibhais was taken to his home while CID officers searched his house and confiscated his electronic devices.  Nine days into his detention, Abdullah Ibhais was finally granted access to a lawyer. He was released on bail on 21 December 2019 pending trial. His case was transferred to another authority and no longer considered a matter of state security.  
The officers threatened Abdullah Ibhais with detention for six months without access to a lawyer or his family, physical abuse, and threatened his family’s safety and security should he refuse signing the pre-written “confession” presented to him, which he ultimately did. The next day, Abdullah Ibhais appeared before the State Security Prosecution where he denied the “confession” he had signed the previous day but was pressured again into signing the document. He was charged with misuse of public funds, bribery, collusion to commit bribery, and causing harm to the Supreme Committee.  
Abdullah Ibhais’s trial before a court of First Instance began in January 2020. Abdullah Ibhais retracted his “confession” claiming it was extracted under threat and coercion, and during interrogations that were held in the absence of a lawyer. The court did not investigate his claims and instead accepted the “confession” as evidence against him. After hearing four out of at least 10 witnesses, the judge halted the hearing sessions and refused to hear the defense in court and gave Abdullah Ibhais’s lawyer a few days to submit his defense in writing.  
On 29 April 2021 a court of First Instance convicted and sentenced him to five years in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of 150,000 Qatari riyals (US$41,197). He was arrested again on 15 November 2021, while awaiting the start of his appeal trial. He immediately went on hunger strike, which lasted for 30 days, in protest of his detention and lost 20 kgs. On 15 December 2021, the Qatari Court of Appeal upheld his conviction and reduced his prison sentence from five to three years. He is now appealing his case before the Court of Cassation. He remains held in Doha Central prison.  
Abdullah Ibhais’s trial was unfair as it was based on a “confession” that he told the judge was obtained through threat of violence and coercion. Both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal failed to investigate his allegations of coerced confession and instead accepted it as inculpatory evidence against him.

0,Amnesty International Canada Statement on “Freedom Convoy” Blockade,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/ottawa-protests-statement-11-feb-2022/,"OTTAWA – Amnesty International has been following with great concern the developments relating to the “Freedom Convoy” blockade in Ottawa.   “Amnesty International Canada is deeply troubled by the reports of violence, harassment, intimidation, and hate speech which have surfaced...","OTTAWA – Amnesty International has been following with great concern the developments relating to the “Freedom Convoy” blockade in Ottawa.   
“Amnesty International Canada is deeply troubled by the reports of violence, harassment, intimidation, and hate speech which have surfaced since January 29th,” said Amnesty International Canada Secretary General Ketty Nivyabandi. “Nazi flags, Confederate flags, and other symbols of racism and hate exhibited have no room in peaceful protests. Equally concerning is the affiliation of some of the Convoy organizers with overtly racist, white supremacist groups.” 
The failure of law enforcement agencies to respond swiftly and appropriately to reports of violence and harassment demands a prompt, thorough, and impartial public inquiry. The inquiry must also address instances of interference with residents’ rights to public health and social services delivery, as well as the harassment of healthcare workers, reporters, people living with disabilities, and racialized and other marginalized persons. 
“Authorities hold an equal international obligation to protect people from violence and harassment, and to respect the rights of all protesters to peaceful assembly and expression of their views. Violence and harassment however are not part of exercising the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Amnesty International calls on authorities to take immediate and appropriate action to facilitate peaceful protests, while investigating and holding those perpetrating violence or inciting hate to account,” added Nivyabandi. 
Throughout the demonstrations, racialized workers and residents have reported being singled out for abuse. Over 400 hate messages are under investigation by the Ottawa Police. Frontline services have expressed concern about the impact of the ongoing demonstration on their ability to provide to already vulnerable clients. People with disabilities have reported disruptions and delays in receiving supportive care, given ongoing street blockages by demonstrators. Journalists experienced threats and harassment, both online and while reporting from the demonstration zone. Until a recent court injunction, residents were subjected to almost continuous high-decibel noise levels, including honking, air horns, train whistles, street parties and fireworks since the demonstration began at the end of January. 
The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, Algonquins of Pikwakanagan, the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council, and Kitigan Zibi Anishinabeg have also expressed concerns about the misuse and appropriation of sacred, traditional objects and ceremonies. 
Further, Amnesty International Canada notes with great concern the permissive response afforded by the Ottawa Police to a largely white-dominant protest group. This response is in sharp contrast with how law enforcement authorities have mistreated Indigenous and racialized protesters in the past. 
“Amnesty International Canada expresses solidarity with the frontline organizations, including homeless and women’s shelters whose operations have been impacted by these protests, as well as 2SLGBTQI+ and racialized communities – particularly Jewish, Muslim, Black and Indigenous communities – who have been targeted by hate propaganda,” said Nivyabandi. 
Further Background on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly 
Peaceful protests are a fundamental part of a vibrant society. The right to freedom of peaceful assembly is a vital means of political engagement, with a long history of being a valid and effective means of bringing issues and grievances to light. Facilitating and protecting the right to freedom of assembly contributes to the protection of other human rights, including freedom of expression. 
The right to hold assemblies and demonstrations on public roads has been consistently upheld by regional and international human rights bodies, which have established that urban space is not only an area for circulation but also a space for participation. The UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association has affirmed that “the free flow of traffic should not automatically take precedence over freedom of peaceful assembly.” However, these rights are not unlimited. They can be restricted in order to protect the rights of others, public order and public health. The UN Human Rights Committee has said that “an assembly that remains peaceful but which nevertheless causes a high level of disruption, such as the extended blocking of traffic, may be dispersed, as a rule, only if the disruption is ‘serious and sustained’.” In any case, the onus is on the authorities to justify any restrictions. 
Under international human rights law, states also have the obligation to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination, including in the enjoyment of the right to security of the person and protection by the State against violence. The UN Human Rights Committee clearly stated that “… peaceful assemblies may not be used for propaganda for war (…) or advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence (…). As far as possible, action should be taken in such cases against the individual perpetrators, rather than against the assembly as a whole.” 
Amnesty International has produced reports outlining good practices on the policing of assemblies, as well as guidelines on the use of force by law enforcement officials.

0,Submission to the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on the Militarization of Indigenous Lands,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uncategorized/submission-to-the-expert-mechanism-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples-on-the-militarization-of-indigenous-lands/,Submission to the UN Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Poeples,"On February 7, Amnesty International Canada proudly supported a submission by Gidimt’en land defenders to the United Nations Human Rights Council’s Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on the “Militarization of Wet’suwet’en Lands and Canada’s Ongoing Violations”. 
Read the submission 
Read the press release from Gidimt’en Checkpoint 
The Expert Mechanism provides the Human Rights Council with expertise and advice on the rights of Indigenous peoples and carries out studies to advance the protection of Indigenous peoples’ rights. It recently issued a call for submissions for consideration in its report to the Human Rights Council on the militarization of Indigenous lands. 
Article 30.1 of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples (UNDRIP) states that ‘military activities shall not take place on the lands or territories of Indigenous peoples, unless justified by a relevant public interest or otherwise freely agreed with or requested by the Indigenous peoples concerned”. 
The Expert Mechanism will consider a number of issues in its study, such as: what types of militarization occur on Indigenous lands throughout the world, the conditions that lead to militarization of Indigenous peoples’ lands, potential conflicts that could bring about increased militarization, how Indigenous peoples’ laws and customs – as well as international and national law – might facilitate peaceful resolution of conflict, and ways to facilitate constructive dialogue between States and Indigenous peoples. 
Gidimt’en Hereditary Chiefs argue in their submission that the forced industrialization and police militarization of Wet’suwet’en land is a violation of Canada’s international obligations as outlined in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The submission documents the ways Canada has violated Wet’suwet’en rights to traditional territory (Article 26); life, liberty and security (Article 7); to govern their territories and to free, prior and informed consent (Articles 19, 32); to protect and conserve their lands (Article 29); to not be forcibly removed from their lands and territories (Article 10); and finally, to determine their own development priorities (Article 23). 
The submission also examines the impact of industrialization – in this instance, the construction and operation of a fossil fuel pipeline – on Indigenous women, girls, Trans, and two-spirit people and the ways in which extractives projects lead to increased gendered violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
The submission concludes by re-asserting that Canada and British Columbia must withdraw the RCMP and associated security forces from the territory, halt construction and suspend all permits related to Coastal Gaslink’s pipeline project. And it urges relevant UN Bodies to conduct a field visit to the territory. 
The Expert Mechanism will introduce its report on the militarization of Indigenous lands during its annual session in July 2022; the final report will be presented to the Human Rights Council at its fifty-first session in September 2022.

Beatrice and Croc Harry is a novel for children and adults about a young girl who awakens alone with amnesia in a massive forest, where every conceivable fish, bird, mammal and reptile coexist. She has no idea who she is. She doesn’t even know her last name, or that she is Black.  
Beatrice forms a tempestuous friendship with a natural predator — a 700-pound, fast-talking crocodile named Harry. Perhaps he can help assemble her lost identity. Together, they embark on a journey that they hope will lead Beatrice home, even though she doesn’t know what or where home is.   
Using playful language and a comic touch, the novel explores themes of identity, the courage to confront injustice, and the possibility that perpetrators of injustice and those who have been harmed might find themselves in a place of healing and respect.

Today the sentencing court in Trujillo, in the department of Colón, northern Honduras, found six of the eight prisoners of conscience known as the “Guapinol eight”, José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández, guilty of the crimes of illegal deprivation of liberty and aggravated damages against the contractor of the company Inversiones Los Pinares (ILP), and simple and aggravated damages against ILP. The sentences will be determined on 21 February. The other defendants Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz were acquitted and should be released immediately.  
“This verdict is outrageous and goes against Honduras’ obligations to guarantee the right to defend human rights. It must be overturned immediately. We will not stop demanding this of the authorities until all of the Guapinol defenders are immediately and unconditionally released.” 
  
“It’s extremely serious that, despite the lack of diligence in the investigations by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, six of the Guapinol prisoners of conscience are facing prison sentences,” added Amnesty International Americas director Erika Guevara-Rosas. “The defenders are victims of arbitrary detention and unfounded criminal prosecution, stemming solely from their legitimate work defending the right to water and a healthy environment in Honduras.”  
“The Honduran authorities must stop using the justice system to criminalize, intimidate and harass human rights defenders.”  
Further information  
Amnesty International recognized the eight defenders as prisoners of conscience after reviewing the available evidence, including the criminal proceedings against the Guapinol eight and videos related to the case, and having spoken to witnesses as well as the Honduran human rights community.    
The organization sent a letter to the Honduran Attorney General after the trial began on 1 December 2021, expressing concern about serious irregularities in the investigation and prosecution of the Guapinol eight. Amnesty International believes that the eight prisoners of conscience were detained solely for their work defending the right to clean water and a healthy environment, and that the criminal charges against them, as well as their prolonged pre-trial detention, are unjustified and constitute a misuse of the justice system.

On 20 January, Zarema Musaeva, mother of a human rights lawyer from Chechnya (North Caucasus), was abducted from her apartment in Nizhnii Novgorod (Central Russia) by at least seven men. They spoke Chechen and drove vehicles with Chechen number plates. Later, Chechen authorities confirmed she was in their custody but refused her lawyers permission to see her. Zarema Musaeva has committed no crime and must be immediately released.  
Zarema Musaeva was abducted on 20 January 2022, from her home in Nizhnii Novgorod by men who were later confirmed to be Chechen officials. On 21 January Chechen authorities reported that Zarema Musaeva was serving 15 days of administrative detention for “petty hooliganism”. She suffers a serious medical condition, which should preclude her administrative detention under Russian law, and she reportedly does not have access to vital medicines. She has been held incommunicado and her lawyers have been denied access to her, ostensibly because she refused their services. On 2 February, media reported that she had been detained on remand, initially for two months, on fabricated charges of using violence against a police officer, a crime punishable by up to 10 years’ imprisonment.   
For years, Zarema Musaeva’s next of kin have faced reprisals from the Chechen authorities. One of her sons complained of secret imprisonment and torture in 2015 – 2016 and of subsequent unfounded criminal prosecution. Her husband, federal judge Saydi Yangulbaev, was forced to resign in 2015 and subjected to an unlawful house search, and her oldest son, human rights lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev received anonymous threats. On 21 January 2022, Head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov publicly threatened that the right “place” for members of their family was “either in prison or in the ground”.   
Zarema Musaeva has committed no crime and is unlawfully deprived of her liberty by the Chechen authorities in retaliation for her family members’ revelations about the abuses they had suffered and for their activism.

Additional Information:  
In December 2021, human rights lawyer Abubakar Yangulbaev reported that 21 of his relatives in Chechnya were abducted by members of local authorities, placed in secret detention and subjected to ill-treatment and threats – alongside dozens of members of other families, mostly relatives of exiled critics of the Chechen authorities. While most of Abubakar Yangulbayev’s family members were released, two of them remain in police custody. In January, he reported that other family members were similarly abducted. There is no reliable information on these events, including the identity and fate of all those concerned. In December 2021, Abubakar Yangulbaev himself was briefly detained in Pyatigorsk (North Caucasus), interrogated as a witness in a criminal case concerning “justification of terrorism” (Article 205.2 of the Russian Criminal Code) and released.   
On 20 January, his mother, Zarema Musaeva, was apprehended by the Chechen police in Nizhnii Novgorod, Central Russia, where she was living with her husband, retired federal judge Saydi Yangulbaev and their daughter. At least seven men, who were speaking Chechen and were driving vehicles with Chechen registration number plates, came to their apartment and forcibly took her away under a false pretext that she needed to testify as a witness in a criminal case. A video captured by CCTV cameras has since been published, which shows her being taken into a snowy street wearing no winter coat and no shoes. The men forced her into a car and drove away.   
Zarema Musaeva’s fate and whereabouts were unknown until the following day when Chechen authorities confirmed that she was in their custody. They claimed she attacked a police officer and was given 15 days of administrative detention for “petty hooliganism”. Later, media reported that Zarema Musaeva stood accused of using violence against police officers and would face criminal charges.   
Zarema Musaeva suffers from diabetes and requires medications and specialist healthcare which, under Russian law, should exempt her from administrative detention. When she was apprehended, the police did not allow to take her insulin and other medication with her. There is no reliable information on whether she receives medication and adequate healthcare in detention. The lawyers who have been hired by her family and Abubakar Yangulbaev’s colleagues, have been unlawfully refused permission to see her. On 29 January, a member of Chechen police showed them a letter purportedly written and signed by Zarema Musaeva which stated that she was refusing their services and that she refused to be involved in any investigative activities or other procedural actions because of her poor health.   
On 21 January, Head of the Chechen Republic Ramzan Kadyrov issued an explicit death threat via his social media channel on the Telegram against Abubakar Yangulbaev’s family who he accused of “deeply hurting the honour” of the Chechens.  
Over the years, the Chechen authorities have targeted their critics as well as their exiled critics’ relatives and forced them to issue apologies to the Chechen leadership on camera or subjected them to other reprisals. In 2020, moderator of 1ADAT, a popular Telegram channel critical of the Chechen authorities, Salman Tepsurkaev (who was 19 years old at the time), was abducted by unknown persons believed to be Chechen law enforcement officers and later appeared in a video published on the Internet where he is seen making such apologies and is seen being subjected to sexual violence. There has since been no news of his fate and whereabouts. In October, the ECtHR found Russia responsible for his arbitrary, unacknowledged detention and torture, and for the failure to effectively investigate his torture (https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-212397).

With at least 20 human rights defenders and four journalists killed across the region in January, the first month of 2022 has demonstrated once again the dangers of defending human rights and journalism in Latin America, said Amnesty International today. 
“The killing of 20 human rights defenders and four journalists in just one month is alarming and paints a frightening picture of what the year may hold for those who speak out for human rights in the Americas if states do not take urgent action to reverse this trend,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
“We must build a future where defending human rights in this continent does not mean risking one’s life. It is imperative that states take urgent measures to guarantee a safe and conducive space for the defence of human rights and independent journalism in the region, and that these cease to be lethal activities.” 
The killings have occurred precisely in the countries considered most dangerous for the defence of human rights in previous years: 13 in Colombia, three in Brazil and three in Honduras, while one human rights defender and four journalists have been killed in Mexico, the most lethal country on the continent for practicing journalism. Of the 20 human rights defenders killed, 18 were involved in defending human rights related to access to land and the protection of territories and the environment. 
Our region remains the most dangerous for the defense of human rights and independent journalism because human rights defenders and journalists threaten the political and economic interests of a few while states remain apathetic and negligent in the face of the violence they face 
“States have an obligation to investigate the killings in a prompt, thorough, independent and impartial manner, and with a primary line of investigation that considers the work of human rights defenders or journalistic work. Eliminating impunity in these cases is crucial to achieving a safe environment for defending human rights and sending a clear message that these acts will not be tolerated,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Honduras 
On 9 January, two unidentified men killed Pablo Isabel Hernández, an Indigenous leader, social communicator, and human rights and environmental defender, while he was on his way to a church in the municipality of San Marcos de Caiquín, department of Lempira. According to the Committee of Relatives of the Detained/Disappeared of Honduras, Pablo had been the victim of multiple threats for his human rights work, in particular for his reports on the community radio station where he worked. 
The following day, Thalía Rodriguez, a trans human rights defender, was killed in Tegucigalpa. Thalía carried out her activism through several organizations, including Asociación Kukulcán, Cattrachas, Colectivo Violeta and Cozumel Trans, among others, raising awareness of human rights, leading self-help groups and promoting labour alternatives to sex work for transgender women. 
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that on 22 January, Melvin Geovany Mejía, a territorial defender and member of the Tolupán Indigenous community, was found dead with gunshot wounds in the municipality of Morazán, department of Yoro. 
Colombia 
According to the Institute for Development and Peace Studies (Instituto de Estudios para el Desarrollo y la Paz), 13 human rights defenders were killed in Colombia in January, all of them linked to the defence of land, territory and the environment. In addition, the Institute has documented thirteen massacres resulting in the deaths of 40 people living in rural areas in Colombia. 
One of the defenders killed was Luz Marina Arteaga. Her body was found on 17 January, after she had been missing for five days. Luz Marina was a well-known defender of the rights of campesino communities in the department of Meta. Amnesty International had visited her home in the municipality of Puerto Gaitán in 2019. On that occasion, Luz Marina mentioned that the situation in the area was complex due to historical neglect by the state, which resulted in the invasion of Indigenous and campesino territories by illegal armed groups, contributing to a series of threats and attacks on social leaders in Meta. 
The National Protection Unit had granted Luz Marina protective measures since April 2019. However, the measures granted were mostly of a material nature and did not reduce the risk she faced. In October 2019 Luz Marina reported threats against her to the Public Prosecutor’s office and in 2020 she informed the National Protection Unit that one of the measures was not culturally appropriate for the region she lived in. 
On 24 January, the Defence of Life and Human Rights Network (Tejido de Defensa de la Vida y los Derechos Humanos, TDVD) reported the killing of Albeiro Camayo Güetio, former regional coordinator of the Indigenous Guard in the Las Delicias reservation, municipality of Buenos Aires, in Cauca. According to information from the TDVD, Albeiro Camayo was killed when suspected members of a paramilitary group shot at the community after the Indigenous Guard had expelled them from the territory. 
Amnesty International has reported on the failed prevention and protection policies that contribute to an unsafe environment for the protection of human rights defenders in Colombia.  
“The protection of Indigenous, campesino and Afro-descendant communities in Colombia is ineffective because it does not address the structural causes of violence and often occurs without the proper participation of those at risk. Defenders of communities at risk are constantly unprotected, and threats, attacks and killings are constant in the country considered the most dangerous in the world for defending human rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
Brazil 
On 9 January, the bodies of three members of the same family known for releasing turtle hatchlings and for defending the land and environmental protection were found in San Francisco do Xingú, Pará state. On 14 January, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPF) stated that the events took place in a context of repeated attacks on environmentalists and human rights defenders in the country. The MPF also requested information from the Military Police on the measures taken for the protection of the victims’ families, as well as other human rights defenders in the region. 
Mexico 
The journalists José Luis Gamboa Arenas, Lourdes Maldonado, Alfonso Margarito Martínez Esquivel and Roberto Toledo were killed in January. Amnesty International believes that journalism can only be practised freely in an environment free from threats, physical, psychological or moral aggression, or other acts of intimidation and harassment. The Mexican government must take concrete, prompt and effective measures to guarantee the lives and safety of journalists in Mexico, as well as to investigate these killings. 
On 27 January, human rights defender Ana Luisa Garduño was killed in Temixco, Morelos. Ana Luisa was fighting for justice for the feminicide of her daughter. Amnesty International has shown that Mexico is a dangerous country for families seeking justice in cases of feminicide. 
“Our region remains the most dangerous for the defence of human rights and independent journalism because human rights defenders and journalists threaten the political and economic interests of a few while states remain apathetic and negligent in the face of the violence they face. It is time to act, otherwise lives will continue to be lost, lives that are essential for building an equal and just region where human rights are a reality,” concluded Erika Guevara-Rosas.

After two months on trial in Tocoa, northern Honduras, against the eight prisoners of conscience, José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández, Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz, known as “the Guapinol eight”, the Public Prosecutor’s Office and the legal teams of the eight defenders and the company Inversiones Los Pinares (ILP) are due to present their conclusions on 4 February. The court is expected to issue a sentence immediately afterwards. 
“The Guapinol eight should not spend one more day in prison, as the available evidence has shown us that they stand accused of crimes they did not commit. They are victims of arbitrary detention and unfounded criminal prosecution stemming solely from their human rights work. The Public Prosecutor’s Office must not only drop the charges against them and call for their immediate release, but also carry out an independent, impartial and thorough investigation to identify and bring all those responsible for violating their human rights to justice,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International. 
The unjust imprisonment of the Guapinol eight for more than two years is a clear attempt to criminalize and intimidate those who legitimately defend the right to water and a healthy environment in Honduras 
Amnesty International is today publishing a letter it sent to the Attorney General of Honduras, Oscar Fernando Chinchilla, on 11 December 2021. In the letter, the organization expressed its concerns about serious irregularities in the investigation and prosecution of the Guapinol eight, concluding that the criminal charges against them, as well as their prolonged pre-trial detention, were unjustified and constitute a misuse of the justice system. To date, Amnesty International has not received a response to the recommendations contained in the letter. 
“The unjust imprisonment of the Guapinol eight for more than two years is a clear attempt to criminalize and intimidate those who legitimately defend the right to water and a healthy environment in Honduras.

Tunisian parliamentarian Yassine Ayari’s trial is set to begin on 14 February before the Military Court of First Instance in Tunis. He is being prosecuted in relation to Facebook posts in which he described President Saied’s concentration of exceptional powers as a “coup.” In July 2021 he was arrested and spent two months in Mornaguia prison for a case dating back to 2018, after the President’s decision on 25 July 2021 to suspend parliament and lift parliamentary immunity for its members. Amnesty International calls for the charges against Yassine Ayari to be dropped and for an end to the prosecution of civilians before military courts.

Additional Information: 
Yassine Ayari was arrested on 30 July 2021, three days after the suspension of parliament and ordered the lifting of parliamentary immunity, to serve a two-month sentence issued by a military court in 2018 for his Facebook posts criticizing the army. He was released on 22 September 2021 but is now facing a new trial, due to start on 14 February, in a case brought against him by the samemilitary court for Facebook posts he wrote on 25, 26, 27 and 28 July 2021. In those posts Yassine Ayari criticized Your Excellency’s assumption of exceptional powers, calling it a “coup”. 
He is being prosecuted under Articles 67 and 128 of the Penal Code. which mandate prison terms and fines for “offense against the head of state” and for “accusing a state official of illegal acts in the course for carrying their duty without offering proof”, respectively. He is also being prosecuted under Article 91 of the Military Code of Justice, which mandates up to three years of imprisonment for actsthat “insult the army, harm military discipline or morale, or criticize the decisions of military leadership or undermine its dignity, and for the unauthorized disclosure of information on military affairs”. 
Yassine Ayari is being tried and may be imprisoned for exercising his right to freedom of expression and expressing his opinions online. His political criticism is protected under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Tunisia has ratified. Amnesty International is concerned that at least nine other civilians are being investigated or prosecuted by military courts in Tunisia for a range of offences, including four -Yassine Ayari among them – who are facing the military justice system for expressing views critical of the President. 
Yassine Ayari, a 40-year-old engineer who opposed President Ben Ali’s rule, was elected as a member of parliament in the 2018 partial elections representing Tunisians living in Germany. He was reelected in 2019 under his political party, Hope and Work, this time representing Tunisians living in France. After leaving Tunisia in 2010, Yassine Ayari spent eight years in exile working as an engineerin Belgium and France. In 2017, he published a Facebook post in which he criticized former President Beji Caid Essebsi and his use of the army to “repress the population”. In 2018, a military court found him guilty of “defaming the army” and sentenced him to two months imprisonment. 
On 25 July 2021, after President Kais Saied announced the freezing of parliament and the lifting of parliamentary immunity, Yassine Ayari published several Facebook posts where he strongly criticized the President. In his online posts, which Amnesty International reviewed, Yassine Ayari fiercely criticized what he considered an abuse of power by the President, calling the 25 July 2021 decision tosuspend the parliament “a military coup with foreign planning and coordination,” and using words such as “Pharaoh” and “silly” to characterize the President. On 30 July 2021, at least 30 police officers in civilian clothes raided Yassine Ayari’s home without showing an arrest warrant and took him to an unknown destination. His brother told Amnesty International that the family later learned that hehad been taken to serve the 2018 two-month sentence pronounced by the Tunis military court for a Facebook post considered as defamatory of the army. The military court ordered his arrest after the lifting of immunity of all members of parliament, ordered by President Saied on 25 July 2021, at the same time as the suspension of parliament. 
Since President Saied assumed new powers on 25 July 2021, there has been an increasing pattern of referral of civilians, including a journalist, a blogger and opposition politicians, before military courts. The military justice system has begun investigating or prosecuting at least 10 other civilians. Prosecutions for “insulting” the army, the President or other state institutions are not recognizable crimes under international law and therefore incompatible with Tunisia’s obligations under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors implementation of the covenant, issued guidance on the free speech obligations of governments under Article 19 that emphasized the high value that the ICCPR places upon uninhibited expression “in circumstances of public debate concerning public figures in the political domain and public institutions,” adding that, “State parties should not prohibit criticism of institutions, such as the army or the administration.” 
Allowing the prosecution of a civilian before a military tribunal is a violation of the right to a fair trial and due process guarantees. Guidance in 2003 on fair trials according to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights states that “[t]he purpose of Military Courts shall be to determine offenses of a purely military nature committed by military personnel.” 
Military courts played a key role in the repressive apparatus of the state under the presidencies of Habib Bourguiba, 1957-1987, and Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, 1987-2011. Under both presidents, persons were convicted in blatantly unfair trials before military courts for political crimes. While they underwent a partial reform following Tunisia’s uprising, military courts remain under the undue control of the executive branch as the President of the Republic has ultimate control over the appointment of judges in these courts. In addition, both the general prosecutor who heads the military justice system, as well as all prosecutors in the military courts, who play a pivotal role ininitiating proceedings, are serving members of the military, subject to military discipline, which places them under the direct orders of the executive branch.

The report sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law.   
The government of Israel has an obligation under international law to dismantle this system of apartheid, and to repeal or amend all laws, regulations, policies, and practices that discriminate on racial, ethnic, or religious grounds to bring them into line with international human rights law and standards.   
Amnesty’s human rights concerns have always been directed at the policies, laws, and actions of the government of Israel, not the Jewish people. It is crucial not to conflate legitimate criticism of crimes under international law committed by the government of Israel with antisemitism. To do so is inaccurate and dangerous.

Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued a policy of establishing and maintaining a Jewish demographic hegemony and maximizing its control over land to benefit Jewish Israelis while restricting the rights of Palestinians and preventing Palestinian refugees from returning to their homes. In 1967, Israel extended this policy to the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which it has occupied ever since.Amnesty International has analysed Israel’s intent to create and maintain a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians and examined its key components: territorial fragmentation; segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and denial of economic and social rights. It has concluded that this system amounts to apartheid. It has also documented unlawful acts committed by Israel against Palestinians with the intent to maintain this system, including forcible transfers, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings, denial of basic rights and freedoms and persecution. It has concluded that such acts form part of a systematic as well as widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population and amount to the crime against humanity of apartheid.Israel must dismantle this cruel system and the international community must pressure it to do so. All those with jurisdiction over the crimes committed to maintain the system should investigate them.

1. Many other NGOs have used the term apartheid to describe Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. How is Amnesty’s report different?  
Amnesty has concluded that Israeli authorities are enforcing a system of apartheid against all Palestinians living under their effective control – whether they live in Israel, the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), or in other countries as refugees. Our report provides new evidence of the institutionalized nature of Israel’s oppression of Palestinians, and of how Israeli laws and policies are designed specifically to deprive Palestinians of their rights. 
There is a growing body of work on the question of apartheid by Palestinian, Israeli and international human rights organizations, as well as lawyers, writers and academics. This includes recent research by Israeli human rights organizations Yesh Din and B’Tselem, as well as Human Rights Watch, who have contributed to a spectrum of analysis within the legal framework of apartheid. Human Rights Watch found that the Israeli government has demonstrated an intent to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians across Israel and the OPT. Yesh Din reached this conclusion in the West Bank, specifically. B’Tselem found that Israel is maintaining a system of apartheid over Palestinians in the OPT as well asPalestinians living within its own borders. 
2. Why is Amnesty issuing this report now? 
Amnesty International adopted a global policy on the human rights violation and crime of apartheid in 2017, following recognition that we had given insufficient attention to situations of systematic discrimination and oppression around the world. This has enabled us to examine potential situations of apartheid globally on a consistent basis. For example, in 2017, we released a report which found that the Myanmar government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid. 
For too long, the international community has side-lined human rights when dealing with the question of Israel and the Palestinians. Palestinians experiencing the brutality of Israel’s repression have been calling for an understanding of Israel’s rule as apartheid for over two decades. Over time, a broader international recognition of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid has begun to take shape. These are some of the reasons we took the decision to initiate an investigation into the potential crime of apartheid in Israel and the OPT. 
3. What difference does it make to call the situation “apartheid”?  
Apartheid is both an international wrong and a crime against humanity. When a crime against humanity is committed, the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account. We hope that by shedding more light on Israel’s discriminatory system of domination over the Palestinian people, we will intensify efforts to dismantle the harmful policies and practices that prevent Palestinians from living with equal rights and dignity. This can only be achieved when the international community holds the Israeli government and other complicit parties accountable. 
4.  What evidence is this report based on? 
Amnesty carried out research and analysis for this report between July 2017 and November 2021. We extensively analysed relevant Israeli legislation, regulations, military orders, governmental directives and statements by government and military officials. We reviewed official and publicly available documents, such as Israeli parliamentary archives, planning and zoning documents and plans, government budgets and Israeli court judgments. 
We analysed Amnesty’s decades of documentation of human rights violations in Israel and the OPT, as well as reporting by UN agencies and human rights organizations, against the apartheid framework. For the case studies featured in the report, Amnesty conducted dozens of interviews with Palestinian communities in Israel and the OPT between February 2020 and July 2021. 
We also consulted numerous representatives of Palestinian, Israeli and international NGOs, as well as UN agencies, academics, and legal experts and practitioners. We sought the advice of external experts on international law before and during our research and legal analysis. In addition, experts with specialist knowledge of the question of apartheid in international law reviewed the written legal argument and conclusions in the draft report. 
5. What is apartheid?  
Apartheid is a violation of public international law, a grave human rights violation and a crime against humanity. It can be seen as both a system (formed of laws, policies and practices), and a crime (specific acts). 
It is easier to explain apartheid as a system by first looking at definitions of the crime of apartheid. These are set out in the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid (Apartheid Convention) and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute). 
These treaties define apartheid as a crime against humanity, committed when any ‘inhuman’ or ‘inhumane’ act is perpetrated in the context of an ‘institutionalized regime’ of systematic ‘oppression’ and ‘domination’ by one racial group over another, with the intent to maintain that system. Inhuman/inhumane acts include unlawful killing and serious injury, torture, forcible transfer, persecution, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms. 
The definitions set out in the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention are not identical. Our report explains in detail how the elements of each treaty apply to the situation in Israel and the OPT. 
To identify the crime of apartheid, it is necessary to show that a system of oppression and domination is in place. Drawing on interpretations by legal experts, Amnesty considers this to mean the systematic, prolonged, and cruel discriminatory treatment by one racial group of members over another, with the intention to control the second group. 
6. Where does international law mention a system of apartheid? 
The 1965 international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) was the first international human rights law instrument to proscribe apartheid. It does not explicitly define apartheid but condemns “governmental policies based on racial superiority or hatred, such as policies of apartheid, segregation or separation.” 
The public international law prohibition of apartheid is best found in an advisory opinion by the International Court of Justice relating to South Africa’s presence in Namibia, where the violation is defined as “distinctions, exclusions, restrictions and limitations exclusively based on grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin which constitute a denial of fundamental human rights.” 
When applying these definitions in our report, we also considered the references in international criminal law to regimes of oppression and domination. Under international human rights law and public international law, states are prohibited from establishing and maintaining regimes (or systems) of oppression and domination by one racial group over another. 
7. Has Amnesty ever concluded that apartheid is taking place elsewhere?  
Yes. In 2017, Amnesty released a report which found that the Myanmar government subjects the Rohingya people to a system of apartheid. 
It is important to note that systems of oppression and domination will never be identical, and our report does not seek to draw comparisons or analogies between the treatment of Palestinians and the Rohingya people. 
Similarly, although the international community began using the term apartheid in response to the political system in South Africa, the conventions and treaties that condemn, prohibit, and criminalize apartheid are drafted in a universal manner. Our report does not argue that the system of apartheid enforced by Israel is the same or comparable to the situation in South Africa between 1948 and the mid-1990s. Instead, it analyzes Israel’s systematic discrimination against Palestinians against definitions of apartheid in international law. 
8. Why do you refer to Jewish people and Palestinians as “racial groups”?  
It is not Amnesty’s place to decide what constitutes a racial group. Our analysis in this report is based on how the term “racial group” is used within the apartheid framework in international law: as a subjective concept, dependent on the dominant group’s perception of the other group. In a system of apartheid, the perpetrator of the crime treats the dominated racial group as being different and inferior on account of particular physical and/or cultural attributes. 
Jewish Israelis and Palestinians self-identify as different groups. Crucially, as our report shows, Israeli law treats Palestinians as an inferior and separate group defined by their racialized non-Jewish, Arab status. This was made explicit in the 2018 Nation State Law, which declares that “Israel is the nation state of the Jewish people,” and that “the right of self-determination in the State of Israel is exclusive to the Jewish people.” This law does not recognize any other national identity despite Palestinians comprising 19% of the population within Israel. Israeli law thus establishes a superior “Jewish nationality” status that is distinct from citizenship. 
9. How does Israel’s treatment of Palestinians amount to apartheid?  
Since Israel was established in 1948, its policies and legislation have been shaped by an overarching objective: to maintain a Jewish demographic majority and maximize Jewish Israeli control over land at the expense of Palestinians. 
In order to achieve this, successive governments have deliberately imposed a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians. The key components of this system are: territorial fragmentation; segregation and control; dispossession of land and property; and denial of economic and social rights. 
Some examples of this system in practice are: 
10. The Apartheid Convention mentions “inhumane acts” as one of its criteria. What inhumane acts has Israel committed?  
Israeli authorities systematically subject Palestinians to many of the acts identified as inhuman or inhumane by the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute. 
For this report, Amnesty examined: acts of forcible transfer; administrative detention and torture; unlawful killings and serious injuries; the denial of basic rights and freedoms; or persecution committed against the Palestinian population in Israel and the OPT associated with the system of discriminatory laws, policies, and practices. 
We found that these constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid because they are committed in a context of systematic oppression and domination, and with the intent to maintain that system. 
For example, in the OPT, Israeli forces regularly resort to lethal force to stifle protests by Palestinians calling for their rights to be respected. During the Great March of Return along the Israel/Gaza border, a series of mass weekly protests against the blockade and the exclusion of Palestinian refugees, Israeli forces killed 214 civilians, including 46 children, and injured more than 8,000 others. 
11. Have Palestinian citizens of Israel also been subjected to “inhumane acts”?  
Amnesty acknowledges that inhuman or inhumane acts inside Israel occur to a lesser degree and in a far less violent manner than in the OPT. However, our report documents violations inside Israel which amount to inhumane acts and, in the context of the wider system of domination and oppression of Palestinians, crimes against humanity of apartheid. 
For example, Israeli authorities have carried out repeated home demolitions and forced evictions against Bedouin Palestinians in the Negev/Naqab region, amounting to forcible transfer. 
Under the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute, inhuman/inhumane acts can include systemic violations as well as inherently violent ones. In its list of acts which can constitute the crime of apartheid, the Apartheid Convention includes: 
“…measures calculated to prevent a racial group or groups from participation in the political, social, economic and cultural life of the country” and the deliberate creation of conditions preventing their full development by denying them “basic human rights and freedoms, including the right to work, the right to form recognized trade unions, the right to education, the right to leave and to return to their country, the right to a nationality, the right to freedom of movement and residence, the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.”Some of the inhumane acts documented within Israel include: 
Our report considers the legally mandated nature of many of these inhuman and inhumane acts, and the failure of Israeli courts to provide remedies or to end these violations. 
The discriminatory treatment of Palestinian citizens of Israel is crucial to understanding Israel’s system of oppression and domination over Palestinians. The crime of apartheid does not, however, require that all members of a racial group are consistently subjected to inhumane acts; the key element is that these acts take place within the wider system. 
12. Palestinian citizens of Israel have many more rights than their counterparts in the OPT – how can you say they are subject to the same system?  
Our report acknowledges those differences. While there are Palestinian citizens of Israel who serve in the Israeli parliament and other branches of government, or who may be fortunate enough to excel in their professions, this does not negate our finding that a system of oppression and domination extends to Palestinians living within Israel’s borders. We have outlined examples of such systematic discrimination in the answers to the above question. 
It’s also important to recognize that the geographical fragmentation of the Palestinian people is itself a foundational element of the apartheid system. In Israel, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, as well as in refugee communities, Israel operates interconnected administrative and legal systems of control over Palestinians. Looking at these areas separately misses the full picture. 
The Israeli government’s differential treatment of Jewish Israelis and Palestinians knows no borders. For example, Israel extends full protections and services to Jewish Israelis living in illegal settlements in the OPT, while depriving Palestinians in these areas of fundamental human rights.13. Do your findings apply to Palestinians who are now citizens of other countries, after initially arriving there as refugees?  
Yes. Israel denies Palestinian refugees outside Israel and the OPT the right to citizenship and prevents them from returning to their homes. This is a serious violation of their right to leave and to return to their country, their right to a nationality, and their right to freedom of movement and residence. The exclusion of Palestinian refugees is crucial for Israel’s demographic objectives. 
When committed with the intention of controlling the Palestinian population as a whole, these violations contribute to maintaining the system of oppression and domination, and amount to inhuman/inhumane acts that fit the apartheid criteria. 
14. Why do you conclude that Israel is maintaining apartheid rule over Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip when they are governed by Palestinian authorities? 
The Fatah-led Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and the Hamas de facto administration in the Gaza Strip operate under Israel’s military occupation. Israel retains effective control over these territories, including the Palestinian population living there, their natural resources and, with the exception of Gaza’s short southern border with Egypt, their land and sea borders and airspace.  In some areas of the West Bank and Gaza, Palestinian authority is extremely limited – for example where there are Israeli settlements or checkpoints restricting movement. 
15. Does Amnesty condemn human rights violations by Palestinian authorities, too?  
Yes. Though not the subject of this report, Amnesty has consistently documented serious violations by the Palestinian authorities in the West Bank and Gaza. We routinely report on and condemn unlawful attacks by Palestinian armed groups against Israeli civilians. This includes the firing of indiscriminate rockets from Gaza into Israel, which we called for the International Criminal Court to investigate as war crimes. 
We have also documented human rights violations against Palestinians by Palestinian authorities, including torture, arbitrary detention, restrictions on freedom of expression, and excessive use of force against protesters. 
16.  Supporters of the Israeli government have accused Amnesty in the past of “singling out Israel.” How do you respond to those allegations?  
Amnesty documents human rights violations by governments all over the world, including Palestinian authorities, and we apply the same standards and policies when assessing the human rights records of all states. A brief glance at our Middle East North Africa page demonstrates our attention to rights violations happening throughout the region. 
Many states would rather not have their human rights violations exposed. In our experience, it is very common for states to try to divert attention away from our findings with accusations of bias, especially if they have no substantive response to the evidence of violations. 
17. Doesn’t Israel put the policies you have documented in place to counter security threats?  
Like all countries, Israel has the right – and indeed an obligation under international law – to protect all people under its control, and to ensure the security of its territory. However, security-related policies must still comply with international law, and they must be proportionate to the threat posed. 
Israeli authorities justify many of the policies presented in the report on security grounds, including land confiscation, denial of building and planning permits, residency revocations, restrictions on movement, and discriminatory laws on family reunification. Amnesty examined each of the security justifications cited by Israel and concluded that these are used as a pretext for actions which are, in fact, motivated by the intent to control the Palestinian people and exploit their resources.   
For example, the prolonged and cruel discriminatory denial of Palestinians’ access to their land and property that was seized in a violent and discriminatory manner has no security rationale. There is no security basis for the effective segregation of Palestinian citizens of Israel through discriminatory laws on planning and access to housing or the denial of their right to claim their property and homes seized under the authority of racist laws. Similarly, arbitrary and discriminatory interference with the rights of Palestinian citizens of Israel to marry and extend rights of residence to their spouses and children, in the absence of evidence that particular individuals pose a threat, cannot be justified based on security. 
In the context of Israel’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, certain limitations on human rights may be permissible under international humanitarian law if conducted in good faith. However, the justification for the differential treatment cannot extend to the settlement of Jewish Israelis in the occupied territories. Nor can it extend to the murders, the targeted killings, the torture, the deportation and forcible transfers of populations that have been perpetrated in the OPT over the years. 
Israel keeps information about security secret, which often means individuals whose rights are violated in the name of security have no meaningful way to challenge them. 
The report gives numerous examples of policies where genuine security considerations have been far outweighed by the clear, and illegitimate, intent to dominate and oppress. 
18. You are calling for Israel’s apartheid system to be dismantled. Does this mean dismantling the state of Israel? 
No. Amnesty’s focus is on human rights violations committed by states, not the legitimacy of governments or states themselves. For example, as a matter of policy, we do not ever call for “regime change;” we instead provide recommendations on how governments can bring their actions in line with international law. 
Amnesty International recognizes that both the Jewish and the Palestinian people claim the right to self-determination. 
In addition, the report addresses whole sets of recommendations to the state of Israel, and we’ve requested meetings with Israeli officials to discuss them. The state of Israel has been a member of the United Nations since its establishment in 1948. It is a party to international human rights conventions and other treaties and therefore must respect these obligations, including by upholding the right to equality and non-discrimination, and by ending and remedying violations of international law. 
This report is a call for the Israeli government to undertake reforms necessary for Israel to comply with its obligations under international law. In this regard, and as an example, international law does not prohibit Israel from encouraging Jewish immigration, however this cannot be accompanied by discrimination against Palestinians exercising their right to return or otherwise contribute to the oppression and domination of Palestinians.  
19. By calling on Israel to dismantle its apartheid system, are you advocating for one binational state in place of Israel and a future Palestinian state? 
This is a political issue and, as such, Amnesty takes no position on this, or on a two-state solution, confederation, or other possible arrangements. 
Our only call with any political solution would be that it be based on respect for international law, including international human rights law, international humanitarian, and international criminal law. 
20. Why is Amnesty calling for sanctions? 
Amnesty is calling on the UN Security Council to impose targeted sanctions, such as travel bans and asset freezes against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid, and to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel. This is in order to prevent Israel from committing war crimes and other serious violations. 
We are not calling for the imposition of wide-ranging economic sanctions, or any sanctions that are not targeted. An arms embargo should cover the supply, sale or transfer of all weapons, munitions and security equipment including training. We have in the past, as per our policy, called for these types of sanctions on other countries, including Syria, Libya, Sudan, Myanmar and Nepal. 
21. Israel is not party to the Rome Statute or Apartheid Convention. Doesn’t this mean they are not bound by their obligations?  
No. Firstly, Israel has ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), which prohibits apartheid. Secondly, the prohibition of apartheid forms part of customary international law, which consists of international obligations arising from general practice of states accepted as law. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has stated that apartheid is a “flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the (UN) Charter”. 
Amnesty also considers that there is strong evidence that the definition of apartheid as a crime against humanity in the Rome Statute reflects customary international law. 
22. What is the role of the International Criminal Court in this situation? 
The International Criminal Court (ICC) has had jurisdiction over crimes committed in the State of Palestine since June 2014. In March 2021, the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the ICC announced that it had initiated an investigation into the Situation in Palestine. The territorial scope of its jurisdiction covers Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. 
Since the crime against humanity of apartheid is being committed in these territories, we are calling on the OTP to consider including this crime in the investigation.

The investigation details how Israel enforces a system of oppression and domination against the Palestinian people wherever it has control over their rights. This includes Palestinians living in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT), as well as displaced refugees in other countries. 
The comprehensive report, Israel’s Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity, sets out how massive seizures of Palestinian land and property, unlawful killings, forcible transfer, drastic movement restrictions, and the denial of nationality and citizenship to Palestinians are all components of a system which amounts to apartheid under international law. This system is maintained by violations which Amnesty International found to constitute apartheid as a crime against humanity, as defined in the Rome Statute and Apartheid Convention. 
Amnesty International is calling on the International Criminal Court (ICC) to consider the crime of apartheid in its current investigation in the OPT and calls on all states to exercise universal jurisdiction to bring perpetrators of apartheid crimes to justice. 
“Our report reveals the true extent of Israel’s apartheid regime. Whether they live in Gaza, East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank, or Israel itself, Palestinians are treated as an inferior racial group and systematically deprived of their rights. We found that Israel’s cruel policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion across all territories under its control clearly amount to apartheid. The international community has an obligation to act,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“There is no possible justification for a system built around the institutionalized and prolonged racist oppression of millions of people. Apartheid has no place in our world, and states which choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history. Governments who continue to supply Israel with arms and shield it from accountability at the UN are supporting a system of apartheid, undermining the international legal order, and exacerbating the suffering of the Palestinian people. The international community must face up to the reality of Israel’s apartheid, and pursue the many avenues to justice which remain shamefully unexplored.” 
Amnesty International’s findings build on a growing body of work by Palestinian, Israeli and international NGOs, who have increasingly applied the apartheid framework to the situation in Israel and/or the OPT. 
Identifying apartheid 
A system of apartheid is an institutionalized regime of oppression and domination by one racial group over another. It is a serious human rights violation which is prohibited in public international law. Amnesty International’s extensive research and legal analysis, carried out in consultation with external experts, demonstrates that Israel enforces such a system against Palestinians through laws, policies and practices which ensure their prolonged and cruel discriminatory treatment. 
In international criminal law, specific unlawful acts which are committed within a system of oppression and domination, with the intention of maintaining it, constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid. These acts are set out in the Apartheid Convention and the Rome Statute, and include unlawful killing, torture, forcible transfer, and the denial of basic rights and freedoms. 
Amnesty International documented acts proscribed in the Apartheid Convention and Rome Statute in all the areas Israel controls, although they occur more frequently and violently in the OPT than in Israel. Israeli authorities enact multiple measures to deliberately deny Palestinians their basic rights and freedoms, including draconian movement restrictions in the OPT, chronic discriminatory underinvestment in Palestinian communities in Israel, and the denial of refugees’ right to return. The report also documents forcible transfer, administrative detention, torture, and unlawful killings, in both Israel and the OPT. 
Amnesty International found that these acts form part of a systematic and widespread attack directed against the Palestinian population, and are committed with the intent to maintain the system of oppression and domination. They therefore constitute the crime against humanity of apartheid. 
The unlawful killing of Palestinian protesters is perhaps the clearest illustration of how Israeli authorities use proscribed acts to maintain the status quo. In 2018, Palestinians in Gaza began to hold weekly protests along the border with Israel, calling for the right of return for refugees and an end to the blockade. Before protests even began, senior Israeli officials warned that Palestinians approaching the wall would be shot. By the end of 2019, Israeli forces had killed 214 civilians, including 46 children. 
In light of the systematic unlawful killings of Palestinians documented in its report, Amnesty International is also calling for the UN Security Council to impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel. This should cover all weapons and munitions as well as law enforcement equipment, given the thousands of Palestinian civilians who have been unlawfully killed by Israeli forces. The Security Council should also impose targeted sanctions, such as asset freezes, against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid. 
Palestinians treated as a demographic threat 
Since its establishment in 1948, Israel has pursued a policy of establishing and then maintaining a Jewish demographic majority, and maximizing control over land and resources to benefit Jewish Israelis. In 1967, Israel extended this policy to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Today, all territories controlled by Israel continue to be administered with the purpose of benefiting Jewish Israelis to the detriment of Palestinians, while Palestinian refugees continue to be excluded. 
Amnesty International recognizes that Jews, like Palestinians, claim a right to self-determination, and does not challenge Israel’s desire to be a home for Jews. Similarly, it does not consider that Israel labelling itself a “Jewish state” in itself indicates an intention to oppress and dominate. 
However, Amnesty International’s report shows that successive Israeli governments have considered Palestinians a demographic threat, and imposed measures to control and decrease their presence and access to land in Israel and the OPT. These demographic aims are well illustrated by official plans to “Judaize” areas of Israel and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which continue to put thousands of Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer. 
Oppression without borders 
The 1947-49 and 1967 wars, Israel’s ongoing military rule of the OPT, and the creation of separate legal and administrative regimes within the territory, have separated Palestinian communities and segregated them from Jewish Israelis. Palestinians have been fragmented geographically and politically, and experience different levels of discrimination depending on their status and where they live. 
Palestinian citizens in Israel currently enjoy greater rights and freedoms than their counterparts in the OPT, while the experience of Palestinians in Gaza is very different to that of those living in the West Bank. Nonetheless, Amnesty International’s research shows that all Palestinians are subject to the same overarching system. Israel’s treatment of Palestinians across all areas is pursuant to the same objective: to privilege Jewish Israelis in distribution of land and resources, and to minimize the Palestinian presence and access to land. 
Amnesty International demonstrates that Israeli authorities treat Palestinians as an inferior racial group who are defined by their non-Jewish, Arab status. This racial discrimination is cemented in laws which affect Palestinians across Israel and the OPT. 
For example, Palestinian citizens of Israel are denied a nationality, establishing a legal differentiation from Jewish Israelis. In the West Bank and Gaza, where Israel has controlled the population registry since 1967, Palestinians have no citizenship and most are considered stateless, requiring ID cards from the Israeli military to live and work in the territories. 
Palestinian refugees and their descendants, who were displaced in the 1947-49 and 1967 conflicts, continue to be denied the right to return to their former places of residence. Israel’s exclusion of refugees is a flagrant violation of international law which has left millions in a perpetual limbo of forced displacement. 
Palestinians in annexed East Jerusalem are granted permanent residence instead of citizenship – though this status is permanent in name only. Since 1967, more than 14,000 Palestinians have had their residency revoked at the discretion of the Ministry of the Interior, resulting in their forcible transfer outside the city. 
Lesser citizens 
Palestinian citizens of Israel, who comprise about 19% of the population, face many forms of institutionalized discrimination. In 2018, discrimination against Palestinians was crystallized in a constitutional law which, for the first time, enshrined Israel exclusively as the “nation state of the Jewish people”. The law also promotes the building of Jewish settlements and downgrades Arabic’s status as an official language. 
The report documents how Palestinians are effectively blocked from leasing on 80% of Israel’s state land, as a result of racist land seizures and a web of discriminatory laws on land allocation, planning and zoning. 
The situation in the Negev/Naqab region of southern Israel is a prime example of how Israel’s planning and building policies intentionally exclude Palestinians.  Since 1948 Israeli authorities have adopted various policies to “Judaize” the Negev/Naqab, including designating large areas as nature reserves or military firing zones, and setting targets for increasing the Jewish population. This has had devastating consequences for the tens of thousands of Palestinian Bedouins who live in the region. 
Thirty-five Bedouin villages, home to about 68,000 people, are currently “unrecognized” by Israel, which means they are cut off from the national electricity and water supply and targeted for repeated demolitions. As the villages have no official status, their residents also face restrictions on political participation and are excluded from the healthcare and education systems. These conditions have coerced many into leaving their homes and villages, in what amounts to forcible transfer. 
Decades of deliberately unequal treatment of Palestinian citizens of Israel have left them consistently economically disadvantaged in comparison to Jewish Israelis. This is exacerbated by blatantly discriminatory allocation of state resources: a recent example is the government’s Covid-19 recovery package, of which just 1.7% was given to Palestinian local authorities. 
Dispossession 
The dispossession and displacement of Palestinians from their homes is a crucial pillar of Israel’s apartheid system. Since its establishment the Israeli state has enforced massive and cruel land seizures against Palestinians, and continues to implement myriad laws and policies to force Palestinians into small enclaves. Since 1948, Israel has demolished hundreds of thousands of Palestinian homes and other properties across all areas under its jurisdiction and effective control. 
As in the Negev/Naqab, Palestinians in East Jerusalem and Area C of the OPT live under full Israeli control. The authorities deny building permits to Palestinians in these areas, forcing them to build illegal structures which are demolished again and again. 
In the OPT, the continued expansion of illegal Israeli settlements exacerbates the situation. The construction of these settlements in the OPT has been a government policy since 1967. Settlements today cover 10% of the land in the West Bank, and some 38% of Palestinian land in East Jerusalem was expropriated between 1967 and 2017. 
Palestinian neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem are frequently targeted by settler organizations which, with the full backing of the Israeli government, work to displace Palestinian families and hand their homes to settlers. One such neighbourhood, Sheikh Jarrah, has been the site of frequent protests since May 2021 as families battle to keep their homes under the threat of a settler lawsuit. 
Draconian movement restrictions 
Since the mid-1990s Israeli authorities have imposed increasingly stringent movement restrictions on Palestinians in the OPT. A web of military checkpoints, roadblocks, fences and other structures controls the movement of Palestinians within the OPT, and restricts their travel into Israel or abroad. 
A 700km fence, which Israel is still extending, has isolated Palestinian communities inside “military zones”, and they must obtain multiple special permits any time they enter or leave their homes. In Gaza, more than 2 million Palestinians live under an Israeli blockade which has created a humanitarian crisis. It is near-impossible for Gazans to travel abroad or into the rest of the OPT, and they are effectively segregated from the rest of the world. 
“For Palestinians, the difficulty of travelling within and in and out of the OPT is a constant reminder of their powerlessness. Their every move is subject to the Israeli military’s approval, and the simplest daily task means navigating a web of violent control,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“The permit system in the OPT is emblematic of Israel’s brazen discrimination against Palestinians. While Palestinians are locked in a blockade, stuck for hours at checkpoints, or waiting for yet another permit to come through, Israeli citizens and settlers can move around as they please.” 
Amnesty International examined each of the security justifications which Israel cites as the basis for its treatment of Palestinians. The report shows that, while some of Israel’s policies may have been designed to fulfil legitimate security objectives, they have been implemented in a grossly disproportionate and discriminatory way which fails to comply with international law. Other policies have absolutely no reasonable basis in security, and are clearly shaped by the intent to oppress and dominate. 
The way forward 
Amnesty International provides numerous specific recommendations for how the Israeli authorities can dismantle the apartheid system and the discrimination, segregation and oppression which sustain it. 
The organization is calling for an end to the brutal practice of home demolitions and forced evictions as a first step. Israel must grant equal rights to all Palestinians in Israel and the OPT, in line with principles of international human rights and humanitarian law. It must recognize the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to homes where they or their families once lived, and provide victims of human rights violations and crimes against humanity with full reparations. 
The scale and seriousness of the violations documented in Amnesty International’s report call for a drastic change in the international community’s approach to the human rights crisis in Israel and the OPT.   
All states may exercise universal jurisdiction over persons reasonably suspected of committing the crime of apartheid under international law, and states that are party to the Apartheid Convention have an obligation to do so.  
“The international response to apartheid must no longer be limited to bland condemnations and equivocating. Unless we tackle the root causes, Palestinians and Israelis will remain locked in the cycle of violence which has destroyed so many lives,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Israel must dismantle the apartheid system and start treating Palestinians as human beings with equal rights and dignity. Until it does, peace and security will remain a distant prospect for Israelis and Palestinians alike.”

On 19 October 2001, the human rights defender Digna Ochoa was killed in her offices in Mexico City. The heinous crime shocked Mexican society and the international community. Digna was one of the most emblematic leaders in the defence of human rights in Mexico, in a particularly complex context. 
Despite the global alarm, the state’s response to her death was unbelievable. Not only did the investigation lack impartiality and integrity, but the conclusion that Digna had “committed suicide” was a slap in the face of truth and justice for her and her family, as well as for hundreds of other human rights defenders who have since faced multiple forms of violence and persecution. Digna’s killing and the apathy of the authorities were not isolated occurrences, but part of a pattern of violence and impunity against human rights defenders, which sadly remains a legacy that continues to threaten human rights defenders and their organizations in Mexico, one of the most dangerous countries in the world for human rights defenders.  
It is in this context that the recent judgment of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the case of Digna Ochoa, condemning the Mexican state for serious failings in the investigation of her death, is a very important milestone for justice and human rights, and particularly for Digna and women human rights defenders. 
The Inter-American Court documented the multiple flaws in the investigations into her death, which in addition to showing the manipulation of evidence, including the crime scene, were plagued by gender stereotypes, and “intimate and personal aspects of the defender” were used to question her credibility and damage her image and reputation in order to minimize the impact of her killing. This is a recurrent issue in cases of killings and violence against women defenders in Mexico. The lack of a gender perspective in dealing with reports of violence perpetrated against women defenders and journalists, and attacks on the legitimacy of their defence work are a common denominator, not only in the few investigations that are carried out, but also in state discourse. 
During the hearing before the Court, as an expert witness, I presented an analysis of the context of violence that human rights defenders in Mexico have been facing from the time of Digna’s killing until now. At Amnesty International we reported the threats against Digna and repeatedly demanded her protection from the authorities. Sadly this was not the only case as for years we have documented various cases of attacks and threats against women human rights defenders in the country. Emblematic cases of threats, such as those of Esther Chávez in 2002 and Obtilia Eugenio Manuel, who since 2004 has suffered multiple threats and even kidnapping; of sexual torture such as that of Lydia Cacho; or of killings such as those of Marisela Escobedo in 2010, Susana Chávez in 2012 and Zenaida Pulido in 2019, are proof that the Mexican state has not only failed to protect women human rights defenders, but that it fuels the impunity that guarantees that the violence will continue. 
In the cases that Amnesty International has investigated, death threats, attacks, smear campaigns, disappearances and other forms of violence are almost never investigated, and the few investigations that are carried out, including into the killings of women defenders, are slow and lack specific protocols that focus on defence work or a gender perspective. In many cases the Mexican authorities and security forces themselves who are identified as responsible for the attacks, threats and aggressions, hence the investigations often lack impartiality and credibility. 
One of the biggest obstacles for human rights defenders is that Mexico lacks truly comprehensive public protection policies. Although it has had a law and mechanism for the protection of human rights defenders and journalists since 2012, this has been clearly insufficient. Defamation and criminalization campaigns by public officials, the lack of firm measures to address the structural causes of violence, and the lack of investigation and punishment of those responsible for violence against defenders contribute to the hostile environment for the defence of rights. 
The crisis of violence against human rights defenders and journalists in Mexico is monumental. The government itself acknowledges that from December 2018 to September 2021, 94 defenders have been killed, 23 of them women. The violence against the press merits its own analysis due to the severity of the situation, but to give an example, so far this year, three journalists have already been murdered.  
In the face of this crisis, and with all the problems identified with the protection mechanism, it is contradictory that, in October 2020, the Mexican Congress, with the approval of President López Obrador himself, eliminated the independent trust fund that financed part of the mechanism’s protection programmes.  
The Court’s judgment against Mexico in the Digna Ochoa case also recognizes this crisis and the state’s inability to provide protection. This is why in its judgment it orders the Mexican state to comply with reparation measures, both individually with the reopening of the investigation into Digna’s killing and compensation measures, and collectively, ordering the strengthening of the protection system with the adoption of investigation and protection protocols, training plans, recognition and prevention campaigns, and the allocation of adequate financial resources. 
Mexico should not rely on a protection mechanism as the only state response for the protection of defenders. The state has an obligation to adopt a comprehensive perspective on the protection of defenders with a differentiated approach that takes into account specific needs, including those of women defenders. 
Unless crimes against defenders and journalists are adequately investigated and punished, attacks will simply continue. Therefore, the state must strengthen the institutions responsible for prosecution and the administration of justice, as well as internal administrative oversight bodies, to ensure that all attacks are promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially investigated, that perpetrators are brought to justice, and that victims receive full reparation and adequate assistance. 
The deadline for empty promises has long passed. President López Obrador must act urgently and put an end to this violence that deeply harms all of society in his country. A first step is to stop his stigmatizing discourse and publicly recognize the work of human rights defenders in the construction of a more just and dignified Mexico. A Mexico where we no longer have to grieve for the Digna Ochoas that the violence takes from us.

Given his ill-health, he is at heightened risk of death or severe illness if he contracts Covid-19 in prison. Officials have also deprived him of family visits for nearly 14 years, causing him mental distress.

Salutation: Dear Mr. Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei  
Additional Information:   
Ailing 49-year-old Iranian Kurdish prisoner Kamal Sharifi, unjustly jailed since 2008, has suffered irreparable harm to his health and faces risks to his life because of prolonged deliberate denial of access to adequate specialized medical care. He suffers from the long-term effects of a stroke sustained in prison in 2011, heart disease, gastrointestinal complications, joint aches, gum recession and tooth loss.   
Kamal Sharifi suffered a heart attack in Minab prison in Hormozgan province on 2 March 2021. He was taken to a hospital,  but was prematurely returned to prison after four days against medical advice. On 10 March 2021, he was transferred to a hospital in Bandar Abbas, also in Hormozgan province, and underwent an angioplasty and stenting procedure. Once again, prison and prosecution authorities disregarded medical advice and returned him to prison after two days. No follow-up care was provided, even though he says his surgeon recommended monthly examinations. He fears that prison authorities are further endangering his life by failing to provide him medication needed to avert the risk of another heart attack as well as by placing him in an overcrowded cell next to prisoners convicted of violent crimes and denying him a healthy diet in disregard of the stress control and dietary requirements that his surgeon said he must observe.     
Judicial authorities have subjected Kamal Sharifi to further prolonged torture or other ill-treatment by ruling that while serving his sentence, he would be banned from “prison leave, visits, and written correspondence with others.” As such, in nearly 14 years, he has only had one family visit. Kamal Sharifi says that in response to his repeated complaints about his ill-treatment and denial of healthcare, prison officials have told him that intelligence bodies insist on denying him leave and family visits, while prosecution authorities have not authorized his transfer to a medical facility outside prison. He was sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment for “enmity against God” in December 2008 after a grossly unfair trial which lasted about five minutes and used torture-tainted “confessions”.     
In May 2011, Kamal Sharifi waged a hunger strike to protest the denial of his visitation rights. On the 48th day of his hunger strike, the authorities allowed him to have a visit with his family for the first time since his arrest. The visit took place in the presence of intelligence officials who banned him from speaking to his mother in Kurdish. He ended his hunger strike six days later in July 2011. Soon afterwards, he suffered a stroke. He continues to suffer from the long-term effects of both his prolonged hunger strike and stroke, including gastrointestinal complications, facial numbness, gum recession and muscle weakness, for which he has not received adequate medical care. In a letter written from inside prison on 21 March 2021, Kamal Sharifi wrote: “I have submitted more than 20 requests for leave to the prosecutor, the head of the department of justice and judicial officials in the provinces of Hormozgan and Kurdistan, but they have been ignored… For 13 years, I have been suffering with gastrointestinal illness while eating poor quality food in prison. After 13 years of imprisonment and internal exile with no family visits and suffering stroke and heart attack… enduring further psychological pressure… has become difficult and intolerable.”  
Kamal Sharifi was arrested in Saqqez, Kurdistan province, on 25 May 2008 during an armed confrontation which occurred when ministry of intelligence agents raided the hiding place of a group of individuals, including Kamal Sharifi, who were allegedly affiliated with an armed Kurdish opposition group, the Kurdistan Democratic Party – Iran (KDP-I) and had irregularly entered Iran from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq shortly before the incident. According to the court verdict of Kamal Sharifi, which has been reviewed by Amnesty International, he maintained during his trial that he did not fire any weapons during the incident. Following his arrest, Kamal Sharifi was transferred to a detention centre controlled by the ministry of intelligence in Sanandaj, Kurdistan province, where he was held in solitary confinement, without access to his family and lawyer, for six months. During this period, he says ministry of intelligence agents repeatedly tortured him while blindfolded, including with beatings, electric shocks, painful stress positions and shackling, to force him to “confess” before a video camera that he had been involved in armed activities attributed to the KDP-I. Kamal Sharifi says that as a result of torture, he continues to experience pain in his joints. He has not received any medical care for these chronic injuries and has simply been left to use regular painkillers.   
In December 2008, the Revolutionary Court of Saqqez convicted Kamal Sharifi of “enmity against   
God” (moharebeh) through “armed rebellion” and membership in the KDP-I and sentenced him to 30 years’ imprisonment. The court ruled that he must serve his entire prison sentence in “exile” in Minab prison in southern Iran, which is around 1,600km away from the north-western city of Saqqez where his family live. The court further relied on article 193 of the Islamic Penal Code of 1991 to rule that “while serving his sentence, he shall be denied the privileges of prison leave, visits and written correspondence with others.” This article states that those convicted of “enmity against God” who are exiled must be placed under supervision and have no interaction with others. Kamal Sharifi’s trial was grossly unfair; it lasted about five minutes and he says the judge did not allow him and his lawyer, whom he met for the first time at the trial, to exchange any words.   
Prisoners in Minab prison suffer from overcrowding and bed shortages forcing many prisoners to sleep on the floor including in the prison corridors. Meals provided by the prison are low quality and contain very little nutrition. The prison clinic has just one bed and lacks adequate staffing and essential medical equipment; only one nurse (behyar) with limited medical knowledge is present 24 hours a day, and a physician visits once a week for a few hours. Clinic staff generally prescribe prisoners ordinary painkillers and antibiotics without addressing their underlying medical problems. Reports surfacing from Minab prison indicate that between March 2020 and March 2021, Covid-19 spread in the prison and several prisoners suspected to have been infected died in custody amid the refusal of prison authorities to transfer them to a medical facility outside prison. The vaccination of prisoners started around August 2021 and Kamal Sharifi and most other prisoners have since received two doses of Iran’s locally produced Covid-19 vaccine. Growing medical evidence, however, indicates that two doses are not sufficient for protection against severe illness, particularly for vulnerable individuals such as Kamal Sharifi who have serious pre-existing medical conditions.  
Prosecution and prison authorities in Iran routinely deny prisoners access to adequate medical care, in many cases as an intentional act of cruelty intended to intimidate and punish them. Dozens of cases of suspicious deaths in custody with suspected links to the denial of medical care have been reported in recent years amid a crisis of impunity for violations of the right to life.

Additional information  
Omar Radi is an investigative journalist and activist from Morocco. He is a founder of and journalist at Le Desk, an independent Moroccan news website that publishes content critical of the authorities. He has worked with several national and international media outlets. His investigations have focused on political affairs, including the relations between political powers and business elites in Morocco and investigating corruption by the authorities. In 2013, he won the first investigative journalism award of International Media Support (IMS) and the Association of Moroccan Investigative Journalists (AMJI) for an investigation into the exploitation of sand quarries published on Lakome. In 2016, he was the author of an investigation report widely known as “Servants of the State” in which he listed the names of around 100 senior officials alleged to have illegally acquired state land.”  
On 23 March 2021, an investigative judge indicted Omar Radi for “harming the internal and external security of Morocco” based on an accusation that he had received funds from sources “linked to foreign intelligence agencies”. Amnesty International has found that Omar Radi has received funds transferred from abroad for research grants in the context of a journalism fellowship and freelance consultancies, both related to his exercise of freedom of expression. During the trial, the prosecution did not provide any evidence that he had revealed classified information or in any way acted outside of his legitimate work. Amnesty International therefore considers the charges to be spurious. A similar tactic is often used by the Moroccan authorities to intimidate critics; in 2015, similar charges were brought against academic Maati Monjib for legitimately receiving funding from a foreign NGO.  
Omar Radi is also charged with “rape” and “indecent assault against a female” based on an accusation made by a former colleague at Le Desk, who alleges Omar Radi assaulted her on 12 July 2020. He denies this, affirming that he had a “consensual sexual relationship” with her. A witness in this case, who was present during the alleged incident, has denied throughout the investigation that rape took place. The witness has also been indicted as an accomplice of the rape. Allegations of sexual violence should always be taken seriously and investigated properly. However, it is worth noting that there has been an ongoing pattern of sexual assault charges being brought against critics of the government in the context of detention or prosecutions related to their freedom of expression.  
Omar Radi’s targeting by the Moroccan authorities for espionage is not new. On 17 March 2020, a court in Morocco handed Omar Radi a suspended four-month prison sentence and a fine of 500 Moroccan dirhams (US$52) for a tweet in which he criticized an appeal court judge for upholding heavy prison sentences against Hirak El-Rif activists.  
Omar Radi’s lawyers’ requests to cross examine a key prosecution witness in the rape charge was denied by court on spurious grounds. The defense team repeatedly asked the court during the trial sessions to summon for testimony a man the alleged victim said was her fiancé and who testified before the investigative judge that he was in communication with her the night of the incident. The judge refused all requests, saying there is no need for such cross examination because it will delay the trial. Omar Radi was sentenced for the espionage charge for the receipt of foreign funds and his contacts with foreign diplomats, which are part of his legitimate journalistic and consultancy work. During several hearings throughout the duration of the trial, his defense team emphasized the need to summon all the witnesses in the espionage case, including diplomats and organizations cited by the prosecution, as suspected of being foreign agents fomenting trouble against Morocco. These requests were all refused because the prosecution argued their testimony will not be impartial as they are foreign agents.  
Furthermore, Omar Radi’s right to consult with his lawyers privately was not respected. On 1 June 2021, during his trial session at the Casablanca Court of Appeal, he complained to the judge about the lack of privacy in the room where he consults with his defense team in prison. This lack of privacy has been ongoing since the start of the trial. One of his (international) lawyers was also banned from attending his trial after receiving a deportation order.  
While the rape accusations must each be considered on their merits and Amnesty International is not well placed to assess their veracity, I note with concern that the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found in another case that the detention of another Moroccan journalist also accused of rape amounted to “judicial harassment attributable to nothing other than his investigative journalism”.  
In June 2020, an Amnesty International report revealed that Omar Radi was targeted by the Moroccan authorities using spyware produced by NSO Group, an Israeli company. Following its publication, the Moroccan authorities launched a smear campaign against Amnesty International, in an attempt to discredit the organization’s findings and distract from the unlawful surveillance in Morocco of human rights defenders and journalists. In October 2019 Amnesty International had published a report presenting evidence Moroccan human rights defenders Maati Monjib and Abdessadak El Bouchattaoui had similarly baeen targeted by surveillance technology produced by the company NSO Group. Amnesty International has underlined the gravity of the threat that unlawful targeted surveillance poses to the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Morocco.  
Omar Radi has been in solitary confinement since his detention in July 2020. He is allowed an hour daily walk outside his cell but no contact with other prisoners; a treatment that amounts to torture.   
In December 2020, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch sent a letter to the Interministerial Delegation for Human Rights (DIDH) to express concern about the solitary confinement of Journalists Omar Radi and Sulaiman Raisouni. The authorities denied that both journalists imprisonment conditions amount to solitary confinement. However, the United Nations’ Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, also known as the Mandela Rules, define solitary confinement as spending 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact.

Additional Information  
The Biden administration has shamefully continued dangerous policies of the preceding Trump administration – including Title 42 expulsions, the deceptively named “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP or the “Remain in Mexico” policy), and the use of arbitrary, mass immigration detention.   
The aggressive expulsions under Title 42 and the appalling decision to reinstate and expand the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) are especially concerning as these policies violate the human right to seek asylum and send hundreds of thousands of Haitians and other asylum-seekers to face danger and even death in their countries of origin and/or transit. These reckless actions not only abandon the administration’s obligations under US and international law, but also its promises to halt these cruel, abusive and unlawful programs.  
Images of desperation from the airport tarmacs in Port-au-Prince and ill-treatment in refugee camps in Del Rio and elsewhere along the southern border have been a damning indictment of the US government’s approach to humanitarian action and human rights for all, without discrimination.   
The US government has been misusing Title 42 of the US code to forcibly expel people at the US-Mexico border back to Mexico or to their countries of origin, without access to asylum or protection screenings. First implemented by the Trump administration under bogus public health grounds and the pretext of COVID-19, the Biden administration has continued Title 42 despite objections by CDC officials, public health experts, and administration officials. Over 1,400,000 people were expelled under Title 42 between March 2020 and November 2021 and subject to serious violence and dangerous conditions.  
After the Trump administration implemented MPP in 2019, nearly 70,000 asylum-seekers at the US-Mexico border were forced to return to and stay in Mexico during the adjudication of their asylum claims, which can take months or years. They lived in dangerous conditions in northern Mexico, under the threat of violence, homelessness, and kidnapping. The Biden administration terminated MPP but a federal court in August 2021 ordered it to reinstate MPP for reasons of administrative legal procedure. Despite describing MPP as having “endemic flaws, imposed unjustifiable human costs,” DHS reinstated and expanded the program in December 2021 to include nationals from Haiti and other Caribbean countries.  
Meanwhile, the average number of people held in US immigration detention has ballooned more than 50 percent to over 22,000 people under the Biden administration – despite the President’s previous commitments to end for-profit detention and as outbreaks of Covid-19 rage through detention facilities with the Delta and Omicron variants. As of 19 January 2022, more than 10 percent of people in detention had contracted Covid-19 in US custody – an increase of 680 percent in cases since 3 January 2022.  
All of this has been entirely unnecessary and violates US obligations to uphold the right to seek asylum, detain people only as a last resort, and not forcibly return individuals to places where they would be at risk of serious human rights violations. Restoring the rule of law and access to asylum requires upholding due process. Asylum-seekers should be allowed to live freely in the country, not expelled or detained, where they can pursue their asylum claims in communities supported by community-based organizations.   
News media in 2021 broadcast footage of US border agents charging into Haitian migrants on horseback – violently dispersing, taunting, and forcing them away from safety. This escalation of violence went hand-in-hand with a rise in removal flights to Haiti, despite the country still reeling from widespread violence, political instability and humanitarian disaster – from the catastrophic 2013 and 2021 earthquakes and the assassination of its president in 2021. Since 19 September 2021, the US has deported over 15,000 Haitians, largely without providing access to the asylum system or protection screenings. Amnesty co-authored “Not safe anywhere” and “Stop US deportations and abuse against Haitians on the move” with Haitian Bridge Alliance and other partners to document the harm facing Haitians in their search for safety in the US and across the Americas.   
The recent misconduct at the border is just the latest in a long line of historical abuses of Black immigrants in the US, serving as a searing reminder of the hateful, racist, and xenophobic cruelty that has shaped US immigration policies and continues to brutally harm and oppress millions of people today.

Economic and social rights have already been negatively impacted. Rising prices for basic foods and goods, including medical supplies, are affecting people’s right to healthcare and to an adequate standard of living in Ukraine.  This is particularly felt by the very old, the very young, and those on low incomes. The right to education has also been affected with schools closing intermittently over the past two weeks amid security concerns. In Russia itself, the rouble has dropped in value and prices are rising. 
“The threat of the use of military force by Russia is already affecting the human rights of millions of people in Ukraine and beyond,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The consequences of actual military force are likely to be devastating. Ukraine’s recent history is punctuated by conflicts involving Russian troops in Donbas and the illegal annexation of Crimea. These episodes have torn communities and lives apart, as military forces have trampled on the rights of civilians with impunity; it’s time to break that vicious cycle.”  
In military conflict, civilians must be protected and anyone who commits abuses must be held to account. Amnesty International will be monitoring the situation closely to expose violations of international humanitarian law (the laws of war) and international human rights law by all parties. 
In 2014-2015, at the peak of the armed conflict in Donbas, eastern Ukraine, all sides violated international humanitarian law leading to the displacement of over a million people. More than 13,000 people died and the toll is still rising. 
Russia’s military – a litany of abuse 
Based on the lack of respect for international law by Russian troops in other settings in recent years, which has been met with impunity, Amnesty International is extremely concerned about the likelihood of history repeating itself. 
For example, in Syria in 2015 a series of Russian air strikes on residential areas in Homs, Idlib and Aleppo between September and November killed at least 200 civilians. And in 2020, Amnesty International reported that Russian aircraft were targeting both schools and hospitals in Syria, some of which the UN had specified should be protected from any attacks. 
In the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, Russia-backed separatist forces violated international humanitarian law by using imprecise explosive weapons in populated civilian areas, as did Ukrainian forces. They also stationed and fired these weapons from homes and civilian infrastructure.   
“The history of Russia’s military interventions – be it in Ukraine or Syria, or its military campaign at home in Chechnya – is tainted with blatant disregard for international humanitarian law. The Russian military repeatedly flouted the laws of war by failing to protect civilians and even attacking them directly. Russian forces have launched indiscriminate attacks, used banned weapons and sometimes apparently deliberately targeted civilians and civilian objects – a war crime,” said Agnès Callamard. 
Amnesty International is also particularly concerned by the prospect of the creation of new militias on Ukrainian territory. Such Russia-backed armed groups in Donbas are notorious for their disregard of the rules of international humanitarian law and lack of accountability, as were the Ukrainian pro-government paramilitaries. 
Potential refugee crisis 
The conflict in eastern Ukraine provoked a full-blown human rights crisis in 2014-2015, the consequences of which continue to be acutely felt to this day. Millions of people were forced to leave their homes, and those who returned or remain in the conflict zone have lived a hand-to-mouth existence, since the region’s economy has been devastated. Hundreds fell victim to extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, torture, abductions, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detentions committed by separatist, as well as government, forces. 
According to the Ministry of Social Policy of Ukraine, about 1.45 million people are still internally displaced after fleeing the conflict in Donbas and from occupied Crimea. 
“It is frightening to imagine what scale the refugee crisis could reach in the event of escalating hostilities in Ukraine. It will be a continent-wide humanitarian disaster with millions of refugees seeking protection in neighbouring European countries,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Ukraine is currently the destination for those seeking protection when fleeing from Russia, Belarus and Central Asian countries. Should Russia use military force against Ukraine, this will no longer be the case and they will have to seek refuge in other countries.” 
Impact on region and beyond 
The conflict will further undermine human rights in the region through the likelihood of protracted guerrilla warfare in Ukraine, accompanied by illicit outflows of weapons, an influx of unaccountable private military contractors, and an overall increase in violence and impunity. The economic devastation and its repercussions for the region, including wider Europe that relies on Russian gas passing through Ukrainian territory, may be huge. 
“A further armed conflict in the very centre of Europe involving a nuclear power and potentially drawing in other countries threatens to disrupt the entire system of geopolitical checks and balances with unpredictable implications on human rights globally,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“If the West and Russia enter into a more bitter confrontation, this could potentially lead to more active intervention of the parties in regional conflicts throughout the world, weaponization of energy policy, and more countries prepared to use force as part of their foreign policy.”

In a positive move, BC’s government has confirmed to us it will review its immigration detention contract with the federal government, although it has yet to make an official announcement. 
After success in BC, we have now moved to Quebec, which like most provinces, has a contract with the federal government that allows for immigration detainees to be held in provincial jails. Call on Quebec to cancel this contract! 
#WelcomeToCanada: Call on Quebec to cancel their contract with the federal government! 
While applauding this development, we urge BC’s government to ensure the review process is credible and legitimate by making it transparent and involving the meaningful participation of key stakeholders, including civil society organizations and those with lived experience in immigration detention. Officials need to detail who is conducting the review, the projected timeline, who will be consulted, the scope of issues to be examined, and the expected output at the conclusion of the review. The review’s findings, analysis, and outcome should also be made public. 
Now, the #WelcomeToCanada campaign is continuing to the province of Quebec, which had the second-highest number of immigration detainees between 2018 and 2020, including hundreds of immigration detainees in its provincial jails. According to government statistics, over the past several years, Quebec consistently had the highest number of children in immigration detention, the majority of whom were under the age of 6. 
Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees in provincial jails is a violation of international human rights standards. Immigration detainees are held exclusively under immigration – not criminal – law, but they are often subjected to some of Canada’s most restrictive conditions of incarceration, including maximum-security provincial jails and in some cases solitary confinement. While Canada prides itself on welcoming refugees and other newcomers, it remains one of the few countries in the global north without a maximum limit to the duration of immigration detention. 
By allowing federal immigration detainees to be incarcerated in its provincial jails where they may remain with no end in sight, the Government of Quebec is implicated in the Federal Government’s human rights abuses. Quebec has a real opportunity to show leadership by canceling its immigration detention contract and protecting the basic rights of people in search of safety or a better life in this country.

Over the last few months, the fate of the 34-year-old Malaysian, who is set to be executed by hanging for drug-related offenses, has captured international attention. From experts at the United Nations to British billionaire Richard Branson, who tweeted that the case exposed the “fatal flaws” of the death penalty, to members of the public internationally, tens of thousands have urged for his execution to be called off.  
There was collective outrage when, despite medical experts finding that Nagaenthran has an intellectual disability, his family learned that the Singapore authorities had scheduled his execution for 10 November. Concerns mounted when his family reported that his mental condition had deteriorated significantly when they visited him in prison, where he appeared to not fully understand what was happening to him.  
The UN body monitoring compliance of the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), to which Singapore is a party, has stated that the imposition of the death penalty on people whose mental and intellectual disabilities may have impeded their effective defense is prohibited.  
In an unexpected twist, Nagaenthran’s appeal hearing was postponed when he tested positive for Covid-19. However, he has now presumably recovered and his life is again in peril. His appeal hearing has now been re-set to 24 January and, with other legal claims denied, this could be his last chance to be spared execution.  
There is still time left for Singapore to change course and prevent a travesty of justice. Authorities should ensure Nagaenthran has a fair hearing and halt his execution, which would be unlawful under international law in light of the numerous flaws in his case. This includes the fact his sentence was imposed as a mandatory punishment and for an offence that does not meet the threshold of the “most serious crimes” to which the use of the death penalty must be restricted under international law.  
A significant factor remains Nagaenthran’s intellectual disability and mental health state, which may have severely impacted his right to a fair trial including effective defense, up to these last critical stages.  
His intellectual disability would also have impacted his ability to communicate his knowledge of relevant information and his engagement with the authorities, including when questioned by officers of Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau, without the presence of a lawyer, after his arrest in 2009 for importing 42.72 grams of heroin.  
This in turn might have had a bearing on the information he provided for what’s called a certificate of assistance, which is needed to qualify for sentencing discretion in Singapore – itself a flawed process. In addition, from information on his present mental state, Nagaenthran’s cognitive function appears to have been severely impaired after years in detention.  
Accommodation measures as required by international law and guidelines on access to justice for persons with disabilities were not yet built into Singapore procedures when Nagaenthran was arrested in 2009. These may also have spared him the death sentence, and should be applied retrospectively to prevent a terrible injustice from taking place.  There is no evidence that the threat of execution acts as a greater deterrent to crime than life imprisonment, something confirmed in multiple studies, including by the UN, across the globe. Singapore, which regularly tops global indexes for standards of living, lags far behind global sentiment against the death penalty. As of today, the majority of the world’s states have abolished this cruel punishment in law for all crimes. The number of states that have voted in favour of UN General Assembly resolutions calling for a moratorium on executions has consistently increased, from 104 in 2007 to 123 at the most recent vote, in December 2020. 
Trends have been shifting in the Asia-Pacific region as well, where 20 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and a further eight are abolitionist in practice. In 2020, six Asia-Pacific countries carried out executions – the lowest number since Amnesty International began keeping records.  
Within ASEAN, only five countries in the region − Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Viet Nam − have carried out executions in the period 2016-2020, yet no executions have been carried out in Indonesia since 2016 and Malaysia has been observing an official moratorium since 2018.   
The Singapore authorities should immediately halt plans to execute Nagaenthran and establish a moratorium on all executions as a critical first step. After global outcry from around the world, the life of a man on death row, and Singapore’s human rights reputation including its treatment of persons with disabilities, are in the balance.   Should the courts fail, Singapore’s leaders must be ready to act. Throughout his 18 years in power, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s cabinet has not once approved an order for the President to grant clemency. But if there was ever a time to do so, it would be now.

Alia...","The Taliban authorities must urgently investigate the abduction of Alia Azizi, a senior female prison official who has been missing for more than three months after she reported for duty in Herat, and immediately and unconditionally release her if in their custody, Amnesty international said. 
Alia Azizi, a member of the ethnic Hazara community and the Head of Herat Women’s Prison, never returned home after going to work on 2 October 2021. Despite several pleas by her family to the Taliban to investigate the case, a veil of secrecy still shrouds her disappearance.  
“It’s been more than three months since Alia Azizi disappeared and her family still remains completely in the dark about her whereabouts. Her apparent abduction takes place within the context of the Taliban illegally detaining members of the former government, journalists, and assorted critics across the country,” said Zaman Sultani, Amnesty International’s South Asia Researcher. 
At the Taliban’s request, Alia Azizi returned to her job on 24 August 2021, just nine days after the collapse of the Afghan Government, her brother Mohammad Nazir Arefi told Amnesty International. She was earlier given an amnesty letter, guaranteeing her safety, by the Taliban on 12 August 2021, the day the group took over Herat province. 
According to Mohammad Nazir Arefi, the family`s continued pleas to the Taliban authorities in Herat have failed to get the group to initiate an investigation into her disappearance. The only information they have received in response is that she is not with the Taliban. Since Alia Azizi’s disappearance, her telephone has been disconnected and, according to Arefi, when the family tracked her phone conversations through the service provider, Alia’s last communication was with the Taliban’s Head of Herat Prison. 
“As the de facto authorities, the Taliban must take immediate steps to conduct a thorough, impartial and independent investigation into this and other cases of enforced disappearance, provide answers to the families whose loved ones are missing, and hold those within its ranks accountable across the country for committing crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations,” said Zaman Sultani. 
On 16 January 2022, the Taliban tried to silence women’s protests in Kabul calling for the Taliban to release Alia Azizi.  In dispersing the women protesters, the Taliban used electric devices to shock women protesters and used chemical substances such as pepper spray that caused the protestors severe skin and eye irritation, according to Human Rights Watch. In September, the Taliban’s Ministry of Interior issued an order banning all demonstrations and gatherings “until a policy of demonstration is codified”.   
“It is quite evident that the promises made by the Taliban, particularly to Afghan women and girls are being broken, and there is complete disregard for their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law. The Taliban must immediately end the use of unlawful force against those exercising their right to peaceful assembly.” said Zaman Sultani. 
Amnesty International contacted the Taliban for comment on 19 January; despite them initially promising to investigate the cases with their relevant authorities and get back to Amnesty, they have not provided an answer to Amnesty regarding the case at the time of publication. Amnesty International plans to publish the Taliban`s response if it receives a response to its query. 
Background 
Alia Azizi is among the few women who, despite the perpetual violence against women in the country, joined the former Afghan National Police. She is a high school graduate and has more than ten years’ experience working in the former police in Herat – including as the Head of Herat Women’s Prison. 
Recent Amnesty International investigations have documented that the Taliban has extrajudicially and willfully killed members of the former security forces, government supporters and ethnic Hazaras across the country.

On 24 April, the Huthi de facto authorities released 30-year-old British national Luke Symons along with 13 other foreign detainees. Luke Symons was arbitrarily detained on 4 April 2017 by the Huthis at a security checkpoint in Ta’iz, a city in southwestern Yemen, on the grounds that he “possessed a British passport.” He spent five years in detention without charge or trial.  
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Luke Symons, a British national arbitrarily detained by the Huthi de facto authorities for more than five years in Sanaa, the Yemeni capital, was released on 24 April.  
On 4 April 2017 he was arbitrarily arrested at a security checkpoint in Ta’iz, a city in southwestern Yemen, on the grounds that he possessed a UK passport. He was not charged, nor did he at any point during his five-year detention appear before a judge.  
Two of Luke Symons relatives told Amnesty International that the Huthi de facto authorities had accused him of espionage for the British government, however, they did not formally charge him nor bring any evidence of such a charge. Amnesty International examined a release order issued on 2 December 2018, by the Sana’a-based Supreme Political Council of Yemen, the executive body set up by the Huthis, demanding the release of Luke Symons for lack of evidence against him.  
The Huthi de facto authorities allegedly tortured and otherwise ill-treated Luke Symons during his interrogations, in a bid to make him “confess” to being a spy and held him in solitary confinement for the last four months of his detention.  
On 24 April, the Omani Foreign Ministry announced in a statement that it had facilitated the release of 14 foreigners, including Luke Symons, who were detained by the Huthi de facto authorities in Yemen and transferred them from Sanaa to the Omani capital Muscat on 24 April.  
Luke Symons’ release followed sustained campaigning by Luke Symons’ family, his local UK Member of Parliament representative, and Amnesty International. In a message to Amnesty International, Luke Symons’ grandfather and wife thanked the movement for campaigning for Luke Symons’ release.

Idris’ family and lawyer have yet to receive any information on the status of his case.  His lawyer raises serious fair trial concerns, making the conviction more troubling in light of his initial abduction by state authorities. His family has been able to confirm that he is yet to be vaccinated against Covid-19, further endangering his life given prison overcrowding. His family is worried that he is being denied access to appropriate nutrition despite his medical conditions.

Additional information:  
Muhammad Idris Khattak is a 57-year-old human rights defender and former consultant with Amnesty International. Abducted by state authorities on 13 November 2019 and subject to enforced disappearance, he was reportedly declared guilty after a secret military court trial, with no information regarding his sentence, the status of his case or the appeals process.  
As a civilian, Idris should have never been tried in a military court. No one has been held accountable or even identified for abducting and keeping him incommunicado for over seven months. Information about his sentencing has not been made available to his family.   
In November 2021, the lawyer was told by the court that Idris had been found guilty, but no order or sentence was issued. Following this, there were unconfirmed reports circulating online stating he had been declared guilty. The family had not received any official information about the status of his case and were relying on updates on social media. Idris was eventually found to be in Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in December 2021 through the family’s own investigation. Talia, his daughter, has been able to visit him in the high security prison ward.  
According to Idris’ lawyer, he was only allowed to meet with his client on three occasions during the trial. Each meeting was filmed, and they were continuously accompanied by an army officer, and were not permitted to speak in Pashto – their native language.  
At a hearing at the Peshawar High Court on 13 January 2021, the Khattak family appealed that as a civilian, Idris must be tried in a civilian court and not a military court. This appeal was denied in an order published on 28 January 2021. More information about the charges against Idris were revealed in the judgment published on 30 January 2021. He has been charged on multiple counts related to spying and other conduct “prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State” under Section 3 of the Official Secrets Act (OSA) as well as section 59 of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 – which gives military courts jurisdiction to try civilians for some offences under the OSA.  
This “offence” seems to be a meeting with Michael Semple in July 2009 – over ten years before Idris’ enforced disappearance. The court order dubs Semple as an MI6 agent. At the time of the meetings, Semple was a fellow at Harvard University’s Carr Center for Human Rights and had been a high-ranking UN and EU official in Afghanistan for 20 years. He was expelled from Afghanistan for “unauthorized activity in 2008.” Semple is currently a professor at Queen’s University in Belfast.  
The court order makes no mention of Idris’ enforced disappearance, or any accountability that the authorities must face for keeping him apart from his family and keeping his family uninformed of his whereabouts and situation.  
Idris Khattak has worked as a consultant with Amnesty International and other international human rights NGOs. For years, he has documented a wide range of human rights violations and humanitarian crises in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas.   
He was on his way home from Islamabad when his rented car was intercepted near the Swabi Interchange of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The only other person in the car was the driver with whom Idris Khattak has travelled frequently. The driver was also picked up with Idris Khattak on 13 November 2019. His family only found out about his disappearance once the driver was released the night of 15 November 2019.   
On the night of 16 June 2020, the Ministry of Defence finally admitted that they have Idris Khattak in their custody, and this was reiterated by a hearing held by the Joint Investigation Team on 17 June 2020.   
The current government of Imran Khan promised to criminalize enforced disappearances through legislation. However, the bill currently tabled before the Senate falls short of international standards, and its progress is undermined by reports of continued disappearances.

Iranian youth Hossein Shahbazi is at risk of imminent execution for a crime that took place when he was 17 years old. His trial was marred by serious violations, including the use of torture-tainted “confessions”. On 24 November 2021, the Iranian authorities executed Arman Abdolali for a crime that took place when he was 17 years old in violation of the absolute prohibition on the use of the death penalty against people under the age of 18 at the time of the offence.

Salutation: Dear Mr Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei:  
Additional information  
Hossein Shahbazi, aged 20, is at risk of imminent execution in Adelabad prison in Shiraz, Fars province, after being sentenced to death for a crime that took place when he was 17 years old. His execution was scheduled for 25 December 2021 in violation of Iran’s obligations under international law not to use the death penalty against people who were under 18 at the time of the crime and despite a pending request for retrial. It was postponed following international actions but may be carried out at any time. His execution had previously been scheduled on three other occasions for 1 March 2021, 28 June 2021 and 25 July 2021 and postponed each time following international pressure. Branch 3 of Criminal Court One of Fars province convicted Hossein Shahbazi of murder and sentenced him to death on 13 January 2020 following a grossly unfair trial. He was convicted, in part, on “confessions” that he said were obtained through torture at a detention centre run by the Investigation Unit of Iran’s police (Agahi). The court noted in its verdict that he was under 18 at the time of the crime, but stated that the Legal Medicine Organization of Iran, a state forensic institute, had found he had attained “mental growth and maturity” at the time of the crime, and therefore merited the death penalty under Article 91 of the Islamic Penal Code. In June 2020, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict. Hossein Shahbazi’s request for retrial, filed 20 June 2021, remains pending before the Supreme Court.  
On 24 November 2021, Arman Abdolali, aged 25, was executed in Raja’i Shahr prison, Alborz province, for a crime that took place when he was a child in a grave violation of international law. Prior to his execution, the Iranian authorities postponed his scheduled execution five times between 13 October and 21 November 2021. Each time, he was transferred to solitary confinement and then returned to the general ward. Given that these transfers, which are repeated acts of cruelty, inflicted intensive anxiety and fear amounting to severe mental suffering on Arman Abdolali, and that they were intentional and part of the process of his punishment, Amnesty International believes that in his final weeks Arman Abdolali was subjected to torture under international law. At the time of his execution, Arman Abolali’s request for retrial to the Supreme Court, filed 17 October 2021, remained pending.   
On 24 December 2021, an official from Adelabad prison phoned Hossein Shahbazi’s family to come for a final visit before his scheduled execution on 25 December 2021. Following international interventions, his execution was postponed. Hossein Shahbazi was arrested on 30 December 2018 and denied access to a lawyer and his family for 11 days while undergoing interrogations at a detention facility run by the Agahi in Shiraz. He was then transferred to a child detention facility but still denied access to his family for several days, after which his mother was allowed to visit him. The sentencing of Hossein Shahbazi to death on the basis of an opinion from the Legal Medicine Organization of Iran (LMOI) confirming his “maturity” at the time of the crime again highlights the complicity of doctors affiliated with the LMOI in the ongoing assault on children’s right to life in Iran.   
Arman Abdolali was sentenced to death in late December 2015 after Branch 4 of the Provincial Criminal Court of Tehran convicted him of murder in connection with the disappearance of his girlfriend in 2014. In its verdict, the court stated that the way the murder was committed indicated that Arman Abdolali had attained “maturity” and understood the nature and consequences of the crime. In July 2016, Iran’s Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence. Arman Abdolali was subsequently scheduled for execution on 1 January 2020, but following an international outcry his execution was halted. On 8 February 2020, Arman Abdolali’s request for a retrial was granted and his case was then referred for retrial to Branch 5 of Criminal Court One of Tehran Province, which largely focused on whether there were any doubts about his “maturity” at the time of the crime to warrant replacing his death sentence with an alternative sentence. On 22 September 2020, that court ruled that it was not possible to determine Arman Abdolali’s “maturity” years after the crime took place, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, “the prima facie presumption of full criminal responsibility” stands. In February 2021, the Supreme Court upheld this sentence. See amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/5049/2021/en/ for information on the circumstances of Arman Abdolali’s execution.    
The court rulings in Arman Abdolali and Hossein Shahbazi’s cases highlight the flawed nature of Iran’s child justice system, which considers that in cases of murder and certain other capital crimes, boys aged above 15 lunar years and girls aged above nine lunar years are as culpable as adults and therefore merit the death penalty, provided they have “attained maturity”. Their sentencing to death underscores again the fundamentally flawed nature of Article 91 of the 2013 Islamic Penal Code that gives judges the discretion to impose the death penalty on those were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Under international law, no such discretion must ever be given under any circumstances. Amnesty International has also repeatedly called on the Iranian authorities, including parliamentarians, to amend Article 91 to completely abolish the use of the death penalty for crimes committed by people below the age of 18 in all circumstances and without any discretion for judges, in line with international law.   
Iran’s criminal justice system facilitates the arbitrary deprivation of the right to life, perpetuates a cycle of violence and seeks to place the responsibility for state-sanctioned killings of human beings on those who have lost their next of kin to murder. Under Iran’s laws, qesas (retribution-in-kind) is a system of equivalent retaliation which involves subjecting those convicted of murder to the same fate as that suffered by the victim of murder – that is death. The law grants this power to the family of the murder victim who may demand and carry out the killing of the defendant or grant pardon in exchange for “blood money” (diyah). In death penalty cases involving persons convicted of crimes committed when they were children and based on qesas, including the casesof Arman Abdolali and Hossein Shahbazi, the Iranians authorities frequently misled the public and the international community by claiming that the final decision on carrying out or halting the execution is out of their hands and that all they can do is to mediate and encourage the family of the victim to grant pardon in exchange for “blood money” (diyah). Amnesty International emphasizes that these claims are dishonest and reflect a fundamental lack of respect for children’s rights by the Iranian authorities. Iranian courts sentence individuals to death for crimes committed when they were children, in flagrant violation of international law, and Iranian courts subsequently reject repeated requests to commute these death sentences.  
The absolute prohibition on the use of the death penalty against persons who were under the age of 18 at the time of the crime is provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which Iran has ratified. It is also recognized as a peremptory norm of customary international law, which means it is accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a norm which is binding on all states and from which no derogation is permitted. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or the circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution.

Additional information  
Lilia Chanysheva, a former regional coordinator of “Navalny’s headquarters” in Ufa, Bashkortostan (central Russia), was arrested on 9 November 2021, following a search at her home. On the same day, the police searched the homes of other activists in Ufa and other Russian cities as part of a criminal case against Aleksei Navalny and his associates.   
On 10 November, the Kirovsky District Court of Ufa put Lilia Chanysheva in pretrial detention. She was accused of “establishing or leading an extremist association” (Art. 282.1(1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in connection with her past work with Aleksei Navalny. If convicted, Lilia Chanysheva could face up to 10 years’ imprisonment. She was transferred from Ufa to Moscow on 21 November.  
On 10 December, Lilia Chanysheva’s lawyer Vladimir Voronin was prevented from visiting her at the pretrial detention centre. Later, he learned that a member of the Investigative Committee had removed him from the case under the false pretext of a conflict of interest. Over the next two weeks, three more lawyers who tried to visit Lilia Chanysheva in detention were similarly prevented from doing so by the Investigative Committee. As of January 2022, Lilia Chanysheva has no lawyer in Moscow.  
On 9 June 2021, the Moscow City Court arbitrarily banned as “extremist” three civil society organizations, namely the Anti-Corruption Foundation, the Citizens’ Rights Protection Foundation and “Navalny’s headquarters”, all of them linked to arbitrarily imprisoned Aleksei Navalny. The court hearing was closed to the media and the general public, and the grounds for the designation have not been made public. According to the information in possession of Amnesty International, no one of Navalny’s organizations have committed, called for or condoned any violent acts nor have did they committed any other internationally recognizable crimes.  
On 28 September, the Russian authorities announced a new criminal investigation against Aleksei Navalny and his associates on unfounded charges of “establishment of an extremist association”. In October, it transpired that this investigation was joined with four other criminal cases against Aleksei Navalny, his colleagues and supporters. Lilia Chanysheva is the first of Navalny’s associates who has been arrested under this criminal case.   
On 2 February 2021, Aleksei Navalny, a leading Russian opposition activist and anti-corruption campaigner, was given a custodial sentence of two years and eight months for purported violation of his probation terms, under his previous, politically motivated, sentence. Russian authorities have refused to release him despite the absurdity of these accusations (Aleksei Navany had not reported to his probation officer while he was recovering abroad from his near-fatal poisoning) that flew in the face of mass protests in Russia and internationally, and the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights which established political motivation of the prosecution of Aleksei Navalny and demanded his immediate release. He is a prisoner of conscience and must be freed immediately and unconditionally.

Dozens of Navalny’s associates and supporters are facing prosecutions on bogus charges, while a growing number of them are already in prison. Meanwhile, the authorities have labelled his organizations as ‘extremist’ and blocked their websites,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia Director. 
In the year since Aleksei Navalny’s detention at a Moscow airport, the politician, his supporters and Russian civil society organizations have suffered a relentless onslaught of repression 
“Some of Aleksei Navalny’s associates were able to flee the country, yet they now fear their relatives in Russia will suffer a similar fate of unfounded prosecution and imprisonment. On the anniversary of his detention, Navalny and the political activists associated with him are in a living hell.”On 2 February 2021, a court in Moscow replaced Navalny’s non-custodial sentence with a jail term of two years and eight months, later shortened by two months. Soon thereafter, the Russian authorities began dismantling the Anti-Corruption Foundation and the Citizens’ Rights Protection Foundation, which Navalny founded, and closed his offices. On 9 June 2021, the two organizations were officially labelled as “extremist” and arbitrarily banned.The activities of the two organizations have since been criminalized. On 28 September 2021, the authorities opened a criminal case against Navalny and his associates under the trumped-up charge of creating an “extremist association”. On 9 November, Lilia Chanysheva, the former coordinator of Navalny’s offices in Ufa, was placed in pre-trial detention.Dozens of Navalny’s team and regional coordinators from his wider political movement have now left Russia fearing political persecution. Yuri Zhdanov, the father of Ivan Zhdanov, the director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, was arrested on spurious charges of “forgery” and “large-scale fraud” in March 2021.Aleksei Navalny faces further bogus charges and up to 15 additional years in prison on top of his current sentence. He stands accused of “contempt of court”, “fraud on an especially large scale” and “money laundering” in relation to alleged misappropriation of donations to his NGOs. He has also been charged with creating an organization that “infringes on the personality and rights of citizens.”“The callous actions of the Kremlin, who remain hellbent on silencing and vilifying Aleksei Navalny and his supporters, must end now. More than 360,000 people around the world have signed a petition set up by Amnesty International that calls for the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Aleksei Navalny,” said Marie Struthers. 
More than 360,000 people around the world have signed a petition set up by Amnesty International that calls for the Russian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release Aleksei Navalny 
“We call on world leaders, international organizations and people across the world to add their voices not only to the call for Aleksei Navalny’s immediate release, but also for the end of brutal reprisals against his supporters. The people of Russia should not have to suffer from the relentless suppression of their human rights. They deserve to have their voices heard without fear of reprisals.”BackgroundAleksei Navalny, an outspoken Kremlin critic, author of groundbreaking investigations into high-level corruption in Russia and founder of several civil society organizations, was arbitrarily detained on 17 January 2021 in Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport upon his arrival from Berlin, where he had been recovering after being poisoned in Siberia in August 2020.He was placed in pre-trial detention for allegedly failing to report regularly to his probation officer in person while recovering from his near-fatal poisoning.The European Court of Human Rights found Aleksei Navalny’s conviction in 2014 and subsequent prison sentence to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”On 14 January 2022, Leonid Volkov and Ivan Zhdanov, two associates of Navalny, were added to a list of “extremists” by the Russian finance regulator. Their assets in Russia are now blocked.

China’s capital will welcome athletes, officials and diplomats from around the world for the Games, which begin on 4 February. But the event will take place against a backdrop of myriad ongoing human rights violations in the country.    
“The Beijing Olympic Games promise to be a memorable sporting spectacle, but the watching world cannot wilfully ignore what is happening elsewhere in China: the lawyers and activists imprisoned for their peaceful work; the sexual assault survivors punished for speaking up; the thousands estimated to be executed each year; the Muslim ethnic groups facing systematic mass internment, torture and persecution,” said Alkan Akad, Amnesty International’s China Researcher. 
“The Games should not be used as a distraction from China’s appalling human rights record. On the contrary, they should be an opportunity to press China to address these issues.” 
IOC should ensure promises are kept 
The Chinese government made a series of assurances related to human rights ahead of hosting the Winter Olympics, including on respecting media freedom, labour rights, “displacement” and ensuring genuine opportunities for peaceful demonstrations during the Games. 
Amnesty International is calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to fully implement and publicly disclose its human rights due diligence policies and practices in the lead-up to, and during, the Games. 
“The right to freedom of expression is systematically violated in China. That’s why it’s vital that the IOC and the various National Olympic Committees at the Games adequately respect athletes’ and sports officials’ wishes to speak out about human rights, including on issues deemed ‘sensitive’ by the authorities,” Alkan Akad said. 
“The IOC must also insist that the Chinese government keeps its promise to guarantee media freedom, including unrestricted internet access for Chinese and international journalists, and ensure that people who want to peacefully protest during the Games are able to do so.” 
Amnesty International urges government representatives, including those who plan to attend the Olympic Games, to place human rights at the top of the agenda in their discussions with Chinese authorities. 
“The world must heed the lessons of Beijing 2008 Games, when Chinese government promises of human rights improvements never materialized,” Alkan Akad said. 
“The Beijing Winter Olympics must not be allowed to pass as a mere sportswashing opportunity for the Chinese authorities, and the international community must not become complicit in a propaganda exercise.” 
The peaceful activists detained in China 
Ahead of the Games, Amnesty International has launched its ‘Free the Five’ campaign highlighting the plight of five Chinese activists among the many detained for exercising their rights to freedom of expression. They are: citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, Uyghur professor Ilham Tohti, labour rights activist Li Qiaochu, human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng and Tibetan blogger Rinchen Tsultrim. 
“The unjust imprisonment of these five peaceful activists is emblematic of the Chinese government’s intolerance of all opposing views, and its eagerness to punish dissent in the harshest possible terms,” Alkan Akad said. 
“If the Chinese government wants to use the Olympics as a showcase for the country, it should start by releasing all those who have been prosecuted or detained solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.” 
Athletes must be allowed to speak freely 
The IOC has pledged – through its Safe Sport initiative – to support the rights of athletes and protect them from harassment and abuse “on and off the field”. However, the strict Covid-19 “bubble” imposed at Beijing 2022 will severely limit athletes’ freedom of movement in a way that could make it even more difficult for them to freely exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 
Late last year, tennis player and three-time Olympian, Peng Shuai, made sexual assault allegations against a former Chinese Vice Premier in a social media post that was quickly censored in China. When reference to her was scrubbed from the internet and she disappeared from public view, fellow players and the Women’s Tennis Association expressed fears about Peng’s fate. Nearly three weeks after her post was censored, the IOC responded by arranging a video call with Peng in an attempt to ease concerns about her well-being and whereabouts. 
“The IOC accepted assurances about Peng Shuai’s well-being without corroborating whether she experienced any limitations to her freedom of expression, freedom of movement and right to privacy, therefore running the risk of whitewashing possible violations of Peng Shuai’s human rights,” Alkan Akad said. 
After heavy criticism, in December the IOC acknowledged “we can’t give assurances and don’t know the full facts”. They insisted that “all aspects of the case are being discussed with the Chinese side” and this would continue beyond the Games. 
“Amid the severe restrictions in place at Beijing 2022, the IOC must do better at keeping its promise to protect athletes’ right to voice their opinions – and above all to ensure it is not complicit in any violations of athletes’ rights,” Alkan Akad said.

Additional information  
Around 8.15 am on 31 December 2021, Noureddine Bhiri and his wife, both lawyers, left their house in the district of Manar 1, in Tunis, and got into their car to drive to the office they share when four cars pulled up and trapped their car in the street. Around ten men in civilian clothing got out of the four cars, struck Noureddine Bhiri and his wife on the head and ordered Noureddine Bhiri to go with them. The men refused to identify themselves and did not present an arrest warrant. Noureddine Bhiri was detained incommunicado at an undisclosed location until 2 January, when his family and lawyers learned that he had been transferred to the Bougatfa hospital in Bizerte, a town in northern Tunisia, where he remains held. Authorities have since allowed Noureddine Bhiri’s family to visit him in hospital but have continued to refuse his lawyers access to him, in violation of his due process rights.  
Around 10.30 am on 31 December 2021, Fathi Beldi was driving his car out of his garage in Ariana, Tunis, when several cars pulled up and men in civilian clothes got out and arrested him without showing an arrest warrant. The men also confiscated his car. Later that day, National Guard officers in Borj El Amri, a city 30 km from Tunis, called his family to inform them of the arrest, but refused to disclose his whereabouts, detaining him incommunicado without access to his family and lawyers. On 5 January, National Guard officers brought Fathi Beldi from his place of detention to the Borj El Amri police station, where they allowed him to meet with his family. However, they monitored the meeting and did not allow them to discuss Fathi Beldi’s place of detention. Throughout his detention, officers have denied him access to his lawyers. To date, neither of the two men’s lawyers have found any evidence that their detention is the result of a judicial order. Without access to their lawyers or a judicial authority, neither Noureddine Bhiri nor Fathi Beldi have been granted their right to challenge their detention or be promptly informed of charges against them, both core fair trial rights.  
On 25 July 2021, President Kais Saied suspended parliament and dismissed Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, citing emergency powers under Article 80 of the Constitution. In September 2021, he issued Decree-Law 117, which suspended most of the Constitution; granting him total control of most aspects of governance, including the right to legislate through decrees and gave him supreme executive power. Since then, the authorities have imposed several repressive measures against judges, senior states officials and parliamentarians such as arbitrary house arrest and travel bans. There has also been an increasing pattern of referral of civilians, including opposition politicians and critics of the President, before military courts.  
Noureddine Bhiri (63) is a former Minister of Justice who served from 2011 to 2013 in a coalition government following the ouster of president Zine el Abidine Ben Ali and elections of a National Constituent Assembly. A lawyer and member of the Tunisian bar, he is also the vice-president of Ennahdha, one of Tunisia’s most powerful political parties and heads the party’s group in parliament. The party has criticised President Saied’s concentration of powers since the July 2021 suspension of parliament, calling it a “coup”. Noureddine Bhiri suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, and normally takes regular medication for both ailments. His health is at risk, as he is refusing to take food, water or medicine to protest his arbitrary detention and is nourished only through intravenous fluids. Fathi Beldi (55) is a former official at the Interior Ministry in the General Department in charge of borders and foreign nationals. Several media outlets reported in November 2021 that the current Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine, forced several officials into forced retirement, among them Fathi Beldi. Lawyers for both Noureddine Bhiri and Fathi Beldi have attempted to determine whether judicial authorities had ordered their detention or sought to prosecute them for recognizable offences under the law but have found no evidence to this effect.  
The authorities allowed the head of the Tunisian bar association to visit Noureddine Bhiri in his place of detention on 31 December, even though he later declared in an a radio interview that he could not determine the location. Members of the Tunisia’s National Authority for the Prevention of Torture (INPT) and representatives from the Tunisia office of the UN’s Office of the High Commissioner for Human rights were also allowed to visit both Noureddine Bhiri and Fathi Beldi in detention.  
On 3 January, the Interior Minister said in a press conference, referring apparently to Noureddine Bhiri and Fathi Beldi, that the two men had been arrested under Article 5 of the 1978 presidential decree. Article 5 grants the Interior Minister the right to order “forced internment” or house arrests against a person who represents a danger to security and public order. The Interior Minister went on to say that the two men were involved in an affair linked to terrorism for “the illegal issuance” of passports to non-Tunisians in 2013, while Noureddine Bhiri was Justice Minister, and the Interior Ministry has detained them because the judicial authorities had thus far not ordered their arrest. On 4 January, the office of the general prosecutor of the first instance tribunal in Tunis stated that the court had opened an investigation into the matter on 24 December, without giving further details.  
Under international law, and most specifically the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Tunisia is a state party, certain human rights cannot be restricted even in times of emergency. These include the right to life, the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment, the prohibition of discrimination, and freedom of religion, as well as the right to a fair trial and from the prohibition of arbitrary detention, in particular the right of every detainee to have their detention reviewed by an independent tribunal.  
Keeping people in secret or otherwise undisclosed places of detention violates the right to liberty and the prohibition of arbitrary arrest or detention, enshrined in Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As people held in undisclosed places of detention are held outside the reach of the law, no procedure established by law is being applied to them as required by Article 9 and 14 of the Covenant, they have not been formally informed of the charges against them or had the chance to examine any evidence to support those charges to enable them to prepare an effective defense and challenge their detention. Furthermore, Article 17 (1) of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance states that no one shall be held in secret detention and calls on states to ensure that national legislation guarantees that any person deprived of liberty shall be held solely in officially recognized and supervised places of detention.

Technical experts from the Amnesty International Security Lab...,"A joint investigation by Access Now and the Citizen Lab has identified the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware against journalists and members of civil society organizations in El Salvador on a massive scale. Technical experts from the Amnesty International Security Lab have peer-reviewed the report and independently verified forensic evidence showing that Pegasus has been misused in the country. 
The use of Pegasus for the surveillance of communications in El Salvador reveals a new threat to human rights in the country. The authorities must stop any efforts to restrict freedom of expression, and conduct a thorough and impartial investigation to identify those responsible. 
“It’s unacceptable that reports of harassment and threats against journalists and human rights defenders, who work in a hostile environment and are at serious risk, are becoming more and more common in El Salvador,” added Erika Guevara-Rosas. “The international community must stand with human rights defenders and journalists in their demand for respect for human rights.” 
Since President Nayib Bukele took office in 2019, the human rights situation in the country has deteriorated swiftly. Freedom of expression has been one of the rights facing the most obstacles, with state officials repeatedly publicly expressing their refusal to accept dissent and seeking to discredit those who expose practices by the authorities that violate or threaten human rights.  
In this context, in November 2021, it was made public that several journalists and members of civil society organizations received an alert from Apple warning them that they were possibly being subjected to targeted surveillance  by “state-sponsored attackers”. 
The Amnesty International Security Lab independently analyzed technical data from a sample of individuals identified as Pegasus targets in the joint Access Now and Citizen Lab investigation. This sample included multiple journalists from two media outlets. The forensic analysis confirmed that each device was successfully infected with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. The earliest evidence of compromise from the sampled devices was on or around 30 July 2020. Signs of compromise or attempted targeting continue as recently as 15 November 2021.   
“This investigation shows that, yet again, the Pegasus spyware continues to be abused in the world to unlawfully surveil journalists on a massive scale even after the groundbreaking revelations of the Pegasus Project,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“So far not enough has been done globally to reign in unlawful targeted surveillance. We urgently need governments to implement a global moratorium on the sale, transfer, and use of spyware until human rights regulatory safeguards are in place.”

Not only did this not happen, but the human rights situation in China deteriorated and has continued to worsen sharply during the past decade. 
Among the many human rights violations committed by the Chinese authorities, their systematic violation of the right to freedom of expression demands specific attention in the Olympic context. While hosting a mega sports event aiming to celebrate international exchange and mutual understanding, the Chinese government is implementing an immense system of massive censorship and crushing control over what people can say and see. China should not be allowed to use the Olympics to sportswash its human rights record. 
These Winter Olympics, Amnesty is highlighting five individuals who have been imprisoned, otherwise detained or disappeared for exercising their human right to freedom of expression. These individuals all belong to communities that have been particularly harshly targeted in the Chinese government’s continuing assault on freedom of expression and related human rights. We are calling for their immediate release and an end to the harassment and persecution of all those peacefully exercising their rights.

Matthew Reeves was put to death by lethal injection in Alabama on the evening of 27 January after the Governor of Alabama declined to intervene and the US Supreme Court vacated an injunction against the execution imposed earlier in the month by a lower court and upheld on appeal.   
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.  
Matthew Reeves was convicted in 1998 of a murder committed in Selma, Alabama, in 1996, when he was 18 years old. After a 90-minute sentencing phase, the jury voted 10-2 for the death penalty. The defense lawyers had presented no expert assessment on the question of Matthew Reeves’ intellectual disability. At a state post-conviction hearing, an expert for the defense testified that Matthew Reeves had intellectual disability. The state presented a psychologist who testified that Reeves had an IQ of 68 and operated in the “borderline range of intellectual ability”.  In 2020, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the trial lawyers’ performance was “deficient”; “the mitigating evidence that counsel failed to obtain and present was powerful” and its absence was “sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome”. However, in 2021, the Supreme Court overturned this without providing Reeves with an opportunity to brief the matter or provide oral argument. Three Justices dissented, with two of them noting that the decision “continues a troubling trend in which this Court strains to reverse summarily any grants of relief to those facing execution”.  
On 7 January 2022, a federal judge issued an injunction blocking Matthew Reeves’ execution by any method other than nitrogen hypoxia. Alabama had granted those on death row a one-off opportunity to choose this new method, instead of the default method, lethal injection. Matthew Reeves did not fill in the election form; his lawyers said he would have chosen hypoxia. The federal judge agreed that because of his cognitive deficits, Matthew Reeves was unable to read and understand the form without assistance, and the failure of officials to provide such assistance was discriminatory on grounds of disability. The judge ruled it would not harm the state to delay the execution until it has developed its nitrogen hypoxia protocol, which was apparently only a matter of months away. The state appealed. On 26 January, a three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit upheld the injunction, noting among other things expert evidence that Matthew Reeves’s “language competency was that of someone between the ages of 4 and 10”, well below what was required to be able to understand the execution form.   
The state appealed to the US Supreme Court and the execution, scheduled for 6pm local time, was delayed while the Justices considered the case. At 7.25pm, the stay was lifted after the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to vacate the injunction. In their dissent, three Justices noted that four judges on two courts – “after extensive record development, briefing, and argument” – had decided that the execution should be blocked. Yet, the Supreme Court had “disregard[ed] the well-supported findings” made by the lower courts.  A lawyer for Matthew Reeves said that it was “disappointing and disheartening” that the Supreme Court had “felt no need to explain its decision”.  
Matthew Reeves made no final statement before his lethal injection was carried out. He was pronounced dead at around 9.24pm, about 21 minutes after the execution began.  
In a statement, Governor Kay Ivey said that the death sentence was “fair, and tonight, justice was rightfully served,” Among those who had appealed to her for clemency was the European Union Ambassador to the USA, who wrote to the Governor on 20 January calling for the execution not to go ahead.    
This was the first execution in Alabama in 2022, and the second in the USA. There have now been 1,542 executions in the USA since the US Supreme Court approved new capital laws in 1976. Alabama accounts for 69 of these executions.

0,Valentines for Land Defenders: Show You Care,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/activism-guide/valentines-for-land-defenders-show-you-care/,Show you care by sending a Valentine to a Wet'suwet'en Land Defender,"Several weeks have passed since heavily armed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers (RCMP) entered Wet’suwet’en territory in Northwest British Columbia to enforce an injunction obtained by Coastal Gaslink. Video footage, often graphic, shows the violent arrests of various people between late September and the end of November, including two journalists, elders, and hereditary Chiefs. 
The use of K9 units, heavily armed police, and helicopters against peaceful land defenders for the third time in as many years shocked people both within and outside Canada. Immediately after the arrests, solidarity actions with Wet’suwet’en land defenders sprang up around the globe. The use of armed police to end peaceful resistance efforts puts into question Canada’s sincerity regarding reconciliation and respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples, as well as its commitment to addressing climate change.  
Show you care by writing a Valentine for a land and water defender! For the next four weeks, Amnesty will collect Solidarity Valentines and deliver them to the defenders who are facing charges. This action is open from January 13 to February 10th. 
Instructions: 
Take a photo of your Valentine and upload it to this Google folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18PrCfMtT0fL_pdqKd0EFaqQ7ZtO3XgA4?usp=sharing 
You can also simply send a photo of your Valentine to edumitru@amnesty.ca and she will upload it to the drive. 
Share this action with your family, friends, professional associations, community groups and colleagues and ask them to join you in showing solidarity with Wet’suwet’en land defenders. 
We will print your messages and deliver them to courageous Wet’suwet’en Land and Water Defenders. We’ll share photos of the delivery of your messages on our social media accounts and in this space.  
After February 14: We will continue to gather Love Letters for Land Defenders throughout 2022. The work of land defenders might be highly visible and or personal and invisible: we want to celebrate all the actions taken by land defenders. Our aim is to gather thousands of messages of solidarity with land defenders across Turtle Island, over the Medicine Line, and throughout the Americas. We will be calling on creative people, quilters, knitters, weavers, painters and poets to turn these messages into beautiful works of art which we will share with community partners from Canada to Colombia in the second half of 2022. Please check this blog space after February 14 for more information. 
Another way for people living in BC’s Lower Mainland to show their solidarity with all women is to take part in the 31st annual Women’s Memorial March on Monday, February 14 in Vancouver, British Columbia. For 31 years, the Valentines Day march has been a way to show compassion and caring for all women, including Indigenous women and girls, two spirit and trans people, in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The annual march is a powerful, beautiful, and meaningful event led by women from the Downtown Eastside. If you cannot attend in person, follow the link to find out about other ways you can support and for important information related to participating in the march.  
Ways to take further action today:  
If you would like to learn more about joining a divestment campaign in your community, please send an email to Corporate Accountability & Climate Justice Campaigner, Tara Scurr: tscurr@amnesty.ca

On February 24, the defenders were released and reunited with their families. They have pledged to renew efforts to defend the Guapinol River from the contaminating impact of an iron ore project that was granted a concession in a protected area. THANK YOU to everyone who wrote letters calling for release of the defenders! No further action is required at this time. 
At a time of such pain in the 🌎, images of the @guapinolre defenders of #Honduras free at last, reunited with their families and companions in the struggle to protect the Guapinol River is incredibly heartening!#LibertadParaGuapinol #JusticiaParaGuapinol ✊🏾💧🇭🇳 https://t.co/oXMpW1yDLM 
Write a letter to call for the release of eight water defenders who have been unjustly imprisoned for more than two years in Honduras.  
Their names are José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández, Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz (for individual bios of each defender see below). 
The eight men are active in the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Assets in the northern Honduran municipality of Tocoa. The committee has been mobilizing peacefully against a concession granted to a mining company called Inversiones Los Pinares, due to concerns about its environmental impact on the Guapinol River. The river is a vital source of water for communities in the area. Authorities granted permission for the iron ore mining and processing project in a formerly protected national park. For more about challenges to the legalities of the concession, read the Additional Information section below. 
The eight Guapinol water defenders were charged with committing acts of violence, despite lack of evidence. They have been in jail without access to due process or a fair trial for more than two years. 
The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detentions has called the jailing of the Guapinol River defenders “arbitrary”, without a legal basis for depriving them of their liberty, and a violation of their human rights. 
Arbitrary detention is a common intimidation tactic to suppress dissent or deter protest.  
In December 2021, Amnesty International declared the Guapinol River defenders to be prisoners of conscience who should be freed immediately. Amnesty’s investigation concludes that the detention and prosecution of the eight water defenders is politically motivated in retaliation for their involvement in peaceful efforts to stop the mine project of Inversiones Los Pinares and protect the Guapinol river from contamination.

Additional Information 
José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández, Arnol Javier Alemán and Jeremías Martínez Díaz have been in pre-trial detention for more than two years in Honduras awaiting trial (scheduled for December 1, 2021) accused of kidnapping and aggravated arson against the head of security of the mining company Inversiones Los Pinares, and of aggravated arson against the company. 
The eight are human rights defenders active in the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Assets (Comité Municipal de Defensa de los Bienes Comunes y Públicos , CMDBCP). It brings together the Environmental Committees of Sector San Pedro (13 communities) and Sector Abisinia Committee (14 communities); Environmental Committee of the Community of Guapinol, campesino groups and the organizations Coordinadora de Organizaciones Populares del Aguán (COPA); Fundación San Alonso Rodríguez (FSAR) and Parroquia San Isidro de Tocoa. 
Since 2015, the CMDBCP has mobilized against the ASP and ASP2 concessions granted by the Honduran Institute of Geology and Mines to the mining company Inversiones Los Pinares in Carlos Escaleras National Park, located in the municipality of Tocoa. CMDBCP filed criminal complaints against officials from INHGEOMIN, the Honduran Forest Conservation Institute and the Ministry of Environment, as well as the municipal mayor of Tocoa, for abuse of authority and environmental crime in relation to the mining concession and exploitation of the core zone of the protected area on which the communities’ water supply depends. 
Given lack of progress in these processes, in August 2018, the CMDBCP established the “Guapinol camp” on a public road as a form of peaceful protest. The goal was to block the company from reaching its operation and thereby protect the Guapinol and San Pedro rivers. The camp remained for almost three months until Honduran authorities violently evicted the protestors. 
The indictment against the eight defenders is related to serious incidents that took place near the camp on September 7, 2018. That morning, a contingent of between 30 and 50 private security guards hired by Inversiones Los Pinares, led by a former army officer and accompanied by company representatives, as well as Military Police officers, arrived with heavy vehicles near the protest camp to erect fencing that would cut off community access. More than 200 protesters approached to disrupt the fencing. As tensions increased, the police and company representatives withdrew. The company’s private security negotiated with the protesters to leave the site. However, a company vehicle reportedly drove back towards the protesters, rolled down a window and fired a gun, resulting in a gunshot wound to the chest of one of the protesters. The car then fled the scene. The protesters called for medical assistance for the wounded man. They held the former army officer for being the leader of the group and handed him over to the National Police to be investigated for the injuries caused to the wounded demonstrator. This complaint was not taken up by the authorities. 
At the beginning of 2019, a judge in San Pedro Sula issued, without prior notice, an arrest warrant for the crimes of robbery, kidnapping, aggravated arson and unlawful association (the latter requiring pre-trial detention) against 31 people, including the eight defenders. José Daniel Márquez, Kelvin Alejandro Romero, José Abelino Cedillo, Porfirio Sorto Cedillo, Ewer Alexander Cedillo, Orbin Nahún Hernández and Arnol Javier Alemán decided to voluntarily present themselves at the San Pedro Sula court on August 21, where they were not received, and were sent to Tegucigalpa. On August 26, 2021, the hearing of the accused took place in the capital of Honduras, where the judge decreed the judicial detention. A week later, on September 1, the court charged them with unlawful deprivation of liberty and aggravated arson and ordered their preventive detention but acquitted them of the crimes of illicit association and aggravated robbery. On November 29, 2019, after having spent more than two months in a high security prison, the authorities transferred them to the Olanchito Penal Center, where they have remained ever since.  
For his part, Jeremías Martínez Díaz has been held at the La Ceiba Prison since December 5, 2018. He was arrested on November 29, 2018, by police officers who had been assigned to provide him with protection granted by the National Protection Mechanism for human rights defenders and journalists, in compliance with the precautionary measures of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights , following attacks suffered by members of the Unified Campesino Movement of Aguan (MUCA). Martínez Díaz was taken to court in San Pedro Sula, as his name appeared on a previous arrest warrant, to face charges of usurpation of public space and damages against Inversiones Los Pinares, of which he was acquitted in March 2021. However, he is still being held on charges of the second arrest warrant.    
So far, the various appeals against the detention of the eight defenders and habeas corpus petitions filed to request an alternative measure to pre-trial detention have been declared inadmissible and the most recent requests are pending resolution. 
Honduras is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for human rights defenders. Front Line Defenders ranks the country third in the number of killings of human rights defenders in the world, and Global Witness ranks the country second in the number of killings per capita of those defending human rights related to land, territory and the environment. The vast majority of killings and attacks against human rights defenders remain unpunished. Amnesty International has also documented threats, attacks and other aggressions against human rights defenders, as well as reports of enforced disappearances.  Human rights defenders, particularly those protecting human rights related to land, territory and the environment, often face unfounded criminal prosecutions. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Honduras has drawn attention to the possible use of the crimes of usurpation and forced displacement to criminalize defenders.

Spoilers ahead! For those who haven’t yet seen it, the film depicts the desperate and sometimes questionable actions of an astronomy professor, his PhD student and their NASA ally to prevent the earth from being destroyed by a ‘planet killer’ sized comet. The ratings-obsessed and corporate-captured President at first downplays the seriousness of the impending disaster but after an unrelated political scandal threatens her leadership, she decides to back the scientists in an effort to improve her polling numbers. However, like mercurial Presidents-past, she soon scrubs her plan to destroy the comet by instead allowing a megalomaniac tech baron to deploy untested technology that would break up and of mine the comet, rendering it harmless and his company spectacularly rich. As expected, his plan utterly fails and humanity is doomed (except for 2000 well-heeled corporate VPs and their families, who make it onto the President’s cyro-chambered spaceship and flee into deep space to find an colonize a new earth in a new solar system). While all of this is taking place, regular folk appear to be equally as ill-equipped and distracted by ‘likes’ as their leaders to do anything to change the outcome. This message is the warning at the centre of the film. 
Fortunately, however bleak the message might be, it doesn’t entirely line up with reality. 
One of 2021’s parting lessons is that organization, persistence, and belief in people power can bring about change. Some of these victories are outlined in a recent Guardian UK article, which praises the persistence of community groups, shareholders, and students in facing down and beating powerful fossil fuel companies.  
There are other reasons to hope, writes Amnesty International’s Climate Policy Advisor, Chiara Ligouri, in the tireless efforts and dedication of climate campaigners from the most climate-affected countries. 
“It is also thanks to this large cross-cutting movement that governments of poorer countries are putting their feet down in climate negotiations every year with more strength. The struggle is still long, but the movement is becoming so strong and so loud that it is becoming impossible to ignore its demands.” 
We also draw inspiration from the courageous climate defenders of the Americas, like Bernardo Caal Xol, Jani Silva, the Guapinol Water Defenders, Berta Caceres and Chile’s Mujeres Modatima. You can read about their courageous efforts to protect the environment and Amnesty’s campaigns to support them. 
As civil society and Indigenous leaders said after the failures in leadership during COP26: now is the time to redouble our efforts, not to give up! 
Those looking to make an even bigger contribution to climate justice work in 2022 will have a lot of options for sharing your organizing, debating, writing, disrupting and – of course – clever sloganeering skills. Join us for some of the many learning and sharing opportunities coming your way, such as: 
Food for thought: If your community were to reduce traffic by 25 percent by 2030 (ie within the next 8 years), what would that look like? What would it take to get there? Who would need to be involved in your community? What gaps in bus service, bike and scooter lanes, or walkability would need to be filled in the next 8 years to make this vision a reality? Close your eyes and imagine what that would be like. Does this sound like something you could envision in your community? Let us know!

Recognizing the deep injustice of this situation, several Amnesty International Canada National Organizers came together to work on the issue. ...","As of August 2021, around 85% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines had gone to wealthy countries while low-income countries had received less than 1%. Recognizing the deep injustice of this situation, several Amnesty International Canada National Organizers came together to work on the issue.  
We decided to organize an online event to raise awareness about the importance of vaccine equity. At the event, we were lucky to have been joined by Hilary Homes, the Crisis and Tactical Advisor at Amnesty International Canada, who delivered a presentation on the basics of vaccine inequity, why the topic is important and relevant for Canadians, and what actions pharmaceutical companies and wealthy nations can take to eliminate the issue.  
Canada has been neutral on many decisions that would ease global access to COVID-19 vaccines.  
For this reason, the second half of our event focused on taking action, with participants having the opportunity to help in demanding a fair COVID-19 vaccine through letter-writing. In breakout rooms, AI National Organizers shared with participants the pre-made letter template we had drafted, where they could sign the letter as is, add something to what was already written, or edit it as much as they pleased.  
However, the action did not stop once the event ended. In fact, the event also served as the launch of our national letter-writing campaign to call on the federal government of Canada to advocate for a more equitable vaccine distribution worldwide. More specifically, we called on the federal government to take on two actions: 
Temporarily waiving the WHO Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement would help ensure an equitable and global public health response to COVID-19. This provision would allow World Health Organization member states to legally increase manufacturing on COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics by temporarily waiving the intellectual property on those products until the end of the pandemic. This would therefore allow for an increased production of COVID-19 vaccines and for lower-income countries to better access doses to inoculate their citizens. While Canada claims to not oppose the waiver, it has not supported it either. 
Moreover, the Canada Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR) program is a system where a foreign government and a Canadian company can make a request to manufacture and export a medicine. Under this program, the federal government can waive patent rights and allow other generic-producing companies in Canada to start production of COVID-19 vaccines, allowing for more manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines that can be distributed worldwide to lower income countries.  
If Canada implemented these actions, they could serve as an example to other wealthy nations and contribute significantly to a more equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution.   
From the date of the event to November 26, we shared our letter template to other Amnesty chapters, groups, and campus clubs across Canada to get more support with our campaign. Notably, we had 2 university Amnesty groups from the University of Toronto and the University of Calgary organize vaccine equity letter-writing events around our letter template, which were significant contributions to our campaign. The Grandmothers Advocacy Network also participated and sent an outstanding number of letters. 
As of November 26, we had close to 200 letters printed and sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  
More than 1.2 billion additional people in low and lower-middle income countries can be vaccinated by the end of 2021 if rich countries and pharmaceutical companies agree to distribute the doses more fairly.  
If you would like to learn more about this, check out Amnesty International’s 100 Day Countdown campaign. You can also take action on vaccine equity by signing Amnesty’s petition calling on pharmaceutical companies to do their part in ending this pandemic by sharing their work so that more vaccines can be produced faster and distributed more equitably.  
We feel fortunate to have access to vaccines, and we are motivated by the belief that a person’s’ right to health should not be dependent on where they live. We can only hope the federal government will take action on vaccine equity by the end of 2021. If not, we can guarantee our advocacy for this issue will not finish by the end of the year either. As the rise of more COVID-19 variants have shown us, in a global pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is safe.

January 
Global: Amnesty International’s ground-breaking report on how health workers around the world had been exposed, silenced and attacked during the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in Ibrahim Badawi, a doctor, and Ahmad al-Daydoumy, a dentist, being released from detention in Egypt in January and March this year. They were just two of the many health workers arbitrarily detained in 2020 in Egypt, on vague and overly broad charges of “spreading false news” and “terrorism”, which Amnesty highlighted in its research.   
February 
Sri Lanka: Following the outbreak of Covid-19 in Sri Lanka, a number of people from the Muslim community were forcibly cremated on the instructions of the authorities and against the wishes of the deceased’s families. Amnesty International called for Sri Lanka’s authorities to respect the right of religious minorities to carry out the final rites of their relatives in accordance with their own traditions unless restrictions were needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Amnesty also engaged with Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) states to impress upon the Sri Lankan government to change this discriminatory policy, and placed op-eds in Pakistan and Bangladesh ahead of a key session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. As a result, Sri Lankan authorities decided to end the practice of forced cremations for victims of Covid-19 in February. 
Saudi Arabia: Women human rights defender and University of British Columbia graduate Loujain al-Hathloul was released from prison. After nearly three years in prison, 32-year-old Loujain was finally reunited with her family.   
Algeria: Authorities released more than 30 pro-democracy activists from jail, including journalist Khaled Drareni who was jailed for covering protestes. Khaled’s case was featured in our Write for Rights 2020 campaign, where thousands of people in Canada and across the world took action for his release: “It is thanks to you, it is thanks to the work of Amnesty International and other organizations, that we were released, that I am free today.”March 
Canada: The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government’s carbon tax is constitutional. As part of our campaign for climate justice, Amnesty International was an intervenor in this landmark case.  
Bahrain: Amnesty International helped to secure several prisoner releases in Bahrain this year, including four children who had been tried as adults. In March, a Bahraini court suspended a six-month prison sentence against the four and placed them in a rehabilitation programme instead – one week after Amnesty issued an urgent action. In April, there was more good news with the release of prisoner of conscience, Mohammed Hassan Jawad, who had been serving a 15-year prison sentence for his peaceful participation in the 2011 uprising. Amnesty International has been campaigning for his release for a decade. In another breakthrough, on 11 March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on Bahrain’s human rights situation and its treatment of human rights defenders, followed by another in September on Emirati prisoner of conscience Ahmed Mansoor – which echoed Amnesty’s recommendations.   
Japan: In March, a Japanese court ruled that the government’s failure to recognize same-sex marriage was unconstitutional – the country’s first-ever judicial ruling on marriage equality. The decision was a ground-breaking step for same-sex couples in their pursuit of equal rights and could set an important precedent for similar cases filed by other same-sex couples in Japan. This followed campaign calls and petitions from Amnesty International and others. 
Iraq: The Iraqi parliament passed the Yezidi Survivors Law which provides a framework for reparations for many survivors of ISIS atrocities in northern Iraq, including women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence and child survivors who were abducted before the age of 18. This was a key recommendation in a report published last year by Amnesty International on the physical and mental health crisis endured by Yezidi children separated from their families. The report was also referenced by Angelina Jolie in a speech to the UN Security Council regarding sexual violence in conflict. Additional bylaws were passed in September. 
Global: In March, October and November, the International Criminal Court (ICC) announced it would open formal investigations into the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the Philippine government’s deadly ‘war on drugs’ and crimes against humanity in Venezuela. Amnesty International has been documenting crimes against humanity in all these countries for several years, its research was cited dozens of times in the Prosecutor’s filing. 
Madagascar: After months of refusing to acknowledge Covid-19, the Malagasy government finally dropped its policy of refusing to order Covid-19 vaccines following pressure from Amnesty and others – giving more people a chance to access life-saving vaccines. 
South Africa: In March, police revived an investigation into the 2017 murders of best friends Popi Qwabe and Bongeka Phungula, after receiving a petition signed by more than 341,000 Amnesty International supporters worldwide demanding that their killers be brought to justice. The police have now completed their investigation and handed over the case to the country’s National Prosecuting Authority. After years of distress and anger over irregularities and delays in the original police investigation, Popi and Bongeka’s friends and families finally have reason to believe that justice for their loved ones is on the horizon. “I feel optimistic,” said Popi’s sister Thembelihle. “I feel like finally, something is about to change.” 
April 
Global: Amnesty International released its flagship annual report, The State of the World’s Human Rights. This latest edition covered the human rights situation in 149 countries and was translated into a record 38 languages. It also included specific advocacy calls on a range of human rights issues.May 
Global: Amnesty International won a prestigious Webby Award for its microsite on the abuse of tear gas by police forces around the world. The site was originally launched in mid-2020, and is frequently updated with new content and evidence of abuses. The material is also still being cited in ongoing advocacy, including in recent US Congressional debates around regulating or banning police use of tear gas. 
June 
Burundi: NGO worker and human rights defender Germain Rukuki was released from prison after spending more than four years behind bars for standing up for human rights. Initially sentenced to 32 years in prison on baseless charges, Germain was jailed before getting a chance to hold his youngest child, born just weeks after he was detained in July 2017. After more than 400,000 actions calling for his release, Germain is looking to be reunited with his family, who fled the country for fear of reprisals. 
Saudi Arabia: Prominent women human rights defenders Nassima al-Sada and Samar Badawi were released from prison. Three years earlier, they’d been jailed along with several other high-profile activists for their peaceful women’s rights activism. More than 40,000 Amnesty supporters in Canada sent messages to Saudi authorities demanding freedom for all the jailed women human rights defenders. Globally, more than more than 777,000 actions were sent in solidarity with Nassima during our global Write for Rights 2020 campaign. 
China: Amnesty International published an extensive report detailing how the draconian repression faced by Muslims in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region amounts to crimes against humanity. The report garnered significant global media coverage, and was followed up with a campaign calling for the closure of the internment camps. To date, the ‘Free Xinjiang Detainees’ petition has been signed by more than 323,000 people around the world and Amnesty International’s national teams in 10 countries have held petition handover events. 
Pakistan: Amnesty International successfully campaigned for the acquittal and release of Shafqat and Shagufta Emmanuel, a Christian couple, who spent seven years on death row on blasphemy charges.  
USA: Decode Surveillance NYC saw more than 7,000 Amnesty International supporters from 144 countries map 15,000 surveillance cameras across New York City which can be used by the NYPD to track people using facial recognition software. The results of the innovative project helped campaigners push local legislators for a ban on the use of the discriminatory technology. 
Nepal: After the launch of Amnesty International’s report, “Struggling to breathe”: The second wave of Covid-19 in Nepal, which was followed by sustained campaigning and advocacy initiatives, the Japanese government donated 1.6 million vaccines to Nepal, Bhutan donated 230,000 and the UK donated 130,000 doses. 
Nigeria: The Court of Justice of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) granted an order to prohibit Nigerian authorities from prosecuting anyone using Twitter in the country. This victory for freedom of expression came after Amnesty International helped Nigerian NGO, the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), to bring a case against the Nigerian authorities over their threat to prosecute anyone using Twitter after they implemented a blanket ban on the social platform in June. 
July 
Nicaragua: After more than two years locked up in an immigration detention facility in California where she was abused and denied access to adequate medical care, Maura Martínez, a transgender woman originally from Nicaragua, was finally freed in July.  Martínez had spent half her life in the United States where she sought safety after experiencing relentless gender-based violence while living in Mexico. However, after a legal incident, US authorities detained and threatened to deport her. Thanks to a global campaign by Amnesty International and partner organizations, she is now free and able to live in the USA while she awaits the adjudication of her asylum claim. 
Honduras: On 5 July 2021, a court in Honduras convicted David Castillo, the former manager of the company Desarrollos Energéticos and the person in charge of the Agua Zarca hydroelectric project, of participating in the 2016 murder of the human rights defender Berta Cáceres. Amnesty International has campaigned for justice for Berta for years and continues to demand that all those responsible for ordering or carrying out her murder face justice. 
Denmark: In early 2021, the Danish government proposed a draft law to parliament granting police the power to issue a “security-creating assembly ban” if a group of people exhibited “insecurity-inciting behaviour”. Amnesty Denmark and partners successfully prevented the Danish government from passing the law, which would have put undue restrictions on the right to protest. They won the Civic Pride Award 2021 for their campaigning. Another award winner was Amnesty Hungary, which campaigned against the abusive and stigmatising LexNGO law, as part of the Civilisacion coalition. Over 3 years, the coalition fought LexNGO, taking the case to the European Court of Justice, which eventually led to the repeal of the law. 
Sierra Leone: After years of sustained campaigning from Amnesty International and others, the parliament voted to abolish the death penalty in Sierra Leone for all crimes. The Act, approved by parliament in July, was being finalised before President Julius Maada Bio can sign it into law. The process of commuting all outstanding death sentences has already begun. As of 30 June 2021, 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa had abolished the death penalty for all crimes. 
Latin America: Amnesty International celebrated the achievements of its five-year human rights education programme, It’s My Body!, which set out to educate young people in Argentina, Chile and Peru about sexual and reproductive rights, enabling them to make positive changes in their community. Hundreds of young people were trained to provide support to others and the impact has been incredible. In Argentina, one young person successfully reformed a school curriculum to include comprehensive sexuality education, while in Peru, young people who took part in the project trained parents and teachers across the country. 
USA: After the previous US federal administration carried out 13 executions in six months, on 1 July 2021, the US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the establishment of a moratorium on executions pending the review of policies and procedure by the Department of Justice. Amnesty International has been one of the organizations campaigning for this outcome and will continue to work until this temporary measure is turned into permanent abolition of the US federal death penalty and all death sentences are commuted. 
August 
Afghanistan: Following the collapse of the Afghanistan government after the Taliban seized power in mid-August 2021, Amnesty International researchers continue to investigate atrocities committed by the group and were able to verify two massacres of Hazara people in the provinces of Ghazni and Daykundi by Taliban fighters. These reports were among the first evidence that the Taliban continued to persecute marginalized communities in Afghanistan as they took control of the country. Amnesty International also published powerful testimony from girls who were excluded from school, amidst ongoing Taliban threats and violence.September 
Guinea: After months of campaigning from Amnesty International and its supporters, pro-democracy activist Omar Sylla was unconditionally released on 6 September, the day after the military led a coup against President Alpha Conde. Following his release, dozens of political activists were also released and charges were dropped by the judiciary. 
Honduras: On 17 September, human rights activist Edwin Espinal was released from four years of hell. A Honduran court finally absolved Edwin, dropping the trumped up charges that had landed him first in solitary confinement and then in a military run prison where his life was threatened. More than 9,000 messages were sent from Canada alone to call for due process and a fair trial.   
Tunisia: Research by Amnesty International helped to end the practice of arbitrary travel bans imposed on many Tunisians following President Kais Saied’s seizure of exceptional powers. After Amnesty published a story on the situation, the president issued a statement on 17 September ordering the border police “not to impose any travel ban on people unless through a judicial order”. 
Global: Following years of advocacy, pressure and engagement from Amnesty International, the Human Rights Council recognized the Right to a Safe Clean Healthy and Sustainable Environment and created a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change – an emphatic statement leading up to COP26 about the link between human rights and the environmental crisis.   
Central African Republic: Two men suspected of crimes against humanity Mahamat Said Abdel Kani and Eugene Barret Ngaikosset were finally arrested, with Ngaikosset placed in custody by the Special Criminal Court (SCC). It was the first time the SCC publicly named a suspect and it came after Amnesty International called for the SCC to address its lack of transparency. Amnesty International has been advocating for justice for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in CAR for a number of years and our work – together with others – contributed to these two individuals being arrested. 
October 
Global: The European Parliament’s Daphne Caruana Prize for Journalism was awarded to the Pegasus Project, which saw Amnesty partner with major media organizations to expose the vast scale of violations perpetrated through secretive cyber surveillance. The revelations made global headlines and led to spyware company NSO Group being blacklisted by the USA, as well as triggering investigations in multiple countries, and calls for the surveillance industry to be properly regulated. 
Moldova: The parliament of Moldova ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention and Suppression of Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), opening the door to better protection and support to survivors of domestic violence and violence against women. According to the Moldovan government, the country has already adapted more than 20 legislative acts to meet the requirements of the convention. To date, the only other country in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to ratify the convention, in addition to Moldova, is Georgia. Amnesty has been actively promoting women’s rights and the fight against domestic violence for years. 
Kosovo: Following an intervention from Amnesty International, Austrian-based Kelkos Energy withdrew its baseless defamation lawsuits against environmental activists Shpresa Loshaj and Adriatik Gacaferi, who had publicly raised concerns about the environmental impact of hydropower projects. Austrian-based Kelkos Energy was using these lawsuits to intimidate and silence Shpresa and Adriatik from speaking out about the possible environmental damage caused by the company’s exploitation of Kosovo’s natural resources. 
Turkey: A court acquitted 18 students and an academic who had been prosecuted for taking part in a peaceful campus-based Pride parade in Ankara in May 2019, which was met with police using pepper spray, plastic bullets and tear gas. Their acquittal after a protracted legal battle was a victory for justice. The case of the METU students was part of Amnesty International’s flagship Write for Rights campaign in 2020. More than 445,000 people from 43 countries demanded their acquittal. 
Saudi Arabia: Ali al-Nimr, a young man who was sentenced to death as a teenager for participating in anti-government protests, was finally released on 27 October after nearly ten years in prison. More than 21,000 Amnesty supporters in Canada alone took part in the global campaign to save his life. 
November 
Guinea Bissau and Niger: Guinea Bissau and Niger declared they would allow individuals and NGOS to submit complaints to the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, bringing the number of countries to sign the declaration to eight. Amnesty’s advocacy campaign was pivotal, thanks to its educational video, social media campaign and sustained engagements with African Union actors and civil society groups. 
Germany/Iraq: In the world’s first criminal trial addressing genocide against the Yazidis, the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt, Germany, convicted Taha Al J. for genocide and crimes against humanity. This is the first time a former member of the armed group calling itself Islamic State (IS) has been convicted of genocide. 
December  
Chile: On 7 December, Chile officially passed a law that legalizes same-sex marriage. This bill has been under discussion in Congress since 2017. Chile’s LGBTI community has long pushed for the law. 
Canada: The Supreme Court of Canada announced its decision to review the constitutionality of the US-Canada Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) — a hopeful step for refugee rights in Canada! This decision follows a long history of legal challenges and more than 16 years of campaigning. Eight courageous refugee claimants from El Salvador, Ethiopia and Syria who were directly affected by the STCA are joining Amnesty International, the Canadian Council of Churches, and the Canadian Council for Refugees in our most recent challenge.

Amnesty International interviewed four displaced civilians and six local aid workers and volunteer humanitarian responders. Their powerful accounts highlight the military’s systematic attempts to starve people and prevent them from accessing health care as it seeks to crush armed resistance to the coup.  
For more than six decades, the military has applied a “four cuts” strategy in the country’s border areas, cutting off essential resources to destroy the support base of ethnic armed organizations fighting for self-determination. Now, it has expanded these tactics to areas where new People’s Defense Forces have emerged, as it continues to violently crack down on all forms of resistance to the coup. The military’s use of the four cuts strategy has had devastating consequences for the civilian population. 
As part of its war against armed resistance, the military has not only launched indiscriminate airstrikes and burned hundreds of homes, but it has also cut off vital items and services for civilian populations across diverse ethnicities and geographic areas.       
The United Nations has identified 284,700 people internally displaced due to armed clashes and insecurity since the coup and at least two million people newly in need of humanitarian assistance in 2021, while projecting that humanitarian needs will further escalate in 2022. 
On 9 December, the UN described “severely limited” humanitarian access with challenges including road blockages and increased scrutiny of humanitarian supplies and personnel. 
“Since the military seized power, the people of Myanmar have faced extreme hardships. Hundreds of thousands have been forced to leave their own homes. Many are suffering from hunger and facing the frightening reality of having to survive without health or medical care even as the pandemic continues,” said Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Research.  
Barely surviving in the forest 
Katherine* was entering the second trimester of her pregnancy when fighting between military forces and combined forces of civilian resistance groups and ethnic armed organizations erupted across Kayah State in May. The military responded to the new opposition front by conducting airstrikes, firing heavy artillery and shooting indiscriminately, causing 100,000 people to flee their homes as of 8 June, according to United Nations estimates.  
On 9 June, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar Tom Andrews warned of “mass deaths from starvation, disease and exposure” across the state as the military cut off displaced people’s access to food, water and medicine, including by blocking aid deliveries. 
When the fighting reached Katherine’s village in Demoso township, she and her husband fled into the forest with their two children. The family relocated several times for their safety and endured the rainy season sleeping under a sheet of tarpaulin. According to her husband, although they received some food from humanitarian aid groups and other villagers, it was insufficient.  
Around seven months into Katherine’s pregnancy, she began vomiting and suffering from dizzy spells, fatigue and shortness of breath. On one occasion, she went into seizures. By eight months, her limbs had swelled, and she had lost the ability to walk. She went into labor in October. Even though a midwife was present, neither Katherine nor her baby survived. 
“She could not access nutritious food or warm shelter. My wife faced difficulties during her pregnancy, and she became weak and unable to deliver the baby,” said her husband. 
Kayah State’s Hpruso township has also seen mass displacement since May, but Francis* could not immediately flee with his family because he is paralyzed from the waist down. His wife and mother-in-law ran into the forest with their four children, and he joined them the next day, when people from his village came back for him and carried him. 
The family returned home after a week and a half, but soon had to flee again because fighting resumed. In total, they spent about a month in the forest. “When we first ran, we just slept where we could, with no blanket or shelter. After one or two days, when things quieted down a bit, we brought some bedsheets and blankets [from home]. We stayed under a tarpaulin the whole time,” said Francis. 
His family and others who had to flee their village not only had to survive with whatever food and water they could find. They also could not access medicine or medical supplies. Francis’ wife usually uses rubber gloves and catheters to assist his bowel movements and urination, but they ran out while in the forest.  
In June, a charity group offered him more stable shelter, where he now stays with his wife and two youngest children.  Although the shelter offers better facilities and access to resources than the forest, Francis said food is still limited. He also fears that the place where he is staying could come under attack. 
Francis’ two older children are staying in their grandmother and aunt’s home, and they are still fleeing in and out of the forest as the fighting between the security forces and armed resistance groups continues. He wants to reunite with his children, but he worries it would create difficulties for those who are helping him. “If I choose to go back to the village and then I must flee again, I will be a burden to others. I cannot cope with that anymore, so I decided to stay here until things get better,” he said. 
Carrying loved ones on their backs 
In Sagaing and Magway Regions and Chin State, in Myanmar’s northwest, fighting between the military and civilian resistance groups as well as ethnic armed organizations has displaced more than 93,000 people according to the United Nations, as the military attacks residential areas with airstrikes, arson and indiscriminate gunfire. 
Tial Lian,* age 30, fled into the forest from her village in Chin State’s Mindat township with her husband, two children, her father and grandmother when clashes escalated in May. 
Because her father, age 77, and grandmother, whose age she estimates to be more than a hundred, are unable to walk well, Tial Lian and her husband carried them on their backs when their family fled. The family has since been going in and out of the forest, where Tial Lian and her husband have been constructing a small shelter out of tarpaulin. There would be times when, worried that their baby’s cries could alert soldiers to their location, the couple would run deeper into the forest with their children, leaving the two elderly people behind in the shelter for several days. 
Sometimes, rats gnaw holes in the tarpaulin, which offers little protection from the elements. “When it rains, our tarpaulin cannot bear the weight of the water. We get soaked, and our blankets too,” said Tial Lian. They also sometimes go for days without eating because they do not dare to make a fire when soldiers are nearby.  
Even when they can travel back to their village, accessing food and medicine is difficult. “The roads to buy rice are blocked, and no one sells rice in the village either,” said Tial Lian. 
“Because the road is blocked by soldiers, we have to pay 1500 kyats (approximately US$1) for supplies that would [usually] be only 1000 kyats,” she added. In addition to being short on rice, she said sometimes the family cannot access cooking oil, salt, or fish paste. 
According to UN estimates, renewed fighting since March between the Kachin Independence Organization and the military in Myanmar’s northernmost Kachin State has displaced more than 15,000 people across the state. 
Hkaw Reng* has not been back to her village in Injangyang township since fighting intensified in March. She left her village and walked with her one-year-old son for two days before setting up camp. They have since received limited humanitarian assistance. “Roads are blocked and the place where I am staying is remote, so it is hard to access food and medicine,” she said. 
Around April, Hkaw Reng found out she was pregnant, but she has not yet received any prenatal care. She worries about how she will deliver the baby, as traveling to a medical facility could take hours and she would need to pass through military checkpoints on the way. 
Cutting off supplies 
Six local humanitarian responders described ways the military has severely limited aid responses, including by arresting aid workers and by confiscating or destroying food, medicine and relief supplies or restricting their transport. 
“The military is denying life-saving aid to people. They are strangling their lifelines such as food and medical supply routes and threatening medical workers who only want to save lives,” said Emerlynne Gil.  
In November, the United Nations described a “fragile” security context in southeastern Myanmar and “heavily restricted” humanitarian access.  
In southern Shan State’s Moebye township, where fighting broke out in late May, a humanitarian response team made up of local youth tried to send relief supplies to displaced people hiding in the mountains on the morning of 8 June, according to one of the team’s members. The person, who is not being identified for fears of reprisals, said he and other members of the response team loaded a van with sacks of rice at a school which was being used as a storehouse. But when the van embarked, soldiers opened fire towards it. The van never reached its destination. 
“We had to flee quickly and were not able to move the supplies,” he said. 
That night, he watched from a distance as soldiers emptied the storehouse of its contents and burned them. More than 80 bags of rice, as well as other food items, medical supplies, and drums of gasoline were destroyed. The soldiers also destroyed a marked ambulance and another vehicle. “They burned everything except the portable toilets,” said the humanitarian responder. 
Military forces also aimed and fired their guns into the mountains, he said, causing people who had already been displaced from their homes to relocate again. Although they did not have enough food, they feared coming out of hiding to find more. 
This response team member also relayed that in early October, a driver transporting food supplies designated for IDPs in Moebye was arrested between the towns of Nyaung Shwe and Pekon. “[Soldiers] confiscated all the dry food supplies and the truck and arrested the driver and his assistant.”  
The military also blocked the transport of medical supplies into Moebye since early October, according to him, and his team has been unable to receive donated relief items from Yangon. “The situation is not safe, so we don’t dare to go and collect donations and no drivers dare to transport them either.” 
His team does not travel to the market in nearby Loikaw to purchase items themselves anymore and has delayed distributing some items because of the risks. They also face difficulties transferring funds to purchase items because few money transfer agents dare to help them, fearing they too could be targeted.  
This volunteer response team, which also partners with healthcare professionals to provide mobile clinics and emergency response services, sometimes had to delay or suspend these services due to fear of arrest.  
A civil society worker in neighboring Pekon township, where there have also been clashes and displacement since late May, told Amnesty International that the military started blocking roads there in June. “At first, we used other routes, but those were blocked too. Now, we are transporting [relief items] little by little but in some areas, we could not transport anything,” she said. 
The military also regularly inspects the contents of vehicles at random checkpoints. “Lately, they have completely restricted transporting any medication. When people order medical supplies, [security forces] open the packages on the road and confiscate them,” she said. 
Another civil society worker described similar challenges when attempting to distribute aid in Kayah State’s Loikaw, Demoso and Hpruso townships. “Soldiers stop and check a lot when we send food and tarpaulins for shelters and sometimes, we aren’t allowed to pass through. When we transport supplies, we cannot do it openly,” she said. 
Her organization has removed the white flags it initially displayed on its vehicles to signal relief work. Furthermore, in order to avoid attention from the military, her organization now purchases aid in small quantities. 
Fear of being attacked or caught in the crossfire has also delayed or stopped her team from reaching certain areas in Demoso township. “We have to look for a safe road which [the military] does not know about,” she said. “We stop in one place and keep the stuff, and when the road is clear, we resume the trip.” 
Pervasive fear 
Humanitarian responders in northwestern Myanmar are facing similar impediments, and the United Nations reported shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies on 9 December. 
A volunteer with an emergency response team in Mindat, Chin State said that his group has been unable to send food or medical aid to many parts of the township due to blocked roads, and that the team delivers relief items in small quantities by motorcycle or on foot to reduce their visibility after one of its members was arrested while returning from delivering aid to displaced people. 
In Sagaing region’s Kalay township, a civil society worker said that the military has “blocked all the main roads” and that security forces “check everything” in vehicles travelling in the area. 
“They prohibit all items that can help [IDPs], and arrest people. There are times that we do not dare to help, and just wait,” she said. Her organization refrains from sending medicine altogether because they heard that the military confiscates all medicine at the entrance into the town. 
The risks of transporting goods have also made it hard to find a driver in areas with ongoing fighting in Chin and Sagaing region where her organization operates, she said. “There were times when we had to negotiate and beg [drivers] to deliver food,” she said. 
A volunteer doctor in Sagaing region’s Yinmarbin township said that his team is unable to freely transport medicine or medical equipment. “Sometimes, [our suppliers] send it to us but we don’t receive it,” he said. He is part of a network providing mobile healthcare to conflict-affected communities and injured People’s Defense Force members, as well as food aid to displaced people in Sagaing region.  
The military has shut down the internet in 24 townships in central and northwestern Myanmar, including Yinmarbin, since September. The volunteer doctor said that he and his teammates consequently face a delay in accessing information about the ground situation, which had severely hampered their medical response, especially in areas where the military has at times blocked phone networks. 
He and his teammates also face security risks. He told Amnesty International that in July, a temporary medical facility was hit by military shelling and gunfire, causing the volunteers and patients to flee.At least three volunteers from his network were also arrested, he said. 
These accounts are emblematic of what is happening across the country and demonstrate how the Myanmar military is systematically depriving civilians of desperately needed supplies and medicine. 
“We will see more lives lost if the military continues this brutal campaign against its own people. The military must allow full access for humanitarian workers in affected regions,” said Emerlynne Gil.

“Having reviewed all the evidence available, including the criminal proceedings against the Guapinol eight and videos related to the case, and spoken to witnesses as well as to the human rights community in Honduras, Amnesty International considers that they are being detained only because of their activities in defense of the right to clean water and a safe environment,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The eight men are part of the Municipal Committee for the Defence of Common and Public Goods (Comité Municipal en Defensa de los Bienes Comunes y Públicos, CMDBCP), an organization that has mobilized communities in and around Tocoa since 2015 to peacefully challenge the legality of iron mining concessions granted to Inversiones Los Pinares (ILP), because they argue it affects the quality of the Guapinol and San Pedro river waters. The concessions are in the protected Montaña de Botaderos Carlos Escaleras National Park.    
The newly elected government of Xiomara Castro must send a clear message that the violence and criminalisation against human right defenders will not be tolerated any longer. 
Seven of the CMDBCP members have been in pretrial detention since August 2019, accused of the crime of deprivation of liberty (privación ilegal de la libertad) and aggravated arson (incendio agravado), after they voluntarily handed themselves to judicial authorities to contest criminal charges against them arising from a protest encampment in 2018. The eighth man, Jeremias Martínez, has been detained on the same charges since November 2018. 
After rigorous analysis, Amnesty International determined that the case file shows multiple flaws in the investigation, including what appears to be a lack of due diligence by the prosecutors to properly clarify the facts, conduct an impartial and independent investigation and provide concrete evidence that could link these men with the charges they are accused of. Instead, the authorities have handpicked these eight human rights and environmental defenders and actively contributed to building a narrative that the Guapinol eightare criminals, having misused the criminal justice system to keep them in pretrial detention as a way to hinder their activism. These irregularities coincide with a wider pattern of criminalization of environmental defenders that we have documented in the region for years. 
In 2020, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found the detention of the human rights defenders to be arbitrary and called for their immediate release. Nevertheless, the Honduran authorities have refused to recognise the injustice inflicted on the men and their families, or to remedy the situation. 
The Honduran authorities must urgently put an end to these unfair practices that jeopardise the right to defend human rights. 
The trial of the Guapinol eight begins immediately after the presidential elections in Honduras. 
“The newly elected government of Xiomara Castro must send a clear message that the violence and criminalisation against human right defenders will not be tolerated any longer. This context offers the opportunity to break this cycle of attacks against environmental and other human rights defenders. Amnesty International demands the immediate and unconditional release of these eight prisoners of conscience and calls on the Attorney General’s Office to drop the charges against them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“Unfortunately, in Honduras, those who speak out and protest to protect the environment face frequent threats and attacks, as in the murder of Berta Cáceres, or unjust criminalization, particularly where powerful vested economic interests are involved. The authorities continue to misuse the criminal justice system to silence and imprison human rights defenders. The Honduran authorities must urgently put an end to these unfair practices that jeopardise the right to defend human rights.” 
Amnesty International defines as prisoners of conscience people who are imprisoned or subjected to other restrictions on their liberty due to their religious, political or other beliefs, their ethnic origin, sex, colour, language, national or social origin, sexual orientation or gender identity, or other status, and that have not used violence or advocated violence and hatred. 
In 2018, as construction work on the mining project began to impact the Guapinol and San Pedro rivers, local residents joined the CMDBCP to demand that national and local authorities respond to their concerns, filing legal actions and holding protests. As the authorities failed to respond, the CMDBCP established a protest encampment on the access road to the mines. The peaceful encampment lasted for 88 days, with local communities, church pastoral activists and other civil society organizations all participating. Negotiations were held with government officials, but in October 2018, the police and the military violently evicted those in the encampment. 
The prosecution case against the eight defenders relates to a dispute that took place on 7 September 2018 near to a protest encampment, in which a ILP security staff reportedly shot one of the protesters and in response, protesters retained a contractor before handing him over to police. The shooting of the protester was never investigated, but the ILP reported the retention of the contractor and the burning of a rented car and two ILP shipping containers during the disturbances.

0,Supreme Court decision to hear Safe Third Country Agreement appeal is a promising step for refugee rights,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/supreme-court-decision-to-hear-safe-third-country-agreement-appeal-is-a-promising-step-for-refugee-rights/,"OTTAWA – Amnesty International, The Canadian Council of Churches, and The Canadian Council for Refugees are welcoming the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision to review the constitutionality of the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).  This decision follows a long history of legal challenges...","OTTAWA – Amnesty International, The Canadian Council of Churches, and The Canadian Council for Refugees are welcoming the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision to review the constitutionality of the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).  
This decision follows a long history of legal challenges to the Agreement, including two recent court rulings. In July 2020, the Federal Court found that the STCA violates the fundamental human rights of refugee claimants and is therefore unconstitutional. The Federal Court of Appeal overturned that decision in April 2021 – not on substantive grounds, but on the basis of how the arguments were framed. 
The organizations presented extensive evidence showing that the STCA has particularly negative impacts on women fleeing gender-based persecution, in violation of section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The organizations hope that these arguments will now be thoroughly considered by the Supreme Court of Canada through this appeal. 
This is the second time that the three organizations have challenged the constitutionality of the STCA. Twice the Federal Court has found that STCA violated refugee claimants’ Charter rights and twice the Federal Court of Appeal has overturned the decision on technical grounds. After refusing a previous request to hear the constitutionality of the STCA, the highest court will now finally review this rights-violating Agreement. 
The evidence is overwhelming that the US is unsafe for many refugees, and that many people sent back to the US under the STCA suffer serious rights violations in detention. Because of this evidence, the organizations call on the government to suspend the Agreement. None of the previous court rulings – or the upcoming Supreme Court decision – prevent the government from taking action immediately to end this harmful Agreement. 
Under the STCA, most refugee claimants who arrive at an official port of entry seeking protection in Canada are denied entry and turned back to the US. Because the agreement only applies at official border crossings, many refugees have been forced to cross the border in between ports of entry, sometimes in perilous conditions. Withdrawing from the Agreement would not only ensure that Canada meets its Charter and legal obligations, but would also allow people to present themselves in an orderly way at ports of entry, ending the need for irregular crossings.

0,Ethiopia: New wave of atrocities in Western Tigray,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/ethiopia-new-wave-of-atrocities-in-western-tigray/,"International investigations, access to detainees key to deter further abuses Amhara security forces are responsible for a surge of mass detentions, killings and forced expulsions of ethnic Tigrayans in the Western Tigray territory of northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch...","Amhara security forces are responsible for a surge of mass detentions, killings and forced expulsions of ethnic Tigrayans in the Western Tigray territory of northern Ethiopia, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today.Tigrayan civilians attempting to escape the new wave of violence have been attacked and killed. Scores in detention face life-threatening conditions including torture, starvation, and denial of medical care. 
 The new onslaught of abuses by Amhara forces against Tigrayan civilians remaining in several towns in Western Tigray should ring alarm bells.  
“The new onslaught of abuses by Amhara forces against Tigrayan civilians remaining in several towns in Western Tigray should ring alarm bells,” said Joanne Mariner, Amnesty International’s Director of Crisis Response.“Without urgent international action to prevent further atrocities, Tigrayans, particularly those in detention, are at grave risk.” 
Since armed conflict began in November 2020, Western Tigray, a disputed administrative territory, has been the site of some of the worst atrocities, including massacres, indiscriminate shelling, and large-scale forced displacement of the Tigrayan population. 
On 2 December, 2021, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that 1.2 million people have been displaced from Western Tigray since the beginning of the conflict. A 9 December UN report found that between 25 November and 1 December, over 10,000 Tigrayans were newly displaced from Western Tigray. It also stated that Western Tigray remained inaccessible to aid agencies due to security concerns. 
In November and December, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch conducted phone interviews with 31 people, including 25 witnesses and survivors as well as relatives of those detained and expelled, about abuses by Amhara militias and regional security forces against Tigrayan civilians in the towns of Adebai, Humera, and Rawyan. 
Since early November, Amhara regional police forces and militias, including militia groups known as Fanos, have systematically rounded up Tigrayans in Adebai, Humera, and Rawyan. These forces separated families, arrested teenagers age 15 and older and men and women civilians. They have forcibly expelled women and younger children, as well as sick and older people from the area. Some of those expelled have since arrived in Central Tigray, while others remain unaccounted for.“Tigrayans, regardless of [their] sex and age, were taken to a school,” said one man in Rawyan who witnessed the house-to-house roundups of Tigrayans by Fano militia. “They separated the old from the young, took their money and other possessions. … Older people, parents were loaded on big trucks [going] east. They let them go with nothing, while the young remained behind.”Following roundups in Humera on 20 and 21 November, two witnesses described seeing as many as 20 trucks full of people leaving on those days toward Central Tigray. 
Six witnesses said Amhara forces shot at Tigrayans seeking to flee the roundups in Adebai and attacked them with sticks and sharp objects. An unknown number were killed. “They started shooting whoever was in range running,” said a 34-year-old farmer from Adebai, who ran to nearby fields from Fano militias attacking him and others. “When the people tried to escape… [the Fano] attacked them with machetes and axes so no one could escape…We were passing bodies and we were all in shock… After we calmed down, we noticed that there were more bodies there too. Everywhere you turned, there would be five, 10 bodies.” Four witnesses said armed elements also shot at Tigrayans crossing into Sudan.Satellite imagery captured between 19 November and 5 December shows significant activity in Adebai, including moving vehicles, groups of people around a makeshift detention site, large amounts of debris on the main road, and burned structures. Imagery taken on 5 December in Humera shows 16 open-back trucks near the town’s central roundabout. 
Three former detainees held in Humera prison, some of whom had been held for as long as five months before they escaped in November, said that Amhara authorities kept them in extremely overcrowded cells for extended periods. Guards denied them food and medical treatment and tortured and beat detainees whose hands and feet had been tied with sticks and rifles. One former detainee arrested on 19 July escaped around 13 November while loading corpses of fellow detainees onto a tractor. He said he knew of 30 people who died while he was held there, including seven of the 200 men in his cell: ““All of us have gone through it [the beatings] but the most vulnerable ones were the [older men],” he said. “They couldn’t handle the torture, that’s why they were dying.” He said that the Fano militia members beating them threatened all Tigrayans with death. 
The roundups, abusive detentions, and forced expulsions separated families and left communities from the three towns desperate for news about the safety and whereabouts of their loved ones, many of whom were put on trucks and remain unaccounted for. One man who fled Adebai in late November said: “My wife and my mother called me four days ago, told me they had put them in vehicles, and they don’t know where they are taking them. After that I have never heard from them.” 
The Ethiopian authorities should immediately cease attacks on civilians, secure the release of those arbitrarily detained, and urgently provide unimpeded access to Western Tigray for aid agencies and organizations with a mandate to visit detention sites, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said. 
Given the gravity of the ongoing abuses, the UN Human Rights Council should urgently establish an independent international mechanism to investigate abuses in the Tigray conflict, including serious violations of international humanitarian law (the laws of war), identify those responsible at all levels, and preserve evidence for future accountability. 
Forced displacement and deliberate attacks on the civilian population violate the laws of war. Everyone in custody has the right to be treated humanely and with respect for their inherent dignity, including having access to adequate food and medical care. Ordering civilians displaced for reasons not required for their security or imperative military necessity, attacking civilians who are not directly participating in hostilities, and torturing or otherwise mistreating detainees, are war crimes. 
“The global paralysis on Ethiopia’s armed conflict has emboldened human rights abusers to act with impunity and left communities at risk feeling abandoned,” said Laetitia Bader, Horn of Africa director at Human Rights Watch.“As evidence of atrocities mounts, world leaders should support the creation of an international investigative mechanism and the UN Security Council should put Ethiopia on its formal agenda.” 
In the early morning hours of 3 November, as Adebai residents headed to Abune Teklai church in town to pray, local security forces at the church ordered the men to congregate for a meeting while telling the women to leave, four residents said. “I was… metres away from the church when I met a group of three Tigrayan women that told me I better go home because Fanos were collecting Tigrayan men and had ordered the women to leave,” a 20-year-old student said. 
As word of the roundup spread, six Tigrayan men interviewed were among the many who ran in panic, some home or to neighbouring fields to evade arrest. Four witnesses said Amhara militia members shot or attacked those trying to flee with machetes, axes, knives, or sticks. A 26-year-old man fleeing to the fields saw armed men on motorbikes shooting at people including his 70-year-old uncle. He later saw his uncle’s body, and those of two other men, including an older man he knew. “They were shooting at anyone who was behind,” he said. “[My uncle] wasn’t even running…they still shot him. I saw the guy shooting at him and him falling.” 
Four witnesses said the Fano militia proceeded to go house-to-house searching for Tigrayans. A farmer hiding at home watched as a group of 30 to 40 armed men attacked his neighbor, a mechanic in his mid-twenties: “They told him to come… He had his hands up and they hit him on his shoulder with an axe. As he screamed, they dragged him and took him with them.” 
Amhara forces took those captured to detention sites: some to the town’s police station, others to a former sorghum mill used as a makeshift detention site near the Enda Roto petrol station, on the town’s eastern outskirts. 
In the following days, the men who had escaped survived by hiding on farmland, but continued to come under attack, three residents said. The 20-year-old student heard gunshots on 7 November and later saw bodies near a reservoir three kilometers northeast of Adebai: 
“The Fanos and [armed individuals] just came… and started killing whomever they found in the bushes. … We were further [away]… but we were hearing a lot of gunshots. So when it got quiet and it was dark, we went to the [reservoir] and saw a lot of bodies. We didn’t count because we were afraid and shocked… I would say [I saw] about 20 [bodies].”Bodies remained unburied, so that “the whole town smelled and was filled with dead bodies,” said one man. Four other residents said they saw dead bodies on the outskirts of town.Roundups, beatings, and detentions of Tigrayan civilians also occurred in the towns of Humera and Rawyan. A 37-year-old farmer from Humera said he witnessed roundups and the killing of an older man with a physical disability nicknamed “Lingo” on 5 November. On his way home the farmer saw militias telling Lingo “to stand up and, when he couldn’t, they started beating him… with machetes, axes, and stones.” Two days later, the farmer learned that Lingo was beaten so badly that he died.Four people who made it to Sudan said that armed forces on the Ethiopian border shot at them as they tried to cross. A 14-year-old boy who crossed on November 23 said that as his group arrived in Dima, the last Ethiopian village before the border, forces in military clothing “started shooting and telling us to stop, and when we kept running, they captured one of us and killed another one.” He said a third person was missing following the incident. 
During the roundups in Adebai, Humera, and Rawyan, Amhara forces separated and eventually expelled younger children, women, and older and vulnerable Tigrayans toward Central Tigray.In Humera, two witnesses and three family members who spoke to people there at the time said that Amhara forces put people in about 20 trucks that left town on 20 November. The expulsions continued the following day, including of children and young mothers, said one witness. A similar number of vehicles left that second day, said one resident.The roundups of Tigrayans similarly began in Rawyan on 20 November. Four witnesses and two family members said that Amhara militias and Fanos in coordination with the town’s administrators rounded up Tigrayans. They went house to house and “collected all Tigrayans at the school,” said one driver, who was among those held. He noted that town administrators issued instructions to militias:“Militia were beating the youth, 17 and 18-year-olds, searching for money, and collecting their possessions. The [administrators] gave instructions, who can be released, and who can stay…. “Catch this one! Release this one!” They loaded the older people, parents… onto the open trucks, Isuzu trucks… and took them away from Rawyan.”One boy said that the militias registered him and other youth and released them. Men and older teenagers remained detained in the village ward offices and flour mill.In Adebai, militias loaded some of the Tigrayan men they arrested on 3 November onto Isuzu and other pickup trucks and took them away, four residents said. The roundups continued in the weeks that followed, when women and older people were also arrested and taken away.Family members of those expelled soon lost touch with loved ones. A student said he last received a phone call from his sister on 28 or 29 November as armed forces were putting her and their mother on a truck in Adebai and taken away:“She told me that they were being forced to leave everything behind, that they didn’t even let them grab their clothes or any belongings… that they [the soldiers] started looting the house while they were there, [and] that they didn’t even have food or water to drink… She… told me that there were 13 vehicles [and] that they had already boarded six vehicles.” 
A farmer described the last phone call he had with his two daughters and niece on 23 November: “When the Fanos were taking them, they took everything they carried in their hands, the jewelry, the clothes that they had, even the kids’ clothes and the biscuits that they had for them. And for two days… they were burning clothes.” 
Satellite imagery collected between 19 November and 5 December confirmed that there were open-back vehicles along the main road that crosses Adebai and burned spots and large amounts of debris along the road. 
Thousands of Tigrayan detainees are estimated to be held in overcrowded detention sites in Western Tigray. Three former detainees held in Bet Hintset prison in Humera, one of several detention sites in the town, described appalling conditions with frequent beatings, torture, insults, and the denial of food and medicine by Amhara regional special police. A daily labourer arrested in July and held in Bet Hintset prison, also controlled by Amhara regional police, until his escape in mid-November described being kept in a 3-by-4-metre room with up to 200 people:“Forget showers, we couldn’t use toilets. They didn’t give us food or water, even [at times] when our family brought us food, they wouldn’t let us… a lot of people were falling ill… dying… I’m talking daily, daily… I’m very sure of 30 bodies… only from our room, seven people died, all of them were above the age of 70.”He described a regular schedule of severe beatings, in which Fanos would torture groups of detainees by beating their hands, heads, chests, and genitals using sticks or the butt or the muzzle of a rifle. Another detainee, also arrested in mid-July and held at Bet Hintset, said: “They used electric wires and for the ages from 12 to 30, they hit us on the soles of our feet… the others that are older, they lay them down on their stomachs and hit them from their necks to their feet.”With the expulsion of some relatives in November on whom detainees had relied for food, survivors and relatives were concerned about those still detained. One 55-year-old man said, “I’m so worried about what they are eating in the prisons, because I know they won’t give them food and all the family members that they had who used to bring them food were taken. I’m sure a lot of people are dying.” Another resident said: “I fear those detained will all be killed.”

The report, No Escape: War Crimes and...","The Taliban, United States military, and Afghan security forces were all responsible for attacks that resulted in extensive civilian suffering before the country’s government collapsed earlier this year, Amnesty International said in a new report today. 
The report, No Escape: War Crimes and Civilian Harm During The Fall Of Afghanistan To The Taliban, documents torture, extrajudicial executions and killings by the Taliban during the final stages of the conflict in Afghanistan, as well as civilian casualties during a series of ground and air operations by the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) and US military forces. 
Read the report 
“The months before the government collapse in Kabul were marked by repeated war crimes and relentless bloodshed committed by the Taliban, as well as deaths caused by Afghan and US forces,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Our new evidence shows that, far from the seamless transition of power that the Taliban claimed happened, the people of Afghanistan have once again paid with their lives. 
“Homes, hospitals, schools and shops were turned into crime scenes as people were repeatedly killed and injured. The people of Afghanistan have suffered for too long, and victims must have access to justice and receive reparations. 
“The International Criminal Court must reverse its misguided decision to deprioritize investigations into US and Afghan military operations, and instead follow the evidence on all possible war crimes, no matter where it leads.” 
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reported that 1,659 civilians were killed and another 3,524 injured in the first six months of 2021, an increase of 47% from the prior year. 
Taliban atrocities 
As they seized control of districts across Afghanistan in July and August 2021, members of the Taliban tortured and killed ethnic and religious minorities, former ANDSF soldiers, and those perceived as government sympathizers in reprisal attacks. 
On 6 September 2021, Taliban forces attacked Bazarak town in Panjshir province. After a brief battle, approximately 20 men were captured by Taliban fighters and detained for two days, at times jailed in a pigeon coop. They were tortured, denied food, water and medical assistance, and repeatedly threatened with execution. 
One of the men captured by the Taliban said: “[The] Talib had taken a knife… he was saying he wanted to behead the wounded… because they are infidels and Jews.”  
Another man added: “They kept us underground. When we were asking for medical treatment of the wounded, the Taliban were saying, ‘Let them die’… There was no food and water, and no support to the wounded. They had brutal relations with us. When we were asking for water, they were saying, ‘Die of thirst’.” Torture and cruel and inhuman treatment of captives constitute war crimes. 
Later the same day, the Taliban also attacked the nearby village of Urmaz, where they conducted door-to-door searches to identify people suspected of working for the former government. The fighters extrajudicially executed at least six civilian men within 24 hours, mainly by gunshots to the head, chest or heart. Such killings constitute war crimes. Eyewitnesses said that while some of the men had previously served in the ANSDF, none were in government security forces or taking part in hostilities in any way at the time of execution. 
The report also documents reprisal attacks and executions of people affiliated with the former government in Spin Boldak. Amnesty International previously documented Taliban massacres of ethnic Hazaras in Ghazni and Daykundi provinces. 
The full scale of the killings nationwide still remains unknown, as the Taliban cut mobile phone service, or severely restricted internet access, in many rural areas. 
Civilian casualties from US and Afghan air strikes 
The report documents four air strikes – three most likely carried out by US forces, and one by the Afghan Air Force – in recent years. The strikes killed a total of 28 civilians (15 men, five women, and eight children), and injured another six. 
The strikes generally resulted in civilian deaths because the US dropped explosive weapons in densely populated areas. Amnesty International has previously documented similar impacts of explosive weapons in numerous other conflicts, and supports a political declaration to curb their use. On 9 November 2020, an air strike most likely carried out by US forces killed five civilians – including a three-month-old girl – and wounded six at a family home in the Mulla Ghulam neighbourhood of Khanabad city, in Kunduz province. 
A nine-year-old child who was injured in the attack said: “I was sleeping when the first bomb hit… They were telling us to hide somewhere in case the second bomb happened. My father said I had to find my younger brother. The second bomb killed my mother, my uncle, my aunt, and my sister.” 
Such strikes form a pattern of civilian harm that continued until the last moments of the conflict, when a US drone strike killed 10 people, including seven children, in Kabul on 29 August 2021. The US military later admitted that those killed were civilians. 
Civilians killed in ground combat 
The report documents eight cases during ground combat in which a total of 12 civilians were killed (five men, one woman, and six children), and 15 more injured. Through a combination of negligence and disregard for the law, the US-trained ANDSF frequently launched mortar attacks that hit homes and killed civilians in hiding. 
The fighting in Kunduz city was especially fierce in June 2021. In the suburb of Zakhail, government forces launched mortars into densely populated neighbourhoods. Meanwhile, Taliban forces gained ground, using schools and mosques to launch attacks, and demanding food from families trapped in their homes. 
On 22 June 2021, one man was killed and two people were injured during a mortar attack in Zakhail. The ANDSF most likely launched the mortar from the First Police District, approximately 2.5 kilometres from the scene of the explosion. The man killed was Abdul Razaq, 20, who was recently engaged to be married. Fragments from the mortar tore open his head and stomach. 
Later the same day in the same neighbourhood, one child was killed and two more were injured when a mortar – again most likely launched by the ANDSF – hit a home where a family was in hiding. A metal fragment hit Manizha, a 12-year-old girl, in the spine, paralyzing and eventually killing her. 
One man said the Taliban often forewarned families about combat, but they had received no similar communication from the government. He said: “The Taliban…say, ‘We will be fighting tonight’, and the people who can afford to leave do – but the poor people stay because they will starve if they leave. But there is no use of asking the government, when we know they are going to do nothing.”  
The use of mortars, whose use in populated areas is inherently indiscriminate, can constitute a war crime. 
Reparations and accountability 
Multiple family members of victims of military actions told Amnesty International they did not receive sufficient, if any, reparations from the government. 
One man, whose family home was destroyed in an air strike, said: “No one from the government came afterwards. We went to the district and told them what happened. No one came to us. They said, ‘This is not good. It should not have happened. We share your pain’. But nothing happened.” 
Amnesty International is calling on the Taliban and the US government to fulfil their international obligations, and establish clear and robust mechanisms for civilians to request reparations for harm sustained during the conflict. 
“The Taliban authorities now have the same legal obligation to provide reparations as the former government, and must address all issues of civilian harm seriously,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Victims and their families must receive reparations, and all those suspected of responsibility must be held to account in fair trials before ordinary civilian courts and without recourse to the death penalty.” 
Methodology 
Amnesty International conducted on-the-ground research in Kabul from 1-15 August 2021, and completed remote phone interviews with victims and witnesses via secure video and voice calls from August to November 2021. 
Amnesty International conducted face-to-face interviews in Kabul with 65 people, and remote interviews through encrypted mobile apps with an additional 36 people, from a total of 10 provinces. 
The organization’s Crisis Evidence Lab also reviewed satellite imagery, videos and photographs, medical and ballistics information, and interviewed relevant experts where necessary.

On 3 August, José Eduardo Ravelo died from multiple internal injuries, after telling his mother the police had tortured him in detention days before in Mérida, state of Yucatán. The prosecutor’s office carrying out the investigation of Jose Eduardo’s death has publicly stated that torture or ill treatment did not occur during his detention, even before concluding the investigation, raising serious doubtsabout the seriousness and impartiality of the prosecutors. We urge the Attorney General to ensure an independent and exhaustive investigation into all possible crimes committed against José Eduardo, and to guarantee full access to justice and reparations for his mother. 
José Eduardo, 23, had travelled from Veracruz to Mérida for a job interview. According to his mother on 23 July José Eduardo told her the police had detained him two days before, and that the agents beat and sexually abused him. He died days later from multiple internal injuries. 
According to the information received, the prosecutor’s office has refused to apply crucial guidelines to effectively document and investigate signs of torture (Istanbul Protocol). Despite this and that the investigation is still ongoing, on 28 October the prosecutor’s office publicly stated that based on the evidence gathered, José Eduardo was neither tortured nor sexually assaulted by police officers and that none of his rights had been violated. These hasty conclusions and omissions to apply the Istanbul protocol put at risk the rights of José Eduardo’s family to have his death and possible torture or illtreatment in police custody clarified with all due diligence. 
Write to the Attorney General urging him to:: 
• immediately ensure an independent, effective and impartial investigation into the allegations of torture, sexual assault and excessive use of force perpetrated against José Eduardo in compliance with all existing guidelines including the Istanbul Protocol.

A few days after Jose Eduardo’s mother made public the story of his son in August, state representatives stated publicly that the young man had been detained for “disturbing the public order” because he was allegedly “under the influence of drugs “. 
In August, a judge dismissed charges against four municipal police officers who had been initially charged with homicide, aggravated rape and aggravated torture crimes against Jose Eduardo, stating that was no sufficient evidence to prosecute them. The prosecutor’s office of the State of Yucatan was initially in charge of investigations, but a prosecutor’s unit specialized in investigations of torture, from the Attorney General’s Office at federal level (Fiscalía General de la República, FGR) then took over the case. According to the information received by Amnesty International, prosecutors now in charge have refused to use Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“Istanbul Protocol”) which contains essential guidelines to effectively document torture, arguing they cannot do it with deceased persons. 
In its public statement from 28 October, the FGR also mentioned they had detected problems in investigations carried out by prosecutors of the State of Yucatan who were previously been in charge of the investigation. To date, there is still no clarity about the causes and responsible of his death and alleged torture, which remain unpunished. The ombudsperson’s office (Comisión Nacional deDerechos Humanos) also opened an investigation into all alleged human rights violations perpetrated by Mexican institutions against José Eduardo and his mother, which remains pending to date. 
Amnesty International has long documented human rights violations perpetrated during arrests or detentions by national and state security forces in Mexico, including arbitrary detentions, excessive use of force and torture. In 2017, Amnesty International published the report False suspicions: Arbitrary detentions by police in Mexico. The research showed the way in which arrests by police forces in Mexico occur, specifically, when the authorities alleged that they arrest a person in flagrante delicto; that is, at the time when a crime was being committed. Amnesty International found that, in Mexico, the arrests of people who were allegedly committing a crime at the time of the arrest, do not serve as a genuine response to the crimes being committed in the country, but are used by the authorities illegally, mainly against those who face historical situations of discrimination, with a worrying impact on young men living in poverty. The report also showed that the use of undue force during detention persists, and that many detainees are subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. 
On May 5, 2020, Giovanny Lopez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, died after being beaten by police after being arrested in the state of Jalisco, apparently for not wearing a face mask. In March 2021, several UN bodies and human rights organizations condemned the death of Victoria Salazar, a Salvadoran refugee, resulting from her arrest by while in the custody of at hands of four police officers in Tulum, state of Quintana Roo, as a result of excessive force. United Nations human rights bodies have also regularly expressed their concerns about the widespread use of torture, ill-treatment and excessive use of force by police forces, armed forces and other public officials, particularly during arrest and the early stages of detention, and the serious deficiencies in the investigation of acts of torture and ill-treatment in Mexico, as well as the persistence of high levels of impunity associated with this type of crime and made recommendationsto the Mexican authorities to end these human rights violations.

One year ago, Germain Rukuki, a well-known activist from Burundi, was languishing in the overcrowded Ngozi jail, serving a 32-year sentence. UN experts determined that his charges, which included rebellion and breach of state security, had no basis in fact. He was arrested in July 2017, while his wife was pregnant and had been detained since. Their son, born four months later, would only grow up to see Germain on photographs. He would be thirty by his father’s expected release.   
Prospects for Germain’s freedom were bleak, his organization had been deregistered by Burundi’s authorities, where a severe crackdown on civil society and free press prevailed since 2015.   
Against all odds and following intense international pressure, including more than 436,000 solidarity actions from Amnesty International supporters globally and nearly 10,000 from Canada alone, Germain was released this summer. This December 10th, he will celebrate with those who wrote on his behalf. 
It was in 2001 that a group of activists gathered in Warsaw, Poland to write letters for human rights defenders at risk, like Germain. By 2002, the small event had become a global Write for Rights campaign and has grown ever since, with hundreds of thousands of people writing letters, emails and social media messages in support of those who face injustice.   
The thought of countless ordinary people still gathering in Canada and across the world to use the power of a pen and paper gives me hope.   
Two years into a pandemic which shows no signs of slowing down, an overheating planet, and glaring inequalities globally, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by the state of our world.   
Omicron, the new Covid-19 variant, sharply reminds us that no one will be safe until vaccine equality becomes a reality globally. In Glasgow a few weeks ago, world leaders failed to deliver a climate change plan that protects us all, despite a clear code red warning by IPCC scientists, the UN body for assessing the science related to climate change. Around the world, gender-based violence remains the silent pandemic and arms sales continue to fuel conflict, leading to an unprecedented 84.6 million people who are now forcibly displaced. Black, Indigenous and racialized communities still face racism in health care and policing institutions, despite numerous commitments to end systemic racism. And Canada continues to disproportionately incarcerate Black migrants and people with disabilities, often in abusive conditions.   
We watched in shock, as the Taliban captured Afghanistan, crushing nearly 20 years of women’s rights gains. Police in Colombia cracked down on demonstrators protesting tax hikes, injuring more than 100. Tensions between Israel and Palestine escalated to levels of violence not seen since 2014. A growing number of Guatemalans are fleeing the impacts of climate change, violence, the deterioration of their livelihoods. Many hope Canada will open its arms to them. Meanwhile the health of citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, imprisoned for reporting on the outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan, has deteriorated. She has been on an intermittent hunger strike since her arrest and is hanging by a thread.  
More than ever, it is time for governments to center human rights. Amnesty International’s latest 2021 Human Rights Agenda for Canada outlines many clear paths. However, as always, the real hope remains – literally – in the hands of ordinary people. Many unjustly detained human rights activists and journalists, from Loujain al-Hathloul, Nassima al-Sada, Paing Phyo Min to Khaled Drareni, were finally released. Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov won the Nobel Peace Prize, a win in a year when many governments clamped down on press freedom.   
The brave and tireless work of activists led to these improbable wins. Speaking out against human rights abuses is essential, especially when it appears pointless to do so. Sometimes all it takes is a letter. Write for Rights – the annual letter-writing event which Germain will join in this International Human Rights Day – started small.   
The winds of injustice may be sweeping our world, but as the great Toni Morrison reminds us: “There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear.” This is precisely the time to turn hope into action.

The Amnesty International ad was published in the Dec. 6 print edition of the Montreal Gazette to promote Write for Rights, the organization’s annual global letter-writing campaign. Write for Rights takes place every year around Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day, and profiles 10 cases of individuals and communities who are facing human rights violations. The ad focused on Janna Jihad, a 15-year-old Palestinian activist who faces threats and intimidation for documenting the Israeli army’s treatment of Palestinians.     
Amnesty International was only made aware of the apology after its publication in the pro-Israel blog. Postmedia did not contact Amnesty International to voice any concerns with the ad. According to the published apology, which Amnesty has since confirmed with Postmedia, the company’s sales staff across the country were mandated to attend training sessions due to the publication of the ad. 
“It is concerning that Postmedia has bowed to external pressure and apologized for two lines about an outspoken young Palestinian girl and activist. This is shocking and further silences a young teenage girl who has won the admiration of the world for her remarkable courage and citizen journalism,” said Ketty Nivyabandi, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English section. “Postmedia fell sway to a concerted lobbying campaign that precisely aims to silence Palestinian voices like Janna’s. Postmedia is a major daily newspaper publisher in Canada; its response should concern everyone in this country.” 
“We rely on advertisements in well-established traditional media outlets – such as those owned by Postmedia – to help raise awareness of human rights violations around the world,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Executive Director of Amnistie Internationale Canada Francophone. “Postmedia has issued this apology ahead of International Human Rights Day, a time of year when we make a concerted push to mobilize people to act in solidarity with those who are facing human rights violations.” 
On Friday, Dec. 10, Amnesty International will be hosting a virtual Write for Rights marathon, which will feature a full day of programming, including a presentation of Janna Jihad’s case. For more information on the event, and how to take part, visit www.writeathon.ca. 
Anyone interested in taking action in solidarity with Janna Jihad is invited to sign Amnesty International’s petition and/or tweet about her case.

A story of 17-years old Mikita Zalatarou,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/i-could-send-him-books-to-prison-but-they-do-not-have-a-free-minute-there-a-story-of-17-years-old-mikita-zalatarou/,"On a hot day of 10 August 2020, Mikita Zalatarou was standing at a bus stop in the central square of the city of Homel in south-eastern Belarus.

Everyone around him was intensely discussing the results of presidential elections that had just ended, and many people were protesting that day and the night before. The square was crowded. Mikita was just 16 and too young to vote that year. 
Suddenly, through the street noise, he could hear someone shout “Run!” People rushed by him, and he instinctively ran with them fleeing the invisible danger. The crowd was chased by the riot police (OMON) – like everywhere else in Belarus, the security forces were ordered to disperse any gatherings. Alyaksandr Lukashenka immediately claimed victory in presidential elections despite the results being widely disputed – and the government was determined to shut down any dissent. Mikita’s life was about to be turned upside down, but he was yet to realise it. 
The next day, several police officers came to his home to arrest him. Mikita was accused of throwing a Molotov cocktail at two policemen during protests. 
During that time, mass protests were happening across Belarus, including Homel. After presidential elections on 9 August, Alyaksandr Lukashenka declared himself the winner. 
The night when the election results were announced, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets of Minsk, Homel, Brest and other cities to protest against Lukashenka’s declared victory. The authorities instantly responded to the peaceful demonstrations on 9 August and the following days with unprecedented violence and indiscriminate arrests.  
Peaceful demonstrators, civil society activists, journalists and bystanders who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, got arrested, questioned for hours, beaten and tortured. Over the following months, the mechanism of repressions kicked into high gear. Hundreds of dissenters faced criminal charges. The authorities closed down independent media outlets and NGOs; journalists were beaten and detained. People could lose their job or even life for their peaceful opinions. People from almost all social groups in Belarus, including medics, athletes or artists, were persecuted. 
In just over a year since the start of protests and repressions, more than 30,000 people were detained after being charged with administrative offences related to their participation in peaceful demonstrations. The number of peaceful protesters, journalists and human rights defenders wrongfully sentenced to lengthy prison terms on criminal charges has been ever-growing. 
Mikita was among the thousands arrested over the first days of protests. Following his arrest, he was taken to a police station where he was beaten and tortured with electric shocks. Seven months later, on 22 February 2021, in a stuffy courtroom, he was sentenced to five years in a penal colony by the Central District Court in Homel.  
The prosecution based its case on two main pieces of “evidence”: a video showing a person throwing a Molotov cocktail at policemen and the testimony of a taxi driver who had driven Mikita away from the city centre on 10 August. The person on the video footage was unidentifiable, and the taxi driver said that Mikita discarded a bottle in a trash bin before getting into his car. No other evidence of Mikita’s involvement in “mass disorder” was presented, and hardly could the events of that day in Homel be described as “mass disorder”. 
Mikita was sent to a juvenile educational colony. 
Educational Colony 2 No. 2 at 4 Batova Street in Bobruisk is a large facility behind a tall fence, surrounded by high-rise buildings. From the windows of the colony buildings, red and white chimneys of the Bobruisk Thermoelectric Power Plant can be seen. 
[Mikita] would not admit even if things were bad [in prison] because all conversations are monitored. 
Mikita tells his parents very little about his life in prison. He keeps saying that everything is fine, but Mikhail, Mikita’s father, believes that “he would not admit [otherwise] even if things were bad because all conversations are monitored.” Mikita has been given some medications for epilepsy — a disorder he has been living with since childhood, but he does not know what they are exactly. 
His mother came to the colony to visit him not long ago. It took her a while to prepare for her 150 km journey from Homel to Bobruisk and pack all the food, medications and other necessary items. However, she was not let in. She stood at the closed gates for a long time until a guard approached her. He said that Mikita is all right, but refused to let her inside or take a parcel for her son. 
Later, Mikita’s parents learned that at the time he had been placed in a punitive isolation cell where he spent almost two weeks. The reason for his punishment remains unknown. Upon his arrival to the educational colony, Mikita got a yellow label as an “extremist”. Now he has a red label that means “inclined to escaping”, and the reason for this also remains unknown. His parents say that now he has been treated more harshly. 
According to human rights defenders, this kind of prisoner labelling is widespread in Belarusian correctional facilities, and the labels can often be predictors of how harsh the treatment of the prisoner will be. 
I tell him to keep his head down, to learn, to study languages, English [for example]. I could send him books. But this is impossible: they are so busy there that they do not have a free minute. 
“I tell him to keep his head down, to learn, to study languages, English [for example]. I could send him books. But this is impossible: they are so busy there that they do not have a free minute,” his father says. 
Mikita’s parents are hoping to find money to hire a lawyer, “kind of for moral support” — they do not believe in justice in Belarus anymore. Defence lawyers are compelled to sign non-disclose agreements regarding information on the cases they are working on. This practice is illegal, but if they refuse, they risk getting disbarred. So even having a lawyer visiting their son, Mikita’s parents still won’t be able to learn how he is doing, but at least they will know that someone has seen him alive. However, with widespread repression and the system set to break people’s spirit and strip them of rights and protections, this piece of knowledge will be worth it. 
Mikita is not allowed to receive letters, but, as his father says with a bleak smile, “if the colony administration starts getting hundreds of letters from all over the world, it will drive them crazy.” “When this is over, we’ll go fishing together,” he promises. 
Mikita must be released. Please join the call to release Mikita and give him a fair trial, ensuring he is treated in line with principles of child justice. You can also send a letter to authorities with Amnesty’s Write for Rights campaign.

The testimonies we have gathered speak of unimaginable violence, including civilians killed as they fled and bodies set on fire and mutilated,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa.“That the attacks not only involved local groups, but also fighters affiliated to government and opposition forces, indicates this is much more than inter-communal violence.”Amnesty International interviewed 76 people, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), humanitarians, government officials, activists and others. Fifty of those interviewed were Azande, Balanda, and ethnically mixed survivors who had been forced to flee and were sheltering in Wau, Yambio and Tambura town, the previous epicentre of the violence.Abductions, unlawful killings and other civilian harmSurvivors gave harrowing accounts of escaping indiscriminate gunfire that lasted for hours and of entire neighbourhoods being set alight. Thirteen witnesses, some of whom were briefly abducted, described incidents where fighters from both sides summarily killed civilians by shooting them or slitting their throats. Deliberately targeting civilians and the murder of captives are war crimes.Stray bullets landed in homes and IDP shelters, injuring civilians, including a 10-year-old girl whose case Amnesty International documented. Many civilians were killed as they attempted to flee to safety or after coming out of hiding to seek food or better shelter. The vast majority of IDPs who were interviewed spoke of having lost a loved one, and in some cases multiple relatives, due to the violence.Many said they saw bodies of civilians brought for burial or along the road while fleeing. Several survivors spoke of family members who have been missing and presumed dead for months. According to local government figures, around 300 people were killed.A 20-year-old Balanda woman described how three Azande-speaking armed men wearing face coverings showed up at her house in Tambura town at night on 2 September and killed her 27-year-old husband as she and their three-year-old daughter watched. “I, my husband and child were sleeping… One of them came in and took my husband out by force… they sat him near the door and shot him… in front of me. My husband fell down,” she told Amnesty International.   A 41-year-old Zande woman said she and an older sister were captured in the bush in September, as they attempted to flee from Tambura town to Ezo after their brother was shot dead. Armed men took them and other civilians captive and proceeded to kill some of them.“They ordered us to sit down and said they were going to slice us like a pumpkin,” she said. She said the fighters had tied their hands behind their backs and placed her 18-month-old son next to her. One of the fighters “put his leg on [my sister’s] head and cut her neck with a knife,” she said. She and her son were spared when pro-Azande forces arrived and started shooting at the men holding them.One witness described seeing fighters burn the body of her brother after they decapitated him in Mupoi in August; her husband and three of her children were abducted and killed weeks prior. Another woman said she heard the screams of her two brothers pleading for their lives as she hid nearby, shortly before seeing their slashed-up bodies with a severed ear each. “When I remember what they did to my brothers, I cannot sleep at night… I have so much fear; if anything comes near me, I jump,” the 42-year-old said of the incident that took place in June in Nabiapai.Seven witnesses described seeing what appears to be one or more cases of a pregnant woman’s disembowelled body alongside her slain foetus. Eight survivors lamented that the bodies of their loved ones were left to decompose without burial, in some cases due to armed men apparently awaiting to target anyone coming back.Survivors mentioned that some older people with limited mobility were left behind and killed. One witness described seeing armed men beating to death a woman with a mental health condition before setting her body on fire.Looting and destructionMost of those interviewed said their homes were looted or burned, and crops were left unharvested due to the insecurity, impacting many of them who farm for a living. Satellite imagery analysed by Amnesty International illustrates widespread damage or destruction of structures between June and October across the county, including in and around Tambura town and Mupoi and the vicinity of Source Yubu.Armed men also ransacked and looted health facilities, depriving civilians of crucial care and violating international law. A senior humanitarian worker told Amnesty International in November that 13 out of 20 medical facilities across Tambura county were rendered unusable after being vandalized, and the rest are “barely functional”.Another humanitarian worker said that out of 53 schools in the county, only eight were open at the time of the interview in November. Practically all displaced people with school-age children who spoke to Amnesty International said their children had been out of school for months.  Seven witnesses told Amnesty International that pro-Azande, SSPDF-affiliated fighters had used a primary school in Tambura town as barracks for several weeks during the fighting, until late October when government officials finally coaxed them into leaving. Such use of schools by armed actors runs contrary to the global Safe Schools Declaration, which the South Sudanese government endorsed in 2015, and undermines international human rights and humanitarian law.Displacement and humanitarian crisisAccording to government figures verified by the UN, the fighting has displaced more than 80,000 people. Some moved to makeshift displacement sites within Tambura town, including a church and a camp protected by UN peacekeepers, which Amnesty International visited. Others travelled as far south as the state capital Yambio and all the way north to Wau in Western Bahr el Ghazal state, often walking between three and 10 days.Families were separated as people fled in different directions, with some still unable to reunite months later. Travelling with just the clothes on their backs, many went without food for days in the bush. One woman said her 15-year-old gave birth along the way, another said her three-year-old daughter died from medical complications during the journey.Displaced people in both camps and host communities said they lacked food and medicine and suffered dismal shelter conditions, which Amnesty International researchers witnessed. The vast majority said they had received either no humanitarian relief or just a one-off 15-day ration of basic food items.“My child at home is very sick and there is no money for treatment… We don’t have food. We don’t even have money for rent. We are going to die from hunger,” said a 42-year-old woman who was displaced in July from the outskirts of Tambura town to Yambio with seven of her children.Survivors said despite announcements that the fighting has ended, they remained fearful of lingering fighters and politicians who had stoked the inter-communal enmity. They also said they had nothing to return to with their houses, crops and properties destroyed. Many highlighted their urgent need for speedy assistance, including psychosocial support.“The government must expedite reconstruction efforts; facilitate assistance and provision of essential services for the displaced; establish conditions for their safe, voluntary and sustainable return; and ensure that those responsible for war crimes and other violations are held to account,” said Deprose Muchena.“The violence in Western Equatoria is yet another stark reminder that a holistic accountability process is needed, including truth-telling, reforms, compensation and working with the African Union Commission to establish the Hybrid Court for South Sudan. Meanwhile the UN Security Council must maintain its arms embargo to stem the flow of weapons to warring parties.”BackgroundThe recent violence in Western Equatoria can be traced to the allocation of the state to the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-In Opposition (SPLM-IO) in May 2020 as part of a power-sharing agreement between parties to the 2018 peace deal. The First Vice-President Riek Machar’s subsequent appointment of a governor angered key figures in the political elite among the Azande community.Despite the creation of a transitional government of national unity in early 2020, violence persists in various pockets across South Sudan, pitting parties to the conflict, as well as local groups aligned with them, against each other. Key provisions of the peace deal, including some pertaining to accountability and security, remain unfulfilled.

“Experts have been warning us that the pandemic is global in nature and that an unequal distribution of vaccines around the world would only increase the chance of new variants emerging. Yet while some high-income countries have fully vaccinated nearly 90% of their populations, just over 7% of people in low-income countries have received a single dose.   
“Leaders in wealthy countries have been urging their populations to get vaccinated while repeatedly acknowledging the importance of vaccines to end the Covid-19 pandemic – especially in the wake of the Omicron variant. These same leaders, however, seem to forget that this same message applies to everybody around the world. 
“It is shocking that wealthy countries, whose populations have all been offered vaccines, continue to hoard hundreds of millions of unused doses while pharmaceutical companies are still sending the lion’s share of their production to these same countries.  
“If we want to stem the tide of new variants and end the pandemic, states that have been stockpiling vaccines must immediately redistribute them whilst also ensuring countries have enough time and resources to adequately carry out a comprehensive roll-out. Likewise, pharmaceutical companies need to realize they are in the business of producing life-saving products that must go where they are needed most, not where they are paid top dollar.” 
Background 
Since 22 September 2021, Amnesty International has been calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to ensure equal access to Covid-19 vaccines so that at least 40% of people in low and lower-middle-income countries can get vaccinated by the end of 2021 with its campaign, The 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion vaccines now!. With less than 25 days left until the end of the year, it’s time to act now.

“The harsh sentences handed down to Aung San Suu Kyi on these bogus charges are the latest example of the military’s determination to eliminate all opposition and suffocate freedoms in Myanmar. The court’s farcical and corrupt decision is part of a devastating pattern of arbitrary punishment that has seen more than 1,300 people killed and thousands arrested since the military coup in February.  
“There are many detainees without the profile of Aung San Suu Kyi who currently face the terrifying prospect of years behind bars simply for peacefully exercising their human rights. They must not be forgotten and left to their fate.  
“As violence escalates, displacing tens of thousands of people and setting up a humanitarian crisis in the middle of an ongoing pandemic, the situation in Myanmar today is alarming in the extreme. Without a decisive, unified and swift international response this can and will get worse.    “The international community must step up to protect civilians and hold perpetrators of grave violations to account, and ensure humanitarian and health assistance is granted as a matter of utmost urgency. The country’s healthcare system is in tatters, the economy is on a precipice, and food shortages loom. The world cannot sit back and defer to ASEAN — states must act now to ensure an end to unlawful killings, arbitrary detention, torture and other gross violations, and to the decades-long pattern of impunity that has led us to where we are today.  “It is shameful that ASEAN has yet to fully implement its emergency consensus after more than half a year. Other than blocking military leader Min Aung Hlaing from attending a handful of meetings, ASEAN has remained shockingly weak as the Myanmar military continues to crush peaceful dissent, sow destruction, and wipe out freedom of expression.”  
Background  
Myanmar’s de facto leader State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi was arrested on 1 February, along with other elected officials, activists and members of the Union Election Commission.   
The guilty sentences handed down on 6 December were for incitement against the military under Section 505 (b) and for alleged breaches of COVID-19 measures under Section 25 of the Natural Disaster Management Law. She is facing a total of 11 criminal cases, including under Section 67 of the Telecommunications Law, and the Export and Import Law (related to the possession of walkie talkie devices in her home). She has also been accused of violating Section 55 of the Anti-Corruption Law and the Official Secrets Act. All of her hearings have been closed to the public.  
On 24 April, the ASEAN held an emergency summit on Myanmar in Jakarta. A Five-Point Consensus was reached at the summit, which was attended by Myanmar’s commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, who has been barred from more recent sessions.   
The Consensus called for an immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar, constructive dialogue among all parties, the appointment of a special ASEAN envoy to facilitate dialogue, the provision of humanitarian assistance, and a visit by the envoy to Myanmar. More than seven months on from the summit, it is clear that this approach has failed to yield truly meaningful results. ASEAN’s special envoy has been blocked from visiting Suu Kyi, who is being held at an undisclosed location in the capital Naypyidaw.  
The military has continued to kill protesters, bystanders and other civilians, and arrest, detain, prosecute and imprison activists, human rights defenders, media workers, medical workers, artists, political opponents, and critics of the military for exercising their rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners Burma (AAPPB), as of 3 December, the military has killed more than 1,300 people and arrested more than 10,000.

“Idris Khattak’s family and lawyer are being kept in the dark by the Pakistani authorities about the exact status of his case and reported conviction, violating the right to fair trial and due process and making it impossible for them to plan any legal recourse.   
“If his conviction is confirmed, it will be the culmination of a shameful two-year process that has been unjust from start to finish. Since being bundled into a car in 2019, Idris Khattak has been kept in an unknown location. Despite being a civilian, he was tried by a military court in a trial that took place in complete secrecy. Few details about the case against him have been disclosed and, according to his lawyer, the proceedings were deeply flawed.  
“We urge Pakistan’s authorities to immediately provide details of the case to the family, give him access to lawyers, and bring Idris Khattak before an ordinary civilian court to rule on the lawfulness of his arrest and detention. This case plainly demonstrates why enforced disappearances must, once and for all, be put to an end. It’s time the authorities lifted the veil of secrecy shrouding the trial and his whereabouts.”  
According to Idris Khattak’s lawyer, he has only been allowed to meet his client three times. On each occasion, they were filmed, accompanied by an army officer, and were not permitted to speak in Pashto – their native language. An earlier application for the trial to take place in a civilian court was rejected by the military court, following on from a similar rejection by the Peshawar High Court in January 2021.

In 26 new interviews, survivors and service providers told Amnesty International that the Taliban closed shelters and released detainees from prison, including many convicted of gender-based violence offences. 
Many survivors – as well as shelter staff, lawyers, judges, government officials, and others involved in protective services – are now at risk of violence and death. 
“Women and girl survivors of gender-based violence have essentially been abandoned in Afghanistan. Their network of support has been dismantled, and their places of refuge have all but disappeared,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“It defies belief that the Taliban threw open prison doors across the country, with no thought of the risks that convicted perpetrators pose to the women and girls they victimized, and to those who worked on survivors’ behalf. 
“To protect women and girls from further violence, the Taliban must allow and support the reopening of shelters and the restoration of other protective services for survivors, reinstate the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, and ensure that service providers can work freely and without fear of retaliation.” 
Amnesty International is calling on the international community to provide immediate and long-term funding for such protective services, evacuate survivors and service providers facing imminent danger, and urge the Taliban to uphold their obligations to women and girls, particularly those who survive or are at risk of gender-based violence. 
On 26 and 29 November, Taliban spokesperson Suhail Shaheen told Amnesty International via telephone: “There is no place for violence against women and girls, according to the rules of Islam… The women facing domestic violence can be referred to the courts, and the courts will hear their cases… and their grievances will be addressed.” 
Amnesty International interviewed survivors and individuals involved in protective services in the provinces of Badghis, Bamiyan, Daikundi, Herat, Kabul, Kunduz, Nangarhar, Paktika, Sar-e Pul, and Takhar. 
Collapse of the system 
Before the Taliban’s takeover, many women and girl survivors had access to a nationwide network of shelters and services, including pro-bono legal representation, medical treatment, and psychosocial support. 
Survivors were referred into the system from provincial and capital offices of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and the Human Rights Commission, as well as from shelters, hospitals, and police stations across the country. 
The system was far from perfect, but served thousands of women each year in Afghanistan, where nine out of 10 women experience at least one form of intimate partner violence in their lifetime, according to UNAMA. 
According to service providers, the most common cases of gender-based violence involved beating, rape, other forms of physical and sexual violence, and forced marriage. Survivors often needed urgent medical treatment. 
One service provider who was based in Nangargar said: “[The cases] were very extreme. We had a case where a man took the nails off his wife’s fingers… [One] man took a crowbar and peeled off his wife’s skin… There was one woman who faced a lot of abuse from her family. She couldn’t even use the bathroom anymore.” 
As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the system of protective services collapsed. Shelters were closed, and many were looted and appropriated by members of the Taliban. In some cases, Taliban members harassed or threatened staff. 
As shelters closed, staff were forced to send many women and girl survivors back to their families, and other survivors were forcibly removed by family members. Other survivors were forced to live with shelter staff members, on the street, or in other unsustainable situations. 
Zeenat* was regularly beaten by her husband and brother before she took refuge in a shelter. When the Taliban arrived, she and several other women fled. They are now in hiding. She said: “We came only with the clothes we were wearing. We don’t have a heater, and we go to sleep hungry… My brother is my enemy, and my husband is my enemy. If he sees me and my children, he’ll kill us… I am sure they are looking for me because they know the shelter has closed.” 
One shelter director, currently in hiding with some survivors from her shelter, told Amnesty International: “We don’t have a proper place. We can’t go out. We are so scared… Please bring us out of here. If not, then you can wait for us to be killed.” 
Perpetrators freed 
As the Taliban advanced, they also systematically released detainees from prisons, many of whom had been convicted of gender-based violence offenses. Testimony from witnesses and others with first-hand knowledge, as well as credible media reporting, indicate that members of the Taliban were responsible. A Taliban spokesperson denied this to Amnesty International, insisting the previous government had opened prisons.  
A legal professional who specializes in gender-based violence said she had been involved in the conviction of more than 3,000 perpetrators of gender-based violence in the year preceding the Taliban’s takeover. 
She said: “Wherever [the Taliban] went, they freed the prisoners… Can you imagine? More than 3,000 released, in all the provinces of Afghanistan, in one month.” 
Amnesty International also received credible reports that survivors have also been transferred by the Taliban into the detention system, including to Pul-e-Charkhi prison, near Kabul. 
Protectors now in need of protection 
Many working within the system of protective services said that although they faced significant risks before the Taliban’s takeover, their lives are now in greater danger, and they are in desperate need of protection. 
One service provider who was based in Badghis explained: “All of these women who worked on this [the support system] – now we need a shelter… We live each day in anxiety and fear.” 
A service provider who was based in Nangarhar said: “I am getting threats from the Taliban, ISIS, perpetrators and the family members… on a daily basis.” 
Another service provider who was based in Bamiyan said: “I was getting three calls each day from men who had escaped the prison. After I received a call from the Taliban as well, I switched to a new number.” 
These women were devastated to see the system they had painstakingly built collapse. A former judge told Amnesty International: “For 20 years, I was working to build everything from scratch – pushing, running, from this office to that office. I was trying to convince everyone, so that we have a framework in place to protect women… It takes a lot of courage, a lot of sacrifice and energy to build something from nothing – and then it becomes nothing again.” 
“We are not safe anywhere anymore” 
There is nowhere to turn for women and girls who have faced violence since the Taliban’s takeover. One psychologist who worked with gender-based violence survivors in Kabul told Amnesty International: “The Taliban doesn’t have any procedure of how to deal with these cases.” 
A prosecutor for cases involving gender-based violence explained: “In the past, women could go to the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. They could go alone and report their case. But now that women are not allowed to go anywhere without a mahram [male guardian], this will make it really complicated.” 
Fariha* was regularly beaten by her husband and his relatives. She said: “[My husband] would pick up whatever he could find, and he would hit me with it… Whenever he beat me, his family would get together and watch… It happened almost every day… The first time he beat me with a wire… I had bruises all over my body. My hands and my nails were scratched, all of them. After that, he beat me from my waist down only. He’d tell me, ‘I will hit you in these places [your genitals and buttocks] that won’t be seen’.”  
Fariha was nine months pregnant when she spoke to Amnesty International, and desperately seeking a safe place to live. She added: “Before, there was a shelter, and I went to that place. I requested that they take me in. They said it’s not running now, and we can’t accept any new cases… There are no options for me.” 
Adilia* was forced to marry an 80-year-old man at age seven. She said: “I spent a year living with him, and he beat me every single day, saying, ‘Why are you not getting pregnant?’” 
Adilia fled, but was remarried and regularly subjected to beating and other forms of violence and abuse by her second husband and his relatives. When she spoke with Amnesty International, she had recently been transferred to one of the few shelters still in operation in Afghanistan. 
She said: “We are very scared now… For how long are we going to stay? The Taliban came to the shelter at 12am, at 1am, and many times during the day. We told [them] this is a safe place for us, but they wouldn’t believe us… We are not safe anywhere anymore.” 
Methodology 
From 26 October to 24 November 2021, Amnesty International conducted telephone interviews with six survivors and 20 individuals involved in the system of protective services, including shelter directors and staff, prosecutors, judges, psychologists, doctors, and representatives of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. 
Amnesty International also interviewed 18 local activists, journalists, representatives of NGOs and the United Nations, and other experts on gender-based violence in Afghanistan.

The emergence of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron, has been met in Canada with travel bans on several African countries and a growing clamour for giving all adults booster shots. But punishing the rest of the world won’t help end the pandemic; it only serves to perpetuate it. 
Experts have been telling us for months that we cannot sit back and let large swathes of the world be locked out of vaccination without dramatically increasing the risk of newer, deadlier and more transmissible variants emerging. 
Yet, that is exactly what we’ve done. For over a year, Canada and a handful of European nations have bogged down negotiations at the World Trade Organizations (WTO) that could ramp up the global production and distribution of vaccines. 
Drafted by South Africa and India in October 2020 and supported by more than 120 member states, the proposal calls for patents and other intellectual property measures covering vaccines and other much-needed COVID-19 medical products to be temporarily lifted. The move could help diversify vaccine supply, bring down prices and increase access for poorer countries. 
Ironically, continued negotiations around this proposal were among the casualties of the new variant. The long-anticipated ministerial meeting of the WTO, set to take place in Geneva this week, was cancelled due to flight restrictions imposed on delegates from southern Africa, where the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly. Less than a quarter of the population in the region is fully vaccinated. And across the African continent as a whole, fewer than 7 per cent are fully immunized. 
South Africans know first-hand how crucial generic production of patented medicines can be in fighting a pandemic. In the 1990s, South Africa clashed with pharmaceutical multinationals over access to affordable antiretroviral while battling the spread of AIDS. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was obvious to the country’s leaders that Big Pharma’s hunger for profit would similarly limit the availability of doses for vaccines. 
Sadly, though not surprisingly, rich countries sided with Big Pharma over South Africa’s reasonable request. 
Alongside several European nations, Canada has been in engaging in all sorts of dilatory tactics at the WTO to block any agreement on temporarily lifting vaccine patents. And so far, they have been successful. 
Officially, Canada has still not made up its mind on South Africa’s request. Trudeau and his ministers evade anything resembling a clear stance when asked if they are for or against the patents waiver, instead resorting to boilerplate responses about “constructive dialogue” and “consensus-based” solutions. 
But in Geneva, Canada’s trade officials shamefully echo Big Pharma’s claims that the patents jealously guarded by Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson pose no barrier to vaccine supply. 
This subservience to Big Pharma is shredding Canada’s international credibility. This week, the South African envoy in Canada criticized Ottawa for punishing African nations while failing to support a waiver to improve vaccine equity. Recently global legal experts concluded that states like Canada that are currently impeding the proposed waiver at the WTO are breaching their legal obligations to the right to health, life, equality and science for all. 
Justin Trudeau must drop the doublespeak and come out clearly in favour of lifting patents at the WTO. Improving Canada’s lamentable record on vaccine donations (only five per cent of pledged doses have actually been delivered, worst among the OECD nations) and greenlighting domestic manufacturing of generic vaccines for export are two other urgent measures that Canada could take now, regardless of what happens at the WTO. 
If our leaders continue to sleepwalk from one disaster to the next, we must wake them up. Canada’s future lies in the world ending this pandemic. That requires us to do our best to help vaccinate the whole world. 
It’s time for Canada to shed the label of a vaccine hoarder and become a nation that fights vaccine inequity.

December 1 marks the halfway point of Nayib Bukele’s five-year term as president of El Salvador. The road has not been easy. When the young leader took office, the nation’s homicide rate was among the highest in Latin America, women’s rights were severely under threat due to some of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world, and victims of the country’s bloody armed conflict were still awaiting justice, truth and reparation nearly 30 years after the signing of the peace accords. 
When Amnesty International met him in June 2019, 24 days after he took office, to share our concerns about the grave human rights situation in El Salvador, Bukele committed to tackling some of the country’s historic challenges, becoming a distinct voice in Central America and remaining open to international scrutiny. 
Fast forward the clock two and a half years and, instead of progress, what you will see is an astronomic rollback on human rights as Bukele turned from a bright promise into a leader whose “with me or against me” approach is destroying what many generations of activists have tried to build for decades. 
Since he took office, the right to express an opinion, to freedom of association or even for women to make decisions regarding their own bodies have been, at best, ignored and, at worst, purposefully pushed aside. 
Today, in El Salvador, there’s very little space for anything other than supporting the President. As a Salvadoran who lived her childhood during the armed conflict, I have watched with despair how the current government has been dismantling, one by one, each of the institutions that should work to strengthen human rights, and backtracking on the path initiated with the Peace Accords back in 1992. The prospect of having the country that my family wanted my generation to inherit is vanishing into thin air. 
Bukele’s strategy is not new. He took office armed with a roadmap borrowed from his neighbour: Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega, a man who has shrunk civil space so much that it is now practically invisible. 
First, Bukele effectively declared open season on independent journalists, lawyers, human rights activists, and anybody who dared criticize him or his administration’s policies. The campaign begun online, where he badmouthed and dismissed their work. He branded activists as “criminals”, “seeking the death of more people” during the toughest months of the COVID-19 pandemic and of being “front organizations” for the “political opposition”. 
When the leader of a country with a relatively small population starts smearing people by name, it gives a green light for something much more dangerous. What followed was the development of a hostile environment in which people started to feel they could no longer speak their mind without a possible reprisal or being publicly discredited by the authorities. 
Journalists are also working in an increasingly hostile environment– so much so that El Salvador has dropped eight places on Reporters Without Borders’s 2021 press freedom ranking and at least 23 journalists reported that they had reason to believe they were under surveillance. Despite the growing risks, many brave media professionals continue to work to uncover wrongdoing. 
There’s more. 
Over the past year, Bukele’s political party, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas) won a majority of the Legislative Assembly, which opened the door for more changes. 
Since May, legislators in El Salvador have been busy rubberstamping the leader’s plans. First, they removed the magistrates of the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Attorney General of the Republic. This was considered by many an attack on the right to access to justice and judicial independence. 
Then they set a number of priorities for the laws they decided to support or consider, including some to remove judges and prosecutors and a proposal to limit the funding that human rights organizations can receive, while dismissing bills to protect human rights defenders and journalists, to create a system to help the search for the disappeared, and to make abortion accessible. 
In September, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court issued a ruling allowing for immediate presidential re-election, in contravention with the country’s constitution. 
The president’s battle-like strategy against anybody he sees as standing on the opposite side of the aisle is not helping anybody. On the surface, his high approval ratings, and apparently loyal online following might paint El Salvador as a country where things are working. The reality, however, tells a different story. 
Shutting down critics does not make their arguments less valid. Instead, engaging in meaningful conversations with them could help Bukele build the country he promised. It is not too late, at least not yet.

This is the third time since 2019 that the RCMP have enforced an injunction to evict and arrest those opposed to Coastal Gaslink’s (CGL) controversial pipeline which, if completed, will transport fracked gas from Alberta to East Asian markets on behalf of TC Energy. 
In total, 36 people – including elders and journalists – were arrested between November 18 and 29, 2021. These arrests happened as the tensions increase between Canada’s publicly stated commitments to respect Indigenous peoples and prevent further climate breakdown, and Canada’s fossil-fuel-soaked  realpolitik.    
The Canadian negotiation team to COP26 in Glasgow made promises to end subsidies for ‘unabated’ fossil fuel projects overseas by 2022 and to phase out coal by 2030. Yet they failed to commit to substantial actions that would limit global temperature rise to 1.5 C.The climate talks are widely considered a dismal failure by civil society. Indigenous leaders from around the world called the failed talks a ‘death sentence’ for Indigenous peoples.  
Canada’s COP negotiators returned to devastating floods and mudslides that killed at least 4 people in BC, destroyed major highway infrastructure and left agricultural resources in ruins in BC, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Nova Scotia. While this climate disaster unfolded, authorities sent heavily armed police officers and canine units to arrest people opposed to a fossil fuel project that they say threatens critical drinking water and salmon habitat. 
The dissonance has left many people upset, confused, unsure what to focus on, and frustrated by Canada’s double-speak. 
The recent arrests on Wet’suwet’en territory violate Canada’s obligations to Indigenous peoples and ignore a decision by the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). CERD’s job is to make sure countries that have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination fulfill their obligations and provides them with guidance in the form of recommendations and decisions when they need to course correct or remedy violations. 
CERD called Canada to task in 2017, 2019, and 2020 over its failures to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples to meaningful consultation and the principle of free, prior, and informed consent – which flows from the right to self-determination – in relation to the Coastal Gaslink and Transmountain pipelines and the Site C hydro-electric dam in British Columbia. 
The Committee has called on Canada to: 
In blatant disregard for the rights of the Wet’suwet’en people and for its Convention obligations, Canada has failed to take these actions. 
Please see the open letter to Prime Minister Trudeau  that Amnesty International Canada signed alongside 68 organizations, academics and public figures calling on him to fulfill Canada’s obligations under the Convention. 
The letter notes that,  
Instead of respecting human rights and taking strong action to address climate change, the Canadian government has escalated the use of force against Indigenous land defenders who, as well as defending their Indigenous rights, are defending the health of the planet for us all. Since 2019, when the CERD issued its declaration, the situation regarding Indigenous land defenders in BC has deteriorated. 
Canada’s highest courts have recognized that Indigenous legal processes existed prior to Canadian legal declaration or colonial recognition. What this means is that Canadian laws and colonial structures rest on top of Indigenous title and rights – not the other way around, as politicians and pipeline companies would have it. The Supreme Court of Canada, in 1997, recognized Wet’suwet’en rights and title to their lands. And in 2021, the BC and federal governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding that “recognize(s) that Wet’suwet’en rights and title are held by Wet’suwet’en Houses under their system of governance” and that “Canada and BC recognize Wet’suwet’en aboriginal rights and title throughout the Yintah”. 
Yet Canada and BC have chosen to criminalize – with violence – those who peacefully defend their rights and do not give their consent to the despoiling of their lands. Canada’s actions are inconsistent with its international obligations, and with federal and provincial legislation to implement the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms that Indigenous peoples have the right to make their own decisions about their lives and futures according to their own laws and traditions. This is fundamental. Anything less is a continuation of the structures and practices of colonial domination that the Declaration repudiates. 
One of the crucial purposes of human rights instruments like the Declaration is to hold governments to a higher standard when there is a conflict between what is politically convenient and what is right. When governments and companies consult or make agreements with communities, they should be prepared to hear ‘yes’, ‘no’, ‘not sure, not yet’. The real test of reconciliation is how they respond when Indigenous peoples say ‘no’, or ‘not yet’. 
Projects can be redesigned, finding new routes in the case of pipelines or alternative sources of power in the case of hydro-electric dams. Projects can be delayed until an agreement can be reached. And they can also be abandoned in favour of other projects where consent can be freely obtained. International guidance to companies provides steps for companies to take when consent is absent or withdrawn during the lifetime of a project. Without a doubt, there can be serious economic consequences for not proceeding with or withdrawing from a project. But at the same time, there are financial costs and social and environmental harms to others that would be avoided by cancelling a project. 
Finding the right balance between benefits and harms is a crucial matter of debate and public policy. In a time of climate crisis, the requirement for balance must be met with vision, boldness, and justice. If humanity is to survive, a just transition that puts human rights at the centre is urgently required. Indigenous knowledges are crucial to this transition.  
In Northwest British Columbia, Hereditary Chiefs of the 5 clans of the Wet’suwet’en people affirm:  
“All Wet’suwet’en Clans have rejected the Coastal Gas Link fracked gas pipeline because this is our home. Our medicines, our berries, our food, the animals, our water, our culture are all here since time immemorial. We are obligated to protect our ways of life for our babies unborn” 
No matter what the government of the day chooses to do, it cannot casually ignore inalienable rights protected by international law and the Constitution. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded that centuries of colonial laws and policies were designed with genocidal intent. By continuing to ignore the inherent rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada to make their own decisions according to their own laws and traditions, by denying consultation and consent-seeking processes for ALL Wet’suwet’en people, and by criminalizing those who say ‘no’ or ‘not yet’ or ‘not exactly like this’, Canada is reinforcing the unjust, colonial relationship between Canada and Indigenous peoples.

It is the third time in three years that the RCMP have arrested land defenders protecting the territory from an unwanted gas pipeline. 
On November 18 and 19, 2021, twenty-nine Indigenous people supporters and journalists were arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) on Wet’suwet’en territory in Northwest British Columbia, Canada. More arrests followed. 
The RCMP made the arrests while enforcing a Supreme Court of British Columbia injunction order obtained by the company Coastal Gaslink. The RCMP enforced the injunction order to remove people from a blockade to prevent drilling under the Wedzin Kwa (Morice River)—a major source of clean drinking water for the communities on the territory and spawning ground to critically endangered wild salmon. 
Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs – the traditional authorities of the Nation – have never consented to the Coastal Gaslink pipeline project, yet Canadian authorities have disregarded their right to self-determination and allowed the project to proceed without their consent. In September, they expressed their opposition to the company’s plans to drill under the river. In addition to the violation of their rights that has taken place and is ongoing, they are concerned about the risks the pipeline poses to their economic, social and cultural rights, and their environment and health. 
In 2019, the United Nations’ Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) assessed Canada’s role in approving the Coastal Gaslink pipeline without free, prior, and informed (FPIC) consent of the Wet’suwet’en people. 
The Committee celled upon and urged Canada to: 
Canada failed to take these actions. Indeed, deployment in November 2021 of yet more heavily armed police to the territory, leading to arrests and increased tensions, represent blatant disregard for the recommendation of the CERD.

Since its official backing by the B.C. provincial government was announced in October 2018, the Coastal GasLink pipeline – a 670-kilometre natural gas pipeline that would run through Wet’suwet’en traditional territory – has been vehemently opposed by all five Clans of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. Beginning in January 2019, the RCMP have had a heavy presence on the territory and previously arrested land defenders in 2019 and 2020 for defying a Supreme Court of British Columbia injunction obtained by Coastal Gaslink. The RCMP is reported to have spent nearly CAD $20 million between the end of January 2019 and March 31, 2021 on policing land defenders in Wet’suwet’en territory. 
In 2021, Coastal Gaslink made clear its intentions to begin drilling under the Wedzin Kwa (Morice River) as part of its pipeline construction work. The river is one of the major sources of clean drinking water in the territory and water defenders have raised concerns about the potential for catastrophic pollution to the river should the pipeline leak, rupture, or fail in any way. Spokespeople for the Hereditary Chiefs say the Wedzin Kwa is a sacred headwater within the territory which provides clean water and salmon spawning grounds. Impacts of a spill on spawning salmon could be devastating. 
The Hereditary Chiefs unanimously opposed any drilling under the river and on September 25 gave their permission for water and land defenders to establish a blockade (Coyote Camp) on the company’s drill pad to prevent the company from commencing drilling under the Wedzin Kwa. The camp is situated in Cas Yikh (Grizzly House) territory within the larger Gidimt’en clan territory, one of the five clans of the Wet’suwet’en Nation. 
Free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC) is an essential safeguard for rights that have been systematically abused by colonial states. Canada’s highest courts have recognized that Aboriginal title and rights to determine what happens within the territory rests with the Hereditary leadership structure of the Wet’suwet’en people. While several Wet’suwet’en band councils have signed agreements with the company to provide jobs and benefits for their community members, they do not have decision-making jurisdiction over development decisions for the larger territory. The Wet’suwet’en people have laws and processes in place to make collective decisions for the good of the entire Nation. Therefore, it is important that ALL peoples within the Wet’suwet’en Nation are consulted meaningfully and that they can exercise their right to give or withhold their free, prior, and informed consent according to their own customs, laws, and decision-making processes. 
The governments of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and British Columbia Premier John Horgan have both made commitments to uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples, including implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Yet both have demonstrated that they are prepared to ignore the voices of Indigenous Peoples when they say ‘no’ to a pipeline on their territory and to stand by while police enforce an injunction against land defenders. A selective approach to FPIC reinforces rather than transforms the underlying unjust relationship between Canada and Indigenous Peoples.

For years, the community has lived next to a waste disposal site containing vast amounts of unfiltered industrial refuse. The resulting toxins and foul smells threaten the health of local people and the surrounding environment. Their right to a healthy environment is at risk. 
The Indigenous community of Kanehsatà:ke is the second smallest in Québec. Construction waste from Montréal, one of the largest cities in Canada, is trucked to the community and left at the facility. Today, the equivalent of one hundred and sixty swimming pools of unidentified waste sit in the community of Kanehsatà:ke with little protection for those who live there. 
In the last parliament, the government was considering a bill to prevent and redress environmental racism, Bill C-230. We are joining other NGOs and Land Defenders in calling for the federal government to reinstate this bill. We are also calling on the federal government to reintroduce Bill C-28 to update and strengthen the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA).  
Left in limbo for too long 
Indigenous peoples must not be trapped in jurisdictional battles between federal and provincial authorities.  For reconciliation to take place, there must be truth and accountability. The people of Kanehstatà:ke have faced serious threats to their right to self-determination and are calling for a period of healing and reconciliation in action. The authorities must take action now to decontaminate the site as requested by the community. 
Will you join the campaign to call on Prime Minister Trudeau to take urgent action?

Dear Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier François Legault,  
As you may have been informed by your respective ministries, the G&R Recycling facility in Kanehsatà:ke, Québec, has been reported to contain toxic waste without permits or precautions(1) to prevent spillage into the environment. Health experts cited in local media and the Toronto Star(2) identify this waste as a threat to human health. The longer this waste sits unmanaged and untreated on Indigenous land, the greater the threat to all adjacent communities and waterways connecting with the St. Laurence seaway. 
Evidence from documents obtained through Freedom of Information Requests establish that Environment and Climate Change Canada and the Québec Ministère de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques have been aware of the presence of toxic waste on the site since 2019. In spite of this, neither the federal nor the provincial government has taken decisive action to secure the site. Instead, they have consistently redirected responsibility to one another, leading to a persisting danger for local residents with no clear roadmap for cleanup. 
G&R is no isolated incident. In 2019, the United Nations rapporteur for human rights and hazardous substances stressed that Indigenous Peoples are “disproportionately affected” by toxic waste. At Grassy Narrows, much of the population suffered from Mercury Poisoning. At Fort McMurray, First Nations communities continue to bear the brunt of the energy sector’s activities.  
At a time when Reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples is a national dialogue, actions must follow words to alleviate the historic and systemic mistreatment of Indigenous communities. We the undersigned in this network are calling on you today to mobilize the vast resources of the federal and provincial governments to immediately secure and decontaminate this dump site in Kanehsatà:ke and others like it. 
We also ask the federal government to re-introduce Bill C-230(3), as reported by committee in the last Parliament, and seek the agreement of other parties to proceed to third reading before the end of the year.  If passed, this bill would reveal the discriminatory effects of environmental policy-making and, we hope, avoid further instances of unregulated and dangerous waste sites on Indigenous lands and adjacent to the homes of the country’s racialized populations. 
Concretely, as an immediate display of good faith and commitment to Reconciliation, we demand that the federal government coordinate with the Province of Québec and Band Council to develop a plan to clean up the G&R facility with a publicly-available timeline and milestones.  
Sincerely,

Over the past two years, children living in al-Hol camp have not had proper access to food, clean water, and essential services such as healthcare and education. The Syrian Kurdish Autonomous Administration, which controls the camp, have been arbitrarily detaining twelve-year old boys, separating two-year old children from their caregivers, and curtailing access to healthcare. Increased child labour, violence and murder has severely impacted the growth and development of children. 
“Tens of thousands of children from Syria, Iraq and over 60 other countries, have been abandoned to misery, trauma and death simply because their governments are refusing to assume their responsibilities and bring these children back to a safe and secure environment,” said Diana Semaan, Amnesty International’s Syria researcher. 
“Governments must stop flouting their international human rights obligations to uphold these children’s right to life, survival and development and promptly repatriate them as a matter of urgency. Additionally, the Autonomous Administration must draw up a clear mechanism of return for Syrian children, their mothers or caregivers.”  
Amnesty International interviewed 10 individuals with knowledge of the situation in the camps, including eight eyewitnesses, who described the precarious conditions in al-Hol as well as abuses by the Autonomous Administration, which runs the camp and has effective control over north-east Syria.  
Since 2019 when the conflict with the armed group Islamic State in Syria ended, around 60,000 Syrians, Iraqis and third country nationals, mostly women and children, have been detained in al-Hol camp without access to due process, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. The camp houses individuals with varying degrees of affiliation with the IS, but also thousands of individuals with no association at all who flocked to the camp fleeing the conflict. 
Children stigmatized, detained and forcibly separated from their families 
The al-Hol camp is under the control of the Asayish, the Autonomous Administration’s police force. The main section of the camp hosts Syrians and Iraqis while the camp area known as the Annex – separated from the main camp by a checkpoint – hosts all women and children from third countries (other than Iraq). Children in the Annex are subjected to various forms of forced separation from their caregivers.  
Over the past year, the Asayish have been arbitrarily detaining boys as young as 12 in the Annex, separating them from their mothers and caregivers, solely on suspicion of the boys’ potential “radicalization” in the future and without any evidence of wrongdoing. The Asayish transfers the boys to detention centres described as “rehabilitation centres” outside of al-Hol camp, which lack adequate access to food, water and healthcare and where diseases such as tuberculosis and scabies are rampant.  
Children in the Annex as young as two are forced to separate from their mothers or caregivers in order to go to a hospital. When children need to access healthcare services outside of the camp, humanitarian organizations provide a referral based on a lengthy process. Armed security forces escort the children to the healthcare services and refuse to allow mothers or caregivers to join, and then fail to follow up directly with the caregivers who are left with no information about their children’s medical condition.   
Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, no child should be deprived of his or her liberty arbitrarily and the detention of a child should be a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.  
“The Autonomous Administration must immediately release all boys who have been arbitrarily detained and cease the practice of family separation and reunify as quickly as possible any child who remains separated from their parents or guardians,” said Diana Semaan.  
Movement curtailed, livelihood restricted 
Severe restrictions on movement imposed by the Autonomous Administration in practice amount to deprivation of liberty. Women and children cannot move out of the camp without prior approval, which is rarely ever granted by the Asayish, according to individuals interviewed by Amnesty International.  
To access the Annex’s service area, where humanitarian organizations provide healthcare and other essential services, women and children in the Annex need to obtain approval from the Asayish and cross a checkpoint run by them. At the checkpoint they must have their picture taken with their face uncovered, which means that women who are face-covered are forced to unveil. This process is repeated on every visit to the service area and has discouraged women from seeking medical care for them and their children, sometimes leading to serious medical conditions, including protracted infections and severe damage to vision and dental health. 
Men and women have very limited access to job opportunities. The Autonomous Administration briefly allowed humanitarian organizations to employ men and women in al-Hol’s main camp, but recently suspended the decision for unclear reasons.  
The lack of livelihood opportunities for adults, coupled with inadequate access to safe spaces and education for children, have led to an increase in child labour. A recent report by Save the Children, found that only 40% of children in al-Hol camp between the age of three and 17 are receiving education. During Covid-19 lockdowns, children in the camp were unable to continue their education as learning centres in the camp closed and online learning was not an option due to lack of internet connection and mobiles phones.  
Daunting present, bleak future 
The Autonomous Administration’s failure to produce and implement a transparent and consistent security plan in the camp has led to a climate of anger and fear amid the pervasive violence, according to individuals interviewed. A Save the Children report highlights the high murder rates in the camp with 79 people killed in the camp this year, including three children shot to death and 14 further deaths of children attributed to various incidents, like fires.   
“These unbearable conditions have taken a significant toll on children’s already-suffering mental health. Donors must ensure that humanitarian organizations have the needed funds to provide children in al-Hol and other camps in north-east Syria with psychosocial support,” said Diana Semaan. 
Barriers to return  
While some Syrians are granted permission to permanently leave the camp, a number of obstacles bar their return to their homes. These include fear of return to areas under the control of the Syrian government, the Autonomous Administration rejecting requests for return of some individuals and resulting in family separation, reluctance of women to return without their male relatives who are either detained or missing, and high transportation costs.  
Due to insufficient funding, humanitarian organizations operating in north-east Syria are unable to provide protection services for Syrian children when they leave al-Hol camp, often exposing them to the risk of child trafficking, early marriage, or recruitment by armed forces. 
For Iraqi and third national children, repatriation is their only chance of leaving the camp. In 2021, Iraq slowly begun a repatriation process. However, the majority of other states have been reluctant to fully commit to repatriation of all children.

All these people faced terrible injustices, and all are now free – a handful of the hundreds of lives changed by the Write for Rights campaign. 
In October 2001, a small group of Amnesty members met in Warsaw, Poland to plan activities for Human Rights Day on 10 December. Little did they know that 20 years later their ‘simple plan’ would change the lives of innumerable people around the world. 
In 2001, activists in Poland wrote letters to authorities for 24 hours straight and every letter aimed to end a human rights injustice – and with those 2,326 letters, Write for Rights was born! 
Write for Rights events take place around the world. Photo: Karen Veldkamp 
In 2002, the campaign went global, with activists from 18 other countries joining those in Poland. By 2005, the campaign got even bigger, with 37 countries taking part. Starting at midday on 10 December in Japan and Malaysia, crossing to Mongolia and Nepal, then onto countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and ending in the Americas. At the culmination of the 24-hours, over 80,000 letters had been written. 
From small seeds, mighty trees grow and what started as a group of friends taking part in a 24-hour ‘letter writing marathon’, has now become the biggest human rights campaign in the world. By 2019, the 24 hours had become two weeks of activities, with over 100 countries taking part and 6.6 million letters, emails, SMS’ and Twitter actions collected. From music concerts in Burkina Faso, to theatre shows in Morocco, speakers’ tours in Norway, art exhibitions in Brazil and over 700 schools in Poland, Write for Rights has grown and morphed into something truly amazing.

As the campaign has grown in numbers, so too have the successes. The impact of Write for Rights has been life changing for those featured. In 2019, student activist and poet, 24-year-old Paing Phyo Min, was arrested after performing satirical poetry criticizing the military in Myanmar. The charges against him included “incitement”; the authorities claiming that the poetry performance would encourage military officers to abandon their duties. Paing Phyo Min was sentenced to six-years behind bars. Over 300,000 letters and cards, signatures and Tweets were collected on behalf of Paing Phyo Min. A few months after the campaign, in April 2021, Paing Phyo was released from prison.

On 30 June 2021, Burundian human rights defender Germain Rukuki was released after serving more than four years in prison. He should never have been imprisoned in the first place – Germain was arrested, prosecuted and convicted simply for his human rights work. 
During Write for Rights, supporters from around the world took more than 436,000 actions calling for Germain’s freedom. Germain’s wife Emelyne Mupfasoni shared her thanks with all those who acted, “From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank you all to have mobilized and made it possible for Germain to soon reunite with us…”

Eighteen students and one member of faculty were on trial for more than two years for organising a Pride event at the Middle Eastern Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey, in 2019. Over 445,000 actions were taken on behalf of the METU Pride defendants, who faced up to three years in prison if found guilty. Melike Balkan and Özgür Gür, two of the 19 defendants, wholeheartedly joined the campaign, taking part in many activities. While the Covid-19 pandemic prevented travel, they joined over 20 online meetings with Amnesty members and students across the world. On 8 October 2021 they were acquitted of almost all charges. Melike and Özgür have gone on to form their own NGO, advocating, campaigning and defending the rights of young LGBTI+ people and students in Turkey.

During Write for Rights 2014, hundreds of thousands of people around the world called for the release of Moses Akatugba. In 2005, Moses was just 16 years old when he was accused of stealing three mobile phones, tortured by the police into ‘confessing’ and sentenced to death. 
In June 2015, after over 800,000 messages were directed to the Governor of Nigeria’s Delta State, Moses was pardoned. When Moses finally left prison, he expressed his huge gratitude to all those who had written on his behalf, stating: “I want to assure them that this great effort they have shown to me will not be in vain, by the special grace of God I will live up to their expectation. I promise to be a human rights activist – to fight for others.” 
I want to assure them [Amnesty supporters] that this great effort they have shown to me will not be in vain… I will live up to their expectation 
And fight he did. 
In December 2019, Moses travelled to the European Parliament in Brussels to take part in Write for Rights actions for fifteen-year-old Magai Matiop Ngong from South Sudan, who featured in the campaign that year. Like Moses, Magai had been sentenced to death when only a child. Moses used his unique experience to campaign on behalf of Magai. Following more than 700,000 letters, tweets, postcards and messages, the Court of Appeal in South Sudan repealed the death sentence imposed on Magai, noting that he was a child at the time of the crime. 
From Moses to Melike and Özgür, these inspiring people represent just a handful of those who have been released over the past 20 years, thanks to your incredible work. Nothing compares to the power of people and Amnesty International’s campaign shows how writing a letter, sending a tweet or signing a petition really can change a person’s life.

Mamadou Konaté is an immigrant worker from Ivory Coast who has lived in Canada for six years who was at imminent risk of deportation on 19 November. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he worked in facilities accompanying vulnerable seniors. He contracted COVID-19 in the workplace. In 2020, the federal and Quebec governments launched programs to give permanent residency to refugee claimants who worked in healthcare services during COVID-19. The programmes are discriminatory against certain healthcare worker roles such as janitorial positions, like Mamadou Konaté. The government threatened to deport him on 19 November, but on 17 November a judge announced his deportation was suspended.    
NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUESTED. MANY THANKS TO ALL WHO SENT APPEALS.   
A Canadian judge suspended Mamadou’s deportation on 17 November 2021. His asylum case will continue to be processed, and there is still risk that he will be deported at a later date. For the moment, we are celebrating that the deportation was suspended. Mamadou was prepared for the worst; his bags were already packed, and he was ready to leave. The judge issued a stay of deportation until the end of Mamdou’s legal proceedings in federal court. They are also pursuing an evaluation under section 42.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to lift his inadmissibility in Canada.  
Amnesty’s Urgent Action Network contributed massively to put pressure on the Canadian government, it would not have happened without coordinated global pressure, and we are hopeful it will continue to have an impact. Mamadou is still at risk of being deported but we will continue working with him and the many other Canadian groups supporting his case until he obtains his permanent residency in Canada. Mamadou is very thankful for and moved by Amnesty’s support, he said “mille mercis à vous” (many thanks to you).

Colombia:  Shoot on Sight: Eye Trauma in the Context of the National Strike documents 12 cases of police violence that resulted in irreversible eye trauma. Four of the cases occurred in previous years and eight in the context of the 2021 National Strike, in the cities of Bogotá, Popayán, Florencia, Medellín and Manizales. Amnesty International’s Digital Verification Corps analysed more than 300 pieces of audiovisual material on the disproportionate and repressive actions of ESMAD between 28 April and 20 October, concluding that officials carried out widespread human rights violations against protesters by inflicting eye injuries through the disproportionate use of less lethal weapons. 
“It is chilling to see how members of the Mobile Anti-Riot Squad deliberately fired at the eyes of so many people, just for daring to exercise their legitimate right to peaceful protest. The Colombian authorities must guarantee justice, comprehensive care and reparation to the victims and take the necessary measures to avoid a repetition of these serious human rights violations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
The report highlights the stories of victims of eye trauma and describes the multiple barriers they have faced in ensuring they received specialized health and psycho-social care. Several victims have faced increased obstacles in accessing decent work or continuing their education under conditions of equality. 
Their accounts describe in detail how their injuries were not accidental, but were targeted attacks intended to punish them for legitimately exercising their right to social protest. They reveal once again patterns in the conduct of ESMAD officials which corroborate repeated complaints about the systematic nature of their practices of excessive and disproportionate use of force. 
“Police violence cannot continue to be part of our daily lives. We cannot get used to the state indiscriminately violating citizens’ rights, much less harming those who exercise their right to protest. The cases of police violence and specifically eye injuries committed during the 2021 strike that we registered in our platform demonstrate that the actions of the police do not comply with international human rights standards and that police reform is necessary to guarantee the safety and lives of the people,” said Alejandro Rodríguez, coordinator of Grita, Temblores’ police violence observatory. 
One of the most emblematic cases in the report is that of Leidy Cadena, a political science student who was demonstrating peacefully with her boyfriend and some friends in central Bogotá on 28 April when ESMAD officials approached them in an aggressive manner. “I just shouted ‘let’s go’ and immediately afterwards my face felt very hot. I couldn’t see through either of my eyes, I was in a great deal of distress,” said Leidy. 
Amnesty International verified a video taken following the incident in which five ESMAD members are seen with shields and two of them are carrying riot gear in their hands, including mechanical kinetic weapons. Leidy is covering her bleeding eye, clearly in pain and her companions ask for help, but the ESMAD officials do not help her. 
Leidy lost an eye in the attack. She believes that it was an act of gender-based violence because her companions were unharmed and from the start of the demonstrations she had noticed several attacks against women. After she reported the incident to the Attorney General’s Office, Leidy confirmed that she was interviewed about what happened at least 10 times and that this revictimized her. She also received threats on social media and on 16 October she was the victim of an attack when gunpowder was pushed under her door. Leidy, her mother and her partner have been forced to leave Colombia because of the threats. 
Based on the evidence and statements presented in the report, Amnesty International, Temblores and PAIIS urge the Colombian authorities to comply without delay with the recommendations of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights following its working visit in June 2021 – in particular ensuring that the use of non-lethal means of controlling public order is subject to strict, publicly available protocols. To prevent the excessive use of force during protests, the Colombian authorities must undertake a structural reform of the National Police, in particular ESMAD, which ensures a civilian approach in their actions, as well as independent and effective monitoring systems and investigation protocols to investigate police abuses. Likewise, they must create pathways for supporting victims of eye injuries and gender-based violence that include prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and psycho-social care. 
“We had the privilege of supporting several victims of eye injuries who gave testimonies about their cases before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and we continue to provide legal assistance to some of them. We understand their struggle and frustration and we support their demands for justice. We are convinced of the need to continue to draw attention to the ways in which the security forces not only do not guarantee the rights of citizens, but deliberately violate them. Eye injuries appear to be a punishment for victims for exercising their legitimate right to protest, which is stamped on their faces and their lives,” said Juliana Bustamante, Director of PAIIS.

Panusaya is a student activist leader who has risen to prominence for her advocacy work promoting freedom of expression, equality, and – a highly sensitive topic in Thailand – the reform of the monarchy. Authorities have repeatedly detained her and denied her bail. She now faces a charge of lèse majesté for wearing a crop top in protest at criminal charges against another demonstrator. In the lead-up to Panusaya’s next court date on Nov. 26, Amnesty International activists are staging demonstrations at Thai embassies around the world, calling on authorities to drop her unjustified charges.  
Panusaya is among more than 1,000 peaceful protesters – including students, youth, and dozens of children – who face criminal charges in Thailand since demonstrations started ramping up in July 2020. Many are at risk of lengthy sentences, including prison terms up to life imprisonment, as officials abuse vaguely worded security legislation and COVID-19 emergency powers to restrict peaceful dissent.   
Rung is also featured in Amnesty International’s 2021 Write for Rights campaign, an annual human rights event that mobilizes hundreds of thousands of people around the world to write letters, sign petitions, and post social media messages in support of those who are facing human rights violations.

“While countries across the Americas have an obligation to protect all Venezuelans who seek safety in their territories, it is women and girls who are at disproportionate risk from violence and discrimination. States have a pressing duty to ensure a gender-sensitive response to those seeking protection,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The entire international community needs to take ownership of the second largest human mobility crisis in the world, as per the international principle of shared responsibility. Civil society organizations, human rights defenders and international organizations provide much needed relief to Venezuelans in the most precarious situations, but states must guarantee their human rights are protected, particularly of those who are most vulnerable to violence and discrimination, such as women and girls.” 
Amnesty International recently partnered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in a two-year project to support the protection of women, girls and people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identity in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador, responding to the urgent needs of Venezuelans seeking protection. 
In Peru, one of the main host countries of Venezuelans, Amnesty International’s research shows how migrant and refugee women face gender-based violence and discrimination on a daily basis, which is often reinforced by having an irregular migratory status in the country, including pending asylum claims that seem endlessly stalled. Having interviewed survivors of gender-based violence, human rights defenders and public authorities, the organization confirmed how Venezuelan women suffer harassment at the workplace, on the streets and in educational centers; sexual blackmail to sustain jobs or homes; physical and psychological abuse; and a constant fear of being returned to Venezuela. 
While gender-based violence affects women of all nationalities, whether Venezuelan, Peruvian, or Colombian, and the official reporting channels are the same for all, migrant and refugee women predominantly from Venezuela face additional challenges to access justice, protection and support. These include discrimination based on their nationality; stereotyped comments that hypersexualize them by state agents who are supposed to protect them; a lack of information; and a fear of reprisals, such as deportation, that often discourage them from reporting violence against them. 
Amnesty International urges the Peruvian authorities to strengthen efforts to build capacity of public officers on the prohibition of discrimination based on gender, migration and other status, and to ensure that they are aware of existing legal mechanisms to attend survivors of gender-based violence without a regular migratory status in the country. In addition, it is essential that authorities widely disseminate information on the rights of migrant and refugee women to access justice, protection and support services regardless of their immigration status.

To mark this year’s 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence–an annual international campaign celebrating women in every region of the world who fight gender-based discrimination and stand up for women’s rights–the human rights organization is sharing the stories of 16 trailblazing Afghan women who had overcome huge barriers to participation across public life over the past two decades. In their own words, women from diverse public spheres including law, politics, academia, and the media recount their professional paths, their feelings about the Taliban’s return, their hopes and fears for the future, and their recommendations to the international community on how to continue supporting women’s rights.   
“These stories offer a powerful and timely reminder of just how far Afghan women had come over the past twenty years, in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles. They also provide a sobering insight into how life has transformed for women and girls since the Taliban’s return,” said Samira Hamidi, Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner.  
“It’s astonishing that, at a time the country is facing an economic and humanitarian crisis, these women and thousands more like them are being barred from public life. We urge the Taliban to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of women and girls. We call on the international community to engage directly with Afghan women to understand their reality, listen to their pragmatic recommendations, and work with them to support women’s rights.”    
Since taking control of Kabul on 15 August 2021, the Taliban have imposed severe restrictions on women and girls. Apart from healthcare workers and a few other isolated exemptions, women have been told they cannot return to work or travel in public without being accompanied by a Mahram (male guardian). Since 20 September, girls above the age of 12 (grade six and above) have not been allowed to go to school, while rigid gender segregation at universities has severely curtailed women in higher education.  
Businesswoman Sediqa Mushtaq told Amnesty International, “When I heard the news that the Taliban had entered Kabul, I felt as if I fell and broke into pieces. I fell from a bright place into darkness with no light to be seen.”  
Preventing women from working has exacerbated economic problems for many families, which had previously enjoyed steady professional incomes, while removing women from government jobs has left a huge hole in the state’s capacity to govern effectively. Women now also face increased threats of gender-based violence and severe restrictions on their rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, including on even their choice of clothing.  
Fawzia Amini, formerly a senior judge in Afghanistan’s Supreme Court, said: “The Taliban have institutionalized discrimination against women; they are denying our fundamental rights…they want to wipe women from the face of society and make us all prisoners in our own homes.”  
While much work remained to be done, women’s rights had improved significantly since the fall of the first Taliban regime in 2001. There were 3.3 million girls in education, and women had actively participated in the political, economic and social life of the country. Despite ongoing conflict, Afghan women had become lawyers, doctors, judges, teachers, engineers, athletes, activists, politicians, journalists, bureaucrats, business owners, police officers, and members of the military.  
Former police officer, Zala Zazai, said: “The international community must pressure the Taliban to ensure women’s rights and they must do everything to ensure that women are part of the new government. The Taliban cannot eliminate half of the population of Afghanistan.”  
Background  
The briefing, “They are the Revolution”: Afghan Women fighting for their future under Taliban rule, is available here.  
The 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign, which starts on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on 25 November and runs until Human Rights Day on 10 December. It provides a platform for individuals and organizations around the world to call for the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls.

The Central American country was cause for extreme concern during decades of armed conflict and genocidal violence by the army that saw 200,000 mostly Indigenous Mayan people killed or disappeared and another 150,000 forced into exile, many of them in Canada. 
Today, we are once again witnessing a desperate exodus, as a growing number of Guatemalans feel they have no choice but to flee the devastations of climate change, deterioration of their livelihood, violence and pervasive insecurity. Add to that an assault by the state on human rights defenders, free press, and organizations that have sought to protect land, Indigenous territory, and the rule of law for all. 
It is imperative that Canada speaks out visibly and consistently to support civil society leaders and organizations in Guatemala that are under increasing attack. It is also imperative that Canada works with international allies to stop a return to terror and impunity. 
In recent weeks, Canadian organizations received urgent calls for solidarity from El Estor in eastern Guatemala. In July 2019, the country’s Constitutional Court ordered a suspension of operations at the notorious Fenix nickel mine, formerly Canadian-owned and long accused of violating Indigenous rights. Last month, President Alejandro Giammattei decreed a state of siege and sent in heavily armed security forces to quash a peaceful protest by community members against the mine’s continued operation. Human rights organizations documented excessive use of force by security forces, injuring women and children. Fear spread as the homes of Mayan Q’eqchi’ community leaders were raided and journalists threatened. 
The situation in El Estor is only the latest in a pattern of repression and persecution of people who speak up for Indigenous rights and the environment in areas where mines and hydroelectric projects have obtained permits to operate. Guatemala has a pattern of issuing such permits—many to companies with Canadian financial backing—despite clear corporate failures to comply with environmental assessment requirements, engage in meaningful consultation or obtain the free, prior and informed consent of affected Indigenous peoples. 
Economic imperatives behind Canada’s promotion of Canadian mining projects must not trump international obligations to protect human rights and threatened human rights defenders. As an endorser of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, Canada knows only too well what those obligations are. 
Meanwhile, the situation is becoming ever more dangerous. Guatemala was the world’s seventh-deadliest country for land and environment defenders in 2020. Smear campaigns and unfounded criminal charges are also used to attack Indigenous rights defenders, human rights activists and their supporters. 
Disturbingly, prosecutors, judges, and magistrates are now being criminalized, too. Those targeted include members of the Human Rights Prosecutor’s Office, the Special Prosecutor’s Office against Impunity, magistrates of the Constitutional Court, judges of higher-risk courts, and tribunals involved with emblematic cases of serious human rights violations and large-scale corruption investigations. 
In May, a former analyst with the International Commission against Impunity, who worked on the so-called La Línea bribery-to-avoid-taxes case against former president Otto Pérez Molina, was arrested along with the former head of the Tax Administration Superintendency. Both remain in preventive detention where they have received threats and are in a high-risk situation, made worse because they investigated many of the people detained in the same place. 
Equally alarming is the transfer last month of Hilda Pineda, head of the Human Rights Prosecutors Office, to a new office investigating crimes against tourists. Pineda worked on conflict-era crimes, including the genocide case against former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, won the conviction of two military officials in the landmark Sepur Zarco sexual violence case and advanced other important cases that led to the conviction of high-level military officials for crimes against humanity. Tellingly, the office from which Pineda was moved also oversees units investigating current violations against human rights defenders and journalists. 
A dangerous backslide is clearly underway. What is at stake is nothing less than the independence of the judiciary, the right to due process, and the right to protect human rights, Indigenous territory, and the environment. UN and OAS experts are sounding the alarm. Will Canada do the right thing and unequivocally prioritize the defence of justice, human rights, the rule of law and hope in Guatemala?

According to...","Sudanese security forces have intensified their use of lethal force over the past two weeks to quell protests against a military takeover of power last month, carrying out dozens of unlawful killings and leaving at least 50 people with gunshot wounds, Amnesty International said today. 
According to the Sudanese Doctors’ Committee, a group monitoring the situation, at least 40 people were killed mostly by live ammunitions during demonstrations in the capital Khartoum since 25 October, when army leader Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan declared a nationwide state of emergency, dissolved the cabinet and arrested dozens of civilian politicians. 
“The escalation in the use of lethal force by the security authorities in Sudan in the past two weeks was calculated to intimidate and quell protests from the streets against a military takeover of power last month.” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa.      
“The killing of dozens of unarmed protesters calls for a prompt, independent and impartial investigation to ensure accountability for the killings and other serious human rights violations allegedly committed by security forces. Authorities must investigate the fatal shootings of unarmed protesters, allow for this investigation to be internationally monitored, and hold those responsible to account.” 
Killings  by security forces 
Security forces intensified the use of lethal force to counter organized protests in the capital Khartoum on 13 and 17 November, killing at least 23 people, according to the Sudanese Doctors’ Committee. 
Research and interviews by Amnesty International confirmed that at least nine of the protesters killed on 13 and 17 November had died of wounds sustained from gunshots, including one by sniper fire. The organization also confirmed that at least fifty people sustained gunshot wounds during the protests. 
Since the military took power in Sudan last month, security forces have increasingly used live ammunition and teargas to disperse widespread protests. An agreement signed on 21 November resulted in reinstating civilian Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok who said following his re-appointment that the authorities would conduct “an independent and transparent investigation into all the violations” that happened since 25 October.  
“Given the past poor track record of Sudanese authorities in investigating similar violations in the past, any investigation into these violations must be monitored and assisted by international observers, to ensure that it produces credible results,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“The fact that a political agreement is signed should not allow the perpetrators of these violations to go unpunished”  
Escalation of lethal force against protesters 
Research by Amnesty International confirmed that nine of the slain protesters had all died of gunshots that targeted their heads, necks and chests on 13 and 17 November, including one from sniper bullets, as well as at least 50 cases of injuries from gunshot wounds. At least one was shot by a sniper. The use of lethal force was unwarranted since they were all unarmed. The organization has also established that security agents raided hospitals.  
On 13 November, four protesters were killed, of which three of whom died of gunshot wounds and one from teargas suffocation, according to the Sudanese Doctors’ Committee. Amnesty International confirmed that at least one of these protesters was killed by sniper fire. 
18-year-old secondary school student Elshaikh Youssef was marching with his friends on 40th Street in Omdurman, Khartoum’s twin city, when he told his friends that he had spotted a sniper on one of the rooftops. As Elshaikh pointed upwards he was shot with a bullet that came from the same direction, a family member and his friends told Amnesty International. 
By the time his friends brought him to the hospital, Elshaikh was already dead. An autopsy confirmed he had died from a gunshot wound to his shoulder which pierced his chest and heart. 
One of Elshaikh’s close relatives told Amnesty International that “I’m devastated. I’m close to losing my faith in God. How could something like this happen?!” 
This confirms multiple reports by Sudanese activists of snipers shooting at protesters from rooftops, aiming their bullets at their heads and chests.   
“These killings demonstrate that there is a deliberate and targeted plan by the authorities to suppress the protests at all costs,” 
“An independent and impartial investigation is needed to ensure that perpetrators are brought to account through courts in fair trials.” 
Security forces went further with their violence on 17 November, killing at least 15 protesters as per the count of the Sudanese Doctors Committee.  Between 1:45 – 5:15 pm on 17 November, the International Hospital in Khartoum North received eight cases of people shot; three with gunshots to the chest, three with gunshots to the head, and two shot in the neck. All of them later died, an on-duty hospital staff told Amnesty International. 
Other protesters bled to death before reaching hospital. A female protester, 25-year-old Sit al-Nafar Bakar, was killed when she was shot in the face while running away from police in Khartoum North at around 4h00 pm.  A close family member told Amnesty that the victim was a nursing student, a dedicated activist, and “a very humble and courageous girl who was always at the forefront of protests. Those who knew her told Amnesty International that she used to say that she was protesting for a civilian state and that if she died, “get justice for me.” 
Another protester killed by live ammunition on the same day was Muzamil al-Jinaid, a 32-year businessman. He was shot dead at around 4:30 pm in Khartoum North. “No one witnessed what happened. We just received a call telling us to come to the hospital to identify a body. When we arrived, we found his dead body with gunshots wounds in it,” a close family member told Amnesty International.  
The violence follows a long-standing pattern of security forces using excessive and deadly force including by shooting live ammunition at protesters to break up demonstrations in Sudan. However, this pattern greatly escalated to counter protests by unarmed civilians since the military takeover.  
“The increase in killings last week confirms Sudan’s security leaders are disregarding the right to life, peaceful protest, and shows contempt for legal norms governing the use of force,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Arbitrary arrests and detentions 
Meanwhile, military authorities continued to arrest civilian politicians and activists, adding to dozens who have already been arbitrarily detained across the country since 25 October. However, a handful of detainees have been released since the political agreement was signed on 21 November. 
Nour Al-Din Salah, a senior member of the Sudanese Congress Party, was arrested at midnight on 16 November when a group of armed security agents forced their way into his house in Khartoum. His family members told Amnesty International that they blindfolded him and took him away. The arrest took place just hours after Salah appeared in an interview aired by Al-Jazeera Arabic, in which he criticized the military’s takeover of power. His sister told Amnesty International that they are demanding information about his whereabouts and the charges against him.             
Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch confirmed in a joint statement on 9 November that at least eight detainees were being held in undisclosed locations, without access to family or legal counsel in circumstances that may amount to enforced disappearances. One of them, however, has been reportedly released. 
Authorities have also been disrupting internet and telecommunications since 25 October to limit people’s ability to plan and document protests. The internet was cut for more than three weeks, while phone lines were cut for hours on 17 November. The services were restored on 18 November. 
“Sudanese security actors are clearly operating with a sense of total impunity,” said Deprose Muchena. “If they continue on their current course, we are clearly going to lose more lives. Authorities must be held accountable, including individuals who bear the greatest responsibility for these serious abuses.”

Additional Information:  
Dipti Rani Das, a 17-year-old girl, was arrested in Dinajpur, Bangladesh, on 28 October 2020 under the country’s draconian Digital Security Act (2018) for a Facebook post which contained a photograph of a woman keeping the Islamic holy book Quran in between her thighs. 
Concerned over the impact that the Facebook post may have had on Dipti Rani Das, her father went to the police station with his family to seek a resolution upfront on the afternoon of 28 October 2020. There, they saw a gathering of about 100 religious clerics who came to file a case against her. They apologized verbally to the people present at the police station and to the Muslim community for the Facebook post, which some people at the police station livestreamed on Facebook. The family also submitted a written apology to the local police chief. The livestreamed apology further agitated some people in the neighbourhood, who then attacked the home of Dipti Rani Das and her family later that evening.Afraid of further attacks, Dipti Rani Das’s father tried to send her daughter away for some days to a relative’s home by train. However, she was stopped at the train and taken to the police station by several individuals who demanded that she be punished for posting the photograph. 
Arrested on 28 October 2020, she has since been in detention at a correction facility in Rajshahi, a northern district in Bangladesh, and could face up to seven years in jail if convicted. After being denied bail three times at a lower court, a High Court granted her bail on 11 May 2021. However, the bail order was stayed through an appeal by the deputy commissioner of Dinajpur, her home district.The UN Human Rights Committee, which monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, stated that “prohibitions of displays of lack of respect for a religion or other belief system, including blasphemy laws, are incompatible with the Covenant”, except in the specific circumstances when it amounts to advocacy of hatred that incites violence, hostility or discrimination.An afficionado of Humayun Ahmed’s novels, Dipti Rani Das loves painting and writing stories. She wanted to study science, but her family couldn’t afford paying for it. She had enrolled in arts for her first year at the Parbatipur Government College in August 2020. Since her detention, Dipti Rani Das has lost her ability to pursue her education and faces further risk of harassment and discrimination. “I wish that my daughter has the opportunity to freely move in the society, complete her education and build a future. I request the government to relieve her from this case in consideration of her future,” her father told Amnesty International. 
In a July 2021 report, Amnesty International documented a wide range of human rights violations committed by the Bangladeshi security agencies in the pretext of containing false, offensive, defamatory or derogatory information online. The human rights organization called on Bangladesh’s government to urgently repeal or substantially amend the 2018 Digital Security Act and end the crackdown on people’s right to freedom of expression online.

On 9 November a member of Turkmenia, Unite! received a formal response to their inquiry from theRussian Ministry of Interior indicating that Azat Isakov left the country on 22 October. Azat Isakovcould not have left the country through his own means because he did not possess the necessarytravel documents. Since 2020 Azat Isakov and his family members living in Turkmenistan have reported receivingconstant threats from officers of the Ministry of National Security of Turkmenistan, including threats ofabduction and rape of family members. 
Write to the President urging him to: 
•Ensure the urgent disclosure of information on the fate and whereabouts of Azat Isakov; 
• If he is in the custody of Turkmenistani law enforcement, ensure that he is protected fromtorture and other ill-treatment and that he has access to his family and any medical care hemight require 
• Release Azat Isakov immediately unless there is sufficient credible evidence to charge him withan internationally recognized criminal offence

Turkmenia, Unite! movement is an opposition group that actively criticizes the Turkmenistan government through social media. They post videos on their Facebook and YouTube pages where they highlight social problems within the country and call on the president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov to respond to people’s needs. 
Turkmenia, Unite! became very vocal after the events in 2020: mass poisoning of Turkmenistani labour migrants in Turkey in March, and hurricane that brought havoc in the Lebat region in April 
Azat Isakov’s parents, wife and children live in Turkmenistan. Since Azat Isakov’s online activism they have reported threats from the Ministry of National Security. On 24 July 2020 Ministry officials seized their phones to investigate Isakov’s whereabouts in Russia. Two days later one of the pro-government YouTube channels declared that they knew Azat Isakov’s Russian address. Soon afterwards Azat Isakov started to receive threats and demands to return to Turkmenistan. Isakov was afraid of persecution and after his documents were stolen he refused to go to the Russian migration services to renew his working status. On 15 September Russian police apprehended Isakov but released him after 2 days in custody. On 20 Oct Azat Isakov disappeared and was reported back in Turkmenistan on 22 Oct.Activists from Turkmenia, Unite! posted a statement on their YouTube channel where they claim Isakov is being held incommunicado in the 6th branch of the Police Department in Turkmenabat notorious for prosecuting opposition figures and journalist, and using torture practices. 
Many groups, including Amnesty International and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have called for the immediate end to this approach, expressing concern that the government’s dangerously broad counter-insurgency strategy has led to an increase in human rights violations against human rights defenders and political activists across the country.

“In accompaniment with victims of human rights violations and courageous Colombian organizations, we have requested meetings with President Iván Duque and other senior officials of his administration, in the hope that they will show willingness to urgently address the grave human rights crisis in the country,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“These are matters of life and death that affect millions of people in Colombia. From impunity for police violence in the context of repression of protests, and the devastating consequences of the armed conflict on historically marginalized communities, to the grave situation faced by human rights defenders and community leaders – with Colombia being the most lethal country in the world for human rights defenders – these are issues that require a firm response from the government. We hope that President Duque will be willing to engage in dialogue and seek solutions.”

A combination of a suspension of foreign aid, the freezing of Afghan government assets, and international sanctions on the Taliban, have plunged a country already suffering from high poverty levels into a full-blown economic crisis. According to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), 22.8 million people (of a population of approximately 39-40 million) are facing acute food insecurity and hunger, while the World Food Programme estimates that at least a million children are already suffering from acute malnutrition. According to the UN, more than $200 million of humanitarian aid a month is needed to avert disaster.  
“Current levels of humanitarian assistance are insufficient to deal with the crisis, with millions of Afghans plunging into poverty and facing the risk of starvation. We have seen countries making pledges and promises to provide aid to Afghanistan over recent months, but this support is yet to reach those who need it the most,” said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s South Asia Regional Director.     
“In just a few months, the situation is already critical. People in the public and private sectors have not been paid their salaries, can’t access money, and can’t afford even essential items. Food insecurity is an issue throughout the country. Afghanistan is at the precipice – without an urgent programme of targeted international support and without permitting the use of Afghanistan government reserves to support the country’s population, the scene is set for a human catastrophe over the coming months.”  
With the Taliban remaining on lists of internationally sanctioned groups, Afghanistan’s foreign donors have moved to withhold and withdraw funding from the country following the group’s capture of Kabul on 15 August. According to the World Bank, prior to the Taliban’s takeover, aid grants constituted 43% of Afghanistan’s GDP and about 75% of its public spending.   
The situation has left the country’s banking system on the brink of collapse. Long queues have formed outside banks and ATMs, which are not dispensing cash. The price of goods has soared while the country’s currency has plummeted in value.  
In August, the Biden administration froze $9.5 billion assets of Da Afghanistan Bank, the country’s central bank. The EU followed suit on 17 August, withdrawing $1.4 billion in development and emergency aid (pledged between 2021 and 2025) to Afghanistan’s healthcare, agriculture and law enforcement sectors. The withdrawal of the EU funding precipitated the immediate closure of at least 2,000 health facilities serving around 30 million Afghans.  
The IMF have frozen the Taliban’s access to $460 million of funds. Other international institutions including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also suspended payments to their projects in Afghanistan.  
Public sector workers have not been paid for months, while about 1.2 million private sector workers’ wages remain pending according to local media, with the government and employers unable to access funds to make payments. According to the UN Development Programme, the country’s poverty rate, currently at 72%, is set to reach to 97% by mid-2022.   
Food insecurity was threatening the country even before the Taliban takeover, with Afghanistan hit by four years of extreme drought, economic recession and mass internal displacement. There are more than four million internally displaced people across Afghanistan – more than 570,000 of whom have been displaced since January – living in desperate conditions.   
Although a flurry of humanitarian aid pledges has been made by the international community, the equipment and cash amounts promised will not be sufficient to cope with the scale of the crisis facing Afghanistan. Moreover, with access to many areas of the country near impossible during winter, it’s also essential that all assistance is carefully planned and delivered on time.   
“Humanitarian aid and the use of public funds for essential services must not be politicized. Donor countries must urgently develop a comprehensive action plan for the dissemination of financial and humanitarian aid support in consultation with NGOs and other humanitarian agencies on the ground. This should include independent monitoring and enhanced periodic public reporting that ensures support reaches those who need it the most. At the same time, the Taliban must cooperate in giving unrestricted access to UN agencies and humanitarian groups to do their work,” said Yamini Mishra. 
“The international community’s top priority must be to prevent the deaths and suffering of people in Afghanistan and protect their human rights. All governments and international organizations must review existing policies, including freezes of aid, assets and financial transactions, in favour of a solution that allows the use of central bank funds to cover essential requirements, including payment of workers, to prevent a humanitarian and human rights catastrophe. This may involve lifting sanctions on the Taliban authorities subject to conditions regarding the use of the funds.”  
Background   
At the UN Geneva Conference in September, the international community pledged $1.2 billion in humanitarian and development aid. At the G-20 Summit in October, the EU promised $1.15 billion to avert humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.

“The Colombian state is still failing to address its historical failure to put in place a comprehensive response to the dangerous situation defenders face in the country. Threats and attacks against human rights defenders continue to occur day after day, making Colombia once again the most lethal country to defend human rights,” said Fernanda Doz Costa, deputy director of research for the Americas at Amnesty International.  
“The hearing in Congress is a unique opportunity to set out a path for Colombia to make progress in protecting human rights defenders and to discuss how authorities that do not act diligently to address the grave situation faced by human rights defenders in the country can be held to account.” 
In recent years, Front Line Defenders and Global Witness have consistently ranked Colombia as the country with the highest number of killings of environmentalists and human rights defenders in the world. 
In October 2020, Amnesty International set out a series of recommendations for the comprehensive protection of defenders at national level and in four cases in particular. However, to date, the Colombian authorities have done very little to guarantee safe conditions for the defence of human rights in the country. They continue to promote a protection model that has proven to be ineffective because it is based solely on material protection measures; on issuing laws, decrees and regulations that lack the means to ensure that they are properly implemented; and on measures aimed at individual protection rather than a collective approach. 
Likewise, the authorities have made very slow progress on various processes that could address the structural causes of violence, including investigating threats and attacks, recognizing Indigenous territories and dismantling armed groups. On the contrary, they have adopted measures that increase the dangers defenders face, such as, for example, the decision to resume the forced eradication of illicit crops and to reduce National Protection Unit protection schemes during the pandemic. 
The Colombian Congress has called a public hearing on the issue today to demand accountability for the lack of security guarantees for human rights defenders and civil society leaders in the country. Civil society organizations and defenders will participate in the hearing, such as María Ciro, a representative of the Catatumbo Social Integration Committee (CISCA), who are having to live with risk because of their work defending human rights and lack adequate protection from the state. State institutions responsible for guaranteeing their protection are also expected to participate. 
The case of defender Jani Silva is an example of the lack of an adequate response from the Colombian authorities. Throughout 2021, she has been the victim of a number of threats from armed groups for her work defending human rights, even though she has been given material protection measures by the National Protection Unit and has been granted precautionary measures by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The latest incident resulted in her being forcibly displaced due to the high risks she faces. As long as the authorities do not adopt measures that can mitigate the structural causes that put Jani Silva at risk, she will remain in danger, compromising her defence of human rights.  
The organization also notes that the Ministry of the Interior has not succeeded in establishing collective protection plans for the Association for the Integral and Sustainable Development of the Amazonian Pearl (ADISPA), the Black Communities’ Process (PCN) or the ASEIMPOME Indigenous community, despite the fact that they were requested several years ago. The slowness of the Ministry of the Interior in establishing collective protection plans shows that the authorities have not been able to address the structural causes of violence against individuals and groups who risk their lives to defend human rights. 
“The state continues to address the risk faced by human rights defenders from a totally regulatory, material and individual perspective, and not from a practical, collective and transformative perspective. The protection of defenders should not be based solely on theory, but on the practical measures and the solutions put forward by the individuals and groups at risk themselves. If the authorities listened to their voices, there would be a significantly safer environment for defending human rights in Colombia,” said Fernanda Doz Costa. 
“All three branches of the state have human rights obligations, so it is imperative that Congress make the issue of defenders a permanent part of its agenda, including through the creation of a Commission for the Verification of Guarantees for Human Rights Defenders that can hold to account those officials in the Executive who do not fulfil their duty of protection”.

Since 2001, the organization has collected millions of messages written in support of people who are unjustly detained or persecuted, and Write for Rights has become the world’s biggest human rights event. 
This year, Amnesty International is calling for urgently needed action on 10 emblematic cases from around the world. They include an Indigenous rights defender wrongfully imprisoned for seeking to protect a sacred river in Guatemala, a feminist activist in Mexico who was shot while protesting violence against women, a citizen journalist imprisoned in China for reporting on Covid-19, and a teenage journalist from the occupied West Bank. 
“Every year, Write for Rights offers a lifeline for people around the world whose human rights are under attack, simply because they stood up for what they believe in. They are challenging inequality, discrimination, political repression and campaigning to protect all our rights, whether for environmental justice or against the death penalty. The Write for Rights campaign signifies everything Amnesty stands for – people from all over the world coming with one voice, in global solidarity, to challenge injustice,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“They need you to stand with them – whether that’s through a tweet, a signature or a letter to those in authority. Sometimes the smallest act can make the biggest difference. The last 20 years of Write for Rights shows words really do have power.” 
Every December, people around the world write millions of letters, emails, tweets, Facebook posts and postcards in support of those whose human rights are under attack. Write for Rights has helped transform the lives of more than 100 people since 2001, freeing them from torture, harassment, or unjust imprisonment. 
In Canada, thousands of people take part in this global event — sending nearly 80,000 letters, emails, social media posts and postcards in 2020 in support of those whose human rights are under attack. This year, from Victoria to Yellowknife to Cape Breton and beyond, Amnesty supporters are gathering for virtual or socially-distanced events in schools, libraries cafes and other spaces from coast-to-coast-to-coast. 
One of the cases featured in this year’s campaign is 15-year-old Janna Jihad, who grew up in the small Palestinian village of Nabi Saleh. In 2009, when Janna was three, her community began to hold weekly peaceful demonstrations against the occupation, which were met with violence by Israeli forces. When Janna was seven, she began using her mother’s phone to record the experiences of her community, and she has been recognized as one of the youngest ever human rights reporters. 
Janna has faced death threats and intimidation for her work, but is determined to keep speaking out. She said: 
“Being raised in an activist family – hearing the stories of my grandma or grandpa, listening to my uncles talk about getting arrested, learning about the resistance — inspired me to not stay silent. Staying silent in such situations is impossible. Why would I stay silent if I want to change the reality of what we’re living through and what we’re still going through?” 
Amnesty International is calling on supporters to write letters to demand protection for Janna. 
Amnesty International is also calling for justice for:     
Write for Rights began 20 years ago in Warsaw, Poland, when a group of friends decided to celebrate Human Rights Day (10 December) with a 24-hour letter-writing marathon. From 2,326 letters in 2001 to 4.5 million letters, tweets and petition signatures in 2021, Write for Rights has grown into the world’s biggest human rights campaign. 
It’s a campaign that really does work – as Jani Silva, an environmental activist from Colombia, can attest. Jani’s fearless opposition to environment contamination and human rights violations has led to harassment, intimidation and death threats. In 2020, more than 400,000 people took action through Write for Rights, calling for her protection. 
Jani said: 
“I am so very grateful for the letters. From the bottom of my heart, this campaign has kept me alive. It’s what has stopped them from killing me because they know that you are there.”

Ali al-Nimr was just 17-years-old when he was arrested in 2012 for participating in anti-government protests in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province. Two of his friends, Abdullah al-Zaher, aged 16, and Dawood al-Marhoon, aged 17, were also arrested separately. All three young men were sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) in 2014 after grossly unfair trials based on so-called ‘confessions’ extracted through torture.   
More than 21,000 Amnesty supporters from Canada took part in the global campaign to save their lives, calling on Saudi authorities to quash the death sentences and protect the rights to freedom of expression and association. Social media played a key role in a solidarity work and raising awareness around Ali al-Nimr’s case in a region where state-controlled media and anti-terror laws are exploited to suppress dissent.

In April 2020, Saudi Arabia issued a Royal Order announcing plans to end its use of the death penalty for people under the age of 18 in discretionary cases not involving the counter-terror law. Four months later, Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor ordered a review of the death sentences in the cases of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon. In February 2021, the SCC commuted their death sentences and re-sentenced them to 10-year prison terms inclusive of time served. 
Ali was finally released on October 27, 2021. Abdullah was released just this week, and it is hoped that Dawood will also be released soon at the end of his sentence.

BACKGROUND 
In 2011, Saudi authorities engaged in a vicious crackdown on the country’s Shi’a Muslim minority in response to protests demanding greater rights and reforms as well as the release of detainees held without charge. Some twenty people were killed by security forces and hundreds more arrested in the Eastern Province. While most were subsequently released, the rest were detained without charge or trial for a year or more, and then charged and brought to trial before the SCC. Dozens of those convicted and sentenced to death were later executed, sparking further protests. Among those executed in 2016 was Ali al-Nimr’s uncle, the prominent and outspoken Shi’a cleric, Sheikh Nimr Baqir al-Nimr, who had been sentenced to death by the SCC on October 15, 2014.

People must be at the centre of our global response to the climate crisis - not profit, not industry, not nationalism.","At the end of the summer, we wrote about the devastating heat dome over British Columbia, which claimed the lives of nearly 600 vulnerable seniors over a week-long period. Over the summer,1600 wildfires burned nearly 900,000 hectares of land across British Columbia. The Lytton Creek wildfire claimed the town of Lytton in a matter of minutes, killing two people.The White Rock Lake fire displaced thousands of people in the Central Okanagan and burned down 78 properties while thousands of people came perilously close to losing everything due to other terrifying wildfires. Our US neighbors on the west coast suffered a similar fate. 
We’ve since learned from researchers at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health that the smoke from the west coast’s wildfires exacerbated the effects of COVID-19 which made people sicker and increased their risk of dying. 
Yet this week, I write to you from a province now drowning in rainfall from a series of ‘atmospheric rivers’ that have caused massive flooding and mudslides, trapping hundreds of motorists in their cars along southern highways and forcing 8,000 people to evacuate the city of Merritt. Not three months ago, desert-dry Merritt was choking on wildfire smoke and sweltering under 42.2 degree skies.The City of Abbotsford also issued evacuation notices for affected areas within the municipality and eight First Nations communities have also been told to evacuate.   
The south coast’s Lower Mainland, which is home to 2.83 million people and includes 16 of the province’s most populated municipalities, is temporarily cut off from most southern routes out of the province due to floods and mudslides. Major cities and towns around the province are expecting lengthy construction delays on transportation routes where roads and bridges have completely or partially washed away.  
These two extreme scenarios make the disappointing outcome of COP26 all the more alarming.   
An Amnesty delegation, led by Secretary General Agnes Callamard, travelled to COP26 this November to add our voices to those of civil society from around the globe who tried to convince governments to stop enabling the fossil fuel industry and financially support low-income countries for loss and damages caused by the climate crisis. Amnesty staff met with Ministers and negotiators from numerous countries, including Canada, to appeal to them to take the difficult and necessary steps to keep global temperatures below a 1.5C  increase.  
Passionate, knowledgeable climate leaders from frontline communities in Canada were also in Glasgow to tell the world why the energy transition must respect human rights and be led by Indigenous peoples. Indigenous traditional knowledge and practices – such as fire-keeping – were repressed and criminalized under colonial laws, but revitalization of these practices could be one of the keys to preventing the massive wildfires that have burned their way across western Canada in recent years. The voices of Indigenous peoples from around the world need to lead our efforts towards climate justice.  
Global leaders, led by rich nations, failed to deliver an outcome that protects people or the planet. They made choices which ignore, denigrate and chip away at our human rights and sacrifice the people made most vulnerable by climate change. 
Agnes Callamard said that COP26 betrayed the very foundations upon which the United Nations was built – as a pledge to the people. Not countries. Not corporations. The People. We must rise to this challenge once again, she said, since our leaders have chosen to ignore us. Climate justice is about human rights and all human rights are at risk from the climate crisis. People must be at the centre of our global response to the climate crisis, she says, not profit, nationalism, markets, or industry. 
Read our Public Statement and letter to the Honorable Steven Guilbeault, Minister of Environment and Climate Change 
Guardian columnist and climate activist George Monbiot’s acerbic assessment of the final agreement was captured in a video in which he called it ‘a total fiasco’ and a “pathetic, limp rag of a document”. 
Activists point to the fact that civil society was outmatched at COP26 by the fossil fuel lobby, which included 503 delegates representing over 100 fossil fuel companies. If the fossil fuel lobby were a country, it would have had two dozen MORE delegates than the largest country delegation. While there were some very modest agreements reached during COP26 – such as pledges to phase out coal – the leaders of wealthy, heavily-emitting nations mostly chose to ignore the needs of the most marginalized communities around the world – made more vulnerable by colonization, extractivism, and the climate emergency – who have contributed the least to the crisis and sacrificed the greater good for the comfort of a relative few.  
Giving up is not an option. After we have taken a moment to process what happened at COP26 and reconnect with one another, we will dust ourselves off and redouble our efforts. There are a number of things you can do.

Additional Information:  
Steve Abua is a long-time community organizer of farmers, farm workers and Indigenous Peoples under the group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas. Prior to this role, Steve was a student activist and leader, graduating with honours from the University of the Philippines.   
Steve Abua was last seen on 6 November 2021 in Lubao town in Pampanga, on his way to a meeting in Bataan according to his wife Johanna. It is believed that he was forcibly taken by unidentified perpetrators, either at a transport terminal in Pampanga province or in Dinalupihan town in Bataan.    
On the same day of his abduction, Johanna received messages from Steve’s phone believed to be from his abductors, including photos of Steve. She was then shown a video of Steve wearing a white shirt and jeans, blindfolded and hands tied, and with his mouth stuffed with a cloth. The abductors, who did not identify themselves or the group they belong to, reportedly told Johanna in subsequent calls to convince Steve to admit to being a member of the New People’s Army, which Johanna said he is not, and asked her to meet with them and bring along their child, which she refused to do. The abductors also told Johanna not to tell anyone about Steve’s situations or they would kill him, while also saying that the government was only giving Steve a chance to “change his ways”. Both the police and the military in the region denied arresting, detaining or holding Steve captive.  
The phenomenon of red-tagging – or the linking of activists and human rights defenders to armed groups, by both the government and unknown individuals – has been happening for decades now but has intensified under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, following the breakdown of peace talks between the government and the Communist Party of the Philippines in 2017. Duterte’s subsequent Executive Order (EO) 70 provides for a “Whole-of-Nation approach in defeating the Local Communist Terrorist Groups” and led to the creation of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict. Observers point to this pivotal moment as the beginning of a renewed campaign of red-tagging, threats and harassment against human rights defenders, political activists, lawyers, trade unionists and other targeted groups perceived to be affiliated with the progressive left.  
Many groups, including Amnesty International and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, have called for the immediate end to this approach, expressing concern that the government’s dangerously broad counter-insurgency strategy has led to an increase in human rights violations against human rights defenders and political activists across the country.

On 25 July 2021, Members of Eswatini Parliament Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and Mthandeni Dube were detained amid a wave of pro-democracy protests and charged under the Suppression of Terrorism Act as well as other trumped-up charges. They have been in arbitrary detention at Mbabane police station ever since. Amnesty International calls on Eswatini authorities to release the two MPs and drop all charges against them.  
The two MPs’ arrests came amid a wave of protests sparked in June 2021 calling for political reform following the mysterious death of 25-year-old law student, Thabani Nkomonye, who allegedly died at the hands of the police in early May 2021. Since their arrest in July, peaceful protests and demonstrations have emerged nationwide calling for their release and an end to the use of excessive force against peaceful protestors. Following a High Court Judge’s refusal to grant MP Mduduzi Bacede Mabuza and MP Mthandeni Dube bail on 14 September, there has been an even further escalation resulting in arbitrary arrests of peaceful protestors, loss of life, allegations of torture and other ill treatment.  
Not only are certain provisions in the Suppression of Terrorism Act of 2008 threatening to human rights and inherently repressive – they also breach Eswatini’s obligations under international and regional human rights law and the Constitution of Eswatini. This is directly in violation of the rights of freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. Activism, be it political or otherwise, should be possible in Eswatini without fear of reprisal. Despite political differences, respect for human rights law should be adhered to.

Additional Information   
The two MPs stand accused of contravening: section 5(1) of the 2008 Suppression of Terrorism Act; section 4(b) of the Sedition and Subversive Activities Act of 1938; trumped-up murder charges; and regulation 4 of the Disaster management regulations under the Disaster Management Act 01/2006.   
Since their arrest in July, peaceful protests and demonstrations by a range of stakeholders have emerged nationwide calling for their unconditional release. On 1 October, the largest demonstration took place where over 10,000 EmaSwati marched to the US Embassy to deliver a petition appealing to the US for support in advocating for the MPs’ release and questioning the independence of the judiciary in affording the MPs a fair trial. According to witness reports, protestors were violently dispersed by the authorities, with security agents using live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas. The army was also deployed with soldiers seen setting up roadblocks to stop people from joining the protests. A protestor was left in critical condition in hospital after being shot in the head by Eswatini security forces.   
Throughout October 2021, pro-democracy protests and anti-police violence marches continued across the country. Nhlanhla Kunene, was allegedly killed by security forces in Siteki on 8 October. This again sparked another wave of nationwide protests calling for the end to police brutality, and the release of peaceful protesters, including the two MPs’.  
More than 1000 people have been arrested since the protests broke out in June, including children in primary and secondary school, who have since joined the movement calling for political reforms. In some instances, security forces have also assaulted school children who participated in the protests. As protests continue to intensify, the authorities have deployed security forces to crush dissent, closed schools indefinitely and instructed mobile telephone network companies to shut down the internet and social media platforms.  
Political activism has been suppressed for years in the Kingdom of Eswatini, where King Mswati III rules as Africa’s last absolute monarch. Eswatini has a history of journalists, human rights defenders and political activists being jailed under repressive laws, including the 1938 Sedition and Subversive Activities Act (SSA Act) and the 2008 Suppression of Terrorism Act (STA), simply for speaking out against the repression of dissent.

Ravo Ramasomanana, a former employee of the Ministry of Public Health, is facing imprisonment of up to 5 years for threatening public order and security and inciting political unrest and hate after posting a video on social media in April 2021 implicating the Ministry of Public Health in corruption allegations. He has disclosed information of public interest. Such disclosures are protected under the rights to information and freedom of expression. The authorities must immediately drop all charges against Ravo Ramasomanana and ensure he is able to freely exercise his right to freedom of expression without any reprisals.  
On 15 April 2021, Ravo Ramasomanana posted what became a widely circulated video on social media revealing information pertaining to alleged rigged tenders, fictitious jobs, contracts by mutual agreement not authorized by law, forgery, use of forgeries during the awarding of procurement contracts, and the embezzlement of MGA44 billion (about USD 11.7 million) within the Ministry of Public Health. He was charged with threatening public order and security and inciting political unrest and hate under articles 89, 90 and 91 of Law 84-001 from 12 June 1984. The use of these articles is abusive and should not be used as a repressive tool to silence critical voices. The Criminal Court of Antananarivo initially scheduled the trial for 27 September. However, the Public Prosecutor did not file the charges and the Court adjourned it to 15 November.

In the video he uploaded onto social media on 15 April 2021, Ravo Ramasomanana also spoke about contracting Covid-19 and criticised the lack of equipment and inadequate treatment. The video was widely shared on Facebook, TV, as well as on messaging apps in Madagascar.  
On 3 May 2021, Ravo Ramasomanana was summoned to appear in court on 5 May in connection with the social media post. He was unable to appear as he was still in quarantine after contracting Covid-19. On 12 May 2021, following his summons, he filed a complaint against the Ministry of Public Health with the Antananarivo anti-corruption prosecutor’s office concerning his claims regarding “forgery and use of forgeries, abuse of office, active and passive corruption, breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and complicity”. To date there has been no updates on the complaint.  
On 15 June 2021 Ravo Ramasomanana honoured the summons and appeared in court where he was informed about another file that had just arrived which was a complaint from the Gendarmerie Nationale, claiming that the head of the cybercrime department received abusive messages on his phone after the summons for Ravo Ramasomanana was published on Facebook.  
Ravo Ramasomanana is not the first whistleblower in Madagascar to be punished with prosecution for speaking out. In June 2020, Dr. Berija was arrested and sentenced in September 2021 to 44 months in prison after he posted a video on Facebook criticising President Andry Rajoelina. Several members of Dr. Berija’s family including his father, mother, sister, wife and baby who was a few months old were all charged with complicity and imprisoned for days. Ravo Ramasomanana’s family members are at risk of the same fate if he is convicted.

“The Taliban are searching for me,” Mahmud, a human rights defender, told Amnesty International researchers following the Taliban takeover of Kabul on August 15. “They found another colleague who was beaten by them. All my staff members are underground.” 
Aadila is a journalist who was based in Kabul. She told Amnesty that at first she decided to stay in Afghanistan and continue her work—until the Taliban came to her home one night asking for her. She left the country shortly afterwards. 
In the weeks since taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have already committed human rights violations—reprisal attacks, restrictions on women, and crackdowns on protests and the media. 
Human rights defenders are under attack. Their offices and homes have been raided. Colleagues have been beaten. They are forced into permanent hiding. They live under the constant threat of arrest, torture, or worse. 
With your support, Amnesty International was able to evacuate several families who had members working with Amnesty. 
The evacuation efforts were complex and involved the work of dozens of people across an international network. Hopes were repeatedly raised and dashed. Seats were secured on planes out of Kabul, but it was then impossible for the families to get into the airport because of the huge crowds and the risk of bomb attacks. 
The families next took the long, dangerous journey over land to Pakistan. Finally, they were able to fly out to Europe, arriving tired, relieved, and very grateful for the support and warm welcome. 
“In just a matter of a day, my school building turned into a Taliban military base, my hopes shattered, my future uncertain, and the lives of my family members in great danger,” said 14-year-old Khalid (name changed). “I’m grateful for the support of Amnesty. I’m now back to school in Europe. I’d like to become a pilot and fly more people to safety.”

Cuban authorities have historically criminalized dissent, making protesters at risk of arbitrary detention and other human rights violations.  
Hundreds of people remain detained for peacefully protesting in Cuba, including during the mass demonstrations on 11 July. The cases of prisoners of conscience Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara, José Daniel Ferrer García, Esteban Rodríguez, and Maykel Castillo Pérez represent only a tiny fraction of the total number of people who are detained solely because of their political, religious or other beliefs without having used or advocated violence. I call on all to be immediately and unconditionally released.  
Activists, independent journalists, and human rights defenders are also frequently subjected to physical surveillance and face arrest by police and state security officials if they leave their houses, which as Amnesty International has previously documented can amount to arbitrary detention.

Additional Information  
Civil society groups in Cuba have called for peaceful protests on 15 November, among other things, to demand the release of hundreds of people that were detained in the context of protests on 11 July.   
Hundreds of people in different cities across the country presented signed petitions requesting local authorities’ permission to convene peaceful, organized protests.   
Cuba’s government-run newspaper, the Granma, described the planned marches as “illicit” and designed to “destabilize” the country.  
Authorities have created a web of control over freedom of expression and assembly for decades in Cuba, which criminalizes peaceful protest and imprisons and ill-treats Cubans from all walks of life solely for expressing their opinions.  
On July 11, hundreds of people who participated in a largely peaceful protest that took place in various cities in Cuba were detained and imprisoned by government authorities. The authorities responded by detaining and criminalizing to different degrees nearly all those found to be protesting.   
Following the protests, Amnesty International called on six prisoners of conscience to be immediately and unconditionally released. The organization also documented arbitrary detentions, violations of due process and incommunicado detention, as well as unlawful surveillance, ill-treatment, and internet interruptions carried out by the authorities, scaling up a machinery of control used for decades to target alternative thinkers, but amped up to a scale not seen in almost 20 years.  
As of 10 November, hundreds of people remain in prison for peacefully expressing their views on the current human rights and economic situation in the country, according to Cubalex.

Israel has a deplorable record of unlawfully killing and injuring thousands of Palestinians, displacing tens of thousands and destroying homes, businesses, and infrastructure. These violations include war crimes and crimes against humanity that go unpunished. The National Organizers decided to take action by starting a letter-writing campaign urging the Canadian federal government to publicly denounce Israel’s human rights violations against Palestine. Some of our asks were to:  
We were looking to get thousands of signed letters sent to us so that we can print them and hand-deliver them to Parliament. In a short time our team was able to obtain over 5000 signatures from people around Canada after countless hours of protesting, promoting, emailing, and inviting people to sign the letter. Early October, we organized a photo op on Parliament Hill, with paper doves representing the fight for Palestinian liberation. All letters have now been delivered to the Prime Minister’s office. 
 “Having created over 50 origami paper doves for this art installation and political demonstration, I hope to see more youth use the intersection of art and activism to promote peace, justice, and security for Palestinians.”  
We are very grateful for Amnesty International Canada’s ongoing help and support throughout the initiative. This is only the beginning for us; we are committed to keep fighting until Palestinians have their basic human rights respected.

Sarah Mardini, a 25-year-old Syrian refugee, and Seán Binder, a 27-year-old German national, face a series of unfair and baseless charges dating from the time they spent volunteering spotting and helping boats in distress in Lesvos. 
Sarah originally arrived in Lesvos as a refugee in 2015. When the engine of the boat she was on failed, Sarah and her sister saved 18 fellow passengers by dragging the sinking boat to safety. Later, she returned to Greece and went on to volunteer at a Greek search and rescue organization, where she met Seán, a trained diver. Sarah and Seán were arrested in 2018 on numerous charges including smuggling, espionage, unlawful use of radio frequencies, and fraud. They spent more than 100 days in prison before being released on bail in December 2018. 
“Sarah and Seán did lifesaving humanitarian work, spotting boats in distress off Greek shores and providing those onboard with blankets, water and a warm welcome. The charges they face are farcical and should never have come to trial,” said Nils Muižnieks, Director of Amnesty International’s European Regional Office. 
“This emblematic case demonstrates how far the Greek authorities will go to deter people from helping refugees and migrants. Stopping rescue operations doesn’t stop people from making dangerous journeys, it simply makes those journeys more perilous.” 
On 18 November, Sarah and Seán will go on trial for misdemeanour charges that can carry a sentence of up to 8 years. They also face felony charges including ‘people smuggling’, ‘fraud’, ‘being part of a criminal organization’ and ‘money laundering’ which, if they come to trial, could lead to up to 25 years imprisonment. 
According to a legal opinion from human rights legal firm Leigh Day, there have been several serious breaches of international human rights law in Seán’s case to date. Seán approached Leigh Day to commission a legal opinion on the legality in international law of his arrest, pre-trial detention and proposed trial for alleged offences committed whilst volunteering on search and rescue missions for ERCI. 
Tessa Gregory, partner at law firm Leigh Day, said: “On the basis of the evidence we have seen, we believe that there have been serious breaches of Seán’s human rights by the Greek authorities in relation to his detention, the charges brought against him and the delays in hearing his case in court. Seán’s case is important as it shows what appears to be a disturbing trend towards criminalizing human rights defenders who are working for recognized NGOs seeking to help refugees. We urge the Greek authorities to review Seán’s case immediately to prevent any further potential breaches of his human rights. Urgent reconsideration needs to be given to whether his criminal trial should go ahead at all.” 
“The law obliges us to help people in distress at sea. What we did was not heroic, it was normal, and anyone else would do the same in our place. The real victims of European migration policies are the refugees and migrants forced to risk their lives to reach ‘Fortress Europe’,” said Seán Binder. 
Hundreds of people like Sarah and Seán have been criminalized across Europe for doing humanitarian work helping refugees and migrants. In a 2020 report Amnesty International detailed the numerous ways in which European governments have deployed restrictive, sanctioning and punitive measures against people who defend refugees and migrants’ rights. They do so by misusing laws and policies, including the legally ambiguous and inconsistent rules in the so-called EU Facilitators’ Package. Dozens of prosecutions have been launched against individuals and NGOs, including Médecins Sans Frontieres, in Italy, Greece, France and Switzerland. 
At the time of writing, the Greek authorities have refused to lift Sarah Mardini’s travel ban which means that Sarah will not be able to attend her own trial.  
Amnesty International is deeply concerned that the injustice of the trumped-up charges is being further compounded by a flagrant violation of internationally recognized fair trial standards, in particular the right to not be tried in absentia. 
“Seán and Sarah’s lives are on hold, their futures at risk simply because they showed solidarity and compassion to people in need. Sarah and Seán must not pay the price for Greece’s cruelty at Europe’s borders,’’ said Nils Muižnieks.

Most detainees are being held without charge or access to a lawyer. 
The arrests have intensified since the government declared a state of emergency 10 days ago as fighters from the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) took control of strategic towns in Amhara region some 400 km from Addis Ababa. Arrests are conducted through house-to-house searches by security forces with support from vigilante groups who check the IDs of people on the street. Detainees, including civil servants, Orthodox priests and a lawyer are being held in youth centres and other informal detention centres across Addis Ababa because police stations are overflowing. 
“These mass arrests have instilled such a climate of fear that Tigrayans that Amnesty International has spoken to are scared they could be rounded up any time. Those currently locked up have not been charged or brought before a court and many have been targeted purely on the basis of their ethnicity,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The authorities must ensure that families are informed of the whereabouts and status of all detainees and that anyone deprived of their liberty has access to lawyers and family members without delay.” 
The government declared a state of emergency on 2 November, which was adopted by parliament on 4 November. The state of emergency allows the authorities to arrest and detain anyone without a warrant if there is “reasonable suspicion” of cooperation with “terrorist groups”, and to detain them without judicial review for as long as the proclamation is in place, currently for six months. Some of the measures violate international human rights law, which prohibits arbitrary detention and discrimination in all circumstances. 
Amnesty International has interviewed eight people – families, friends and lawyers of detainees – who have reported seeing hundreds of Tigrayans detained in six different locations. While it is currently impossible to establish the exact number of detainees, they number hundreds and potentially thousands. 
A few family members and friends have had limited and irregular access to detainees. However, many have been denied access to a lawyer. Moreover, interviewees told Amnesty International that the police have transferred some of the detainees to places on the outskirts of Addis Ababa.  
Two Tigrayan lawyers interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were expecting a knock at the door at any time by security forces, and had their bags packed with a spare set of clothes. 
The United Nations has announced that its staff members are among those arrested in Addis Ababa in addition to 72 UN truck drivers arrested in Semera, Afar.   
Since the conflict started a year ago between the TPLF and federal government forces, thousands of people have been killed and more than 2 million forced from their homes. Parties to the conflict have been responsible for war crimes and horrific human rights abuses including widespread rape and sexual violence and massacres of unarmed civilians. 
“The Ethiopian government must immediately end ethnically motivated arbitrary arrests and amend the state of emergency proclamation to bring it in line with international law,” said Deprose Muchena.

0,Covid-19: New research reveals Pfizer is making misleading claims about fair distribution of vaccines,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/covid-19-new-research-reveals-pfizer-is-making-misleading-claims-about-fair-distribution-of-vaccines/,"Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is making misleading statements about its commitment to vaccine fairness, as it continues to supply the majority of its life saving Covid-19 doses to wealthy nations, said Amnesty International today. In a new briefing, the organization found that Pfizer, which recently...","Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer is making misleading statements about its commitment to vaccine fairness, as it continues to supply the majority of its life saving Covid-19 doses to wealthy nations, said Amnesty International today. 
In a new briefing, the organization found that Pfizer, which recently said it expects to earn 36 billion dollars in vaccine sales this year alone, has distorted reality to benefit its corporate image. The company is claiming to prioritize fair distribution of its vaccine and purporting to commit to sharing its scientific tools and insights – when the truth is very different. 
“We’re still in the middle of an unprecedented global health and human rights crisis and it is essential that all countries of the world have access to vaccines as soon as possible. Pfizer says it is committed to supplying doses to low and middle-income countries, but the numbers just don’t bear this out. The fact is that this company is still putting profits first,” said Patrick Wilcken, Amnesty International’s Head of Business and Human Rights. 
Pfizer’s executives have repeatedly claimed that by the end of the year the US-based multinational will have supplied at least one billion doses to “low and middle-income nations”. 
But the language is misleading. The World Bank classifies economies for analytical purposes into four income groups: low, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high income. However, in these statements, Pfizer has amalgamated low, lower-middle, and upper-middle countries – over 84% of the global population – into one group and referred to them as “low and middle-income”. Within this very broad category, the bulk of Pfizer’s doses have in fact been going to “upper-middle” income countries such as Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand.  
Pfizer said it had shipped a total of two billion doses by the end of September. In a letter to Amnesty International in November, the company admitted that of these only 154 million doses – less than 8 percent of its total – had reached 42 low- and lower-middle-income countries. Pfizer said it had distributed less than 10 percent of these (i.e. 15.4 million) to low- income countries. 
“As much as these companies might want to massage the facts, the numbers are crystal clear – they are still supplying the majority of their doses to richer parts of the world,” said Patrick Wilcken. 
Pfizer’s claims to have “committed to sharing our scientific tools and insights”, starkly contrasts with the fact that the company has failed to join the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (CTAP), which was established to pool data and knowledge, and is not participating in the WHO’s mRNA vaccine Technology Transfer hub in South Africa, greatly delaying the development of production sites in Africa. 
According to the WHO, only 4.4% of the continent’s population have been fully vaccinated and its population is in grave need of access to life-saving vaccines. Pfizer has also actively lobbied against the World Trade Organization’s TRIPS Waiver which would temporarily lift intellectual property rights, allowing for expansion of the world’s manufacturing capacity of Covid-19 vaccines. 
Furthermore, despite claims that Pfizer’s development and manufacturing costs relating to the Covid-19 vaccine are entirely self-funded, the company has benefited from pre-orders from some of the world’s richest countries, as well as the large government support received by its German partner BioNTech. 
Pfizer is not alone in these failures. The other European and US-based Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers, BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have all similarly blocked technology sharing and lobbied against the proposed TRIPS waiver. 
According to data provided by Airfinity, a science and analytics company, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson also have an especially poor record on fair vaccine distribution. Approximately 96% of Moderna’s vaccines are still going to upper-middle and high-income countries. 
Over the last 50 days, only 100,000 out of 52 million doses delivered went to low-income countries. Johnson & Johnson’s breakdown is also inadequate. According to Airfinity, Johnson & Johnson, has delivered just 11% of its vaccines to low-income countries, and a further 5% to lower-middle income countries, with the remaining 84% going to upper-middle and high-income countries. 
“With 50 days left until the end of the year, it’s not too late for these pharma giants to redeem themselves, do the right thing and fulfil their human rights responsibilities. To achieve this, they need to ramp up fair distribution and ensure half the doses they produce before the end of 2021 goes to these countries,” Patrick Wilcken said. 
“By taking action now, they could help to vaccinate an extra 1.2 billion people in low and lower-middle income countries by the end of the year – and save at least 2 million* lives.” 
Amnesty International is supporting the World Health Organization’s target of vaccinating 40% of those in low and lower-middle-income countries by the end of 2021 with its 100 Day Countdown campaign. The 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion vaccines now! campaign is calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to take urgent action to meet that lifesaving target. 
According to Amnesty International this can be achieved if pharmaceutical companies deliver 50% of vaccines they produce between 21 September 2021 and 31 December 2021 to low and lower-middle income countries; states redistribute the hundreds of millions of surplus vaccines currently in their stocks; and if states and pharmaceutical companies urgently increase global supply of Covid-19 vaccines by sharing knowledge and technology. 
Amnesty will be holding demonstrations outside the offices of pharmaceutical companies around the world, including Pfizer, during November, calling on the company to stop blocking access to vaccines, start sharing and save lives.    
Amnesty International’s 100 Day Countdown calls on states and pharmaceutical companies to share vaccines with low and lower-middle income countries – so that millions more people can be protected from Covid-19 in 2021. Act now!

Fourteen of the 16 women Amnesty International interviewed said they were gang raped.The TPLF took control of Nifas Mewcha, in Amhara’s Gaint District, for nine days between 12 and 21 August 2021, as part of an ongoing offensive into parts of the Amhara and Afar regions. Regional government officials told Amnesty International that more than 70 women reported to authorities that they were raped in Nifas Mewcha during this period.“The testimonies we heard from survivors describe despicable acts by TPLF fighters that amount to war crimes, and potentially crimes against humanity. They defy morality or any iota of humanity,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General.“TPLF fighters must immediately stop all human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including sexual and gender-based violence. The leadership must make clear that such abuses will not be tolerated and remove suspected perpetrators from their ranks.”Gang rape and physical assaultsAmnesty International used secure video call applications to individually interview 16 survivors of sexual and gender-based violence in Nifas Mewcha.The organization also interviewed the head of Nifas Mewcha hospital, as well as local and regional government officials with knowledge of the assault and its aftermath.According to a local government desk officer for Women, Children and Youth Affairs, 71 women reported that they were raped by TPLF fighters during the period in question; the Federal Ministry of Justice puts the number at 73.Survivors told Amnesty International that the attacks began as soon as the TPLF took control of the town on 12 August 2021. The women all identified the perpetrators as TPLF fighters based on their accents and the ethnic slurs they used against victims, as well as their overt announcements that they were TPLF.Bemnet, a 45-year-old Nifas Mewcha resident, told Amnesty International that four TPLF fighters came to her house on the evening of 14 August and demanded she make them coffee, before three of them gang raped her. She said:“I suspected their intentions, and I sent away my daughters to stay away from the house. [The soldiers] told me to bring them home. I told them they won’t come. Then they started to insult me. They were saying ‘Amhara is donkey’, ‘Amhara is useless’. One of them told the others to stop insulting me. He said, ‘she is our mother; we don’t have to harm her’. They forced him to leave the house and three of them stayed back at my home. Then they raped me in turns.”Gebeyanesh, a 30-year-old food seller in the town, told Amnesty International: “It is not easy to tell you what they did to me. They raped me. Three of them raped me while my children were crying. My elder son is 10 and the other is nine years, they were crying when [the TPLF fighters] raped me. [The fighters] did whatever they wanted and left. They also assaulted me physically and took shiro and berbere [local food items]. They slapped me [and] kicked me. They were cocking their guns as if they are going to shoot me.”Hamelmal, 28, sells enjera in the town. She told Amnesty International that four TPLF fighters raped her during the night of 13 August at her home, while her daughter watched: “I have children, 10- and two-year-old girls. I was scared they might kill my daughter. I said, ‘don’t kill my children, do whatever you want to me.’ The youngest was asleep, but the older [one] was awake and saw what happened. I don’t have the strength to tell you what she saw.”Dehumanizing verbal assaultsTPLF fighters also subjected the women to degrading ethnic slurs, such as ‘donkey Amhara’, and ‘greedy Amhara’. In some cases, the TPLF forces told women they were raping them in revenge for the rape of Tigrayan women by Federal government forces. Amnesty International previously documented widespread rape and sexual violence by government-allied troops and militias in Tigray.Hamelmal, who said she was raped by four TPLF fighters, told Amnesty International:“The one who raped me first is their superior. He was saying ‘Amhara is a donkey, Amhara has massacred our people (Tigrayans), the Federal Defense forces have raped my wife, now we can rape you as we want’.”Meskerem, age 30, who told Amnesty International that three TPLF fighters raped her and beat her with the butts of their guns, said:“They were insulting me, calling me ‘donkey Amhara, you are strong, you can carry much more than this’. I was unconscious for more than an hour.”Stealing from rape victimsAmnesty International heard that, after raping the women, TPLF fighters then looted their homes. Survivors, many of whom live hand-to-mouth by working in low-paid and informal jobs, running small businesses or engaging in sex work, described fighters stealing food, jewelry, cash and mobile phones.Meskerem, who sells kollo [a local cereal-based food], told Amnesty International that: “Four of the soldiers came to my restaurant and they ate and drank whatever was in the house. Then two of them raped me. They also took my ring and necklace.” Frehiwot said she was gang raped several times by TPLF fighters between 12 and 20 August, and that one fighter stole her phone and cash. Tigist said the TPLF fighters who raped her on 12 August also destroyed her shop items and took her jewelry:“They took my property. After they drank the beer, they broke the beer bottles in four caskets. They also broke the two caskets of soft drink and took my gold necklace. They also took my beddings. Now I am not able to [run] my business as before since I lost all I had. I am only selling coffee… I am also a sex worker. But it has become difficult for me to trust anyone after what they did to me.”Health impactFifteen of the 16 rape survivors Amnesty International interviewed described suffering physical and mental health problems as a result of the attacks. They described a variety of symptoms including back pain, bloody urine, difficulty walking, anxiety and depression.While two of the women have sought basic private medical treatment since the rape, damage and looting to the town’s hospital and health station by the TPLF attack has meant that none of the survivors interviewed has been able to access comprehensive post-rape care, including emergency contraception, post emergency prophylaxis for HIV and sexually transmitted infections, assessment and treatment of injuries, or focused therapy for mental health care. An NGO that normally provides such services told Amnesty International that it cannot access the area due to security concerns prompted by the government’s hostile public statements about international humanitarian organizations.Bemnet, who has a pre-existing medical condition as well as back pain and other symptoms as a result of the rape, said: “I am just relying on God to save me.”Selamawit, a 20-year-old domestic worker, told Amnesty International that three TPLF fighters raped her on 12 August. She said she is now pregnant due to the rape, but wasn’t able to access any medical services.Many of the survivors told Amnesty International that they have developed anxiety and depression since the rape.Amhara regional government officials told Amnesty International that Nifas Mewcha residents, including 54 rape survivors, had received livelihood support since the attack. They also said they are preparing to restock medical equipment and other supplies to looted hospitals and facilities in the region, and to provide counselling and psychosocial services for the survivors.“The Ethiopian government must speed up efforts to fully support the survivors of sexual violence and the conflict’s other victims. As an urgent first step, it must facilitate immediate and unhindered humanitarian access to all areas of northern Ethiopia impacted by the conflict,” said Agnès Callamard.“The government must also ensure allegations of all sexual violence are promptly, effectively, independently and impartially investigated. They must bring those suspected of criminal responsibility to justice in open, accessible civilian courts in full compliance with international standards for fair trial without recourse to the death penalty and reparations for the survivors.”NOTE TO EDITORS: All the interviewees’ names have been changed to pseudonyms due to ongoing security concerns.

Security...","Some Officials Freed, but New Detentions and Others Still Held 
(Nairobi, November 9, 2021) – Sudanese security authorities should immediately release people arbitrarily detained since the military takeover on October 25, 2021, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today. Security authorities should also cease further arbitrary arrests and stop using unnecessary, including lethal, force in response to peaceful protests. 
From the early hours of October 25, security agents in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum, detained at least 30 civilian political leaders, including 6 cabinet members. On the same day the army also detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, and two days later placed him under house arrest. Permission from the military is required for anyone to meet with him while he is under house arrest. By midday, Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the chairperson of the Sovereign Council – a collective presidency body of civilian and military leaders – announced to the media that he was installing a nationwide state of emergency and dissolving the cabinet and Sovereign Council. 
“Over the last two weeks the military has resorted to its well-trodden and brutal tactics, undermining small but important progress on rights and freedoms that Sudanese from all walks of life have fought for,” said Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The military should immediately free all those arbitrarily detained over the last two weeks and end all illegal detentions, including enforced disappearances, by the military.” 
In addition to arbitrary arrests, Sudanese security used heavy-handed measures to repress peaceful protests against the military takeover. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented unwarranted use of lethal force by security authorities in their efforts to counter the many protests that erupted in Khartoum. At least 14 people have been killed by live ammunition in Khartoum since October 25 according to the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors. 
The African Centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS), a Sudanese human rights group, reported that security authorities detained more than 30 people including ministers, advisers to the prime minister, and journalists, between October 25 and 27. Interviews with family members and other research by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch confirm that at least eight of the 30 detainees whose cases feature in the ACJPS statement are being held in undisclosed locations, without access to family or legal counsel in circumstances that may amount to enforced disappearances. Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army leader, said on October 26 that some detainees would face criminal charges, but none have been announced. 
Since October 25, internet and telecommunications have been repeatedly disrupted, limiting people’s access to timely and accurate information, infringing on people’s ability to express political views, and restricting reporting on rights issues, including about detentions, especially outside Khartoum.  
Among those arbitrarily arrested is Cabinet Affairs Minister Khalid Omar Youssef, who was detained by a group of security agents in front of his family in a dawn raid on his house on October 25, family members said. 
A close relative who spoke to other family members who were present during the raid said: “A group of plain-clothed and armed agents arrived at his house at 3:30 a.m. and began firing shots in the air before they violently broke in, casting terror in the heart of his young daughters… Khalid was roughed up and dragged out of the house, barefoot and in his sleeping clothes. They did not even allow him to change or take any clothes.” 
Youssef’s relative said they have no information about his whereabouts and are concerned that the authorities will bring trumped-up charges against him. 
Mohamed al-Faki Sulieman, a civilian member of, and spokesperson for, the Sovereign Council, was one of the first officials detained. Al-Faki was also the alternate head of the Committee for Dismantling the Former Regime, a government body to tackle embezzlement and corruption by the ousted government, which was dismantled immediately after the military’s takeover. In the weeks before, al-Faki had publicly criticized the military, blaming them for delaying key reforms and instigating political tensions. A family member said that al-Faki was alone at his official residence and in isolation on October 25, having tested positive for Covid-19 two days earlier. “When we heard the news that officials were being detained, his wife who wasn’t at the residence at that time tried to call but couldn’t get hold of him,” the family member said. “We heard later from some witnesses that armed elements from Sudanese Armed Forces had arrested him. We don’t know where he is or if he took medication he needs as he suffers from chronic medical conditions including heart problems. His family is very concerned because those military leaders have a problematic record when it comes to respecting rights. We want to know where he is and to check on his wellbeing.”    The family of Yasir Arman, a political adviser to the prime minister, released a public statement saying that he had been violently arrested alongside his brother on October 25. The statement said that 18 uniformed soldiers broke into his house at dawn, smashed security cameras, and ransacked the house, leaving his bedroom “turned upside down.”    
Wagdi Salih, a lawyer and another prominent figure in the Committee for Dismantling the Former Regime was also arrested on October 25. A family member authorized to speak on behalf of his family said that about 20 armed men in civilian clothes forced their way into Salih’s house around 4 a.m. and forcefully grabbed him from his bedroom while they held the guards in the house at gunpoint and handcuffed his son. 
The family heard through social media that Salih and others were taken to the police federal investigations unit in Bahri, Khartoum North, and went to inquire about him. However, the police said he was not in their custody, and the office of the attorney general could not offer any information on Salih’s whereabouts either. 
Under international law, when anyone is detained by state forces and their detention is either not acknowledged or the person’s whereabouts is concealed, placing them outside the protection of the law, this is an enforced disappearance. Enforced disappearances are forbidden in all circumstances. 
The arrests by military forces have continued. On October 26 at around 7 p.m., security agents in civilian clothes arrested Ismail al-Taj, a prominent lawyer and member of the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), at his office. “We’ve had no contact with him whatsoever since the arrest,” his son said. “We want him released. What right do they have to arrest him? On what charges?” 
On November 4, the military released four ministers after they spent 10 days in arbitrary detention, including the ministers of telecommunications and of information. However, at about 7 p.m. that day, the military reportedly detained the political secretary of the Sudanese Congress Party, Shareef Osman; his deputy, Hamzah Farouq; and the rapporteur of the Committee for Dismantling the Former Regime, Taha Osman, after they left a meeting at the offices of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission, which later condemned the arrests.“We don’t know who took them,” said a close family member of Osman’s. “There are no witnesses to this arrest. “We need to know where they are so we can deliver the medicines that he (Osman) needs to treat the many medical conditions that he has.”       
Sudan’s armed forces, including the Rapid Support Forces, have no legal authority to detain civilians or carry out law enforcement functions, making detentions of civilians arbitrary and unlawful. On January 21, the former attorney general issued an instruction limiting the powers of arrest and detention of civilians to the police and prosecutors, making clear that any detention by other forces is considered unlawful. 
Despite regional and international calls on the military to halt the crackdown, abuses continue. On November 7, security forces, including police and the military, violently dispersed a sit-in called by the teachers’ association in northern Khartoum. According to one lawyer following the cases, about 100 teachers and other protesters were taken to the military central command’s garrison in Khartoum. Some were released the next day, but others remain in detention without access to a lawyer and have yet to be officially charged with any offense. 
“The Sudanese people have the rights to peaceful protest, to liberty and security, fair trial, and many more that the military cannot undermine” said Sarah Jackson, deputy regional director for East Africa, the Horn of Africa, and the Great Lakes at Amnesty International. “Violations of rights by the military should be met with a joint, coordinated, and strong regional and international response.”

Ten Egyptian men of the Nubian ethnicity are due to appear for their first hearing before the Specialized Criminal Court in Riyadh on 10 November 2021. Saudi Arabian authorities have detained them without charge since 14 July 2020 in relation to a peaceful community event they had been planning. At least two of the men are older people and suffer health ailments. Amnesty International urges Saudi Arabian authorities to release all the men immediately.  
They were arrested in relation to a cultural event they had planned on 25 October 2019 to mark the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. According to one of the detainees’ relatives, the men were first arrested on the morning of the said event. Saudi security officials interrogated them about the event, namely accusing them of failing to include the photo of Egyptian President General Abdelfattah al-Sisi in the event’s announcement poster, alongside other Egyptian army generals. The detained men explained that the event was not political but rather focused on celebrating Nubian soldiers who had taken part in that war. On 25 December 2019, after two months in detention without charge, the men were released on travel ban pending the case’s resumption.   
On 14 July 2020, all 10 men were re-arrested and detained in al-Ha’ir prison in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. In April 2021, they were transferred to Assir prison in Abha city, where they have been denied access to lawyers of their choosing, appointed instead lawyers by the authorities, and have continued to be held without charge. The Egyptian consulate in Riyadh has failed to date to provide any consular assistance or facilitate the consular rights of those detained, despite the families’ recurrent pleas for action. Instead, it issued a statement on 29 October 2020 supporting their detention.  
A relative of one of the men told Amnesty International: “Some of the detainees are senior and suffer ailments like diabetes, gangrene and cardiovascular problems. They are rarely allowed to contact their families, and they fear speaking on the phone because of surveillance.”

Additional Information:  
The Nubians are a minority ethnic group in Egypt and Sudan and have been historically marginalized and discriminated against on the basis of their cultural, ethnic, and linguistic identity. In 1964, the Egyptian government forcibly displaced thousands of Nubians from their homes in southern Egypt, to build the Aswan High Dam which caused the flooding of several Nubian villages and further displacement. The displaced Nubian population resettled in other areas, and many migrated to the Arab Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, seeking work. To preserve their culture and heritage, the Nubian diaspora established Nubian cultural and social associations. For decades, Nubian associations have operated normally in Saudi Arabia, focusing strictly on cultural and social activities away from politics.  
Since the early 2000s, Nubian activists’ demands for the return to their ancestral land and compensation accelerated. Article 236 of the 2014 Egyptian Constitution stipulated for the first time the implementation of a comprehensive development plan for marginalized areas including Nubia, with participation of local communities, with the view of preserving their heritage. To that end, a coalition of 40 Nubian associations was formed in Riyadh in early 2020 to call on Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to abide by Article 236 and allow the Nubians’ return to their homeland. After the establishment of the coalition, Saudi Arabian authorities arrested and detained the 10 Nubian men on the morning of the planned annual event in remembrance of Nubian soldiers who fought in the 6 October 1973 war. The event has taken place in previous years in Saudi Arabia without any reprisals against the community.  
The ten detained Egyptian Nubian men are: Adel Ibrahim Faqir (Head of the Nubian community in Riyadh, 65 years old), Dr. Farjallah Ahmed Youssef (Former Head of the Nubian community in Riyadh), Jamal Abdullah Masri (President of Dhamit Nubian Village Association in Riyadh), Mohamed Fathallah Gomaa (37 years old), Sayyed Hashem Shater, Ali Gomaa Ali Bahr (37 years old), Saleh Gomaa Ahmed, Abdulsalam Gomaa Ali Bahr (43 years old), Abdullah Gomaa Ali and Wael Ahmed Hassan Ishaq (member of Thomas Nubian Village Association, 53 years old).  
In 2017, the Egyptian authorities arrested 25 Nubian activists after the police violently dispersed their peaceful protest in Aswan governorate on 3 September 2017. They were later released and all charges dropped, noting that Gamal Sorour, one of the activists, died in custody. Amnesty International documented the continued harassment of Nubian rights activists through National Security Agency (NSA) including through summons for coercive questioning without judicial orders in 2021.  
In addition, the SCC routinely conducts trials that have been assessed as being grossly unfair and leading to harsh sentences including prison sentences up to 20 years to be followed by equally long travel bans, and going up to the death penalty, and has been considered to be a politicized tool to repress dissidents.  
Amnesty International is calling on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience detained solely for peacefully demanding reforms or celebrating their heritage. Those imprisoned include in addition to the 10 Egyptian Nubian men, Mohammed al-Bajadi, founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and prominent human rights defender; and Salman al-Awda, a reformist cleric who faces a death sentence for expressing his opinion in a tweet.

0,Venezuela: ICC Prosecutor’s primary consideration in opening an investigation must be timely and effective justice for victims,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/venezuela-icc-prosecutors-primary-consideration-in-opening-an-investigation-must-be-timely-and-effective-justice-for-victims/,"In response to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announcing that it is opening an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International...","In response to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) announcing that it is opening an investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed in Venezuela, Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International said:  
“The International Criminal Court has finally recognized the urgency of investigating the crimes against humanity that multiple human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have documented and denounced for years in Venezuela. The Office of the Prosecutor must fully investigate the atrocities committed against the Venezuelan people, pursuing cases against those who bear the greatest responsibility for crimes against humanity.”  
The ICC Prosecutor has announced the conclusion of his Office’s preliminary examination in Venezuela – which it had opened in 2018 – with a determination that a full investigation is warranted. The Office of the Prosecutor had previously found that crimes against humanity have been committed in Venezuela under Nicolas Maduro’s government, since at least 2017, including arbitrary detentions, use of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, rape and other forms of sexual violence, as well as persecution.  
In a public announcement, Prosecutor Khan and President Maduro explained that they had agreed to a “Letter of Understanding”. Prosecutor Khan also highlighted the importance of “positive complementarity” in his approach to the Venezuela investigation. 
“This is the first ICC investigation into a country in the Americas. To be effective, the ICC must commence as soon as possible, and should impartially investigate those most responsible for the systematic policy of repression and social control in Venezuela, since at least 2014, as noted by the United Nations’ Fact-Finding Mission in its reports in September 2020 and September 2021,” added Erika Guevara-Rosas. 
“While a cooperative approach to investigations would be desirable, the Prosecutor should listen to calls from victims who are yet to see justice and recognize that his Office’s intervention is urgently needed for prompt and effective investigations of crimes against humanity in Venezuela. Although the ‘principle of complementarity’ urges the Prosecutor to call on Venezuelan authorities to carry out independent and impartial domestic investigations in Venezuela, he must not be deferential to state proceedings at all costs. In particular, when states are not genuinely willing or able to investigate and prosecute crimes under international law themselves – including investigations into those at senior levels or most responsible.” 
“Above all, the Prosecutor’s approach must ensure that the rights to justice of victims and survivors of human rights violations in the country are respected and fulfilled by the Court and in Venezuela. It is paramount that human rights defenders who have sought justice at the ICC should be protected against any reprisals.”

Zhang Zhan, who was sentenced to four years in prison in December for posting on social media about China’s handling of the outbreak, has been on hunger strike in protest at her incarceration. Her family say they do not expect her to live through the winter if she is not released on medical grounds. 
“Zhang Zhan, who should never have been jailed in the first place, now appears to be at grave risk of dying in prison. The Chinese authorities must release her immediately so that she can end her hunger strike and receive the appropriate medical treatment she desperately needs,” said Gwen Lee, China Campaigner at Amnesty International. 
“The Chinese government’s prosecution of Zhang Zhan, simply because she tried to uncover what was happening in Wuhan amid huge government secrecy about the pandemic, is a shameful attack on human rights.” 
Zhang Zhan, a former lawyer, travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to provide on-the-ground information about what was happening there. She posted on social media about how government officials had detained independent reporters and harassed families of Covid-19 patients. 
She went missing in Wuhan in May 2020. It later emerged that she had been taken by the Chinese authorities and detained in Shanghai, where she was convicted of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” after a sham trial. 
In June 2020, Zhang Zhan began a hunger strike in protest at her detention. By December, her body was so weak she had to attend her trial in a wheelchair. 
Prior to the trial, authorities force-fed her and restrained her for days at a time to prevent her from removing a feeding tube. They also forced Zhang to wear shackles and hand restraints 24 hours a day for more than three months as punishment for her hunger strike. 
On 31 July 2021, she was admitted to hospital due to severe malnutrition. However, she was returned to prison and remains on a partial hunger strike despite the grave risk to her health, which continues to deteriorate at a dramatic rate. 
Since her trial, the authorities have refused to let her speak to her lawyer or meet her family in person. She has been allowed occasional phone or video calls with relatives, under supervision. 
In a Twitter post on 30 October, her brother Zhang Ju wrote: “I don’t think she’s going to live much longer. If she doesn’t make it through the coming winter, I hope the world will remember her as she once was.” 
Zhang Zhan is featured in Amnesty International’s 2021 Write for Rights campaign calling for her release. 
“Zhang Zhan is a victim of the Chinese government’s zero-tolerance approach to criticism and opposing views. She has been imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression, and she must be immediately and unconditionally released,” Gwen Lee said. 
“Pending her release, she must have regular, unrestricted access to her family and lawyers of her choice, and not be subjected further to any ill-treatment. If Zhang Zhan dies in prison, her blood will be on the Chinese government’s hands.” 
Citizen journalists were a vital source of uncensored, first-hand information about the Covid-19 outbreak in China. Because they work independently of state-controlled media, citizen journalists face constant harassment for exposing information the Chinese government would rather keep quiet. 
There is an alarming pattern of deaths of imprisoned Chinese activists, either in detention or after being belatedly released on medical parole. 
In July 2017, human rights activist and Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo died in custody after the authorities refused his and his family’s requests to receive treatment abroad for his cancer.  
The same year, Chinese writer and government critic Yang Tongyan (pen name Yang Tianshui) died three months after being released on medical parole and undergoing an operation to remove a brain tumour. 
Beijing activist and prominent campaigner Cao Shunli died from organ failure after months in custody in March 2014. She was denied appropriate medical treatment while in jail.

In the joint document, the signatory organizations highlight the intensification of repression and harassment of dissident voices, as part of a context in which the conditions do not exist for holding elections that guarantee the exercise of rights. 
The Nicaraguan government has tried to eliminate and discourage electoral competition through arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and the prosecution of opponents and presidential candidates, as well as by creating obstacles to the candidacy of the main opposition parties. It has also harassed and intimidated the press and violated political rights, all with the collaboration of the legislative and judicial powers. The intensification of harassment, in addition to the repeated abusive use of force and impunity, have increased concerns about human rights violations in the context of social mobilization.  
For these reasons, the organizations, are calling on the international community, multilateral organizations and international human rights organizations to redouble their efforts and endeavours to end the human rights crisis.

On 17 October, the First-Instance Tribunal of Adrar, a city 1400 km southwest of Algiers, the Algerian capital, convicted environmental activist Mohad Gasmi to five years in prison for “glorification of terrorism” for a Facebook publication in which he blamed the Algerian authorities for the radicalization of a well-known militant. Mohad Gasmi has been detained since 8 June 2020 in a detention facility in Adrar. The authorities must quash his conviction and grant his immediate release.  
Police in Adrar arrested Mohad Gasmi on 14 June 2020. His house was searched and police seized his phone, computer and USB flash drive. He was charged with “glorification of terrorism” for a Facebook post where he attributes the radicalization of a prominent Algerian militant, considered a “terrorist” by the Algerian authorities, to their failure to deliver justice and dignity to their population.  
Mohad Gasmi is a civil society and environmental activist who was among the leaders of the protest movement against the exploitation of the shale gas in the south of Algeria between 2012 and 2015. He also took part in the Hirak protests which erupted in February 2019 and called for political change in Algeria.  
The Algerian authorities are increasingly resorting to trumped up terrorism-related charges to prosecute journalists, human rights defenders and political activists in the country. Journalists Hassan Bouras and Mohamed Mouloudj are currently held in pre-trial detention on terrorism-related charges for their online publications criticizing the authorities. Three members of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights in Oran are also being prosecuted for “terrorism” to punish them for their participation in the Hirak movement.

The prosecutor of the Adrar First Instance Tribunal brought charges against Mohad Gasmi of “glorification of terrorism’’ and he was held in provisional detention for the maximum time allowed by the law which is 16 months. On 17 October, a court in Adrar convicted the activist to five years in prison based on article 87bis 4 of the penal code. He was also banned from voting or participating in an election for five years.  
According to Mohad Gasmi’s lawyer, the Court used as evidence a Facebook post he published on 18 January 2018,  where he points to the responsibility of Algerian authorities in the radicalization of Abdesslem Termoune, head of the armed group “the South’s Sons Movement for Justice”, who was killed in Libya in January 2018. In his publication, which Amnesty International reviewed, he pays tribute to Termoune, and says that there is no wonder some took up arms in the Algerian Sahara to protest marginalization and express social demands. He concludes by considering that “the authorities are responsible for extremism within society through their disdain.”  
The Algerian penal code punishes with up to five years “anyone who glorifies, encourages or finances, with any means” the acts of terrorism. The Algerian code definition of terrorism and glorification of it contains broadly worded offences that criminalise legitimate expression. The right to freedom of expression includes speech that offends, shocks and disturbs. Mohad Gasmi’s sentencing for a Facebook post that does not appear to incite a criminal act is contrary to international law and Conventions to which Algeria is a state party.  
In another case against him, the Court of Adrar prosecuted Mohad Gasmi on penal code charges related to “having access to secret information”, “offending” the President of the Republic and “offending” public institutions for online posts such as one where he wrote that the police who helped distribute Covid-19 aid was the same that repressed activists during Hirak. A tribunal in Adrar held its first hearing in this case on 13 October and the judge ordered further investigation.  
Since 2019, the Algerian authorities have been prosecuting, arresting and detaining hundreds of activists for the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Since April 2021, Algeria’s authorities have increasingly resorted to the use of “terrorism” or “conspiracy against the state” charges to prosecute human rights defenders and Hirak activists. They have arrested and prosecuted activists for their alleged ties with unregistered political organizations from Algeria, such as Rachad and the Movement for the Self Determination of Kabylie (MAK), designated as terrorists’ organizations in May 2021 by the authorities.  
There are currently 222 people in Algeria detained on the basis of the peaceful exercise of their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, according to the National Committee for the Liberation of detainees in Algeria, a national watch dog group.

The authorities of Singapore have set the execution of Malaysian national Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam for 10 November. In violation of international law and standards, he was sentenced to the mandatory death penalty after he was found guilty of transporting 42.72 grams of diamorphine in April 2009. Several medical experts have found him to have borderline intellectual functioning and cognitive deficits, which might have impacted his ability to assess risks and his accounts of the circumstances of the offence.  
International law and standards set out restrictions to the use of the death penalty to protect against the arbitrary deprivation of life. These include the prohibitions to impose this punishment as a mandatory sentence; for offences that do not meet the threshold of the “most serious crimes” involving intentional killing; on people with mental or intellectual disabilities; and after proceedings that do not meet the highest standards for a fair trial.  
Singapore is one of four countries known to have carried out executions for drug-related offences in recent years. Due to its highly repressive drug control law, judges are not allowed to take into consideration possible mitigating circumstances at sentencing, including drug dependence or other circumstances relevant to the case.

Additional Information:  
Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty on 22 November 2010 for importing into Singapore 42.72 grams of diamorphine (heroin) in April 2009. His conviction and death sentence were upheld by the Court of Appeal in July 2011. International law and standards prohibit the imposition of mandatory death sentences as these deny judges the possibility of taking into account the mitigating circumstances in the case. Moreover, international law and standards require that the imposition of the death penalty be restricted to the “most serious crimes” involving intentional killing. Of additional concern remains the possible reliance by the prosecution on legal presumptions under Singapore’s Misuse of Drugs Act, meaning that any person who is proved to have in their possession certain amounts of prohibited substances can be presumed to have knowledge of the substance contained in the package and its quantity; and to have had that drug in their possession for the purpose of trafficking, unless they can prove differently, in contravention to the right to the presumption of innocence.  
Following amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act effective from 2013, judges in Singapore have some sentencing discretion in cases where the role of the defendant was limited to transporting drugs (“courier”) if the public prosecutor issues a certificate of substantive assistance; or for those with mental or intellectual disabilities that substantially impaired their mental responsibility for their acts and omissions in relation to the offence. This means, alarmingly, that if the prosecution does not provide a certificate of assistance after a defendant is found to be a “courier”, the court is deprived of any discretionary powers and must sentence the accused to death, shifting the sentencing decision in practice to the prosecution. In February 2015, Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam applied to be resentenced to life imprisonment following the changes to the law, but while he qualified as “courier” the Public Prosecutor did not issue him a certificate of substantive assistance, leading to the confirmation of his mandatory death sentence in September 2017. Other motions and appeals were subsequently rejected.  
Medical experts who assessed Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam in 2013, 2016 and 2017 found that he has borderline functioning intelligence and concurrent cognitive deficits, which “may have contributed toward his misdirected loyalty and poor assessment of the risks in agreeing to carry out the offence”. The Court of Appeal dismissed the concern, stating that “[h]is alleged deficiency in assessing risks might have made him more prone to engage in risky behaviour; that, however, does not in any way diminish his culpability.” Similarly, the Court rejected the claim that Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam’s various psychiatric conditions, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder of the inattentive subtype, as well as borderline intellectual functioning, would have impacted his ability to communicate his knowledge of relevant information in a cogent manner and his engagement with the authorities, including when questioned by officers of Singapore’s Central Narcotics Bureau, without the presence of a lawyer, after his arrest. This in turn might have had a bearing on the information he provided to the prosecution for the certificate of assistance needed to qualify for sentencing discretion. The treaty bodies for the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Singapore is a party, have clarified that these treaties prohibit the imposition of the death penalty on people whose mental and intellectual disabilities have impeded their effective defense.  
Singapore must end its strategy of using the death penalty to address drug-related problems and instead focus on evidence-based and community-based approaches to drugs, rooted in the respect of public health and human rights. Singapore’s reliance on draconian laws and policies has not only failed to tackle drug dependence in the country, but also to offer effective protection from drug-related harm. Amnesty International urges the Singapore authorities to immediately halt the set hanging of Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam and establish an official moratorium on all executions as first step towards full abolition of the death penalty.  
The authorities of Singapore notified Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam’s family, who live in Malaysia, of the set execution by a letter dated 26 October. Because of restrictions in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, Nagaenthran has not been able to see members of his family for over two years. It is only now that up to five family members are allowed to travel and visit the prison. Activists have highlighted how ongoing Covid-19 related restrictions and quarantine requirements have added financial and logistical challenges to an already inherently cruel process.  
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception. As of today, 108 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes and more than two-thirds are abolitionist in law or practice.

Additional Information:  
Badr Baabou (41) is a Tunisian LGBTI rights activist and co-founder of DAMJ, one of the country’s most prominent LGBTI rights groups. Around 9:00pm on 21 October 2021, Badr Baabou left a cafe in downtown Tunis after socialising with friends and was walking toward the area’s main roundabout, known as “Monguella,” to find a taxi when two unknown men accosted him in the street. The first man to appear, walking beside Badr Baabou, wore T-shirt and dark trousers labelled “Public Security,” and taunted Badr Baabou about filing complaints against police officers. Badr Baabou asked the man who he was, and the man replied loudly with a phrase in Tunisian Arabic indicating “The cops!” The second man, wearing civilian clothes, appeared a moment later and grabbed hold of Badr Baabou by his backpack, as the first man struck Badr Baabou repeatedly on the head. The two men forced him into a dark side-street called Rue Kemal Ataturk, where he fell to the ground as they repeatedly struck him with their fists and kicked him with their boots on the head, neck, and legs, yelling insults and the phrase “the cops” until he nearly lost consciousness. Finally,the man in civilian clothing took Badr Baabou’s laptop from his backpack and his phone from his pocket, confiscating them. The two men told him the beating was retaliation for filing complaints against police and left with parting words that Badr Baabou said he recalls as a warning not to defend “whores and [a derogatory term in Tunisian Arabic for homosexuals].” After a few minutes Badr Baabou got to his feet, bleeding from his head, returned home by taxi, and used a phone there to call a fellow DAMJ activist and the association’s lawyer, who accompanied Badr Baabou to the emergency room of Tunis’ Rabta Hospital, where a doctor examined him, as attested by a copy of a medical report shared with Amnesty International.  
According to DAMJ and HRW, Badr Baabou was harassed, assaulted and threatened several times. In 2018 his home in Downtown Tunis was by burglarized by people who stole personal and work laptops containing sensitive DAMJ information. In November 2019, he was approached by unidentified individuals in the streets of Tunis who threatened to kill him and burn down his apartment. The threat was reiterated in March 2020, when police officers questioned his neighbours about his work as an activist. Following these incidents Badr Baabou has been forced to relocate frequently.  
On the evening of 10 March 2021, four men in civilian clothes allegedly assaulted Badr Baabou in downtown Tunis as he left a bar after socializing with friends. After a bystander intervened to separate the men from Badr Baabou, the men joined a group of policemen nearby who had watched the incident without intervening. Badr Baabou filed a complaint over the alleged incident with the prosecutor’s office at the Tunis Court of First Instance. To date, the prosecutor has not informed them of any progress on this complaint.  
On 25 October, the activist filed a complaint with Tunis’ Court of First Instance directed against Tunisia’s General Director of National Security, General Director of Public Security, Regional Head of Public Security, and the two men who assaulted and robbed him and whom he alleges to be members of security forces. The complaint has yet to be responded to.  
LGBTI activists in Tunisia have alleged various forms of harassment by authorities in recent years, including verbal harassment during protests, assault, surveillance, as well as arrests under broadly-worded laws such as those that criminalize insulting police and harming public morals.

Locked up in filthy, overcrowded conditions in a prison system notorious for deadly riots and beheadings, Bernardo Caal Xol is paying the price for standing up to corporate interests and authorities who routinely misuse Guatemala’s justice system to silence human rights defenders. 
Caal, 49, is a teacher and community leader from Santa María Cahabón, a Q’eqchi’ Mayan territory in the lush northern region of Alta Verapaz. Since 2015, he has filed several legal challenges against the OXEC hydroelectric project for allegedly destroying 15 hectares of forest and three sacred hills and restricting access to two sacred rivers where Q’eqchi’ people have fished and bathed for generations — in violation of an international law enshrining Indigenous peoples’ rights to free, prior and informed consent over projects that affect their territories. 
Arrested in January 2018, Caal is serving a sentence of seven years and four months for supposedly detaining and robbing four employees of an OXEC subcontractor during a 2015 protest. Guatemala’s Supreme Court rejected his latest appeal in September, but he should never have spent a day behind bars. At Amnesty International, we found irregularities, negligence and a lack of evidence in the case against Caal, and declared him a prisoner of conscience, jailed solely because of his activism. 
Caal’s defense of human rights has also provoked threats and smear campaigns against him, raising serious concerns over his safety. Guatemala was the world’s seventh-deadliest country for land and environmental defenders in 2020, and at least 11 activists against hydroelectric projects have been killed there in recent years. 
U.N. experts recently warned that Caal’s health is deteriorating in a prison with “deficient infrastructure, food and sanitation.” Visits have been heavily restricted during the pandemic, with his wife only allowed in sporadically while his elderly mother and two daughters have been unable to see him. 
Caal spends much of his time behind bars writing letters, often denouncing Florentino Pérez, the Spanish billionaire best known as president of the soccer club Real Madrid. Pérez also heads the Spanish construction giant ACS, whose subsidiary Cobra built Renace, another hydroelectric project on the Cahabón river. In a 2014 visit to supervise construction, Pérez gifted Guatemala’s then-president a Real Madrid jersey and boasted of Renace’s “exemplary social responsibility, with respect for others, the environment and the communities.” 
But Caal says it has inflicted terrible harm. In one handwritten letter, he accuses Pérez of piping and diverting the river without consulting the affected communities, thus “leaving thousands of Q’eqchi’ Mayan brothers and sisters without access to water.” In another, he implores Real Madrid’s fans to tell their club president to “leave the sacred Cahabón river in peace.” ACS and Cobra did not respond to requests for comment. 
As with OXEC, Guatemala’s courts allowed the Renace project to proceed, despite acknowledging the violation of local communities’ rights to prior consent. Renace has denied any wrongdoing, but a Spanish government body found it had caused “significant changes to some stretches of the Cahabón river … with potential negative effects on local communities.” 
Access to rivers is vital in Alta Verapaz, one of Guatemala’s poorest regions, where only 28 percent of the population have running water in their homes. Restricting access can have terrible consequences for local communities who have long depended on rivers as a source of fish, crabs, snails and edible plants. Renace and OXEC say they have helped reduce malnutrition through their local health and social development programs, yet Alta Verapaz has accounted for 75 percent of nationwide child deaths from malnutrition this year, and at least 137 infants have died from acute malnutrition there since 2016. 
To add insult to injury, affected communities rarely reap the benefits of hydroelectric projects, as the areas where dams are concentrated have the least access to electricity in all of Guatemala. 
Public anger at Caal’s imprisonment has coincided with national discontent over economic inequality, the government’s handling of the pandemic and its dismantling of efforts to combat corruption and impunity. The unrest erupted in a nationwide strike in July, with broad swaths of society joining Indigenous leaders in calling for a complete transformation in how Guatemala is governed. 
Respect for human rights must be central moving forward. When Guatemala represents Central America at the COP26 conference in Glasgow, as one of the countries worst affected by the global climate crisis, it is expected to raise the need to recover and protect ecosystems affected by hydroelectric works. Yet it cannot continue to criminalize the environmental defenders who play such a vital role in protecting these same ecosystems. 
Guatemala’s authorities must start by overturning Caal’s conviction and releasing him immediately. Instead of imprisoning courageous human rights defenders, they must protect them and guarantee the rights of Indigenous peoples to prevent further injustices.

Following the release of the G20 Leader’s Declaration, which promises to “explore ways to accelerate global vaccination” and “advance toward” WHO’s goal of vaccinating 40% of every country’s population by the end of the year, Tamaryn Nelson, Amnesty International’s Advisor on Right to Health, said:   
“G20 leaders seem to be saying all the right things – but after 5 million deaths, that’s not good enough. These vague promises are an affront to those who have died, and to everyone still living in fear of Covid-19.   
“We need action, and we need it fast. Many G20 members have vast stocks of surplus vaccines which could end up simply going to waste. Amnesty found that 500 million doses could be made available immediately if these were redistributed to lower-income countries, yet redistribution did not even get a mention in this statement. 
“With just two months left of this year, only a radical change in approach will close the shameful vaccine gap. If we continue down our current path, the end of the pandemic will remain a glimmer on the horizon.”

Amnesty was among many organizations expressing concern at the rapidly deteriorating situation earlier this year and backed a call by the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission for a United Nations-mandated Fact-Finding Mission in Afghanistan looking at abuses from January 2020 onwards. 
The responsibility of the international community didn’t end with the complete withdrawal of US & NATO forces from Afghanistan on August 31st. Thousands of Afghans remain at risk of reprisal from the Taliban. We are calling on the international community to:

Stay tuned: We are continuing to gather more information on Canada’s response to the crisis, discuss work with partners, and develop our campaign strategy. 
These online actions are wrapping up in mid-September (see links below). Please share with activists in your group or network to encourage a last round of signatures. 
China: call on President Xi Jinping to release people arbitrarily held in camps and prisons in Xinjiang. Amnesty’s June 2021 report ‘Like We Were Enemies in a War’: China’s Mass Internment, Torture, and Persecution of Muslims in Xinjiang documented systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity. 
Equitable global access to Covid-19 Vaccines: call on companies to help increase production and access to vaccines by joining the World Health Organisation’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). Twenty years ago, millions of people gained access to life-saving HIV treatment after leading pharma companies allowed others to produce low-cost ‘generic’ versions of HIV medicines. 
Myanmar: call on governments and companies across the globe to join together and end the oppression by the military. August 19 marked 200 days since the military coup.

Sign and share Amnesty’s call to the Minister of Immigration and Integration in Denmark to ensure continued protection of refugees. Use the hashtag #SyriaNotSafe on social media. 
Tigray 
New research by Amnesty in August 2021 documented extensive sexual violence against girls and women by both government forces and armed groups amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity. We are calling for a prompt, thorough, independent, and impartial investigation in all cases of sexual violence perpetrated in Tigray during the conflict. You can add your name to the global call for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to take all necessary steps to ensure justice and reparation for women and girls subjected to sexual violence by the military forces aligned with the Ethiopian government. 
Individual cases 
We continue to call for the release of Aleksei Navalny in Russia and for the US to drop politically motivated charges against Julian Assange. 
Belarus 
On September 6, 2021, Maryia Kalesnikava — the public face of the 2020 peaceful protests in Belarus – and lawyer Maksim Znak were sentenced to 11 and 10 years respectively after a brief, closed trial in which all hearings and materials were classified. Both were members of the opposition Coordinating Council. We’re expecting a new action on their cases as part of our ongoing work around the brutal crackdown on protests and dissent following the disputed elections in August 2020. 
Covid-19 Vaccines 
Canada must live up to its international human rights obligations and do more to ensure equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines. This summer we wrote to PM Trudeau and several cabinet ministers calling for clear support to the World Trade Organization (WTO)’s Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and reform of the Canadian Access to Medicines Regime (CAMR, both of which would enable sharing of knowledge and technology to increase vaccine production and access. Caught up in all of this is a potential agreement between Bolivia and a Canadian company to produce the 15 million Johnson & Johnson doses needed to vaccinate that country’s entire adult population. But too many barriers stand in the way. Stay tuned for a post-election action in late September!

They risk their lives and freedom to do so, amidst increasing death threats, assassinations and misuse of the justice system to lock up those who challenge powerful economic interests. 
Amnesty Canada has prioritized campaigns in solidarity with defenders under attack. Recent successes and ongoing attacks underscore the importance of redoubling our efforts. 
On July 5, in a landmark decision, the Supreme Court of Honduras found David Castillo guilty of being a “co-author” of the 2016 murder of Lenca indigenous water defender Berta Cáceres by hired hitmen. In 2018, seven other men were convicted and sentenced for their role in the murder of Caceres, including hired assassins, DESA employees and members of the army. 
Castillo is a former army intelligence officer and manager of Desarrollos Energéticos, a hydroelectric company that was seeking to build the Agua Zarca dam, despite opposition by Lenca Indigenous people because of the impact it would have on their water and land. As Coordinator of the Civic Council of Indigenous and Popular Organizations of Honduras (COPINH), Berta led efforts to halt the dam project and reported receiving threats that she would be killed if she continued her efforts. 
COPINH called the conviction of Castillo a victory for their organization, Berta’s family, the Lenca and all people in Honduras. “It means that criminal power structures failed to corrupt the justice system,” COPINH said on Twitter. Berta’s daughter Bertha Isabel told The Guardian newspaper: “To have achieved a guilty verdict against the [former] president of a corporation, [who is] connected to the armed forces: it is unprecedented in our country. We have to continue the fight. Our work, our struggle for justice in the case of our mother, will contribute to this important cause of ensuring there is no repetition of this kind of crime in our country.” 
Amnesty’s Americas director Erika Guevara-Rosas described the verdict as “an important step towards justice and the result of her family and COPINH’s tireless efforts to secure truth, justice and reparation.” COPINH has credited the vital importance of international solidarity with their struggle, including more than 65,000 messages to Honduran authorities by Amnesty supporters in Canada. 
Amnesty is urging Honduran prosecutors to act on evidence that implicates other high-level business executives and agents of the state in the murder of Berta Caceres. Until all those responsible are held accountable, other defenders in Honduras will continue to lose their lives for raising their voices and defending the most vulnerable. 
A recent, disturbing case is that of four Garífuna activists, members of the Black Fraternal Organization of Honduras (OFRANEH), who were taken away on July 18, 2020 by individuals wearing Police Investigations Directorate vests. The whereabouts of the Garifuna defenders remain unknown.  
Respond to our Urgent Action for the disappeared Garifuna defenders of OFRANEH

Stay tuned for upcoming actions in support of COPINH and Justice for Berta 
Following the delivery of thousands of messages of concern for the safety of threatened Amazon defender Jani Silva written by Amnesty supporters in Canada and around the world, the Colombian government responded to our calls for strengthened protection measures, including a bullet proof vehicle, bodyguards and a cell phone to enable calls for help. Authorities also granted a protection scheme to Sandra Lagos, another threatened woman defender with Jani’s organization ADISPA. 
This is good news. Jani Silva thanked everyone who raised their voice on her behalf and told us she believes calls for action by authorities helped to save her life. 
Sadly, too many other environment defenders are at grave risk in Colombia, amid a terrifying increase in assassinations. 
At an AGM workshop in June, Yuvelis Morales, a young woman student, explained how she had to leave her home and go into hiding because of death threats. She was threatened after she raised her voice to protect the Magadalena river and Colombia’s rich biodiversity from threats posed by fracking pilot projects. Yuvelis is an activist with AGUAWIL (acronym for the Committee for the Defence of Water, Life and the Territory of Puerto Wilches) as well as the Colombian Alliance against Fracking. The members of these organizations are in constant danger, with added risks for young women activists. Yuvelis told us that solidarity from Canada is vital. She urged us to make their situation more visible and push for guarantees of safety for those who are speaking up to protect the right to a healthy environment.

Environmental defenders with the Women’s Movement for the Defense of Access to Water, Land and Environmental Protection in Chile are under attack as they courageously confront a water crisis, and its impact on women and their families. Mujeres Modatima, as they are known in Spanish, are dedicated to working together in an antipatriarchal movement for water as a human right, confronting extractivism which they say has “dried up entire communities, depriving them of such a vital element” 
In response to their efforts to defend access to life giving water, leaders of Mujeres Modatima have suffered break ins, attacks, smear campaigns and terrifying threats like the one threatening death for Verónica Vilches, painted on the wall of her workplace (see below). Learn more about their experiences here. 
The experience of Verónica and other members of Mujeres Modatima has taught them to have little faith in the authorities. In some instances, the women have not even been allowed to report crimes committed against them. In other instances, when they were able to make official complaints, investigations were not carried out. The police have failed to provide protection and have told the women there is nothing they can do. 
Write a letter in support of the threatened women defenders of Mujeres Modatima. Tell Chilean authorities they must investigate all threats and attacks, bring the perpetrators to justice, and ensure that leaders of Mujeres Modatima can protect the right to water without fear of harm to them or their families. 
One year after naming Bernardo Caal Xol a prisoner of conscience, colleagues from our Latin American Regional Office delivered 28,000 signatures to Guatemala’s Attorney General from around the world demanding his release, including more than 12,500 from Amnesty supporters in Canada. It was a powerful call to redress a grave miscarriage of justice! But so far that call has fallen on deaf ears. 
“Bernardo Caal’s imprisonment for more than three years now sends a frightening message to the Indigenous peoples leading the defence of human rights, justice and the protection of our planet,” said Amnesty’s Americas director Erika Guevara-Rosas. “It’s shameful that the Guatemalan authorities continue to criminalize and intimidate those who dedicate their lives to defending nature while a global movement for environmental protection is gaining ground.”  
A teacher, trade unionist and trusted community leader, Bernardo Caal has been unfairly imprisoned since January 2018 for defending the rights of Q’eqchi’ Mayan communities affected by the construction of a hydroelectric project on the Cahabón River, considered sacred by the communities and vital to their survival. Bernardo’s detention is emblematic of how human rights defenders, especially Indigenous people and those working on issues associated with territory, land and the environment – are criminalized in Guatemala. It also reflects the historical racism and dispossession of Indigenous peoples’ territories in Guatemala.  
Bernardo Caal filed a cassation appeal with Guatemala’s Supreme Court of Justice in September 2020. After multiple obstacles and delays, the hearing took place this past June. A ruling was supposed to be issued within 15 days but more than 2 months later, there is still no word.  
Seeking Bernardo Caal’s release has been selected as a priority action for this year’s Write for Rights campaign. Our goal is to increase pressure on Guatemalan authorities with thousands of more letters and e-action signatures. 
Read Amnesty’s Open Letter expressing concern about irregularities and negligence in the criminal proceedings against Bernardo Caal Xol, including lack of objective evidence to support the charges against him.  
Sign the e-action here. Equally important, invite friends, family, teachers and other potential allies in your community to add their signature to our call to Free Bernardo. 
Write a letter as part of Write for Rights. Check back here at the beginning of October for the case sheet. The case sheet and instructions will be available at the end of September. 
Organize an online screening of Water: The Blood of Mother Nature, a powerful documentary from Guatemala about the struggle of Bernardo and the Q’eqchi communities he represents. Then invite viewers to sign our action and write a letter. For more information, contact Elena Dumitru via edumitru@amnesty.ca 
Send a solidarity message so Bernardo knows you are taking action to seek his release. Email your message to campaigner Kathy Price [kprice@amnesty.ca] so she can ensure it reaches Bernardo in jail.

Background 
Several years ago, Amnesty International began challenging electronics and car companies for failing to tackle child labor allegations in the battery supply. Our report, Time to Recharge, ranked industry giants including Apple, Samsung Electronics, Dell, Microsoft, BMW, Renault, and Tesla on improvements they had made to their cobalt sourcing practices since January 2016. It found that while a handful of companies had made progress, others were still failing to take even basic steps like investigating supply chain links in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
In addition to cobalt, lithium is also required to make lithium-ion batteries, which are used to power many of the devices we rely upon such as laptops, phones, electric cars, and electric bicycles. The global race to secure sources of lithium is placing immense pressure on communities and governments to approve exploration and exploitation licenses in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia, and Canada. Communities concerned about the impacts of lithium extraction and processing on their lives, livelihoods, and the various animal species in their territories, are speaking up to demand respect for their rights – including their right to self-determination and consent on these projects.

Over 80% of G20 population live in countries that support COVID-19 Intellectual Property waiver Failure to tackle global vaccine inequality at this weekend’s G20...","Failure to tackle global vaccine inequality at this weekend’s G20 summit could prolong the pandemic, civil society groups have warned, if leaders do not address structural problems they have so far ignored allowing COVID-19 doses to be hoarded by rich nations. 
The People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of more than 75 organisations including Oxfam, Amnesty International, the African Alliance, UNAIDS, and Global Justice Now, is calling for G20 leaders to unblock global supply shortages by waiving intellectual property and sharing technology of COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics  and treatments. 
G20 countries represent 62% of the world’s population but have used 82% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines. Only 3.1% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose. 
The G20 are deeply divided on a proposal to temporarily suspend intellectual property rules on COVID-19 technologies to allow wider vaccine production. Rather than constructively negotiate this life-saving proposal, led by South Africa and India, rich country members Germany and the UK have prevented unified G20 action to protect billions of people. 
G20 members such as President Rhamaphosa of South Africa have spoken out bitterly about the continued intransigence of rich nations on the patent issue and the vaccine apartheid this is creating. 
Eighty-two per cent of the G20 population live in countries that support the waiver, yet the measure is being blocked by just three opposing G20 members: the UK, Germany and, by extension, the EU. The UK and Germany have fully vaccinated three times as many people, relative to population, than India and South Africa. 
The alliance is calling on G20 leaders to pressure the UK and Germany to resolve the dispute, which would allow all safe manufacturers approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to produce COVID-19 vaccines, unlocking the world’s productive capacity to end the pandemic. 
Anna Marriot, policy lead for the People’s Vaccine Alliance, said: 
“It’s an absolute scandal that the G20 has wasted a year ignoring a proposal, backed by the majority of its members, to break vaccine monopolies and ensure the life-saving vaccines can be made around the world to save countless lives. The G20 is turning its back on the thousands of children orphaned every day by this pandemic. G20 leaders who support the waiver must not be silenced by the rich country members like the UK and Germany. It is beyond time to act.” 
Indonesia, a G20 country that supports the waiver, told a WHO press conference earlier this year it could manufacture 550 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines a year, but intellectual property and secrecy around vaccine knowhow have held it back. 
Ahead of the G20, People’s Vaccine activists are holding stunts in Italy and the United States to demand government action on global vaccine inequality [details in notes]. 
Tamaryn Nelson, advisor on right to health from Amnesty International said: 
“When the G20 met last year, 1.3 million people had died of COVID-19 and leaders vowed to spare no effort to ensure access to vaccines for all people. A year later, not much has changed, except another 3.5 million people lost their lives to COVID-19. It’s unconscionable that G20 leaders are not taking sufficient action while tens of thousands of people continue to die every week. 
“Countries sitting on excess vaccines must redistribute these doses now and pharmaceutical companies need to share the know-how needed to scale up global production. Anything short of this is depriving billions of people of lifesaving vaccines and medicines. We have no more time to waste.” 
A report last month from Amnesty International found that large pharmaceutical companies were fueling an unprecedented human rights crisis through their refusal to waive intellectual property rights and share vaccine technology, criticising AstraZeneca, BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer for refusing to participate in initiatives to boost global vaccine supply. 
Nick Dearden, Director of Global Justice Now, said: 
“Armed with effective vaccines and abundant manufacturing capacity, we should be able to swiftly vaccinate the world from COVID-19. But, unless we clear away vaccine patents, it will be years before global south countries receive the jabs, leading to countless deaths and increasing the risk of deadly new variants. G20 leaders like Boris Johnson must finally agree to redistribute the jabs they have hoarded and waive vaccine intellectual property at this summit, or they risk condemning the world to an endless pandemic.” 
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, has repeatedly called for governments to support an intellectual property waiver at the WTO. Last week, Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, warned the COVID-19 crisis could “easily drag on deep into 2022” because of global vaccine inequality. 
Epidemiologists have warned that global vaccine inequality threatens to undermine our current generation of vaccines, while a report from the Wellcome Trust and Institute for Government warned that virus mutations will “chip away” at the protection offered by vaccines. 
Maaza Seyoum from the African Alliance said: 
“The staggering inequality of global manufacturing and distribution has given rise to a system of vaccine apartheid – and even G20 countries, like South Africa and Indonesia, have found themselves at the sharp end. An endless stream of false promises of vaccine donations from rich countries has failed to materialise. We cannot wait for charity. It’s time to remove the intellectual property barriers and share the knowhow needed for low and middle-income countries produce COVID-19 vaccines for ourselves.” 
Earlier this month, the People’s Vaccine Alliance found  that just one in seven of the 1.8 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses promised by rich nations have been delivered to date, totaling just 261 million doses. Western pharmaceutical companies have delivered only 12 percent of the doses they allocated to COVAX, the initiative designed to help fairly distribute COVID-19 vaccines.

This fall, Amnesty Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Network on Corporate Accountability (CNCA), is urging the Canadian government to adopt legislation that would a) require Canadian companies, as well as companies doing business in Canada, to prevent human rights abuses and environmental damage throughout their global operations and supply chains, and b) hold companies accountable when they cause harm. This is called “human rights and environmental due diligence.” 
The CNCA has developed draft model legislation, the Corporate Respect for Human Rights and the Environment Abroad Act, to provide lawmakers with a blueprint for such a law. Similar laws have already been adopted by a number of countries.

Further protests are expected on Saturday. 
Security forces killed at least six men and wounded another 140 by shooting live rounds into multiple crowds of protesters in the capital Khartoum on 25 October. 
“At least six men were shot dead in cold blood and hundreds injured, some critically, simply for exercising their right to peaceful assembly. This is unconscionable and must not be allowed to happen again,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“Sudan’s military leaders, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, must make no mistake about it: the world is watching and will not tolerate further bloodshed. They must order effective and independent investigations into Monday’s killings and ensure that anyone suspected of responsibility for arbitrary or abusive force is prosecuted in fair trials. They must also direct their security forces to desist from using such force at any future protests.” 
The protests erupted in Khartoum and some provincial towns, including Madani in central Sudan and El-Fashir in Darfur, in response to General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan’s announcement declaring a military takeover and a state of emergency across the country. The announcement came a few hours after the military detained Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and several of his ministers, with whom the military had shared power shortly after the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir. 
Gamal Abdel Nasir, 23, was killed near the army headquarters in Khartoum with gunshot wounds to the eye and hand. His brother told Amnesty International: “I couldn’t even look at his body. His face was mutilated beyond recognition. He loved his country very much and he was my only brother.” 
Muhammed Al-Sadiq Musa, 27, was also shot and killed outside the army headquarters. A close family member who was also at the protest told Amnesty International that he was shot and mortally injured when soldiers opened fire after a group of four or five protesters picked up rocks and hurled them in their direction. 
Both Gamal and Mohammed were killed by security forces and in neither case would lethal force have been warranted. 
“That’s the last time I saw him alive. When I arrived at the hospital the doctors had already pronounced him dead. I was asked to identify the body. I saw gunshot wounds, one in the right side of his neck and the other in the side of his right kidney.” 
“We call on Sudan’s military leaders to ensure their security forces observe restraint, and respect and uphold the right to peaceful protest in line with the country’s own laws and international human rights standards,” said Deprose Muchena. 
“They must also take steps to reverse all measures and actions that trample on human rights, including by releasing all those who have been arbitrarily detained since the military takeover and restoring full access to the internet which has been partially shut down for days now.”

On 27 October, the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission delivered to the Federal Public Ministry its final report on the mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has resulted in more than 600,000 deaths and countless human rights violations. The Attorney General, who heads the Public Ministry, has until 26 November to decide whether to open an investigation based on the report. Due to the potential human rights impact of the actions and omissions identified by the Commission, we call on the Attorney General to instruct the Public Ministry to investigate these allegations.  
Amnesty International has been closely following the unfolding of investigations being carried out at the Parliamentary Inquiry Commission and believes it is essential to hold those involved in the mishandling of the pandemic of Covid-19 to account. It is imperative to ensure accountability for the human rights violations committed in the context of the Brazilian government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has produced an unprecedented crisis in the country.  
In October 2021, Brazil reached the record of 600,000 COVID-19 deaths, the second highest in the world. Many of these deaths could have been avoided if authorities had put people’s lives at the center of its decisions. But instead, arguing economic and political concerns, they deliberately minimized the impact of the pandemic on specific groups, promoted treatments without scientific evidence, and failed to secure enough vaccines for its population and to ensure essential supplies  
such as oxygen, as well as to protect groups who faced greater threats due to historic discrimination and inequality.

Just over a year after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global health emergency, Brazil continues to beat records in terms of lethality. More than 600,000 people in Brazil had their lives interrupted by Covid-19 and by the disastrous management of public authorities in fighting the pandemic, a number that should only increase in the coming weeks. In addition to the perverse effects caused by the denialist discourse and the insistence on “early treatment”, the collapse of the health system and various obstacles placed on mass vaccination attest to the implication and responsibility of public authorities for the affliction that the population has been living and yet are seeing worsening.   
This scenario becomes even more serious in a country like Brazil, marked by deep inequalities, systematic attacks on public services and on the set of constitutionally provided rights. The pandemic has disproportionately impacted historically discriminated groups, who in addition to suffering violations to their rights to life and health, have been living with the growing precariousness of their means and conditions of existence. The health crisis we face is, above all, a human rights crisis. It is the State’s duty to take effective measures so that these rights are guaranteed in an integral and equitable way to the entire population, but this duty has been deliberately neglected.  
In response to the actions and omissions of the public administration in the disastrous management of the pandemic, the Federal Senate instituted in late April the Covid-19 Parliamentary Inquiry Commission. The Commission, although it has no power of trial, produced a final report indicating to the Attorney General which crimes possibly have been committed and who should be held accountable. Now, the Attorney General, Mr. Augusto Aras, has 30 days to decide to launch an investigation or not.

But states across the region are failing to provide it. This briefing illustrates that countries are limiting access to international protection and failing to shield Haitians from a range of human rights violations in host countries, including detention and unlawful pushbacks, extortion, anti-black racism, abuses including gender-based violence by armed groups, and destitution.

Armed men abducted Mansour Atti, a journalist, blogger and head of the Red Crescent Committee and of the Civil Society Commission in Ajdabiya, on 3 June 2021 near his workplace in Ajdabiya, in northeastern Libya. Since then, his family have received no information about his fate and whereabouts, amid credible reports that he is being held by an armed group in eastern Libya. Prior to his abduction, Mansour Attia had been subjected to repeated questioning about his activism by the Internal Security Agency-Ajdabiya, an armed group affiliated to the Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF), a powerful armed group in de facto control of eastern Libya.  
Given the well-documented pattern of armed groups in eastern Libya subjecting individuals in their custody to torture and other ill-treatment with impunity, we believe that he is at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. According to eyewitnesses, around 7:00pm, armed men alighted from three vehicles and seized Mansour Atti from a street near his workplace. Since then, his family received no information about his fate and whereabouts, despite sending written appeals to the Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF) and affiliated armed groups, as well as the head of the Ajdabiya Security Directorate, which is nominally under the Ministry of Interior. Until August, armed groups active in Ajdabiya and security forces nominally under the control of the Ministry of Interior denied having him in custody. According to informed sources, in August, a commander in the 302nd Battalion, an armed group affiliated with the LAAF, confirmed in a private gathering between local tribal leaders and armed groups that Mansour Atti was in their custody but refused to indicate his exact location or allow his relatives to visit or otherwise communicate with him.  
According to an informed source and written appeals by Mansour Atti’s family addressed to commanders of armed groups in control of territory in eastern Libya as well as the Ministry of Interior, examined by Amnesty International, the Internal Security Agency-Ajdabiya, an armed group affiliated with the LAAF, had summoned Mansour Atti for questioning several times prior to his abduction and questioned him about his activism.  
Mansour Atti was involved in efforts to ensure that the parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 24 December take place in an environment free of repression and coercion.

Salutation: Dear Colonel General Abdulrazek al-Nadoori,  
Additional Information:  
Since 2014, Libya has been divided between two entities and parallel institutions competing for legitimacy and territorial control. As part of a UN mediated process, 75 members of the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum (LPDF) agreed on a roadmap to bring an end to the political crisis and appointed a Government of National Unity (GNU) in March 2021 tasked with preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections on 24 December 2021. Since then, the GNU has been struggling to exercise effective control over Libyan territory, as armed groups continue to control large swathes of Libyan territory and political divisions persisted. The political crisis deepened after the GNU faced a contentious and widely criticized vote of no-confidence by the House of Representatives (HoR), Libya’s parliament, on 21 September 2021. Several parliamentarians said that they voted against the motion of no-confidence and challenged the tally reported by media as forged. Some municipalities, particularly in the west, publicly denounced the vote. Prime Minister Abdelhamid Al-Debiba also rejected the motion and called for protests in support of the GNU, as hundreds took to the streets in protests in cities in western Libya. Following the vote, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya confirmed that the GNU remained the legitimate government and called on the HoR to focus on the preparation of the constitutional and legislative framework for the 24 December 2021 elections.  
On 9 September 2021, Abdullah Belhaiq, the spokesperson for HoR, publicly announced that the HoR passed the presidential elections law. On 4 October, he further announced that the HoR passed the parliamentary elections law. A number of parliamentarians and other politicians and officials claimed  both laws were invalid, citing the absence of a parliamentary vote, other procedural irregularities and violations of the roadmap endorsed by the LPDF.  
Khalifa Haftar leads the Libyan Arab Armed Forces (LAAF), an armed group which exercises effective control over large swaths of eastern and southern Libya, either directly or through allied armed groups. On 22 September 2021, Khalifa Haftar named Abdulrazek al-Nadoori as Commander of the LAAF temporarily until 24 December 2021.  According to an article of the aforementioned presidential elections law, all presidential candidates must vacate their official or military posts three months ahead of the elections. Khalifa Heftar was appointed to the then newly created position of Commander of the LAAF in March 2015 by the HoR.  
Armed groups and militias across Libya have been subjecting activists and human rights defenders to   
attacks including abductions and other unlawful deprivation of liberty, assassinations, surveillance, death threats and other intimidation. For instance, lawyer and activist Hanan al-Barasi was shot dead on 10 November 2020 in broad daylight in the street in Bengahzi, after she denounced corruption by the LAAF and criticized one of Khalifa Hafter’s sons. In 2021, several activists told Amnesty International that they were threatened by members of various militias and armed groups affiliated with either the GNU or the LAAF,due to their activism in connection to the scheduled elections. On 26 September 2021, unknown armed men abducted Emad al-Harati, head of the National Youth League, from his Tripoli office. He had publicly called for protests in support of holding the elections as scheduled on the day of his abduction, as well as three days prior.  
Amnesty International documented abductions between 2019 and 2021 by armed groups affiliated with the LAAF of residents of Ajadabiya and surrounding areas from the Magharba tribe, over their perceived affiliation to and support of Ibrahim Jadran, former leader of the Petroleum Facilities Guard, an armed group at odds with the LAAF. Former detainees told Amnesty International that they were subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, while in custody. According to Ajdabiya residents, in June 2021, armed men confiscated copies of a local newspaper that included a story on the abduction of Mansour Atti from various distribution places in the city.

Additional information  
 Steven Donziger is a US lawyer and environmental rights defender who has represented victims of oil dumping in an emblematic case against Chevron Corporation in Ecuador, following accusations that the corporation was responsible for what is widely considered one of the worst oil-related environmental disasters in recent history. He has been under pre-trial house arrest since August 2019 after he refused to comply with a court order to hand over his electronic devices, arguing that such a disclosure could compromise the confidentiality of the communications with his clients and put them at risk. The detention follows a long-running smear campaign of intimidation and harassment against Steven Donziger and other human rights defenders by Chevron.  
In September 2021, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that Steven Donziger’s deprivation of liberty is arbitrary because it lacks any legal basis and is in violation of several norms relating to the right to a fair trial, including the apparent lack of impartiality of the courts. Moreover, the Working Group concluded that his detention appears to be in retaliation for his work as a legal representative of Indigenous communities in Ecuador.  
Despite serious concerns over the lack of independence, objectivity and impartiality of the judge who ordered the pre-trial house arrest and who has overseen the trial over criminal contempt charges, Steven Donziger was sentenced on 1 October to the maximum penalty of 6 months in prison and denied the possibility to be released pending an appeal.  
Steven Donziger first began his work for environmental justice in 1993, when he visited Ecuador and became part of the legal team representing victims of oil dumping. In 2011, after years of judicial proceedings, a court in Ecuador found Chevron Corporation liable for causing serious environmental and health damage to the Amazon rainforest and the communities who lived there. The court determined that the corporation had deliberately discharged billions of gallons of oil waste onto Indigenous ancestral lands as a cost-saving measure and ordered to pay billions of dollars in damages.  
After losing the case in Ecuador, Chevron moved all its assets out of the country to avoid paying damages and threatened the Ecuadorian victims with “a lifetime of litigation” unless they dropped their case. Chevron then filed a lawsuit in the USA against all the plaintiffs named in the Ecuador lawsuit as well as Steven Donziger and other lawyers, nongovernmental organizations and a number of experts who supported their case.  
The judicial proceedings that followed since have been marred by flaws that have rendered Steven Donziger’s detention arbitrary, including a lack of impartiality by the courts, a disproportionate interference with his right to liberty imposed as a means of circumventing attorney/client privilege, and a deprivation of liberty that has continued beyond the maximum period foreseen by the charges laid against him.  
In 2019, the judge presiding over the civil case against Steven Donziger took the extraordinary decision to appoint a private law firm as special prosecutors over criminal contempt charges that the US Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York declined to pursue. On 6 August 2019, the judge presiding over the criminal contempt case ordered Steven Donziger to surrender his passport and submit to both GPS tracking and home confinement. Steven Donziger has been deprived of his liberty since then.   
The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is a group of independent experts appointed by the Human Rights Council mandated to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international standards. The opinions of the Working Group are authoritative decisions from a UN expert mechanism and carry legal weight. The obligations contained in the international treaties which form the basis for the Working Groups decision are legally binding upon states party. The United States has been a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1992.  
Strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP) suits are legal cases brought, or threatened to be brought, with the intention of silencing or intimidating public participation. SLAPP suits often target journalists, human rights defenders, civil society organizations, activists or academics with the aim of silencing them and deterring other critical voices. SLAPP suits are not necessarily aimed at protecting the honour or reputation of an individual or a corporation, but rather to intimidate, tire and deplete the financial and psychological resources of their target. The cost of fighting these legal actions can put extreme financial and other pressure on human rights activists forcing them to repurpose the already limited funds and resources from their work to defending the lawsuit. The litigation is often also successful in diverting the attention from the environmental or human rights issue to the legal defamation case itself.  
Steven Donziger has been under house arrest for over 800 days and there is a coalition of organizations advocating on his behalf.

Last November, leaders of the world’s 20 biggest economies held their annual G20 Summit online, with a focus on ensuring Covid-19 vaccines would be made available to everyone. However, one year on, the most powerful countries have failed to protect the lives of millions of people, choosing to hoard vaccines, resulting in a predictable and utterly devastating vaccine scarcity for the rest of the world. Rich countries are sitting on an estimated 500 million doses right now. 
Agnès Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said: 
“The rollout of vaccines began last December – bringing hope to a world that had been crippled by Covid-19 and saving millions of lives. However, since the first vaccine was administered, the death toll has risen from 1.3 million people to nearly 5 million in 2021 due to gross inequality in access. 
“The sheer selfishness and greed behind these deaths is unfathomable. While G20 countries enjoy vaccination rates of around 63%, only 10% of the population in low and lower-middle income countries have been able to get vaccinated. What have these leaders been doing for the past year but hoarding and actively contributing to vaccine scarcity along with Big Pharma? The millions of deaths show a staggering disregard for human life, a disturbing moral acceptance that profit trumps lives, and a blatant neglect of their global obligations.” 
In 2020, G20 countries pre-ordered and bought the vast majority of Covid-19 vaccines before these vaccines had even been approved. Many countries stockpiled enough doses to be able to vaccinate their populations several times over. In 2021, they continue to hoard surplus doses, preferring to sit on them, rather than share them with those who need them most. 
On 22 September 2021, Amnesty International launched a global campaign to demand that the World Health Organization’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population of low and lower-middle income countries is met by the end of the year. The 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines now! calls on governments with surplus stocks to redistribute these doses to other countries by the end of the year. 
“While some countries have pledged to redistribute vaccines, many still haven’t provided a clear timeline– with some only committing to share vaccines by September next year,” said Agnès Callamard. 
“Vaccines must be shared now. It’s in the best interests of everyone, especially if we want to ensure borders can reopen and our global economy can recover in a fair way. The clock is ticking. It’s time to take action now.” 
Leading up to the G20, Amnesty International, together with members of the Peoples Vaccine Alliance, will be calling on G20 leaders to redistribute vaccines now, upping the pressure with a media stunt expected to be held in Rome, Italy, on 29 October.

The local ‘section’ office will cease operations on 31 October while the regional office – which is part of Amnesty’s global International Secretariat – is due to close by the end of 2021. Regional operations will be moved to the organization’s other offices in the Asia-Pacific. 
“This decision, made with a heavy heart, has been driven by Hong Kong’s national security law, which has made it effectively impossible for human rights organizations in Hong Kong to work freely and without fear of serious reprisals from the government,” said Anjhula Mya Singh Bais, chair of Amnesty’s International Board. 
“Hong Kong has long been an ideal regional base for international civil society organizations, but the recent targeting of local human rights and trade union groups signals an intensification of the authorities’ campaign to rid the city of all dissenting voices. It is increasingly difficult for us to keep operating in such an unstable environment.” 
There are two Amnesty International offices based in Hong Kong: a local membership section focused on human rights education in the city; and a regional office which carries out research, advocacy and campaigning work on East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific. All of the regional office’s work will continue from new locations. 
“We are deeply indebted to Amnesty members and staff who over the last 40 years have worked tirelessly to protect human rights in and from Hong Kong. From successfully pushing for the full abolition of the death penalty in Hong Kong in 1993, to exposing evidence of excessive use of force by police during the 2019 mass protests, Amnesty in Hong Kong has shone a light on human rights violations in the darkest of days,” said Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“In the wider region, our research and campaigning has tackled subjects including freedom of expression in North Korea, conscientious objection to military service in South Korea, the right to housing in Mongolia, Japan’s wartime atrocities against “comfort women”, and the crackdown on human rights lawyers in China. 
“Moreover, Amnesty International Hong Kong’s education programmes – from classroom talks to a documentary film festival – have enhanced awareness of human rights not only in the city’s schools but among the general public as well. No one and no power can demolish that legacy.” 
The national security law, imposed by the Chinese central government, was enacted on 30 June 2020. It targets alleged acts of “secession”, “subversion of state power”, “terrorist activities” and “collusion with foreign or external forces to endanger national security”.  
Its sweeping and vaguely worded definition of “national security”, which follows that of the Beijing authorities, has been used arbitrarily as a pretext to restrict the human rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association, as well as to repress dissent and political opposition. 
Amnesty documented the rapid deterioration of human rights in Hong Kong one year after the enactment of the national security law in a June 2021 briefing. 
“The environment of repression and perpetual uncertainty created by the national security law makes it impossible to know what activities might lead to criminal sanctions. The law has repeatedly been used to target people who have upset the authorities for any number of reasons – from singing political songs to discussing human rights issues in the classroom,” said Anjhula Mya Singh Bais. 
“The pattern of raids, arrests and prosecutions against perceived opponents has highlighted how the vagueness of the law can be manipulated to build a case against whomsoever the authorities choose.” 
A government crackdown targeting activists, opposition politicians and independent media has recently expanded to include civil society organizations. At least 35 groups have disbanded since the law was enacted, including some of the city’s largest unions and activist groups. 
“There are difficult days ahead for human rights in Hong Kong, but Amnesty International will continue to stand with the people of Hong Kong. We will fight for their rights to be respected and we will be vigilant in our scrutiny of those who abuse them,” said Agnes Callamard. 
“While leaving the city that we have called home for decades is devastating, we do so proud of our achievements over that time, and confident that the strength of Amnesty’s 10 million-plus supporters worldwide will enable us to continue our work together to end human rights abuses everywhere.” 
Background 
Amnesty International is a global human rights movement of 10 million people, with operations in more than 70 countries. The organization holds governments around the world accountable to equal standards under international law.

Our campaign calls on states and pharmaceutical companies to share vaccines with low and lower-middle income countries, so that millions more people can be protected from Covid-19 in 2021. 
More than 1.2 billion additional people in low and lower-middle income countries could be vaccinated by the end of the year, if rich countries and vaccine makers agreed to redistribute more fairly. Are they up to the challenge? 
Background: Scandalous inequality 
An end to the Covid-19 pandemic is in sight. For almost a year now, we have had the safe and effective vaccines we need to finally bring this virus under control. 
But we won’t beat this pandemic until everyone has access to a vaccine. Not just people in rich countries, whose governments have struck deals with a handful of pharmaceutical companies – everyone. And right now, that moment is a long way off. 
As of late October, 63% of people in high-income countries are fully vaccinated. But elsewhere it’s a very different story: 
[* Source: Our World in Data. All figures as of 21 October 2021] 
The unequal global roll-out of Covid-19 vaccines is a stark reminder of how the pandemic has magnified existing inequalities. While Europe, the US and a handful of other states emerged from lockdowns in the summer of 2021, parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America were plunged into renewed crises. 
Meanwhile, the threat of new variants, which spread more easily among unvaccinated populations, remains. If we continue down our current path, the end of the pandemic will remain a glimmer on the horizon. 
Who is responsible? 
This shameful inequality, which is stalling our progress against Covid-19, was not inevitable. It is a manufactured crisis, brought about by the decisions key pharmaceutical companies and wealthy governments have made. There are enough vaccines to go round – but they’re not being shared. 
Despite receiving billions of dollars in government funding, most pharmaceutical companies have insisted on maintaining control over production, which stunts the global supply of vaccines. 
By refusing to waive intellectual property rights or share their technologies, most western vaccine developers have blocked other companies from manufacturing much-needed doses. 
Intellectual property rights also mean companies can set the price of vaccines. Unsurprisingly, many have chosen to sell them at sky-high prices, mostly to wealthier countries. 
Hoarding 
Since the very beginning of the pandemic, wealthy states have been hoarding vaccines by buying up almost all the world’s supplies. Many now have a significant surplus of doses. 
A conservative estimate by data science company Airfinity found that by the end of September 2021, wealthier states had more than 500 million excess vaccine doses in stock. 
This includes: 
These stockpiled doses are gathering dust while millions of at-risk people worldwide remain unprotected against Covid-19. 
We can still fix this! 
In July, a task force led by the World Health Organization (WHO) set a target to vaccinate 40% of people in every country by the end of 2021. But so far, less than 10% of people in low and lower-middle income countries are fully vaccinated. 
On 21 September Amnesty International launched the 100 Day Countdown,  calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to take urgent action to meet that lifesaving target. 
We calculated that if 2 billion vaccines were delivered to 82 low- and lower-middle income countries, an additional 1.2 billion people could be fully vaccinated by the end of 2021. That’s the number of vaccinations needed in for the WHO to meet its 40% target in these countries. 
Airfinity estimates that between 100,000 and 225,000 lives can be saved for every 100 million doses delivered – meaning that meeting this target could save at least 2 million lives. 
Amnesty found that this could be achieved if: 
The World Health Organization and the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights have expressed strong support for the 100 Day Countdown. You can sign the petition here. 
Is this realistic? 
Our analysis showed that there are enough vaccines available to meet the 40% target, if states redistribute surplus doses, and companies prioritise deliveries to COVAX, the African Union and other mechanisms benefiting lower-income countries. 
Many lower-middle income countries have already given one dose to over 20% of their populations – showing that systems are already in place in these countries. Others may need additional resources, support and time to be able to implement vaccine rollouts effectively – so it is also crucial that assistance is provided to ensure effective distribution systems. 
What about people in wealthy countries who haven’t been vaccinated yet? 
Given the high vaccination rates in higher-income countries, and the fact they have ordered many times more vaccines than required, redistributing doses should have no significant impact on vaccine access in these countries. 
Countries with surplus vaccines have already inoculated the most at-risk people in their populations. Many are now giving booster jabs to these groups, and offering the vaccine to teenagers and schoolchildren. Meanwhile, in other countries, health workers, older people and those with serious health conditions are still waiting. 
How much have pharma companies done to deliver vaccines more fairly? 
WHO has set up a number of initiatives to encourage technology sharing and boost supply, but pharma companies have refused to join. 
In June, WHO established the mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub in South Africa, so that African manufacturers can make mRNA vaccines like Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s. But these companies have refused to participate – despite knowing full well that doing so could save tens of thousands of lives. 
Nor have any of these companies joined the Covid-19 Technology Access Pool (CTAP), established to support the sharing of open and non-exclusive licences. They have also lobbied aggressively against proposals to temporarily lift intellectual property rights, such as the WTO TRIPS Waiver proposed by India and South Africa. 
Amnesty International launched a report in September 2021 about vaccine inequality. Among our key findings: 
We need to end vaccine inequality now 
Redistributing vaccines will save countless lives lives. It will make all of us safer, because global vaccination will reduce the likelihood of dangerous variants developing. The longer we wait, the more time the virus has to mutate. 
States and pharma companies hold millions of lives in their hands. With enough pressure we can ensure they respect everyone’s human rights, no matter where they live. 
There is no more time to waste. No one should spend another year living without access to these life-saving vaccines.

The designation, made pursuant to a 2016 Israeli statute, effectively outlaws the activities of these civil society groups. It authorizes Israeli authorities to close their offices, seize their assets and arrest and jail their staff members, and it prohibits funding or even publicly expressing support for their activities. 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, who work closely with many of these groups, said in a joint statement: 
“This appalling and unjust decision is an attack by the Israeli government on the international human rights movement. For decades, Israeli authorities have systematically sought to muzzle human rights monitoring and punish those who criticize its repressive rule over Palestinians. While staff members of our organizations have faced deportation and travel bans, Palestinian human rights defenders have always borne the brunt of the repression. This decision is an alarming escalation that threatens to shut down the work of Palestine’s most prominent civil society organizations. The decades-long failure of the international community to challenge grave Israeli human rights abuses and impose meaningful consequences for them has emboldened Israeli authorities to act in this brazen manner. 
How the international community responds will be a true test of its resolve to protect human rights defenders. We are proud to work with our Palestinian partners and have been doing so for decades. They represent the best of global civil society. We stand with them in challenging this outrageous decision.”

Most people would probably be shocked to learn that every year, Canada locks up hundreds of migrants and refugee claimants in maximum-security jails. Even more shocking is that Canada jails these newcomers under immigration law – without a trial or even a charge – minus any of the due process that those accused of crimes receive. There are no time limits: detention can occur indefinitely. 
Canadian law allows authorities to detain newcomers on immigration-related grounds – for example, if they are unsure as to the person’s identity, or if they believe the person is inadmissible, poses a danger, or is unlikely to appear for immigration proceedings – in facilities designed for criminal punishment. For decades, this has occurred in overcrowded facilities, where immigration detainees are co-mingled with prison populations, receive inadequate health care and have little to no contact with the outside world. Racialized people and those with mental-health conditions are habitually incarcerated for longer periods of time and endure harsher conditions of confinement when compared with other detainees. Many languish in lockdowns and solitary confinement, with no end in sight. All are routinely dismissed, degraded and demeaned, as chronicled by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International in a recent report. 
The problems of immigration detention have received intense critical scrutiny for years – detainees have launched protests and hunger strikes, advocates have launched law reform campaigns, and lawyers have launched lawsuits. In 2016, after a series of deaths in detention, the federal government declared that it “can and must do better” and launched the National Immigration Detention Framework, a five-year, $138-million undertaking designed to create a “better, fairer immigration detention system that supports the humane and dignified treatment” of detainees. Despite this initiative now coming to a close, not enough has changed. 
In fact, one of the most egregious, most inhumane practices of immigration detention – holding migrants and refugee claimants in correctional facilities – has only intensified. Between April and September, 2020, for example, while the number of immigration detainees decreased, the portion of detainees held in provincial jails jumped from roughly 20 to 50 per cent. In the same period, the average length of detention also increased significantly – more than doubling when compared with before the pandemic. This means that authorities now rely as heavily on jails as on immigration holding centres to house immigration detainees. 
Studies confirm that immigration detention causes serious harm: anxiety, depression, despair, psychological distress, psychosis, catatonic withdrawal, self-harm and suicidal ideation. The mental-health impacts of detention are so severe that even a short stint can be devastating to the mind and cause long-term – and sometimes permanent – damage. Detainees experience these harms no matter where they are held, but the research has long confirmed that detainees are affected most acutely when they are held in jails. 
How can a country like Canada, one that prides itself on its commitment to human rights and refugee protection, continue to engage in such violations? One explanation is that year after year, each of the entities involved in immigration detention has passed the buck to another. The federal government has passed the buck to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), which is tasked with enforcing immigration detention. The CBSA, in turn, has passed the buck to the provinces, by entering into memoranda of understanding or informal arrangements with the provinces that authorize immigration detention in provincial jails. As a result of these agreements, the CBSA maintains, it has “limited control over detention conditions” in provincial jails, and is unable to intervene in their operations. 
But what about the provinces? In a new campaign, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have turned the spotlight on their role. The groups are calling on provincial premiers and corrections ministers to cancel all existing arrangements with the CBSA that authorize detaining migrants and refugee claimants in jails. The groups make clear that by maintaining these agreements, the provinces are complicit in continuing human-rights violations. 
And they are right. Five years after launching its reform initiative, and despite the promise to “do better,” the federal government has allowed the most pernicious and violent aspects of immigration detention to thrive. But the success of some recent reforms show that change is possible. It is time for authorities to stop abdicating responsibility. The provinces can and must take the lead and end the devastating practice of detaining migrants and refugee claimants in jails once and for all.

In an advocacy briefing, the organization highlights how neighbouring countries have closed their borders to Afghans without travel documents, leaving many with no choice but to make irregular crossings. Instead of granting protection to people who arrive on their territory in this way – as required by international law – countries across Europe and Central Asia have subjected Afghans to illegal pushbacks, detention and deportation.   
Download the briefing 
Amnesty International is calling on all countries to live up to their obligation to protect people at risk of serious human rights violations, by immediately ending all returns or deportations to Afghanistan and ensuring access to fair asylum procedures. They should also urgently take steps to secure safe passage for Afghans who are in danger of being targeted by the Taliban, including by minimizing requirements for travel documentation and offering humanitarian visas to those most at risk.  
“Trying to get out of Afghanistan right now is like an obstacle course. Since the Taliban takeover it has been near-impossible to obtain travel documents, forcing many Afghans to make irregular journeys which result in punitive treatment by other governments. Instead of finding safety and protection, Afghans who fled the Taliban end up trapped in makeshift camps at border zones, or detained while they await deportation to an uncertain fate,” said Francesca Pizzutelli, Head of Amnesty International’s Refugees and Migrants’ Rights Team.  
“We urge all countries to open their borders to Afghans seeking refuge, and to establish targeted resettlement schemes to bring the most at-risk to safety. Governments must offer international protection to new arrivals and to Afghans who are already on their territories, mindful of the international prohibition on non-refoulement.”  
Borders closed  
Amnesty’s briefing highlights how Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have all closed their borders to Afghans travelling without documents, despite the risk that returning people will put them at risk of serious human rights violations by the Taliban. IOM figures show that Iranian authorities deported 58,279 undocumented Afghans between 27 August and 9 September 2021, while Uzbekistan said on August 20 that it had returned 150 people to Afghanistan, based on an agreement with the Taliban.   
The international imperative to keep borders open for those seeking refuge, and the obligation on non-refoulement, does not just apply to countries which share a land border with Afghanistan. It also applies to countries that Afghans can reach via air or sea, or after journeys through other countries. In other words, it disregards any distinction between regular and irregular arrivals.   
Despite this, countries including Bulgaria, Croatia and Greece have continued to carry out pushbacks against Afghans, while Poland has introduced new restrictions which will make it impossible for people crossing the border irregularly to claim asylum in Poland.  
One group of 32 Afghans has been stranded on the Poland-Belarus border since 19 August, after they were moved from Poland to Belarus in a suspected pushback, without any individual assessment of their protection needs. Polish and Belarusian border guards have kept the group trapped in a small strip on the border, without adequate shelter, clean water, food or access to health care.  
Meanwhile, in July 2021, as arrivals from Afghanistan increased, Turkish authorities announced the extension of a wall with its border with Iran, and Turkey continues to round up undocumented Afghans in preparation for deportation.   
Amnesty also highlighted the impact of security clearance processes on Afghans seeking refuge. For example, Germany requires Afghans to present themselves to German authorities for security checks before they can be considered for evacuation – but there is currently no diplomatic representation in Afghanistan. In the US, the Biden administration has stated the intention to resettle 95,000 Afghan evacuees by the end of September 2022. However, questions remain about the treatment of Afghan evacuees in US military bases, and the detention and transfer to third countries of Afghan evacuees who have not cleared stringent US security checks.  
While Afghanistan’s human rights situation continues to deteriorate, all countries must take immediate measures to enable exit from Afghanistan, in particular for women activists, human rights defenders, journalists, and people from marginalized ethnic or religious minorities. They must offer international protection both to new arrivals and to those Afghans who are already on their territories, and support countries in the region to guarantee the rights of Afghans who travel there.  
“The lives of thousands of women and men who had worked to promote and defend human rights, gender equality, rule of law and democratic freedoms in their country are now hanging by a thread,” said Francesca Pizzutelli.  
“The world must not abandon Afghanistan at this critical moment – we need a concerted international effort to bring Afghans to safety.”

0,Nigeria: No justice for victims of police brutality one year after #EndSARS Protests,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/nigeria-no-justice-for-victims-of-police-brutality-one-year-after-endsars-protests/,"Despite promises of reform police impunity goes on  Investigation panels dashing victims’ hope of getting justice  Pro-government mobs used to instigate violence  One year after peaceful #EndSARS protests ended in a brutal crackdown by Nigerian security forces in Abuja, Lagos and...","One year after peaceful #EndSARS protests ended in a brutal crackdown by Nigerian security forces in Abuja, Lagos and other parts of the country, no one has been brought to justice for the torture, violence, and killings of peaceful protesters, while reports of human rights violations by the police continue, Amnesty International said today.  
An investigation by the organization found that Nigerian army and police killed at least 12 people on 20 October 2020 at Lekki toll gate and Alausa in Lagos. Amnesty International was able to establish that pro-government supporters instigated violence at many of the demonstrations, providing cover for the police to use lethal force against peaceful protesters. The organization also found that detained protesters were tortured and refused or denied immediate access to lawyers.   
A year on, despite the gravity of these human rights violations, not a single member of the security forces has been prosecuted while judicial panels of inquiry set up to investigate abuses by officers have made little progress.  
“President Muhammadu Buhari must fulfill his promise of reforming the police to end the reign of impunity Nigerians have been protesting against for many years. Failure to bring to justice those suspected to be responsible for the torture and killings of #EndSARS protesters on 20 October 2020 is yet another indication that Nigerian authorities lack the political will to ensure accountability for these atrocities, and end police brutality,” said Osai Ojigho, Director of Amnesty International Nigeria.   
“Under the pretext of restoring order, horrific injuries were inflicted on hundreds of people and at least 56 people were killed, among them dozens of young people lost their lives as Nigerian security forces used unnecessary and excessive force to disperse peaceful protesters across the country. It is unacceptable that despite overwhelming evidence, the government continues to deny the use of live ammunition on protesters at Lekki toll gate exactly a year ago.”   
Amnesty International had documented incidents at Lekki Toll Gate Lagos and other parts of Nigeria, showing the violent response of the Nigerian security forces to peaceful protests. The clear aim of the crackdown was to instill fear, discourage peaceful protests and punish those demanding an end to widespread human rights violations by the police.   
Use of pro-government supporters to whip up violence  
While most of the #EndSARS protesters were peaceful, there was violence, mostly instigated by pro-government supporters.  
After reviewing videos and photos of the protest sites, Amnesty international found that in nearly 21 incidents where violence occurred between peaceful protesters and pro-government supporters, security forces not only failed to take preventive measures to avoid peaceful assemblies from being disrupted, but they also failed to protect protesters from violent attacks.    
“In many instances, the police and other security agents watched as apparently government-backed armed thugs attacked peaceful protesters. In some cases, these thugs were brought to the protest sites in government vehicles. On at least two occasions, these attacks resulted in the death of protesters,” said Osai Ojigho.  
Excessive use of force  
Almost every person arrested during the protests described being beaten with the butt of a gun, whips and fists during their arrests. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 12 journalists were attacked during the #EndSARS protests by security forces and unidentified perpetrators.  
Many of those detained interviewed by Amnesty International said that they were tortured while in detention. In many cases, police abuse continued in detention, in police stations and other holding facilities, and on the way to detention, in police vehicles. Several such cases amount to torture and other ill-treatment.   
Delayed or no access to legal counsel  
Amnesty International also documented numerous cases in which police denied or delayed access to lawyers and medical care to detainees. This was despite repeated requests from detainees to see or call a lawyer – and repeated requests from lawyers at places of detention to have access to the detainees. Several lawyers and human right defenders said they spent days moving from one police station to another trying to find out where those who had been arrested were being held.   
One person arrested during a protest on 18 October 2020 and held at Lagos state Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Panti, said he repeatedly asked to call a lawyer. He was told by a police officer to shut up. While in detention, he was denied access to a lawyer who had come to see him and was unable to meet with a lawyer until a week after being arrested.  
Providing timely access to lawyers is an important safeguard for many human rights, such as the right to a fair trial and ensuring the detainee’s rights are respected in custody, including the right to access medical care when needed, as well as protection from coerced confessions and torture and other ill-treatment.  
Investigative panels set up to look into police brutality have so far been marred by prolonged adjournments, intimidation of witnesses by police lawyers and the failure of police officers to appear as witnesses, according to observer reports verified by Amnesty International. Panels have failed to sit in some states, and in others have gone on an indefinite break.  
“What we observed at these panels is discouraging and clearly shows there is no real commitment to ensuring justice for victims of police violence across Nigeria. These panels raised hopes of getting justice but in some states, this is quickly vanishing,” said Osai Ojigho  
Amnesty International is calling on Nigerian authorities to put words into action and decisively end police impunity. Use of pro-government thugs to violently disperse and undermine peaceful #EndSARS protests must be thoroughly, independently, impartially, and transparently investigated and suspected perpetrators brought to justice in fair trials.   
Nigerians must not be denied the constitutionally and internationally guaranteed right to peaceful protest. All those detained or missing since the #EndSARS protests must be immediately released or reunited with their families. Nigerian authorities must ensure access of victims and their families to effective remedies, including adequate compensation, restitution, and guarantee of non-repetition.   
“The #EndSARS movement was met with the same use of excessive force by the police it was set to fight against. It is time for the authorities to ensure accountability and end impunity for police violence in Nigeria,” said Osai Ojigho  
BACKGROUND  
The #EndSARS protest was a nationwide protest demanding an end to police impunity in Nigeria. On 3 October 2020, a video went viral showing SARS officers dragging two men from a hotel and shooting one of them outside. A few days later, protests erupted across Nigeria. On 11 October, SARS is disbanded. But it was the fifth time since 2015 that the Nigerian authorities pledged to reform the police and disband SARS. Protests continued demanding more than empty promises. On 20 October, the Nigerian army and police violently repressed peaceful protests and killed at least 12 people at Lekki toll gate and Alausa in Lagos.

Silenced and Misinformed: Freedom of Expression in Danger During Covid-19 reveals how governments’ and authorities’ reliance on censorship and punishment throughout the crisis has reduced the quality of information reaching people. The pandemic has provided a dangerous situation where governments are using new legislation to shut down independent reporting, as well as attack people who have been directly critical or even attempted to look into their government’s response to Covid-19. 
Read the report 
“Throughout the pandemic, governments have launched an unprecedented attack on freedom of expression, severely curtailing peoples’ rights. Communication channels have been targeted, social media has been censored, and media outlets have been closed down – having a dire impact of the public’s ability to access vital information about how to deal with Covid-19,” said Amnesty International’s senior director for research advocacy and policy, Rajat Khosla. 
“In the midst of a pandemic, journalists and health professionals have been silenced and imprisoned. As a result, people have been unable to access information about Covid-19, including how to protect themselves and their communities. Approximately five million people have lost their lives to Covid-19 and lack of information will have likely been a contributory factor.”  
The government of China has a long history of controlling freedom of expression. During the early days of the pandemic, health workers and professional and citizen journalists attempted to raise the alarm as early as December 2019. However, they were targeted by the government for reporting on the outbreak of what was then an unknown disease. By February 2020, 5,511 criminal investigations had been opened against individuals who published information about the outbreak for “fabricating and deliberately disseminating false and harmful information”. 
In one harrowing case, citizen journalist Zhang Zhan travelled to Wuhan in February 2020 to report on the Covid-19 outbreak. She went missing in May 2020 in Wuhan. It was later revealed that she was detained by police, charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” and sentenced to four years’ imprisonment. 
Numerous other countries have put in place oppressive laws, restricting the right to freedom of expression and silencing critics under the guise or in the context of the pandemic, including Tanzania, Russia and Nicaragua.  
Over the past few years, the Tanzanian government has introduced a raft of laws and used them to silence journalists, human rights defenders and members of the political opposition. Under former President Magufuli’s administration, the Tanzanian government took a denialist stance on COVID-19. From March to May 2020, authorities used laws prohibiting and criminalizing “false news” and other measures to restrict media coverage of the government’s handling of Covid-19. 
While initially trying to downplay the impact of the pandemic and intimidate those raising concerns, the Nicaraguan authorities used Covid-19 to introduce the “Special Law on Cybercrimes” in October 2020. In practice, it enables authorities to punish those who criticize government policies and gives them ample discretion to repress freedom of expression. 
In April 2020, Russia expanded its existing anti-“fake news” legislation and introduced criminal penalties for “public dissemination of knowingly false information” in the context of emergencies. Although the amendments have been described as part of the authorities’ response to Covid-19, these measures will remain in force beyond the pandemic. 
“It’s clear Covid-19 related restrictions on freedom of expression are not just time-bound, extraordinary measures to deal with a temporary crisis. They are part of an onslaught on human rights that has been taking place globally in the last few years – and governments have found another excuse to ramp up their attack on civil society,” said Rajat Khosla. 
“Restricting freedom of expression is dangerous and must not become the new normal. Governments must urgently lift such restrictions and guarantee the free flow of information to protect the public’s right to health.” 
Amnesty’s report highlights the role of social media companies in facilitating the rapid spread of misinformation around Covid-19.  This is because platforms are designed to amplify attention-grabbing content to engage users and have not done enough due diligence to prevent the spread of false and misleading information. 
The onslaught of misinformation – whether that be through social media companies or people in a position of power seeking to spread division and confusion for their own gain – is posing a serious threat to the rights to freedom of expression and to health. It is making it increasingly difficult for individuals to have a fully informed opinion and make educated choices about their health based on the best available scientific facts. A variety of sources is key, as is the ability to challenge and debate available information. 
“As we are urging governments and pharmaceutical companies to ensure vaccines are distributed and made available to everyone around the world, states and social media companies must also ensure the public has unfettered access to accurate, evidence-based and timely information. This is a crucial step to minimize vaccine hesitancy driven by misinformation,” said Rajat Khosla. 
“So far, 6.6 billion* doses have been administered globally, yet only 2.5% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose.  With less than 75 days left until the end of the year, we’re calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to drastically change course and to do everything needed to deliver two billion vaccines to low and lower-middle income countries starting now – but they need safe, reliable information to help inform their decisions.” 
Amnesty International is calling on states to stop using the pandemic as an excuse to silence independent reporting, lift all undue restrictions on the right to freedom of expression and provide credible, reliable, accessible information so the public can be fully informed about the pandemic. Censorship does not help in dealing with misinformation: free and independent media and strong civil society do. 
States must overhaul the destructive business model of Big Tech – one of the root causes of the spread of mis/disinformation online. Social media companies must also stop hiding their heads in the sand and take measures to address the viral spread of misinformation, including by ensuring their business models do not endanger human rights. 
Amnesty International launched a new campaign, 100 Day Countdown: 2 billion Covid-19 vaccines now! on 22 September 2021. The organization is calling on states and pharmaceutical companies to deliver 2 billion vaccines to those who need it now, to ensure that the World Health Organization’s target of vaccinating 40% of the population of low and lower-middle income countries by the end of the year is met.

Sometimes there seems to be so much wrong in the world, the idea of changing it for the better feels impossible. But as Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign shows, you can make a big difference by doing something ‘little’. 
Writing a letter, sending a Tweet, signing a petition. Surely you can’t change the world with something so simple? Yes, you can! 
In 2020, millions of people, just like you, changed the lives of 10 people whose human rights had been stripped from them. Taking just a little bit of time to send a Tweet or write a letter has made the world of difference to the people we supported through the campaign in 2020. Here are some of their stories. 
JAILED ACTIVIST FREED IN SAUDI ARABIA  
Nassima al-Sada (AFP via Getty Images) 
Nassima al-Sada, a campaigner for women’s freedom, walked free from jail in June 2021. Nassima had been arrested in 2018 for peacefully defending human rights. While imprisoned the guards beat her and banned anyone from visiting – even her lawyer. Supporters worldwide wrote a massive 777,611 letters, tweets and more. Nassima’s son, Mousa al-Sada, feels that international attention on his mother helped push her case to a verdict, after years of stagnation and aided in securing her release. Nassima is still subject to a travel ban, meaning she cannot leave Saudi Arabia for five years – Amnesty supporters will continue to fight for Nassima’s full freedom. 
FATHER OF THREE TO BE REUNITED WITH FAMILY 
Germain Rukuki 
On 30 June 2021 NGO worker and human rights defender Germain Rukuki was released from prison after being found guilty of a slew of sham charges and sentenced to 32 years in prison in Burundi. He was jailed before getting a chance to hold his youngest child, born just weeks after he was taken in July 2017. His family fled the country for fear of reprisals. Germain will soon be reunited with his family, after more than 400,000 actions calling for his release.  
ONE STEP CLOSER TO JUSTICE IN SOUTH AFRICA 
Popi’s mother and sister call for justice, as they deliver a petition of over 300,000 signatures from Amnesty supporters worldwide. 
The families of murdered best friends Popi Qwabe and Bongeka Phungula finally have reason to believe that justice for their loved ones is on the horizon. Until recently, Popi and Bongeka’s friends and families had been distressed and angered by irregularities and delays in the police investigation into their 2017 murders. However, in March 2021, police revived the case after receiving 341,106 petition signatures from supporters worldwide. The police have now completed their investigation and handed over the case to the country’s National Prosecuting Authority. “I feel optimistic,” said Popi’s sister Thembelihle. “I feel like finally, something is about to change.” 
JAILED ALGERIAN JOURNALIST RELEASED       
Khaled Drareni 
Khaled Drareni spent 11 months in jail and became a symbol for much needed press freedom in Algeria. In March 2020, Khaled was arrested while covering a peaceful demonstration. He was charged with inciting an unarmed gathering and harming the integrity of the national territory and sentenced to three years in prison – all for simply doing his job as a journalist. Following continuous attention from the campaign, and mass mobilisation by activists, Khaled was released on 19 February 2021. Khaled is still facing charges. We will not stop until these charges are dropped. 
PRIDE DEFENDERS ACQUITTED IN TURKEY 
Melike Balkan and Özgür Gür, two of the nineteen defendants who have spent more than two-and-a-half years awaiting trial for organizing a Pride at the Middle Eastern Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey, were finally acquitted on October 8, 2021. The defendants – 18 students and one member of the University’s academic staff – had been facing up to three years in prison for organizing a Pride against an order of the University’s rector. 
445,000 people from around the world demanded their acquittal during Write for Rights, including more than 11,000 people in Canada who sent letters, emails and texts.

While male students nationwide were allowed to return to secondary...","Girls in Afghanistan must be allowed to return to secondary school and continue their education, Amnesty International said today as it published new testimonies from pupils and teachers documenting Taliban threats and violence. 
While male students nationwide were allowed to return to secondary school on 17 September, the Taliban insisted that a “safe learning environment” was required before girls could return. 
However, in more than 20 new interviews, students, teachers and school administrators told Amnesty International that intimidation and harassment by the Taliban are causing school attendance rates to remain low at all levels, particularly for girls. 
“At present, girls in Afghanistan are effectively barred from returning to secondary school. Across the country, the rights and aspirations of an entire generation of girls are dismissed and crushed,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“The right to education is a fundamental human right, which the Taliban – as the de facto authorities running the country – are duty-bound to uphold. The policies currently pursued by the Taliban are discriminatory, unjust and violate international law. 
“The Taliban should immediately re-open all secondary schools to girls, put a stop to all harassment, threats and attacks against teachers and students, and cease any military use of schools in Afghanistan.” 
Amnesty International is also calling on the international community to ensure appropriate funding for Afghanistan’s education sector to enable schools to continue functioning, through organizations such as the UN or NGOs. Failure to do so could potentially deny millions of Afghan students the right to education.     
‘Education is not a crime’ 
To date – while some secondary schools have allowed girls to return, including in Kabul city and in provinces such as Kunduz, Balkh and Sar-e Pul – the vast majority of secondary schools across Afghanistan remain closed for girls. 
Asma*, a 14-year-old student in Kabul, told Amnesty International: “Will I be able to go to school or not? This is my biggest concern. I want to learn everything, from the easiest to the hardest subjects. I want to be an astronaut, or an engineer or architect… This is my dream… Education is not a crime. If the Taliban announce that getting an education is a crime, then we will commit this crime. We will not give up.” 
Mariam*, a 17-year-old student in Badakhshan, said: “When I first heard they would close high schools, I felt we were going backward instead of forward. We had so many hopes and dreams, and now they are gone. I want to study medicine and become a doctor. I was ready to take the entrance exam for university. I feel like I am paralyzed right now. I can’t think of the future.” 
Several female secondary school students said they had lost their motivation to study because the Taliban seem likely to allow them to work only in a few, specific fields, such as education or healthcare. 
Khalida*, a 16-year-old student in Kabul, said: “What will we do with an education, if we cannot fulfil our passions? I want to be a politician… I don’t want to graduate and sit at home… Girls like me, we want to be leaders… We can be anything, and they are not letting us.” 
Falling attendance rates 
Teachers, students and activists across Afghanistan told Amnesty International that primary school attendance rates have dropped significantly in many areas, particularly for girls. Many families remain fearful of the Taliban, and are too nervous to send their children to school, particularly girls. 
Zeenat*, a teacher in Samangan province, said: “There is no trust in the community… Parents think if they send their daughters to school, they could be beaten by the Taliban.” 
The severe economic situation has forced many families to take their children out of school and send them to work. Millions of Afghans have been internally displaced during and following the Taliban’s takeover of the country, and many displaced children are not attending school. 
Interviewees also said there are widespread absences among teachers, largely due to the Taliban’s failure to pay their salaries. This has led many primary schools either to run at reduced capacity, or to close entirely. 
At the tertiary level, students reported that while some universities have re-opened, attendance rates have dropped, particularly for young women. 
Wadan*, a 21-year-old medical student in Kabul, said: “There were 20 girls in my class [before the Taliban’s takeover]. Now there are just six girls… The Taliban introduced new rules… No-one knows what will happen in the next few hours, let alone days. Parents won’t give permission for their daughters to go to university in this situation.” 
Taliban harassment of teachers and military use of schools 
Pashtana*, a high school teacher, told Amnesty International she received death threats from the Taliban and had been called to the local court for prosecution due to her prior teaching of co-educational sports. 
She received a letter from Taliban members earlier this year, and explained: “It said, ‘If the Taliban catch you, they will cut your ears off, and this will be a lesson for others in [your] province’. Now I am in hiding. Even my family thinks I am out of the country.” 
Efat*, a 22-year-old woman, and Naveed*, her 16-year-old brother, said they were beaten unconscious by two Taliban members on 18 August. They said they were attacked while going to an English class, which the Taliban members called “the language of infidels”. 
Another secondary school teacher said the Taliban had subjected her to harassment and intimidation, in retaliation for a media interview in which she complained about teacher salaries and girls’ access to secondary education. She added that she and several other teachers were threatened with eviction from their homes, which the previous government had provided. 
For security reasons and fear of reprisal attacks, the precise locations of these incidents have been omitted. Amnesty International has not yet established whether these incidents represent a broader pattern of abuse by Taliban members against students and teachers, but will continue to monitor such reports. 
Witnesses also told Amnesty International that the Taliban used four schools for military purposes during fighting prior to their takeover of the country: Tughani High School and Khetib Zada High School in Sar-e Pul city, Zakhail e Khondon High School in Kunduz city, and Alishing High School in Alishing district in Laghman province. Such use of schools places them at risk of attack, and is likely to make it extremely difficult to deliver an adequate education. These acts are also contrary to the global Safe Schools Declaration, which the Afghan government endorsed in 2015. 
Methodology 
From 16 September to 8 October 2021, Amnesty International conducted telephone interviews with 11 teachers and school administrators and 10 students – ranging from ages 14 to 22 – in provinces across Afghanistan, including Badakhshan, Farah, Helmand, Kabul, Kandahar, Laghman, Nangahar, Samangan and Sar-e Pul. 
Amnesty International also interviewed 12 local activists, representatives of NGOs and the United Nations, and other experts on education in Afghanistan. 
Amnesty International attempted to contact Taliban officials on 6 and 12 October, but had received no reply by the time of publication.

Additional Information  
Alem Tesfay Abraham and Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi fled Eritrea to escape indefinite military conscription, which is one of the main drivers compelling people to flee Eritrea. According to a 2016 Amnesty International report, deserters are likely to face prolonged arbitrary detention, inhumane detention conditions and torture and other-ill-treatment. Furthermore, in 2015, the UN Human Rights Council Commission of Inquiry on human rights in Eritrea found that “with a few exceptions, those who have been forced to return to the country have been arrested, detained and subjected to ill-treatment and torture”.  
On 9 September, prison officials forced them to undergo Covid-19 PCR tests at a hospital outside the prison and to sign documents in Arabic that they were unable to read, before informing them about plans to deport them without specifying a date. Security forces arrested 42-year-old Alem Tesfay Abraham at the Salloum border crossing with Libya on 10 March 2012, while 37-year-old Kibrom Adhanom Okbazghi was arrested on 30 December 2013 in North Sinai Governorate. According to their lawyer, they have not been charged with any criminal offence since and have been repeatedly pressured to “voluntarily” return to Eritrea by officials at the migration department of the interior ministry. The two men have refused and have repeatedly requested to register for protection with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  
On 23 July 2020, three UN independent experts wrote to the Egyptian government raising concerns about the two men’s prolonged arbitrary detention and denial of the right to seek asylum. According to a refugee rights activist, shortly after this communication, prison officials verbally and physically assaulted the two men, and threatened to deport them. Going ahead with plans to deport them would violate the principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits returning anyone to a place where they would be at real risk of torture and other serious human rights violations.  
Egyptian security forces routinely arbitrarily arrest and detain refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants in an irregular situation. As a state party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1969 Organization of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Egyptian authorities are obligated to respect the principle of non-refoulement.

0,Canada: Stop Incarcerating Immigration Detainees in Provincial Jails,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/canada-stop-incarcerating-immigration-detainees-in-provincial-jails/,"National Campaign Urges Provinces to Cancel Contracts Enabling Abuses(Ottawa, October 14, 2021) – Provincial governments should sever their contracts to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, where many experience abusive conditions, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said...","National Campaign Urges Provinces to Cancel Contracts Enabling Abuses(Ottawa, October 14, 2021) – Provincial governments should sever their contracts to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, where many experience abusive conditions, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today in opening a joint national campaign, #WelcomeToCanada. While Canadian authorities have released significant numbers of people from immigration detention since the onset of Covid-19 in March 2020, the proportion of those in provincial jails rather than immigration holding centers more than doubled in the six months following the onset of the pandemic.Provincial jails in Canada are designed to hold people awaiting criminal court proceedings or serving criminal sentences of up to two years. Immigration detainees held in these jails – many of which are maximum-security facilities – are not only confined in more restrictive settings than those held in immigration holding centers, but they are also more likely to be detained for longer periods of time. “By allowing the federal government to transfer immigration detainees to provincial jails, where they may remain with no end in sight, provincial authorities are implicated in Ottawa’s human rights abuses,” said Samer Muscati, associate disability rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The provincial governments have a real opportunity to show leadership by walking away from these contracts that allow serious violations to happen in their own backyards.”According to government statistics, in the three-year period between April 2017 and March 2020, about a fifth of immigration detainees were held in 78 provincial jails across Canada. In the six months following the onset of the pandemic, between April and September 2020, 50 percent of immigration detainees were held in provincial jails. The average length of detention more than doubled, to 29 days compared with the same period the previous year, and at least 85 people were held for 100 days or longer.“I was arrested without charge and my belongings were taken, including the batteries for my hearing aid,” Abdelrahman Elmady, an Egyptian man with a hearing disability said in one of the campaign videos released on October 14, 2021. He described his detention in three provincial jails in British Columbia after fleeing to Canada to seek asylum. “My whole life I have relied on hearing aids, but suddenly I was in prison, confused, scared, and unable to hear anything. Nobody told me how long I would be detained.”In their recent report, “‘I Didn’t Feel Like a Human in There’: Immigration Detention in Canada and Its Impact on Mental Health,” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International documented the serious human rights violations that people face in immigration detention in Canada. Immigration detainees include people who are fleeing persecution, seeking a better life, and some who have lived in Canada since childhood.Immigration detainees are not held on criminal charges or convictions, but many experience some of the country’s most restrictive confinement conditions, including maximum-security provincial jails and solitary confinement. Immigration detainees are handcuffed, shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world. In provincial jails, many are confined in dangerous environments where they may be subjected to violence.Immigration detainees from communities of color, particularly detainees who are Black, appear to be detained for longer periods and often in provincial jails rather than immigration holding centers. People with psychosocial disabilities (or mental health conditions) experience discrimination throughout the detention process. Immigration detention has especially harmful effects on communities of color, refugee claimants, children, and families.Through access to information requests, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International obtained copies of the contracts between the federal government and six provinces (British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and Saskatchewan), which allow authorities to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails, including maximum security facilities. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) confirmed to researchers that an additional contract is in place with the province of Alberta, but it has not been released.According to the contracts reviewed by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, each province can terminate the agreement without penalty or explanation with one year’s notice. In the three remaining provinces (Manitoba, Newfoundland, and Prince Edward Island), CBSA representatives said the agency has “informal arrangements” to hold immigration detainees in provincial jails.In its 2020-21 Departmental Plan, the CBSA indicated that it has “limited control over detention conditions” in provincial jails across the country, which “poses challenges in ensuring a common standard of care.”Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees in provincial jails is a violation of international human rights law. Incarceration in these facilities is inherently punitive in nature and not suited nor permitted under international standards for use in immigration detention.Canadian authorities at the federal and provincial levels should take concrete measures toward abolishing immigration detention, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said. The groups have written to all provinces urging premiers and corrections ministries to stop using provincial jails and other incarceration facilities for immigration detention, and to cancel all contracts and informal arrangements between the federal and provincial governments that allow authorities to transfer immigration detainees to these facilities.Through their #WelcomeToCanada campaign, which will go coast to coast starting with British Columbia, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are asking the general public to support their advocacy efforts by writing, calling, or tweeting their premiers urging them to cancel the contracts that allow immigration detainees to languish in provincial jails.“By shining a spotlight on the devastating harm caused by immigration detention in provincial jails, we hope that people across Canada will join us in urging provincial leaders to end this shameful practice,” said Justin Mohammed, programs manager at Amnesty International Canada. “Canada should become the refugee-welcoming and multicultural country it holds itself out to be, and treat people seeking safety or a better life with the dignity and respect they deserve.”For more Human Rights Watch reporting on disability rights, please visit: https://www.hrw.org/topic/disability-rights

“Around the world, hundreds of thousands of people have signed our petition to express their outrage at evidence of crimes against humanity and other serious human rights violations being inflicted on Muslims in Xinjiang,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“It’s a clear sign that people around the world see through China’s efforts to silence critics and lash out in response to credible reporting on its atrocities in Xinjiang. Every signature is a direct call on China to immediately stop this systematic persecution. 
“The Chinese government must immediately release all people arbitrarily detained in the camps and in prisons, dismantle the internment camp system, and end the systematic attacks against predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.” 
Petitions delivered at Chinese embassiesIn recent days, Amnesty International supporters in 10 cities around the world have held public events to hand over their Free Xinjiang detainees petitions. 
On 7 October, activists gathered at the Chinese embassy in London, UK, to hand over their petition while dressed in the distinctive blue uniforms that camp detainees are forced to wear. Amnesty International activists planned similar events at Chinese embassies in: Dakar, Senegal; Helsinki, Finland; Lima, Peru; Lisbon, Portugal; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; The Hague, the Netherlands; and Washington DC, USA. Amnesty International Indonesia hosted an online seminar and led a digital action encouraging activists to dress in blue uniforms and post selfies.  
The global petition is part of an ongoing Amnesty International campaign, launched in June 2021, to demand an end to the arbitrary detention and other serious human rights violations suffered by predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.The campaign highlights more than 60 cases of individuals arbitrarily detained in “transformation-through-education” centres – actually, internment camps – or sentenced to prison for years. These represent only a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of men and women – possibly up to one million or more – whom the Chinese authorities have detained under the guise of fighting “terrorism”.  
New family testimonies 
Amnesty International interviewed dozens of family members of those arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang and recently released new videos sharing some of their experiences. 
Memeteli’s sister, Hayrigul Niyaz, was detained after she returned from studying abroad, and he has no information about her whereabouts in Xinjiang. Memeteli told Amnesty International: “If I met her again, I will say: ‘Sorry, my sister, that I couldn’t save you from the camps.’” 
Adila’s father, Sadir Ali, was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 20 years in prison, allegedly because he was fasting during Ramadan. Adila said: “Deep [in my] heart I will never be happy because my father is in the jail or in the camp. Why is the Chinese government doing this to us?” She said she had been unable to visit her hometown for 11 years and has lost contact with her relatives in Xinjiang.Abduweli Ayup, a well-known Uyghur activist now living in Norway, told Amnesty International about his sister, Sajidugul Ayup and brother Erkin Ayup, who are serving 12 and 14 year prison sentences, respectively, in Xinjiang for “inciting terrorism”: “I feel every time I do something, it will be dangerous for my family. No one can protect my family members from the punishment. I know that maybe my words will make the Chinese government very angry, but at least I will make the Chinese government know that I will not just watch them torture my sister. I’m not afraid to speak out anymore.” 
Accountability for Xinjiang violations 
In June 2021 Amnesty International launched a report documenting how Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities in Xinjiang face systematic state-organized mass imprisonment, torture and persecution amounting to crimes against humanity.The Chinese government has shown a total unwillingness to acknowledge the reality of the situation in Xinjiang, to halt the human rights violations, or to conduct impartial and thorough investigations and prosecute those suspected to be responsible in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty. 
Meanwhile, UN bodies and member states have been slow to respond to the violations. Indeed, another UN Human Rights Council session ended last week without any formal action being taken to address abuses in Xinjiang. 
Amnesty International is urging UN member states to stand together to strongly condemn China’s serious human rights violations in Xinjiang and to launch a robust, independent, international investigative mechanism to ensure accountability.“Despite mounting evidence of serious human rights violations and crimes under international law over the past four years, the United Nations and its member states have failed to live up to their responsibility to hold China to account for its actions,” said Agnès Callamard. “The international community must stop pretending that the dystopian reality for Muslims in Xinjiang will somehow remedy itself. Too much time has already been wasted. Now more than ever, UN member states have a duty to protect the human rights of all people in Xinjiang, launch an investigation into the suspected crimes under international law, and ensure accountability.”

“This resolution brings hope in the context of widespread and increasing climate disasters, and is a milestone moment in the battle against environmental degradation. With the adoption of this resolution, the HRC has finally acknowledged that the enjoyment of human rights depends on the environment we live in. When the planet suffers, so do we, and all over the world environmental degradation is robbing people of their rights. 
“Government failures to protect the planet, and the ongoing support for environmentally destructive industries, amount to an assault on human rights on a massive scale. We welcome the long-overdue adoption of this resolution, and now call on states to ensure it translates into real change by recognizing this right in law at a national level, and by strengthening their environmental laws and policies. 
“We also welcome the adoption today of the resolution establishing the mandate of a Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Climate Change. Both resolutions are the result of continued efforts of a broad range of state and non-state actors, including human rights defenders from all over the world. They will both make it easier for the UN to support states in improving their performance on environmental issues.”

“Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov’s Nobel Peace Prize win is a victory not only for independent, critical journalism in The Philippines and Russia, but for the fight for justice, accountability and freedom of expression all over the world.  
“For more than three decades, Maria Ressa has worked tirelessly as a journalist in the Philippines, carrying out vital investigative reporting on corruption, abuses of power, and human rights violations in President Rodrigo Duterte’s deadly so-called war on drugs. As the co-founder of Rappler, a highly lauded and uncompromising online news site, she’s opened the world’s eyes to the brutality and pervasive impunity in the Philippines. Put simply, she is a global icon for press freedom.  
“Dmitry Muratov has been a rock for free media in Russia, his newspaper producing hard-hitting, fearless journalism in the face of mortal danger in the country’s increasingly perilous press environment. He is one of the few who continue to hold power to account. We salute the indefatigable professionalism and courage not only of Mr Muratov, but of all those Russian journalists who have suffered while carrying out their professional duties.   
“The Russian and Philippines authorities must take note of Dmitry Muratov’s and Maria Ressa’s Nobel Peace Prize win and end their relentless attack on press freedom.”  
Background  
In January 2012, Maria Ressa co-founded Rappler, an online news website critical of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his administration’s murderous “war on drugs”. She also serves as the publication’s CEO.   
Under the Duterte administration, Maria Ressa, former journalist Reynaldo Santos and Rappler’s directors have collectively faced threats and multiple lawsuits and investigations, including alleged tax violations and violations of the prohibition against foreign control over mass media.  
In June 2020, Maria Ressa was found guilty of “cyber libel” after being convicted under the controversial Philippines Anti-Cybercrime law. For this conviction and if she is found guilty under a myriad of other charges she faces up to sixty years in prison. Amnesty International was among numerous rights groups around the world that condemned her conviction as an attack on press freedom.    
Dmitry Muratov co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has been its editor ever since. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least six of its journalists, including Anna Politkovskaya, have been murdered during the course of their professional duties.   
Dmitry Muratov and his Novaya Gazeta colleagues have over the decades provided essential public interest information to Russia society, in the continuing face of attacks, threats and imprisonment.   
In recent months an increasing number of media organizations and journalists have been designated “undesirable organizations” or “foreign agents”, either halting their work or imposing severe administrative and financial constraints.
