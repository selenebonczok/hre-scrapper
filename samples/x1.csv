17 March 2022 
INTRODUCTION 
Amnesty International welcomes this opportunity to provide input to the five-year review of the state of implementation of the Council of Europe Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education. Human rights education and training (HRE) is one of Amnesty International’s core objectives and is at the heart of the organisation’s work. In 2021, Amnesty’s HRE Network reached over 4 million people and led more than 728 thousand supporters to take action to defend human rights in 212 countries and territories, 86% of them being young people. 
Amnesty International advocates for a holistic approach to high-quality human rights education in national, regional and international policies and educational systems. This includes: 
CHALLENGES 
In the last few years, we have been witnessing an increase in legal and policy restrictions on HRE such as banning HRE in schools, restricting access of NGOs to schools to conduct HRE, censorship of HRE (e.g., in sexuality education, LGBTI, gender, racism, etc). If the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has impacted HRE severely, the impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine and beyond is unfathomable and has already led to a human rights crisis of unimaginable proportions – with dramatic consequences for HRE. 
We substantiate these challenges with a few examples seen from Amnesty’s HRE work in Europe. These examples are by no way exhaustive of the length and breadth of HRE challenges in the region. But they provide a flavor of the urgency to rectify this by increasing HRE efforts in the region. 
Belarus – Though Belarus is not the member-state of the Council of Europe, it is a contracting party to 11 Council of Europe treaties, and in the last CoE Action Plan for Belarus (2019-2021) the state agreed “to promote human rights education for young people, develop democratic and inclusive environments in schools and enhance dialogue between national authorities and civil society, while paying particular attention to gender equality”. The Action Plan also claims that “Belarus participates actively in activities related to the implementation of the EDC/HRE Charter principles”1. Nevertheless, we can see that there is a near-total destruction of the human rights sector, including human rights education in schools, universities and other institutions. According to our partners, the few HRE projects in place before the current human rights crisis which started in the summer of 2021, are no longer operational in any form. Hundreds of human rights defenders, including human rights educators and activists promoting general principles of human rights are persecuted,  
silenced and often imprisoned. Moreover, most NGOs which were promoting HRE across the country have since been liquidated2. Since the beginning of the human rights crisis in Belarus, students and teachers have been at risk of various forms of persecution, including expulsion from universities, dismissals from working places, arrests, prosecution, lengthy prison sentences and even torture and ill-treatment. An example is the case of Katsyaryna Vinnikava, a law student from the Belarusian State University who was sentenced to 15 days of detention after giving a graduation speech honoring human rights and the rule of law. Hundreds of students have been persecuted while participating in peaceful protests3. Such a crackdown on students and teachers for promoting human rights principles in the country directly leads to delegitimising HRE efforts in Belarus and has a corrosive effect for the state of HRE in the region. 
Russia – HRE in Russia is sparse in both formal and non-formal educational sectors. Although some elements of human rights education are included in the curriculum, it is minimal and over-legalized. We already see those international providers working on HRE in and with Russia are labelled as non-desirables (the Council of Europe School of Political Studies, Prague Civil Society Centre, etc). Russian-based NGOs labelled as foreign agents cannot have access to educational systems. The liquidation of Memorial (a historical and educational centre) and the closure of its 20-year-old educational programme for schools, where students developed research projects on family history, the history of GULAG and the Stalin repressions are indicative. Since 2013, Russia’s notorious Anti-Homosexual Propaganda Bill has outlawed all ‘propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships among minors expressed in the dissemination of information’, effectively banning all educational and raising awareness activities about the rights of LGBTI persons4. In March 2021, the Russian Federation President signed a new law that obliges all governmental educational institutions, including schools and universities, to seek approval for non-formal, international, and collaborations with foreign entities. All non-formal initiatives would have to be pre-approved by the government, effectively introducing a censorship mechanism. The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Non-Formal Education (“Prosveshchenie”) would be in charge of monitoring any “incorrect information about historical, national, religious or cultural traditions of the nations”. Such a necessity can effectively block non-governmental organisations access to educational systems, making projects on various topics, including human rights, impossible. 
Hungary – In Hungary, a “Russian-style” propaganda law contravenes human rights and threatens LGBTIQ+ people5. On 26 May 2021, MPs of the governing party Fidesz submitted a bill to the Parliament on “Harsher sentencing for paedophile criminal offences and set-up a criminal registry for perpetrators of such offences”. Without public consultation, on 10 June 2021 the Parliament’s Legislative Committee submitted a series of amendments containing discriminatory provisions targeting the members of the LGBTI community. Despite widespread domestic and international criticism, the governing majority in Parliament adopted the law and it came into force on the 8th of July. The ban on depiction or discussion of diverse gender identities and sexual orientation in schools, television, and advertising in Hungary violates several human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, to equality and non-discrimination, and to education. The provisions of the new law differentiate between employees and partners of educational institutions providing specific programmes and when these programmes are provided by others, for example, civil society organizations and external individual experts. If the programme is provided by others, only “a person or organisation registered by the body designated by law shall be allowed to hold, in the framework of the regular curriculum or other activities organized for the students”. The person conducting an unregistered lecture, training or workshop and the head of the institution could be held liable for committing a newly introduced petty offence which is punishable by fine or community service. The legal changes followed a communication campaign that had lasted several months and attacked educational programmes that raised awareness on LGBTI related topics. The programme called ‘Melegség és Megismerés’ (Getting to know LGBTI people), provided by two Hungarian LGBTI NGOs, Labrisz and Szimpozion Associations, had become the primary target of these attacks in the government-aligned media. Amnesty International’s own human rights education programme was also heavily smeared. We saw that some school principals and teachers were afraid to invite Amnesty and other LGBTIQ programmes to their schools. The law does not provide sufficient clarity about the criteria for the registration of the programme service providers, which leads to a lack of legal certainty and allows for discretionary decisions by the authorities. If school programme providers are permitted or denied the registration in an unclear, arbitrary and non-transparent way, children will not have access to information and support that may be vital as a part of their comprehensive sexuality education. Consequently, their right to access quality education under international human rights law will be violated. 
Poland – In 2021, the Ministry of Education in Poland proposed a bill according to which government-appointed officials would be given greater powers to appoint and dismiss school headteachers. They would also have more control over which external organisations are allowed into schools. That would mean the schools will have to obtain permission from a government-appointed superintendent before entering cooperation with any external organisation. So far, non-governmental organisations were the main force behind HRE projects and workshops in public schools. The bill has been vetoed by the President, however, the President explicitly stated being in favour of some of the provisions of the new law. There is still a risk that the modified law will be proposed again which will result in obstructed access for non-governmental organisations to HRE in schools. We also see threats to sexuality education. In 2019, a regressive bill on sexuality education was proposed by Members of Parliament6. In a country where sexual and reproductive rights are already extremely limited, education about sexuality is crucial to help young people decide on issues such as consent, contraception and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. As of April 2020, Members of Parliament voted to send the bills to parliamentary committees, and this has not proceeded since. However, the threat to sexuality education in Poland remains serious and the proposed law, although not implemented, already has a freezing effect on teachers and schools. 
Turkey – In Turkey, we have seen smear campaigns against human rights educators as human rights defenders. Smear campaigns are seen in the press, social media, especially referring to education on LGBTI-related topics and the Istanbul Convention. Over the last few years, Amnesty Turkey’s publication on gender discrimination (Feminist Alphabet) was targeted with threats of punishment and prosecution against the editorial team on social media. Amnesty has been unofficially prevented from carrying out HRE activities in public schools for a long time. The few private schools that invite Amnesty are reporting they feel under pressure. It is almost impossible to sustain HRE work in state schools or even in co-operation with government related departments and ministries. Teachers use educational materials in the classrooms without administrative permission, but they do so at the risk of administrative investigation. Apart from teachers, Amnesty Turkey can also reach public officials through trainings organized in partnership with their professional organisations and unions as it is not possible to organize trainings directly with public institutions. 
In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and aggravated existing threats to human rights, from the rights to life and health to the right to education and many more. Many states have failed to prioritize effective delivery of HRE amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. Lack of alternatives to in-person training programmes in many countries has excluded millions who have unequal access to technology. In 2021, Covid-19 continued to have an impact on Amnesty HRE network in Europe and Central Asia, especially on formal education projects, although not as strongly felt as in 2020. Projects continued to use a variety of digital alternatives to reach their audiences, however there are some signs of digital fatigue, with projects reporting challenges in retaining beneficiaries throughout longer digital programmes. 
In these existing and emerging human rights crises, young people in particular are facing a growing list of challenges, from intersectional discrimination to arbitrary restrictions on their freedom of expression, assembly and association. And this comes at a time when young people are increasingly demanding action to address the growing human rights emergency as result of climate change. 
ACHIEVEMENTS OF AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S HRE NETWORK IN EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA 
Europe and Central Asia is the region with the largest number of projects and reporting Amnesty entities, with a total of 85 projects from 26 entities. The region reaches a sizeable proportion of youth through HRE, with over 91% of people reached in the region in 2020 being youth. 46 of the projects reported are conducted within the formal education setting with teachers, children and youth being the key target groups for the region. In 2020, Amnesty entities in Europe and Central Asia reached 473,375 people via HRE project in formal and non-formal settings7. 
Covid-19 & human rights – Amnesty Human Rights AcademyAmnesty’s Human Rights Academy is a multilingual, free, online learning space that aims to provide quality HRE for all. In 2020, we saw an example of successful rapid response HRE with the production of a 15-minute microlearning course on COVID-19 and human rights. The course outlines the human rights implications of COVID-19, describes states’ human rights obligations in relation to the pandemic and leads learners to promote social solidarity and response to COVID-19 that is compliant with human rights. 2020 was a significant year for the Human Rights Academy as the pandemic led to increased global growth in online learning, resulting in exponential growth for the Academy. By the end of the year, the Academy had over 200,000 registered learners, was available in 25 languages and offered 84 courses. In 2020 itself, we had 39 courses, from which five were new, and 34 were translations of existing courses. 
Human Rights Workout – gamification of the European Court of Human Rights caselawHuman Rights Workout8 is an interactive micro-learning platform which provides young learners with gamified cases of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). It was released in 2019 and as of December 2021, Human Rights Workout reached 10,000 learners. The platform has three interactive modules in English, Ukrainian, Romanian, Italian, Slovak and Russian. In the first module, based on the 2017 ECHR case Lashmankin and others v. Russia learners navigate a panorama of small-town Russia and the bureaucratic obstacles and excuses protestors face. It was drawn directly from real-life responses from Russian authorities as protestors tried to organise a peaceful assembly. The second micro-module is based on Identoba and others v. Georgia, in which complainants participated in a peaceful rally against homophobia in Tbilisi in 2012. The protesters had requested state protection from counterdemonstrators but were severely beaten with the acquiescence of police officers. This module deals with the positive obligation of the state to protect peaceful protestors. In November 2020, Amnesty International released a third online educational module that helped thousands of learners to understand the obstacles rape survivors face and the importance of consent. The module is based on the emblematic EB v Romania case of the European Court of Human Rights, which unpacks how the issue of sexual violence intersects with human rights 
Integration of HRE in the new curriculum in UkraineSince 2015, a new curriculum for Grades 1-12 has been created in Ukraine with the active participation of Amnesty Ukraine. One of the crucial features is that civic education and human rights are mandatory and cross-cutting components which means that they should be included in all educational subjects. The development of civic competencies and human rights competencies is based on the Council of Europe Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education and the Competence Framework for a Culture of Democracy. 
HRE Advocacy in Central Asia – integrating HRE into the core subject standard for schoolsIn 2021, Amnesty carried out a mapping of the state of HRE in Kyrgyzstan9 and organised a multi-stakeholder discussion of its findings. This project led to the official acknowledgment of gaps in delivering human rights education and the commitment to integrate HRE into core school curriculum. Amnesty International works with officials of several affiliates of the Kyrgyz Ministry of Education on the holistic integration of HRE into the revised standard for the core subject in Kyrgyzstan secondary schools. 
Other highlights: 
Me and You Together (Amnesty Greece) – Me and You together is a nationwide education project in Human Rights Education for Secondary Schools in Greece. The Ministry of Education and Religion approved the educational material to be one of the main training tools for teachers and educators for HRE in schools, through the national educational platform. The project combines the training of teachers and educators and training for parents. In 2020 Amnesty Greece more than doubled the number of schools in which the project is carried out, increasing from 70 schools to 153, reaching over 8,000 students, 600 teachers and 300 parents. The project aims to foster a deeper understanding of human rights while promoting the development of a culture of respect for diversity, an understanding of sexual orientation and freedom of choice, accessibility, and inclusion, by providing students with advocacy tools and safeguarding methods of their rights. 
“Justice Warriors” HRE project about Human Rights Defenders in Schools (Amnesty Denmark) – The Justice Warriors is an HRE project based on learning about people’s experiences as human rights defenders with the aim of inspiring students and developing their ability to engage and take action themselves. Carried out as a pilot project aimed at students aged 12-16 years old and their teachers, Amnesty Denmark developed materials for students with case stories from five Human Rights Defenders, a teachers’ guide, a teacher Facebook page and held a series of school events together with the American LGBT activist Jamie Nabozny. As a result, some students expressed a positive change in their well-being, and in one school an anti-bully group was set up. 
The Start the Change! (Amnesty Italy and partners) – Start the Change project10 was active from 2017 to 2020 and aimed to raise the awareness of young Europeans on the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the program of action for people, the planet and prosperity signed in September 2015 by governments of 193 UN member countries. Made in collaboration with teachers and educators, Start the Change! has implemented an innovative educational model in order to increase the involvement of young people within their communities. At the same time, the project strengthened the network between schools, civil society organizations and local authorities. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Amnesty International believes it would be important for the Council of Europe, as it reviews the implementation of the Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education (EDC/HRE) and decides on its future work, to effectively address the following challenges to HRE: 
I. HRE in hostile and conflict environments – Considering the devastating impact of the war in Ukraine to youth and civil society in Ukraine and neighbouring countries, and the ongoing crackdown on civil society, it is crucial that future programmes of the CoE focus on ensuring support to youth movements, in particular in Ukraine, Belarus, Russia, where the prospects are grim. This support should include selecting more participants from the affected countries for international events, especially from Ukraine, accommodating translations of events and outputs into Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Russian languages, financing activities of the NGOs and supporting with humanitarian visas if necessary. Also, given the departure of Russia from Council of Europe, it is crucial for the CoE not to exclude Russia’s civil society, HRDs, educators and academics from its educational and youth programmes. In the long term, Council of Europe should focus these educational and youth programmes on how to monitor and document human rights violations, and transitional justice with an emphasis on human rights abuses. 
II. HRE and thematic priorities – Given the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Second World War, and the unprecedented crackdown on civil society in a number of CoE states, the Council of Europe should prioritize the following thematic areas when developing educational and youth programmes: the rights of refugees and migrants, freedom of expression and the right to protest, women’s rights and the right to be free from sexual violence including in the war context. 
III. HRE in formal education – The Council of Europe should address the lack of access to formal education for NGOs specializing on HRE/EDC and make an effort to encourage national state bodies to be inclusive and open for collaborations with youth and human rights NGOs, especially when developing new educational standards or reviewing the current standards. The Council of Europe should organise a regional summit to hold governments to account on the implementation of the EDC/HRE Charter and ensure a holistic and meaningful integration of human rights and EDC into curricula, exposing both challenges and successes from across the region. 
IV. HRE and marginalised groups – The Council of Europe should adopt an intersectional approach when developing and delivering educational programmes for youth, ensuring that they are accessible for and sensitive to the most disadvantaged groups, who are negatively affected by discrimination on more than one ground, for example, girls from rural neighbourhoods, refugees with disabilities and LGBTIQ people from racialized communities, etc. 
V. HRE for and with young people – It is critical that young people are enabled to lead the ideation, design and implementation of HRE programmes focusing on addressing major global human rights concerns.

This manual has been produced within the context of a project entitled the Ljubljana Poster Festival ’11: The Faces of Racism Revealed. It includes a selection of poster artwork produced on the topic of racism by international professional poster artists and art and design students from Slovenia and European partner countries (Poland, France and the Netherlands). Each poster is accompanied by a suggestion of how it can be used to discuss one of the many themes related to racism. The manual has been designed as a resource for teachers or educators interested in using visual images to promote interactive discussion and critical thinking amongst young people about racism and discrimination. The resource can be used within diverse educational settings and is most appropriate for use with young people above the age of twelve.

This International Day of Education, Amnesty International has launched Rights Arcade, a free human rights game app which aims to educate the next generation of human rights defenders about rights such as freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. 
Rights Arcade is designed to strengthen the human rights movement through action-oriented education. The games will boost players’ knowledge about human rights and encourage people to take action on human rights issues.   
One of Rights Arcade’s key features is a self-paced approach that allows players to learn, reflect and take action at their own pace while navigating through the game’s stories. 
“This game has been designed to empower and encourage people everywhere, but especially younger audiences, to learn about human rights in an engaging manner,” said Agnès Callamard, Amnesty International’s Secretary General. 
“Young people are pivotal in setting the human rights agenda, today and for the future. Reaching them in the spaces they inhabit, or with which they engage regularly, is key to enabling new generations of activists and empowering them to fight for, and protect, human rights – now and in the future.” 
The players take a human rights journey through the experiences of three real-life people: Ahmed Kabir Kishor, a cartoonist unjustly charged under the Digital Security Act in Bangladesh; Zhang Zhan, a citizen journalist sentenced to four years in prison for reporting about Covid-19 in China; and Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, a student activist facing more than 25 charges for protesting in Thailand. 
The game’s stories, which are fictionalized experiences inspired by real world events, are driven by a player’s choices. 
The player gets to play the role and navigate the experiences of the three central characters, making decisions based on their own understanding of human rights and unpacking how human rights concepts apply in daily life. 
People around the world will be able to access a collection of three games currently available in four languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Thai and Korean. 
Rights Arcade can be downloaded on iOS and Android devices, ensuring its accessibility in regions with poor internet connectivity. 
Rights Arcade will be regularly updated to accommodate learning in more languages, and with new game offerings in the months and years to come.

Based on the recommendations of our global human rights education network, we have compiled a list of educational resources that explain the rights of refugees. 
Teachers, educators, facilitators or anyone that wishes to learn more about refugees can use these materials produced by Amnesty International and other organisations. 
By drawing parallels between the lives of primary school children and those of refugees, the two resources aim to create a feeling of global interconnectedness among pupils. Seeking Safety is designed for use with eight to 12 year olds. It features eight interactive activities to understand why people flee their country, and debunk the myths and stereotypes often associated with people seeking asylum. Time to Flee is for 11 to 16 year olds. Through fictional stories it addresses why people seek asylum and the difficulties they can face when they have to settle in a new country. 
Teachers and educators can also use the primary and secondary school packs containing a lesson plan on refugees. 
– From Amnesty International UK 
Against All Odds is an educational online game that shows what it’s like to flee a country. As they play, gamers plunge into the world of a virtual character where they have to build a new life in a different country after they escape conflict. The game is built on facts and short films, and comes with a teacher’s guide that includes exercises and discussion topics. It is available in 12 languages. 
– From The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
This is an online activity where Yara, Nabil and Ghassan tell the story of how they fled from Syria to resettle in a new country (in Norwegian only). Each case study is composed of short video clips and information on Norwegian and European refugee policies and international law. Two sets of materials are available with suggestions for practical exercises and activism for 13 to 16 and 16 to 19 year olds. 
– From Amnesty International Norway  
“Ebrahim is a teenage refugee, he did not choose to bid farewell to his mother for the last time and he certainly did not choose to take the long journey to be granted asylum in the UK.” 
This comic book story depicts the journey of 15 year old Ebrahim as he embarks on a journey for a safer life. The comic strip images serve as an introduction for the discussion topics and activity ideas in the resource pack.  
Teachers and educators can also search through a set of interactive resources. 
– From the British Red Cross 
Using fiction to bring real stories to life, this movie analysis resource makes five films on the theme of migration the starting point of a discussion on refugees (including An American Tail, The Kite Runner and The Terminal). The resource pack comprises discussions ideas, activities and questions for teachers to use with five to 19 year olds. 
Teachers and educators can also search through a set of interactive resources. 
– From UK Refugee Week 
These lesson modules help teachers to integrate the topic of refugees into different subjects of the curriculum, such as Art, History, Geography, Civic Education, Human Rights or Language and Literature. The modules target students from three different age groups: 9 to 11; 12 to 14; 15 to 18 year olds, to develop an understanding of the asylum process within a human rights context. They include lesson plans, teaching methods and learning strategies. 
“The enemy is there but I have never seen him. Every morning, I shoot at him. Then he shoots at me. We both stay hidden the rest of the day, waiting.” Davide Cali, 2009 
This children’s book tells the story of two soldiers who keep fighting each other because the manual they received tells to do so. This tale can be used as a conversation starter to discuss the concept of “our enemy” and the importance of getting to know each other. 
Teachers and educators can use the lesson plan with the book, available in English and in Hungarian.  
– From Amnesty International Australia and Amnesty International Hungary 
Based on field trips to Lebanon and Jordan, this set of six curriculum units and lesson plans for 11 to 13 year olds provide historical background and case studies on refugees. The units also show how creative activities such as music or video making with students can serve as a medium to raise awareness and communicate a message on this topic. 
– From Georgetown University

Students attending Accra High School in the Ghanaian capital may not see themselves as trend-setters in global education.  
But after a visit to their school late last year, Ghana’s late President John Atta Mills – who was also a professor – spoke of his great admiration for their success at making human rights an integral part of everyday school life.  
The school aims to build capacity of the whole school community by promoting a democratic environment, innovative teaching methods and responsible citizenship. Students feel empowered through a representative student council that moots new ideas and voices the student body’s concerns.  
And the school has embraced human rights not only inside the classroom, but also as an integral part of its clubs and extra-curricular activities – a human rights garden maintained by students and staff is just one space where openness, tolerance and debate are promoted.  
Accra High School is one of a growing number of schools around the world that are supported by Amnesty International’s Human Rights-Friendly Schools project, whose methodologies and successes are highlighted in a new guide.  
“Human rights education is a participatory practice aimed at empowering individuals and communities, equipping them with the knowledge, attitudes, values and skills that they need to enjoy and exercise their rights and to respect and uphold the rights of others,” said Sneh Aurora, International Human Rights Education Manager at Amnesty International.  
“With this new guide, we’re offering practical suggestions for schools around the world to make human rights a viable part of their curricula, teaching methodology and broader learning environment that has a lasting impact not just on students, but also on their wider communities.” Becoming a Human Rights Friendly School: A guide for schools around the world offers 10 Global Principles for Human Rights Friendly Schools that can be integrated into four key areas of school life – governance, relationships, curriculum and extra-curricular activities, and the overall school environment.  
A toolkit of human rights education resources accompanies the guide.  
According to Amnesty International, Human Rights Friendly Schools are places where human rights are at the heart of the learning experience and present in all key areas of school life.  
They are inclusive environments where all are encouraged to take part, regardless of status or role, and where cultural diversity is celebrated.  
Integrating human rights into education 
In 2009, Amnesty International developed the Human Rights Friendly Schools project within the context of the UN World Programme for Human Rights Education.  
The programme’s initial phase from 2005 to 2009 – aimed at primary and secondary schools worldwide – called for a holistic approach to human rights education, encouraging national governments not only to support schools to teach about human rights, but also to ensure that schools were run according to human rights values and principles. Since 2010, a second phase has expanded the focus to also cover higher education.  
“This human rights education initiative is based on the premise that everyone has the right to know, seek and receive information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms and should have access to human rights education and training,” said Sneh Aurora. Fifteen secondary schools from 14 countries – in all regions of the world – took part in a pilot of Amnesty International’s Human Rights Friendly Schools project from September 2009 to July 2011.  
As the project now engages a greater number of schools and expands to new countries, the organization sees this new guide as an opportunity to consolidate, reflect and share the experiences and learning to date, and continue to support schools in their journey to become human rights friendly.

Sex without consent is rape, yet a majority of countries in Europe and Central Asia do not recognise this in law, while harmful misconceptions about rape and gender stereotypes prevent survivors from accessing justice and hamper prevention for rape across the region. To combat this, an Amnesty International online educational module released in November 2020 has helped thousands of learners to understand the obstacles rape survivors face and the importance of consent. 
The course, Violence Against Women: Consent is a 15-minute ‘micro-learning’ module on how the issue of sexual violence intersects with human rights. The module, originally released in English and Russian, was developed as part of the regional “Let’s talk about Yes” campaign to promote access to justice for rape, including by calling for consent-based laws on rape in Europe. Violence Against Women: Consent is the third module on the Human Rights Workout platform, with the previous two modules focusing on the right to peaceful protest. 
The Human Rights Workout is a unique platform to provide in-depth understanding of rights and the mechanisms around international human rights law teaching through real-life cases from the European Court of Human Rights. It provides learners the personal story of an individual defending their own rights through dynamic and interactive learning elements. This last module on violence against women showcases E.B against Romania. E.B. is a female survivor of rape who was denied protection and access to justice.  
In this module, learners navigate their way through several shocking obstacles rape survivors may encounter in their fight for justice, such as victim blaming, prejudices, and flawed investigations that focus on the perceived lack of resistance of the victim rather than the absence of consent 
Together with a unique storytelling approach to teaching human rights, the Workout features many interactive elements including a movable panorama, quizzes and a chat-bot where learners can consult with a human rights lawyer. The bright and eye-catching illustrations for this module are provided by Kyrgyz activist and illustrator, Tatiana Zelenskaya. A summary booklet entitled ‘Know your rights’ is given at the end of the course, providing learners with a quick outline of human rights violated in cases of rape, an introduction to the European Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (the Istanbul Convention), and a guide to how states should define rape in line with international standards. 
The target audience for the module is youth throughout Europe and Central Asia. The module saw positive feedback from this group at the learner testing stage, where a demo version was rated 8.4 out of 10.  In particular, learners praised the interactivity, narrative approach and the overall look of the course. Moreover, 86% of users reported that the module had increased their knowledge of how rape relates to the right to freedom from torture and ill-treatment, as well as the key role of consent in rape legislation.  A learner from Kyrgyzstan noted that although the course contains some fairly complex legal concepts, ‘the material is presented in a consistent, accessible way’. Тhe module received an unprecedented amount of attention, with 1,017 people taking the course within a month of release. 
In 2019 Ukraine adopted a consent-based definition of rape. But even with the recognition that sex without consent is rape in law, attitudes and misconceptions about rape and gender stereotypes can hamper access to justice and prevention of gender-based violence, including sexual violence. 
“A key objective of Amnesty Ukraine is the ratification of the Istanbul Convention.” says Volodymyr Selivanenko, Human Rights Education officer for Amnesty Ukraine. “Educational materials such as this online module help to achieve this goal and contribute to creating a consent culture in society as a whole”. Amnesty Ukraine hopes that the module will serve as an additional tool for teachers in schools and universities who, “having passed this course will be able to talk more boldly with students about a consent culture”. Following its release in Ukrainian, teachers in Ukraine have praised the clarity of the course contents – they are easily understood by students. 
On the other side of the continent, Amnesty Netherlands used the English language version of the module as part of the online masterclass “Gender & Human Rights: Sexual Consent”. During the two-hour session participants were divided into break-out rooms, given 20 minutes to go through the module, and eventually returned to discuss the issues presented in the module as a group. 
When asked why she had chosen to use the module during the masterclass, Annelie Bonnet from Amnesty Netherlands noted that “the module offers the opportunity to present a clear and compelling case study to the students on this topic. In addition, I am personally very pleased with the quality of the module and the different questions posed throughout the module to learn about the topic. It was very effective to use a masterclass to teach about this topic.” Participants comments were striking: a combination of shock about real-life events depicted in the course alongside praise for attractive and engaging visuals. 
To mark International Women’s Day on 8th March, three new translations are being released by the Italian, Slovak, and Moldovan sections respectively, meaning that the module will now be available in six languages: English, Russian, Ukrainian, Italian, Slovak and Romanian. 
Colleagues from Amnesty Italy praised the module as powerful tool to inspire and mobilise young people and activists, and they intend to integrate it into their national initiatives. 
What we appreciated most was the fact that the module is based on a real case, allowing learners to be more empathic with the difficulties experienced by the survivor in her search for justice 
The plan is for the module to be used as a new tool to take action in the “Iolochiedo” campaign on consent. In addition, it will be added to the pool of HRE resources already available to educators in Amnesty Italy’s teachers’ guide – a resource available for older students. They plan to promote the module to the high schools already engaged in the campaign and to activists working on sexual violence and consent in Italy. 
“Discussing violence against women is a big part of our initiative and so we have been working hard to translate the module as quickly as possible”, says Constanta Botnar from Amnesty Moldova. During the pandemic online platforms have been key to delivering education programmes  across the region: “Having an online interactive learning platform is a truly wonderful instrument for delivering courses that may otherwise be inaccessible to those who do not have the opportunity to participate in face-to-face workshops, especially given COVID-19 and its restrictions.” Noting the launch date for the module in Moldova, she added, “Every year on 8th March – International Women’s Day – there are messages of appreciation and solidarity everywhere. This in turn makes 9th March a very sad day for women, when they realize that “their day” has passed but nothing has changed. That is why we decided to focus on one of the biggest problems societies face around the world:  violence against women.” 
It is anticipated that in the coming year even more Amnesty sections will translate the module into additional regional languages.

What was once introduced as an engaging extra-curricular topic almost ten years ago has now found its way into the national curricula in Moldova thanks to continuous advocacy work. Over the last ten years, Amnesty International Moldova (AI Moldova) has been instrumental in supporting the development and implementation of Human Rights Education (HRE) in the formal education system in primary and gymnasium schools. Currently, civic education is an obligatory subject in Moldova and HRE is an elective subject. 
AI Moldova developed the first Human Rights Education curriculum and HRE materials in 2010. In 2013-16, the curriculum was revised and new modules on non-discrimination and sustainable development were introduced, which were approved by the Ministry of Education and National Council for Curricula. 
Now, ten years down the line, the nation’s biggest challenge is not the curriculum itself, but ensuring those implementing the curriculum have the capacity and resources to do so well. Since 2015, AI Moldova has been training teachers and building on its Human Rights Friendly Schools programme in Moldova. In 2018 alone, it trained around 150 teachers. 
With Moldova gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the concept of human rights is still developing in Moldovan society and education system. HRE is therefore a key priority in the country. Moldova faces an interesting political context. On the one hand, the political environment is not entirely human rights friendly. There remain significant concerns with civic freedoms and the justice system as well as discrimination against certain groups (Roma, LGBT+). Declining pluralism of the media and harassment of NGOs present barriers for human rights defenders. 
On the other hand, there is a strong trend to move closer to and eventually join the European Union. HRE is not particularly controversial domestically (compared with more immediate human rights issues) and the government has committed to implement the Council of Europe recommendations to align Moldova to European Standards of democratic governance. Thus, there is relatively good support for HRE at a high level, and Amnesty International Moldova has had an agreement with the Ministry of Education since 2010. 
Nevertheless, the programme faces practical challenges, particularly regarding teachers and the education system. Many teachers were trained in Soviet times, where human rights were not taught at all and teaching methodologies were rigid. The teaching profession in Moldova now faces high turnover due to historic under-investment, this means that teachers trained in one year may not be working in the next. 
In 2018, Amnesty International Moldova has been focusing on embedding HRE in the formal education system. AI Moldova’s work over the last ten years has made a significant contribution to moving HRE from an extra-curricular activity in a small number of schools to an elective subject widely offered across Moldovan gymnasium schools and demanded by students. In 2015, AI Moldova signed another agreement with the Ministry of Education to include collaboration on teacher training and Human Rights Friendly Schools. It has co-authored HRE curricula with the ministry – in practice leading the process. 
Since then, working with around 20 pilot schools, Amnesty International has developed Romanian language HRE curricula for particular grade levels and included more subjects. In 2015, HRE was made available as an elective subject starting in around 100 schools. In 2017, Amnesty started to develop an HRE curriculum from primary right through to gymnasium (secondary) level. The current curriculum spans two grade levels (ages 14-15), with one hour of HRE classes per week. 
One primary teacher involved in piloting the curriculum in 2018 reported changing her view of the standard curriculum. Previously she had felt she was teaching students comprehensively across all the subjects. After taking the HRE training for teachers, she realised there are many things that kids need to know that are not on the standard curriculum. Prior to being involved in the pilot, she felt it would be impossible to teach human rights to primary-age pupils. 
Other teachers reported that they did not realise the breadth of human rights concepts, for example that emotions and feelings are also part of human rights. Neamțu Olga, a primary school teacher from Chișinău explains, “HRE is based on the formation of competences for life, attitudes and values; it is the life we live day by day in different social groups. It is the peaceful resolution of conflicts, assertive communication and objective decisions that they take. The course meant for me professional and personal growth; experience, since the harvested fruits have made me understand that an informed person is a more protected person”. 
Amnesty International Moldova is currently contributing further to curriculum development at a national level as well as supporting implementation through training of teachers. Work on the HRE curriculum development and implementation has strong links to Amnesty International’s Human Rights Friendly School approach. AI Moldova has trained more than 150 teachers with 50 becoming Amnesty International members. Currently more than one in 10 schools offer HRE as an elective subject and every year more than 2,000 students attend the course, participating in one hour of HRE classes per week. The project has found that a holistic approach is required to achieve good results: ‘It is not enough to have extra-curricular activities or student groups; it is also not enough to have a curriculum in place. It requires a holistic approach that is not just education about HR, but also education through HR.’ explains Violeta Terguță, HRE program coordinator at AI Moldova. 
“It has been a great opportunity to learn about, through and for Human Rights and Child Rights within the frame of Amnesty training courses, summer schools, skill shares. I could exchange knowledge and skills with colleagues from all over the country. Amnesty Moldova’s work is great as they develop a lot of teacher friendly materials, lesson plans, books, guides, which can be used during both curricula and extracurricular school activities,” explains Diana Galanton a High School teacher in Bălți. 
AI Moldova also organises other activities such as annual HRE tournaments that complement Human Rights Friendly Schools and formal education work, providing additional motivation for students to take action and engage on a high level. More than 100 students attending the course became AI Moldova members, forming school groups, and participating in wider Amnesty International activities, campaigns, as well as promoting Human Rights in their school and their community. 
Daniel, a student at the Olimp High School in Sîngerei, reported that the course has helped him shape new views and opinions: “When I attended human rights classes, I found out that I used to have stereotypes, unfortunately. Now I know that all people are different but equal. People need to be tolerant and not discriminate against each other”.[1] For Nicoleta who studies in the same school, taking the course helped her realise the ways she can defend human rights: “I have learnt that one man, one signature can change the world. People should all get involved and not be simple passers-by. I will use the skills I develop during class to defend those whose rights are violated and formulate my arguments”. 
As a result of the demand from schools now implementing HRE curricula, there has been a large growth in the number of students taking part in Amnesty’s annual letter writing marathon Write for Rights compared with ten years ago. Schools now call Amnesty to participate in the marathon, rather than AI Moldova having to call schools. Over the years the number of letters has increased from around 700 to 40,000 letters. A reason for this is the changes in the quality of actions over time as students are organising events differently and tackling issues in a deeper way.

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, educators worldwide have been forced to actively adopt new remote learning formats. Amnesty International’s human rights education team for Europe and Central Asia, together with Amnesty Ukraine, conducted two three-day blended learning courses  for teachers from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. These courses replaced the face-to-face trainings in Bishkek, which had been planned before the pandemic.  
From offline to online without loss of quality or group dynamics 
In the autumn of 2020, due to the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Amnesty International’s human rights education team was not able to conduct offline trainings in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Therefore, the methodical materials for the programme on human rights and Write for Rights aimed at teachers of different disciplines had to be completely re-designed. We faced the challenge of moving the course into the format of a fully distance learning course, without losing quality, atmosphere and active participation. 
As a result, the human rights awareness component and the information about the Write for Rights campaign were transformed into remote learning elements – an hour and a half long course “Introduction to Human Rights” was supplemented with a 15-minute course on “Write for Rights” on the Amnesty Academy platform. The trainings sessions devoted to learning the methodology of giving lessons on human rights and building a community of human rights educators were transformed into an interactive webinar, which consisted of three intensive sessions over three days, each lasting 3 hours. 
As a result, instead of a planned one-day offline training, the online training took three days. Based on the experience of both holding and participating in many hours of online events, it was decided to do three three-hour intensive webinars, taking place on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday, rather than all on a single day. Regarding the workload, the difficulty of preparation lay in the fact that instead of a standard training program, it was necessary to develop a minute-by-minute script for webinars with the distribution of roles between co-hosts, an expert and a technical assistant. 
Stasya Denisova, Human Rights Education Coordinator for Europe and Central Asia, explains, “It was important to us that this online course fulfilled the ambition we had originally for the offline course. We wanted to create a group of like-minded teachers who share the values of human rights and who would communicate with each other and us after finishing. We did not want our online course to turn into another online conference with hosts presenting slides all the time. Moreover, it should be an event as close as possible to the experience of a face-to-face training session, with the inherent group dynamics, interpersonal communication and most of all, active participation. That was why we paid attention to replacing the traditional elements of a workshop with adequate online tools. For example, the group’s routine evaluation exercises at the beginning and end of each day were replaced by “temperature measurements” using the MentiMeter online tool, which creates a real-time cloud of associations”. 
“We had previously been in contact with teachers through other messenger services so that if they were disconnected or delayed for some reason, everyone was aware of what was happening to the group. This provided a sense of care and continuous communication with the members and maintained the group’s integrity, ” explains Aizhan Kadralieva, Human Rights Education Consultant in Central Asia.   
An important task was to create a ‘blend’ between the Amnesty Academy’s distance courses and the webinar sessions. Kahoot interactive quizzes provided an opportunity for participants to test their knowledge gained in the online courses. Moderated discussions about human rights values allowed for reflection on the relevance of human rights to values such as freedom, equality and justice in each teacher’s context. Working in small groups and creating a shared vision was done through virtual breakout rooms in Zoom and synchronized work in the program Miro. Flipchart presentations became PowerPoint presentations using the “share your screen” feature. After the course, a mutual exchange of experience and methodological peer-to-peer support continued in a closed group in a user-friendly social network. 
Unexpected benefits of online learning  
Instead of the expected few dozen applications from Bishkek or Almaty’s teachers, we received 67 applications from teachers from ten cities and districts across Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. These teachers were from public and private schools, including the Academy of Education and the Republican Institute for The Excellence and Teacher Training at the Ministry of Education and Science of the Kyrgyz Republic. Due to the great interest and for better group work, we decided to divide the groups into two and ended up with not one, but two hybrid courses, one after the other. 
For many teachers, these blended learning webinars were their first course on human rights, and indeed many noted that they had not previously been familiar with Amnesty International. “For me, reaching out to new audiences with basic information about human rights norms and values is very precious,” says Stasya Denisova. “One teacher said that she even ‘dared for the first time to sign an electronic petition to support a Saudi Arabian women’s rights activist’. That’s an important and positive shift in attitudes for us.”  
We were especially pleased to read the reviews in which teachers said they had learned new techniques and tools and those praising the course program to be so engaging and interestingly designed that it almost did not feel like online work.  
Anna Vitalyevna Tolstosova, an event manager, citizenship teacher and organizer of the debating society at the “Bilimkana Bishkek” school said, “I liked the methods used during the webinars. Given the circumstances – that it was an online event, I think we managed to do everything: we figured out ways to work using different programs and received important and necessary information.” 
Irina Nikolaevna Yesina, history and citizenship teacher for years 9 – 11 at Novopokrovky middle school No.1, shared: “I especially want to mention the online course “Introduction to Human Rights” on the Amnesty Academy platform. The course is very compact, both theoretical and practical and well-designed too. I was impressed by the materials supplied, the electronic design and the use of electronic testing methods. Conveniently, it is possible to take it at any time, and sums up everything learned at the end of the course, and you automatically obtain a certificate.” 
Another unexpected benefit of going entirely online was the possibility for teachers from very remote areas of Central Asia to fully participate in the course. Their experiences enriched group discussions about the relevance of human rights education in schools outside of big cities. Teachers from Southern parts of Kyrgyzstan said that lessons about women’s rights would be especially relevant for their high school pupils. Notorious “bride kidnapping”, when very young girls are being abducted for forced marriages, is still widely spread in that part of the country. Another teacher gave an example – at one rural school, boys can have mobile phones starting from junior school. In contrast, girls are not allowed to have phones even in graduating classes. Aside from striking inequality, the teacher thought that schoolgirls were thus more vulnerable to bride kidnapping as without access to mobile phones they had no means of communication in case of abduction.  
Added value of online that would be scarcely possible in a traditional format was the sharing the experience of Amnesty experts and teachers from Ukraine, Moldova, Kazakhstan and the Netherlands who have conducted sessions on Write for Rights in their schools and communities for many years. Many participating teachers noted that the stories and work done by fellow teachers from Ukraine and Moldova inspired them to scale up ideas to introduce human rights education in their schools. 
In the end, all 67 teachers received a pack of methodical materials and engaged with the courses on the Amnesty Academy platform. More than 35 took part in one or more blended learning course elements, and 29 teachers completed the blended learning course with a certificate of completion. These teachers developed and presented their human rights and Write for Rights lesson plan. 
Overall, 95% of all teachers reported improvements in their ability to teach human rights in the classroom, particularly the right to peaceful protest and the inadmissibility of discrimination against women. 92.5% of all who passed the course confirmed that they will be able to apply this knowledge and skills in their classrooms to support Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign and have joined our Facebook group “Human Rights Educators”. 
As a result, in November-December 2020, 2084 pupils participated in a Write for Rights lesson and wrote a letter or posted a message on social media in support of human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia and Chile. 
Burul Uvaidullana Kozubayeva, a teacher trainer for the subjects of citizenship and history, praised the translation of Write for Rights HRE materials into Kyrgyz and added, “In the future to expand Amnesty blended learning course, I propose to include Kyrgyz-speaking schools and teachers. 
Irina Maslova, a history teacher and citizenship teacher at Kara-Balta Middle School – Gymnasium No. 6, shared that: “The lessons about the featured individuals who need help in the Write for Rights campaignare wonderfully thought out. The website is just great, and its educational materials are too. You can download and use informative cards, worksheets and exercises. It seemed to me that this is exactly what is needed to present to high school students. I’ve already drawn up a plan of 4 lessons for my 9th-grade citizenship class.”  
We continue to work with teachers and receive inspiring results and feedback both from teachers and students. Letters that students write in support of Write for Rights heroes are very moving and stunning drawings will lift the spirit of those who suffer from human rights abuses. We are very grateful for the courage and strength of the teachers who took part in this intensive course despite the disruption caused by the pandemic.    
Traditionally, blended learning is defined as a pedagogical method that combines face-to-face learning with online instruction. For example, it can be the use of a combination of online courses, where students can gain the necessary knowledge and face-to-face classes that can be devoted to acquiring new skills. It requires both the coach and the learner’s physical presence, with some control over the time, place, course of study or pace. Blended learning has proven to be a successful approach to improving understanding, interaction and inclusion in education.

“I found the workshop on the death penalty very useful,” shares one of the participating students. “It helped me get a sense of the situation in Asia and around the globe. I could tap into the views of different stakeholders in depth through analysing different cases. Before this session, I had never come across any data, stories or facts about the death penalty.” 
Created two years ago, following Hong Kong’s 2014 Umbrella Movement – a series of student-led pro-democracy protests, which saw massive participation from social activists and online independent journalists, the programmebrings together future journalists interested in learning how to report on issues from a human rights-based perspective. 
“A lot of them were quite young, and not studying journalism, but they wanted to do something about the situation,” shares Doriane Lau, Education Officer at Amnesty International Hong Kong, who is involved with organising the workshops in the region. “We felt it was important they know their rights as a journalist.” 
The objective of the workshops is to provide students with the right skills and tools, but also adopt an interactive format. “Students are used to one-way communication, where teachers give them information, and they conduct the analysis,” explains Doriane, 
Participative workshops are an engaging format for young people, as they are different from the lectures or talks that students are used to in formal education. The purpose should not be to provide them with information that they can analyse, but give them the tools to find the information themselves. 
Each workshop deals with a different human rights-based approach and includes a speaker session, usually led by a university educator with extensive knowledge in the particular area being discussed. It also includes a group assignment where students apply the rights-based framework and journalistic skills they have learned by reporting on a topic of their choice. 
While students are encouraged to pursue the assignment as independently as possible, Doriane shares that in her experience, it is valuable to include additional guidelines and support at this stage, such as helping students to finalise an angle around which they can focus their story before they can start conducting interviews. 
Students usually start each day by discussing their thoughts on the previous workshop’s assignment before they receive a brief introduction about the day’s programme, the main expectations and the guest speaker who is invited. The speaker then introduces the discussion on the exercise of rights, and applies it in a context that is meaningful for students. 
During a session on the rights of the child, for example, the discussion starts off with what it means to the students to exercise their human rights in their own school, and then asks the participants to reflect on some of the school’s rules and what they think about them from a rights-based perspective. 
Young people found this session particularly impactful as it challenged them to question how they could push for greater student participation in their own schools. “I realised that a lot of secondary schools in Hong Kong have poor understanding of human rights, especially the rights of the child. It was a reflective session for me, as I started to question how I could push for better civic education and student participation in my own school,” shares a participant. 
The written assignments encourage students to conduct an analysis through a human rights framework and apply the different approaches that they learn. Students refine their journalistic skills conducting interviews and writing a report. “I understood more about news writing, conducting interviews, human rights and the importance of journalism,” shares a participant. 
The open-ended nature of the assignments also helps students to explore topics that they might otherwise find difficult to discuss openly. For example, a group of students who applied the discrimination framework to the issue of LGBTI rights conducted interviews with legislative counsellors who were willing to share how they experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation. 
Giving students the freedom to focus on issues they are passionate about also encourages more personal involvement during the assignment. Another group who researched the issues faced by domestic workers collected extensive primary data through interviews with migrant domestic workers. Their final report provides a comprehensive analysis of the situation and includes recommendations on specific government policies to change in order to improve the lives of workers. 
Encouraging students to reflect on the different tasks is an important exercise in assessing the impact of the programme, and giving them an open space to discuss their thoughts. “The last session of the workshop includes a reflective session, where students can speak with the experts who lead the different modules,” shares Doriane. 
This reflective session also encourages young people to exchange ideas about how to share what they have learnt with the wider community. As a result of the session, two students decided to share their insights in their morning assemblies, while others discussed ways to raise these issues in their upcoming student election. 
A platform for participants to ask questions – whether it is a blog, or a Facebook group, ensures that they stay connected between workshops, since most of them attend different schools. 
This platform helps to update students with necessary information whether it is related to the logistics of the next workshops, upcoming assignments, or providing timely assistance if they have any questions on the workshops. 
In addition to ad-hoc communication, interactive platforms promote active participation within the programme. “We had many students come back saying they want to help out by sharing their insights from the programme in their schools, and amplifying the impact of the workshops,” shares Doriane. 
The journalism programme is an effective way to engage with a larger number of schools particularly because its design and approach cater to the needs of the formal curriculum. Since the first workshop, 40 students from 22 secondary schools have taken part in the programme. 
“Journalism training allows us to meet some of the criteria set out by the curriculum in Hong Kong,” says Doriane, referring to the liberal studies programme, taught in most high schools and that encourages students to explore different social issues. 
From a student’s point of view, the value of a rights-based approach extends beyond the scope of the workshop. “I discovered that many aspects in our daily lives can be examined with a rights framework,” shares a participant. “This helps me with my studies as well as my understanding of current affairs.” 
Amnesty International Hong Kong’s Human Rights Youth Journalist Programme will expand to university students with a new format for participants already experienced in journalism. “The level will be more in-depth,” shares Doriane, adding that the students will co-create a newspaper at the end of the programme.

What does identity mean and what role does it play in the social construction we have of others? These questions were raised by Slovenian students at the annual event Path along the Wire, which commemorates the end of Ljubljana’s occupation during the Second World War. 
Looking at the concept of identity through the cases of well-known human rights defenders who were forced to find refuge abroad, including physicist Albert Einstein, female rapper M.I.A, and author and model Waris Dirie, students addressed some of the common myths surrounding refugees and migrants living in Europe. 
Along the event, Amnesty International Slovenia organized human rights education activities for primary school students and shared information on the acts of human rights defenders to help them reflect on the meaning of the word “refugee” and discuss the different ways individuals identify themselves. “This year’s event focused on showing how people go through different experiences, and highlighting well-known people who are also refugees. Before the event we gave schools and teachers an education pack with activities explaining why people leave their homes, but also how to create a safe and inclusive environment for refugee children enrolled in Slovenian schools, which is a new phenomenon in the country,” explains Ana Cemazar, Human Rights Education Coordinator at Amnesty International Slovenia. 
 Over 40,000 people – among which 3,000 students – took part in the 3-day event, and 1,400 signatures in support of welcoming refugees were collected. 
Understanding the legal aspects of the status of a refugee is a key element to claiming and defending refugee rights. A group of activists from Amnesty International Switzerland designed an educational activity for secondary students to understand the international legal framework regulating the status of refugees. Educators and facilitators can use the Parcours Migration packas a conversation starter to introduce legal notions such as the 1951 Refugee Convention, refugee status, the principle of non-refoulement, and the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrants Workers and Members of their Families. 
The activity, conceived as a fictional journey, demonstrates how individuals fleeing their country are particularly at risk of human rights violations. Participants roll a dice to discover which simulated situations they would be confronted with as refugees. The decisions they make will then determine the next steps of their journey. 
“The activity we participated in was very good, I have been able to realize what some people face every day,” says a student. “It was very interesting. There were a lot of emotional but also shocking moments. The game format of this activity is very strong, although for us it is almost too much of a game. At some point we looked at each other and said ‘This is the end’. “When we thought about it, I just wanted to scream and cry,” shares another participant. 
For more information on how to use Parcours Migration at school, teachers and educators can contact Amnesty International Switzerland. 
To share experience of field work with young people and human rights workers, and support activism and campaigning, Amnesty International Finland has set up a webinar series on refugee rights. This online training course, which started in April, is composed of six sessions that run until September. 
Each of the sessions focuses on a different aspect of the reality of migrants and refugees in Europe, looking at the multiple causes of the global refugee crisis, border control and human rights, safety for refugees and legal routes, asylum procedures, family reunification, as well as deportation and detention. So far, approximately 200 people have signed up to follow the live sessions and chat online with staff from Amnesty International, the Finnish Refugee Council and other NGOs. Recordings of the sessions are made available online for participants to watch later.  
“We received positive feedback from people who liked the training and how easy it is to access. Activists get together in a meeting room to watch it as a group. Now we can reach people all over Finland who are looking to increase their knowledge and would like to join our campaign. This is something that can have a real impact in the long run,” says Maarit Pihkala, Human Rights Education Adviser at Amnesty International Finland. 
Registrations are open to take part in the webinar series (available in Finnish only).

How to support women’s rights activists in a country that is ranked among the 10 worst countries for gender inequality, and what happens once you’ve trained the trainer? 
In the region of Meknes, Morocco, 30 professionals including people from women’s rights groups, activists and lawyers have taken part in human rights training in response to gender-based violence and discrimination against women. Over six days, participants received legal training and advice on how to assist women at risk of physical, sexual or psychological harm. 
This form of training of trainers has since multiplied in impact and led to an increase in educational projects targeted at other women across the region. 
For Touria Bouabid, Human Rights Education Program Coordinator at Amnesty International Morocco who organizes the trainings, working directly with professionals is an essential aspect to counter a situation that remains critical for many women. 
Gender-based violence remains largely prevalent in society despite the Constitution guaranteeing equality between men and women. According to a national survey conducted in 2011, 62.8% of Moroccan women had reported suffering from an act of violence within the 12 previous months.  
Despite judicial reforms – including the removal from the Penal Code of a provision that had formerly allowed men who raped underage girls to escape prosecution by marrying their victim – discriminatory laws on inheritance and the criminalization of consensual sex between unmarried people still exist, and there is no legal framework to protect women from domestic violence. 
To assist professionals in their work, Amnesty Morocco’s training for professionals focuses on legal knowledge of international norms to provide a deeper understanding of the legislation associated with women’s rights. “The professionals we train will be able to work with women using a rights-based approach,” says Touria. 
“We also want them to be able to defend the idea that Morocco has signed international conventions on the protection of women’s rights, which means that it needs to take all necessary measures to make sure these conventions are implemented across the country,” she says. 
Moroccan women have the right to live a decent life just like men, without being raped, or suffering violence that prevents them from being fully involved in the country’s political, economic and social life. We ought to work towards this end and change this reality; by doing so, we’ll secure freedom and dignity for every woman, and build a healthier society 
Training local women’s rights defenders and legal actors has proven helpful to reinforce their professional work, but also contributes to reaching a larger number of women from different social backgrounds. “Most of the women these professionals work with on a daily basis are illiterate, with no access to information or resources to understand their basic rights. It can also be very challenging to explain in popular Moroccan Arabic what international law is, or what their rights as women are.” 
“For instance, I’ve met 16 year olds, forcibly married, abused every day – both physically and sexually – by their husbands, but who didn’t know this was not normal,” Touria says. 
Several participants have since built on their own projects to pass their knowledge to other women and tackle societal attitudes and stereotyped images. 
Amina Azatraoui is one of the women’s rights activists who participated in the training. Every day, at the college in Meknes where she teaches, Amina sees the impact gender inequalities have on the lives of many of her students: “I heard stories involving students, particularly young women, victims of sexual harassment or physical violence from relatives, sometimes even from the teaching staff.” 
“To address this issue, we first set up a counselling centre for young women to speak up about their vulnerability to violence, and seek psychological support or medical assistance. We’re now also able to offer sensitization workshops where students learn how to identify discrimination and defend their rights.” 
The workshops she set up enable young people to learn to identify and open up about the discrimination they experience. Every two months, students aged from 15 to 20 years old get together and take part in debates and participatory activities to share and discuss the challenges they face. During these sessions, young women also learn how to protect themselves against physical and sexual violence, or how to speak out about an assault in front of the authorities or in court. 
According to Amina, working with young people and giving students the opportunity to discuss freely issues such as sexuality and reproductive rights already represents a step towards equality: “I hope to change mentalities of both men and women that perceive women as inferior.” 
“Moroccan women have the right to live a decent life just like men, without being raped, or suffering violence that prevents them from being fully involved in the country’s political, economic and social life. We ought to work towards this end and change this reality; by doing so, we’ll secure freedom and dignity for every woman, and build a healthier society,” she says.

When Ana Nunes, and her friend Ana Moura, both 17 years old, heard that some 12 year-old students in their school could no longer attend an optional after-school study class because of bad behaviour and lack of commitment, they came up with an idea. 
“Some students were facing complicated issues, at home and in school, which affected their school performance. So we created an open space for them to talk about themselves and discuss issues such as bullying, discrimination, and racism,” says Ana Nunes. 
What was at first seen as challenging: wondering how to motivate students to take extra classes in their free time, and involve and motivate them, led to a very successful approach. Every Wednesday afternoon, for one hour, Ana and Ana organised a students meet-up to talk about whatever they felt like, whether it was directly related to school work or not. This proved to be very effective. 
“The pupils’ grades improved and so did their overall behaviour! They were reluctant at first but with time they trusted us more and started trusting themselves!” says Ana Nunes. 
The key to this success? The two girls offered a place free of judgment and adult authority, a place where the students felt respected and listened to, without the pressure of the school framework. “No one from the school administration ever came to watch,” explains Ana Nunes, “the presence of someone else in the room would have troubled the trust we implemented.” 
Juliana Santos, a 12 year-old student who attended the sessions, spoke of her need for a safe learning space. “I like the experience because we can talk about our problems without feeling ashamed, we are comfortable talking about serious things,” she said, “We play games aimed to make us think and debate. We’ve learned to listen to each other and respect the opinions of others.” 
As time went by these weekly meetings became essential to the students attending, “In the beginning, the students saw us as strangers and were uncomfortable talking about why they were there,” says Ana, “but when they realised we really wanted to listen, they opened up and our sessions became important for them.” Students said they missed it when, for some reason, a session was cancelled, and some even said they came to school just to attend the class. 
François was one of the first to join the group: “The older students are more understanding, they understand the way we think as teenagers. They understand our jokes better, as well as our difficulties. We are more comfortable with older students, but still we respect them,” he says. 
With this initiative, Ana Nunes and Ana Moura became the first people to implement peer education in the school. Initially five pupils joined the class and two more came along later. What came so natural to them, helping young students in difficulty is a founding pillar of Amnesty’s Human Rights Friendly Schools project. According to a teacher from the school, Marília Santos, this initiative is a result of empowerment that resonates with Amnesty’s values: “Amnesty’s approach is about making changes to improve the school environment and those two girls did exactly that,” she said. 
The Professor Reynaldo dos Santos School has been a member of the Human Rights Friendly Schools project since 2013. The project aims to empower young people and promote the active participation of all members of the school community in integrating human rights values and principles into all areas of school life. 
Since this spontaneous peer education initiative, Amnesty Portugal has deepened its work in the school. “Raising awareness about defending human rights was always a concern to the school. So the work developed by Amnesty served to reinforce this,” says Ana. This year Amnesty Portugal is training multipliers on bullying and discrimination issues to spread knowledge and skills to the other students and teachers in the school.

Twelve years ago 47 member states of the Council of Europe signed a Charter on Education for Democratic Citizenship and Human Rights Education. The document took several years to prepare and although not legally binding, it serves as an essential tool in developing human rights education. The Charter’s drafters are certain that education plays a vital role in promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law and the core values of freedom, equality and justice. Human rights education is a powerful tool which helps preventing future human rights violations and violence as well as fight racism, extremism, xenophobia, discrimination and intolerance.  
Amnesty International wholly shares this vision and has long made human rights education one of its work’s priorities. It actively engages with young people all over the world in cooperation with partners in dozens of countries creating a multilingual education community. 
In 2021 alone more than 4 million people from 212 countries and territories, engaged with HRE programmes organised by Amnesty International and its partners. And in April 2022 in Turin the Council of Europe, the Italian government as its presidency and Amnesty International along with other partners conducted a regional Forum on the present and future of citizenship and human rights education in Europe with young people. 
More than 500 human rights activists and educators, education officials and youth leaders participated in the forum. They all worked to review the Charter’s implementation in the past 5 years and to draft proposals to the Council of Europe and its member countries on ways to improve the quality of human rights education in light of the present-day realities, including the aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic and reduced access to human rights education in some European countries, such as Russia, Turkey, Belarus, Hungary and Poland. 
 Human rights education is a vital tool to ensure that we build societies that are more inclusive, diverse and respectful of human rights. But human rights education in our region is under attack — from smear campaigns against educators in Poland and censorship of discussions about LGBTI rights in Hungary to almost complete elimination of human rights education in Belarus and Russia. Young people everywhere are paying for our leaders’ failures  
In many countries of the region, including those named above, in the past few years there has been a significant increase in legal and political restrictions concerning human rights education. These can be a direct prohibition of such education in schools, restricted access for non-governmental organisations to education institutions, direct censorship of education programmes, including on the issues of gender identity or reproductive health. Moreover, in the past two years young people across the continent faced serious restrictions to access to education, including human rights education, due to the pandemic. Also, Russia’s recent invasion threatens to nullify all Ukraine’s latest achievements in developing human rights education due to a number of factors. 
Meanwhile, in Russia itself, human rights education is underrepresented within the official education system as well as outside it, and the situation is only getting worse. In the recent years a number of international organisations implementing human rights education programmes were declared “undesirable” (Association of Schools of Political Studies of the Council of Europe, Prague Civil Society Centre to name but a few) and Russian organisations designated as “foreign agents” also lost access to educational institutions. Furthermore, in March 2021 a new law came into force that requires all state educational establishments, including schools and higher education institutions, to seek approval for any international cooperation with foreign organisations. The requirement to obtain prior approval from government bodies and Russian authorities’ obsessive stifling of any alternative views on history and culture in favour of those formulated by the government that drives it, effectively represents an open censorship on educational activities. 
In Russia “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors” has been prohibited by law since 2013 which in effect blocks any educational or awareness raising activities on LGBTI rights in both formal and informal education systems. Liquidation of the Historical and Educational Society “Memorial” and closure of its 20-year-old school education programme across Russia, whereby schoolchildren worked on research projects into family history, the history of GULAG and Stalin’s repressions, became a blatant attack against all the work on young people’s civil education. 
The exclusion of Russia from the Council of Europe threatens yet further degradation of education for democratic citizenship and human rights education, whereas growing repressions against civil society threaten to kill off the last remaining initiatives in this area. 
The situation is bleaker still in Belarus, which is not in the Council of Europe but nonetheless has connections with Europe through numerous agreements covering culture and education and thus has an obligation to “encourage democratic and inclusive environment in schools”. In the past two years human rights sector has been almost entirely eliminated, including human rights education in schools, higher education establishments and other institutions. Those few educational projects that continued until summer 2021 were closed down while most non-governmental organisations working on human rights education were liquidated. Furthermore, educators and students were persecuted. Today, it can be said that human rights education in Belarus is in fact fully delegitimised. 
In such countries as Turkey, Hungary and Poland, human rights community and human rights education are also under attack. The authorities in these countries put special emphasis on supressing sexual education, gender equality and protection of LGBT+ rights. Also, there is deteriorating situation with cooperation between schools and human rights organisations and independent education centres in Poland and especially in Turkey where human rights activists are effectively denied access to the education system. 
 Against this background, at the forum in Turin, representatives of Amnesty International’s national sections in Poland and Hungary supported by the International Secretariat held a working group “Threats to human rights education: How to act?” to discuss ways of overcoming the crisis in human rights education in the region.  
Amnesty International aims to use all its experience to counter and where possible to reverse the degradation of human rights education in these countries. The organisation’s task is to develop further its education projects in Europe and Central Asia and adapt them to local conditions. Today in the region the organisation is running 85 projects in total and they are implemented in cooperation with 26 civil society organisations; 46 of these projects are being implemented within the official education system. 
In 2021 Amnesty International and its partner organisations engaged 628,703 people from within the official education system and outside it in their education projects. The previous year 2020 was particularly remarkable as the pandemic led to an increase in online education all over the world. The audience of Amnesty International’s Human Rights Academy, the movement’s main platform for online education, grew exponentially. By the end of the year the Academy had more than 200,000 registered students enrolled on 84 different courses in 25 languages. 
Moreover, another interactive micro education platform aimed at young people, Human Rights Workout, was also active. Here the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights are reviewed using game-based methods. The platform was launched in 2019 and as of December 2021 the number of students learning on the Human Rights Workout reached 10,000. The platform has three interactive modules in English, Ukrainian, Romanian, Italian, Slovak and Russian. 
In 2021 Amnesty International made a certain breakthrough in Central Asia after research into the state of human rights education in Kyrgyzstan with active cooperation of the civil society and the country’s authorities. Having discussed the research, the government made a decision to strengthen human rights education within mainstream school curriculum which is what Kyrgyzstan’s Ministry for Education is currently working on along with civil society partners, academics and Amnesty International. 
However, without expanding international efforts and strengthening solidarity of the civil society in all the European and Central Asian countries without exception, the integration of human rights education into the school curricula will remain an impossible dream. This is why Amnesty International has drawn up recommendations for the Council of Europe and its member states calling them to do their utmost to engage youth leaders in discussions about plans in the area of education, consider the interests of vulnerable groups, seek to involve non-governmental organisations in the official education system and in respect to Ukraine, Belarus and Russia support youth activism in every way, as well as independent civil society organisations, academic and teacher communities. This is especially poignant in case of Russia who is trying to isolate itself from the international community. The exclusion of the Russian civil society which is already subject to repressions from the Council of Europe’s attention and specifically from its educational activities, will result in an irreparable damage to all without exception – to the Russian society and to the Europeans.

We finish our look into the fight for Sexual and Reproductive Rights in Argentina by looking at how two different communities, in La Plata and Tucuman, address the lack of Sexual Education available to young people. 
For young people, having Sexual Education classes is key to learning about their changing bodies, desires and relationships. But, equally important, these classes are necessary for them to know their sexual and reproductive rights and learn that what they do with their bodies is their choice. 
To address this necessity, in 2006 Argentina approved a law that required all schools in the country to provide their students with Sexual Education classes. The law (known as “Ley de Educación Sexual Integral” in its original Spanish) aimed to allow students to learn about the “biological, psychological, social, emotional and ethical aspects” of sexuality, to promote “responsible attitudes towards sexuality” and to assure “equality in both treatment and opportunity for men and women”. 
However, many schools throughout the country didn’t include Sexual Education in their curriculum, be it because of budget reasons or because of religious pressure. Joaco Herrero, a young activist from La Plata, says about the lack of implementation: “most times it’s negligence, but there are schools that even position themselves against the law, avoid talks of the topic in class and censor students”. 
For Herrero, his fight started in 2015. 9 years after the law was approved, Herrero’s school still didn’t have any kind of Sexual Education. Herrero, who had recently reached out to Amnesty International Argentina to learn more about their work, decided to take action and coordinated the first Sexual and Reproductive Rights workshop in his school. “We created the workshop as a reaction to the school’s lack of response” Herrero explains. 
The workshop was a success. That first workshop led to many others, the number increasing every year. “We did six this past year, each was attended by 30 students” says Herrero. The workshops have different topics, but they all revolve around gender and sexuality: sex, abortion, youth, equality. The students like the workshops because of “the comfortable environment we created” points out Herrero. Students can express themselves, ask questions, there are no taboos. It’s all about participation. 
Even though the school implemented basic Sex Education classes after the workshops gained popularity, it wasn’t enough. “They were irregular, inefficient and simply not enough” explains Herrero, “they weren’t continuous, and they mostly focused on biology”. Herrero and a group of friends decided then to create a student group, UTOPIA, to represent those students that felt ignored by the school administration. In 2017, they ran for the Student Centre elections and won. It was a big step: “it opened up the doors for us to contribute on measures”. Thanks to their new influencing position and the constant debate between administration and students, they achieved a curriculum reform that finally included Sexual Education as a continued subject. 
“I think Human Rights Education not only helped teach students about Sexual Education, but it also gave us the tools to know what the law said and gave us the possibility to claim our rights from the school’s administration” says Herrero of the importance of Human Rights Education. 
Thanks to Herrero’s ongoing efforts, this year his school will, for the first time, provide Sexual Education classes. They are optimistic. “The curriculum has been designed by school teachers who have worked in optative classes on gender-based violence and diversity” explains Herrero. Their hope is that the law is finally properly implemented in the school, so that young people are “empowered through their rights”. “This will not only make students realise when their rights are violated, but will also help improve their knowledge of their personal and sexual relationships, giving them access to their right to choose” predicts Herrero. 
Other regions in the country live through an even more difficult situation. These are traditional areas, many times impoverished and with a lack of educational possibilities, where religion is a way of life and sexuality is taboo. Schools provide little or no Sexual Education, and many young people don’t even have the possibility to access the little information available on sexual health. 
One of these regions is Tucuman, in northwest Argentina. Sexual Education wasn’t even considered an option in the area, and none of the schools have implemented the law. Many young people are only able to attend primary school before having to drop off. Tucuman, strongly Catholic, declared itself “the city that embraces life” to position itself against the abortion bill. 
In 2017, through Amnesty International Human Rights Education programme the “It’s My Body” project (present in Argentina, Chile and Peru and focusing on teaching youth about their sexual and reproductive rights) was launched in Tucuman. In partnership with ANDHES, a law firm specialised in human rights, the project worked to bring the opportunity to learn about sexuality to a group of young people from Tucuman. 
Agustina Taibo Soler, one of the coordinators from ANDHES, explains learning about their rights has been “a radical change” in the lives of the members of the group. The group is a weekly opportunity for them to “talk about things they can’t talk about anywhere else” she says. This opportunity has allowed them to learn about things they never knew about, particularly regarding sexuality, domestic violence and minority discrimination. 
The workshops they participate in have created a lot of positive impact. Young participants explain how, before the workshops, they were completely against abortion. Now, they realise they didn’t really understand the issue and they even asked for the green handkerchiefs that, in Argentina, mean support for the right to abortion. 
Their new knowledge about their rights, which is defined by Taibo Soler as “eye-opening”, has however been a cause of tension within families. The young activists’ families are happy about them acquiring new knowledge and tools, coming back to education, however, they don’t support the topics the workshops focus on. At home, if they want to talk about what they have learned, they are either silenced or told they are wrong. 
However, the group has planted the seed of activism and social justice in these young people. A group of participants helped a friend talk to his mother when she kicked him out after he told her he was gay. Thanks to their intervention, the boy and his mother are in speaking terms again. 
The young activists continue to do their work, talking and learning, taking action and opening conversations with their friends, breaking taboos and creating a community of informed youth that can, finally, claim their rights. As for the future, they just want to keep on learning, and keep on fighting.

In a bid to break down barriers, smash stereotypes and encourage people to take action, an innovative educational online course focusing on the rights of refugees will be rolled out globally to mark World Refugee Day (20 June), said Amnesty International.  
The course, which is open to all, covers a spectrum of issues in a straightforward way. Human Rights: The Rights of Refugees includes modules on how to defend the rights of refugees, the role of governments in protecting refugees and preventing human rights violations against them and how to challenge discrimination. 
“Every day, all over the world, people make one of the most difficult decisions of their lives: to leave their country in search of a better, safer life. Yet, there is a still a lack of knowledge about the rights of the people who have been forced to flee. Our course provides a unique opportunity to learn about the rights of refugees in a simple accessible way, while encouraging and empowering the public to take action,” said Barbara Weber, Amnesty International’s Human Rights Education Director. 
The free educational online course is aimed at people aged 15 and above, and is also available for teachers to use in class. Through a series of interesting exercises and activities taught by Amnesty International’s experts, activists and campaigners, people can learn about the rights of refugees at their own pace. 
The course initially ran from 2016-2017, with over 88,000 people enrolling. It is hoped even more people will participate this year and build on the impact achieved so far.  
After Montreal’s Olympic Stadium became home to around 1,000 refugees last year, 27-year-old nurse Gabrielle* was motivated to volunteer her time at the stadium and nursing skills after completing Amnesty International’s online course.  
“As a nurse, it was natural for me to volunteer in the crisis situation. I’d just finished the online course, which strengthened my convictions and opinions, and motivated me to get involved. It was very stressful, as I had no idea what I was getting into, but I’m really glad I did it,” said Gabrielle. 
The nurse is making her voice heard in other ways too. 
“After I completed the course, I heard an MP using the term ‘illegal immigrants’ in the media. Regardless of what someone’s opinion may be, especially a person with influence, it’s essential to use the right terms, so I wrote a message, simply to explain what I thought and give the correct definitions,” said Gabrielle. 
Yacouba, a student from Mali, also took the course to broaden his knowledge of the rights of refugees so he could better support and help them. 
“The course helped me understand the difficulties experienced by people forced to leave their homes because of war, persecution or natural disaster. It helped me understand that any one of us could face these threats,” said Yacouba. 
“One of the course components that has been useful to me is the definitions. The distinction between refugees, migrants and stateless persons causes a great deal of confusion and I can now explain the differences between these different situations.” 
The course is available on edX.org, a platform founded by MIT and Harvard University.  
Amnesty International has been partnering with edX.org since 2015, to date offering three human rights education courses, covering freedom of expression, the rights of refugees and human rights defenders. 
From Kenya to Mongolia, Amnesty International also runs human rights education in a host of schools across the world, to ensure young people grow up understanding why human rights are important.

In November 2015 Amnesty International launched its first MOOC in partnership with EdX, “Human Rights: The Right to Freedom of Expression,” which is currently accessible in archived format. The course was built for participants to learn how to defend their right to freedom of expression, wherever they come from. We have collected six additional online courses on human rights from a variety of different providers, which are free of charge, and fully accessible online. 
The first half of this course provides a general overview of the core concepts in human rights, such as the notion of ethics and morals, and the principles of equality. It then moves onto covering various issues in the contemporary global human rights agenda, such as migration, terrorism, anti-corruption, intellectual property, the environment, and the rights of women and children.  Lawyer and Human Rights Professor, Jose Zalaquett, who co-teaches this course, is both a practitioner and educator. In addition to being the former President of Amnesty International‘s Executive Committee, and the Legal Department of the Peace Cooperation Committee for Chile, he heads the MOOC Chile project, which is an online platform dedicated to human rights education. 
When/Where: This course is available on Udemy throughout the year, and is self-paced.   Modules: 6 hours of lecture material.  Language:  English and Spanish. 
Amnesty International Venezuela has launched three online courses that are designed for individuals who wish to expand their knowledge of human rights: Introduction to Human Rights, Non-Discrimination and LGBT Rights, and Reduction of Armed Violence. The courses combine taught modules with interactive exercises and projects that encourage learners to reflect on the differences between various human rights violations, as well as the state’s obligation to protect human rights. While the introductory course focuses on some of the key elements and characteristics of human rights, the latter two cover more specialised knowledge about principles of non-discrimination, as well as the impact of uncontrolled proliferation of firearms and ammunition on human rights 
When/Where: All three courses are available on Learnsity and are self-paced. 
Modules: The three courses consist of approximately 45 modules in total. 
Language: Spanish 
Taught by the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, this course covers the key areas around the development of international human rights law and its enforcement. For example, some of the modules focus on questions such as, ‘when may human rights be restricted?’ or ‘when must the state intervene to protect human rights?’ Drawing on different jurisdictions and case law, the course takes a comparative approach to studying topics such as human rights in employment relationships, economic and social rights in development, and human rights in the fight against terrorism. 
When/Where: This course resumes on 15 June 2016 on EdX. 
Modules: The course is 10 weeks long, and the estimated time commitment is 6 to 8 hours per week. 
Language: English 
As a global actor in the field of human rights, this course is concerned with the challenges and factors that affect the European Union’s performance in relation to human rights. The modules are accompanied with case studies that illustrate some of the initiatives undertaken by the EU to fulfil its internal and external human rights obligations. The multi-instructor format allows for a wide representation of different EU member states, such as Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Denmark, across the course. 
When/Where: This course resumes on 21 June 2016 on EdX. 
Modules: The course is 7 weeks long, and the estimated time commitment is 4 to 6 hours per week. 
Language(s): English 
This course provides an overview of women’s health and human rights,from infancy to all ages, and covers topics from access to education, and food, to reproductive health, violence against women, and sex trafficking.  The four critical themes that inform the various modules are being born and female discrimination, poverty, unequal access to basic services, and different forms of gender-based violence.  
Designed by activist and the Global Fund for Women’s President Anne Firth Murray, the modules include lectures and interviews with a range of scholars, experts and NGO leaders. A fortnightly component called ‘Tea Time with Anne’, also allows students to submit questions that are relevant to the topics covered, and comment on current events related to women’s health and human rights. 
When/Where: Although the course is not currently in session, the archived material is available on Lagunita, Stanford’s online learning platform. 
Modules: The course is 8 weeks long 
Language: The course is available in English, with Spanish subtitles. 
Although this course is not directly covering human rights it is fundamentally connected with activism and the psychological theories that were developed to understand what motivates individuals to participate in collective action and work towards social change. In order to practically apply these theories, the course uses nine case studies that were created using one of the most extensive collections of oral histories from women activists around the world. In addition to the lecture modules, the material includes video excerpts with these activists, interactive digital timelines, and study groups.   
When/Where: Although the course is not currently in session, the archived material is available on EdX. 
Modules: The course is 7 weeks long.

Amnesty International’s online education portal, Amnesty Human Rights Academy, now offers a curated Teacher’s Guide aimed at educators of students aged 10 and up. Teachers can use this guide to supplement their lesson plans with online courses about human rights, each lasting from 20 minutes to a few hours. Some of the topics covered include an introduction to human rights, freedom of expression, and human rights defenders. 
Amnesty International has produced many resources for teachers before, including our Human Rights Friendly Schools framework and a wide range of other toolkits. The Teacher’s Guide, however, is our first global resource based on a flipped classroom approach. In a traditional model, students learn new information in the classroom and later apply that knowledge through homework. The flipped classroom reverses this: Students learn new information independently at home and later apply it through classroom exercises. 
The flipped classroom approach isn’t always ideal, but it does have its benefits. Some students that struggle in a formal classroom environment do much better with online courses, where they can proceed at their own pace. Online courses on the Academy don’t require their undivided attention, and they don’t pressure students with time-limited tests. Flipped classrooms also often entail group discussions and joint exercises, so students have greater opportunity for input and participation, and their individual needs are more likely to be addressed. This can also be more stimulating for teachers, because instead of reciting information, they can actively and creatively engage and discuss with their students. 
Of course, many teachers already do this, even if they don’t call their approach “flipped classroom”! But fewer are equipped to do this on the subject of human rights, unless it’s directly part of their curriculum. The Teacher’s Guide on the Amnesty Human Rights Academy aims to fill this gap by pointing teachers to our free learning resources on human rights that they can use for their own flipped classroom. 
The benefits of the flipped classroom approach are even more pronounced in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current situation for schools varies from country to country, and even within countries. But one thing that teachers everywhere now face, in their own unique ways, is the need to adapt. 
If a school is physically closed to students, and teachers need to rely on online resources to keep students engaged in learning, the Teacher’s Guide can form the basis of lesson plans for distance learning. Teachers can direct students to take an online course on their own, and later they can follow up with group discussions in a virtual classroom. Learning outcomes are listed at the beginning of each course, so teachers can determine if a course is suitable for their students and for their curriculum. 
If your school is physically open to students, the guide is still just as relevant. Instead of taking the learning further in a virtual classroom, teachers can engage students through hands-on classroom activities. 
The guide is useful beyond the scope of the pandemic, too. As we look into the future of education, we see necessary pivots and shifts. Online courses will continue to be one of many tools available to educators in all fields, allowing for structured learning regardless of location. 
Maybe you’re a social studies teacher covering indigenous peoples of your country—have your students take the short course on Indigenous Peoples’ Land Rights. If you have younger students and want to address the basics, have students take An Introduction to Human Rights. If your classes are now online and you’re concerned about students’ online safety, introduce them to Digital Security and Human Rights. 
The guide is meant to be a starting point, a window into the Amnesty Human Rights Academy and what it can offer to educators interested in human rights. Teachers may find that, after exploring the Academy and the rest of the course catalog, they see other learning opportunities available to their students. Educators often find their own creative solutions!
