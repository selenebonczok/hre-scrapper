His continued imprisonment only prolongs their suffering.” 
At the end of January 2019, a Chinese court found human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang guilty of “subverting state power” and handed him a prison sentence of four and a half years. Amnesty International described the verdict as a gross injustice. 
But on April 5, 2020, Wang Quanzhang was released and entered a 14-day quarantine. He was reunited with his family on April 27 in Beijing. His wife who tirelessly campaigned for his release also credited supporters of Amnesty: “Wang Quanzhang is finally home. Your work and help played a big part in bringing him home. In the past five years, we couldn’t have kept fighting without your continuous support. We are very thankful for having all of you by our side in this journey.”

0,South Sudan: Evidence of violations and illicit concealment of arms must spur UN to renew arms embargo,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/south-sudan-evidence-of-violations-and-illicit-concealment-of-arms-must-spur-un-to-renew-arms-embargo/,"Amnesty International visited 12 military camps in South Sudan Site visits and satellite imagery reveal multiple forces violating arms embargo Child soldiers, illicit concealment and diversion of arms also documented The UN Security Council must renew and strengthen enforcement of the arms embargo...","The UN Security Council must renew and strengthen enforcement of the arms embargo on South Sudan, Amnesty International said today, exposing new evidence that multiple security forces are breaching it and concealing weapons amid a volatile security situation. Next month the Security Council is set to vote on a resolution that would renew the embargo, which currently expires on 31 May 2020. 
Earlier this year, the organization’s investigators gained access to 12 military training and cantonment sites across the country run by members of formerly opposed forces including the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), Sudan People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition (SPLA-IO) and South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA), as well as the so-called “Organized Forces” of the police, fire brigade, and wildlife service. 
Amnesty International discovered evidence of newly imported small arms and ammunition, illicit concealment of weapons, and diversion of armoured vehicles for military uses not approved under the arms transfer licenses. Government and former opposition forces’ reporting on security arrangements actively deceived Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)-supported monitors, showing an urgent need for meticulous, independent verification. 
“The African Union has dubbed 2020 the year to ‘silence the guns’ on the continent, which, as they have stated, includes taking measures to prevent UN arms embargo violations. Renewing the embargo on South Sudan is a crucial part of this effort. Weapons have been used to commit horrific human rights violations and war crimes throughout the conflict,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“The UN arms embargo hasn’t been a panacea, but the situation would almost certainly be worse without it in place. The ceasefire continues to be broken sporadically, the implementation of critical security, governance and accountability arrangements are persistently delayed, and South Sudan – awash with small arms – is also facing the public health crisis posed by COVID-19. Now is not the time to let even more weapons flow into this volatile mix.” 
Evidence of UN arms embargo violations 
Most of the hundreds of rifles and other small arms that Amnesty International investigators observed in the hands of soldiers were acquired prior to the embargo the UN Security Council imposed on all of South Sudan in July 2018. However, several bodyguards for prominent generals from government and opposition forces alike, who would have first access to newly acquired weapons, carried models of Eastern European weapons never before documented in the country (see technical addendum for more details). Amnesty International therefore believes that these weapons were brought into South Sudan in violation of the arms embargo. 
Amnesty International has also acquired verified photographs of ammunition used by the National Security Service (NSS) at Luri, a highly secretive NSS base outside South Sudan’s capital, Juba. The images show Chinese cartridges manufactured in 2016, after China’s last acknowledged sale to South Sudan. Either these cartridges breached the arms embargo, were secretly sold beforehand, or were acquired from a third-party seller who would have broken the embargo or illicitly diverted the ammunition. 
Small arms imports are not the only likely violations. Sources have told Amnesty International that at the time the arms embargo was established, the South Sudan government’s fleet of Mi-24 attack helicopters was dysfunctional and grounded. Since then it has acquired spare parts to refurbish the helicopters, violating the arms embargo. 
Satellite imagery analysis by Amnesty International shows that several of the helicopters underwent significant maintenance at Luri and Juba International Airport in October 2018 and have been flown several times since. Two aircraft were missing twice from the ramp in Juba, on 4 March and 10 March 2019, and one was missing on 10 February 2020. There are many reasons the aircraft could have flown, but it is noteworthy that in March 2019, fighting took place against the National Salvation Front in Yei, in the southern part of the country. The Mi-24s are especially problematic in the context of South Sudan, where the heavy armed gunships have unfettered opportunity to strafe ground targets with rockets and machine guns and have been used in attacks that have unlawfully killed and injured civilians. 
“Just one of these attack helicopters costs USD $36 million, and parts and maintenance come at a premium, particularly when these components violate a UN arms embargo. Given the tremendous challenges facing South Sudan’s grossly under-funded health and social welfare systems – particularly in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic – priority must be given to protecting people’s health and livelihoods, rather than purchasing and importing arms. The embargo must remain, be strengthened and independent monitors based in South Sudan must be mandated to inspect exempted shipments,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Weapons hidden from monitors 
As part of the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (R-ARCSS) signed in September 2018, government and opposition forces committed to moving troops to joint cantonment sites, turning in their weapons to independently monitored armouries, and beginning a training process to form unified forces as a step towards building a new military. 
However, Amnesty International investigators did not find this disarmament process occurring at any of the 12 sites visited. Some fighters did not bring their weapons to the cantonment sites, as a wariness of the peace process prompted SSPDF and opposition forces to retain their arms. In other cases, fighters arrived with weapons but then hid them away in their dwellings rather than turn them in. 
The only site that had a nominally established armoury was Gorom, where the special VIP protection force is being formed and trained. In a presentation to diplomats and independent ceasefire monitors, the brigadier general leading the training there said they had dedicated four shipping containers to store weapons. However, when Amnesty International researchers requested the containers be opened, they discovered they were all stuffed with bags of grain stacked to the ceiling, and only a handful of small arms were laid against the door of a single container. 
The government carefully orchestrates what monitors can see and blocks access to strategic sites, thereby effectively largely controlling what information is reported to IGAD. For example, in December 2018, when three ceasefire monitors and their driver attempted to gain entry to Luri, NSS officers arbitrarily detained them, blindfolding, handcuffing and physically assaulting them. The monitors were turned away after NSS agents stole their money and valuables. 
Child soldiers and other violations 
During the investigation, Amnesty International observed child soldiers present in at least two cantonment and training sites, within ranks of government and opposition forces, including the VIP protection force. UNICEF estimates there are 19,000 children used by armed forces and armed groups in South Sudan as of late July 2019. Only 53 have been released from barracks, bases and cantonment sites as at 7 February 2020. 
In February 2020, the government signed an action plan with the UN to end and prevent all grave violations against children. The SPLA-IO and SSOA endorsed the plan which will apply to the opposition forces as they unify with government forces. Two weeks after the signing of the action plan, on 26 February, 15 children associated with armed forces and armed groups were released, but more needs to be done to end the perpetration of violations against children affected by conflict and holding those responsible for it to account.  
Besides blatant UN arms embargo violations, the Government of South Sudan has also violated sales agreements for legally acquired weapons. In 2014, it purchased armoured vehicles from STREIT Group, a Canadian company with a major manufacturing plant in the United Arab Emirates that typically supplies African countries. At the time of the sale, the Government of South Sudan promised only to use the vehicles for policing. 
However, photographs obtained by Amnesty International show the vehicles being used in military operations against opposition forces, in violation of the sales agreement. And during its recent field investigation, Amnesty International researchers observed one STREIT Typhoon armoured vehicle in Western Equatoria State in the south-west of the country, a tense strategic area that saw persistent fighting from 2016 until 2019. This shows that the government continues its practice of illicit diversion. 
“Until forces in South Sudan stop illegally concealing weapons, and use the ones they have responsibly, the arms embargo must stay in place. The security situation in South Sudan is too fragile while basic international norms, such as the prohibition of the recruitment and use of child soldiers, continue to be violated. South Sudan must seriously tackle these problems and the UN Security Council must renew the arms embargo to stem the flow of weapons into the country,” said Deprose Muchena.

Long-time member Kim tells us how she is continuing her human rights activism, from home. 
Here is what she wrote: 
This weekend my kids and I created a virtual protest in front of a virtual legislature, with LEGO! My son dug deep in his LEGO collection, finding figures; my daughter used her talent for exceedingly TINY printing to make up the protest signs. I cut up cotton swabs for handles and glued them to the tiny signs. We printed an old photo of the Alberta legislature I had on the computer. This is a pretty basic kids’ diorama, but we had so much fun putting it together! My oldest was even helpful with looking around on the internet for good slogans to use! What an educational opportunity for discussion of human rights and using our voices of dissent for change! 
Together, we can make a difference for human rights, even when we’re apart during the COVID-19 crisis! Over the past few weeks of self-isolation, my local Amnesty group and I have been talking about ways to stay connected, and ways to continue our human rights advocacy. We may not be able to take our message to the streets, but we can still take ACTION!  
Sharing creative visuals and activities might not seem like activism, but they inspire us all to keep thinking about protecting and defending human rights. Taking action online can be very powerful! Keep signing online petitions and writing letters; hold governments accountable for their policies. 
During a crisis like COVID-19, governments sometimes implement measures without enough oversight or without end dates, so it’s important we stay vigilant! 
Everything’s cancelled, except our commitment to human rights!

0,US military sheds some light on civilian casualties from shadowy war in Somalia,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/us-military-sheds-some-light-on-civilian-casualties-from-shadowy-war-in-somalia/,"Reacting to the publication today of US Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) first quarterly assessment of civilian casualties resulting from its operations in Africa, which acknowledges that two Somali civilians were killed and three injured in an air strike, Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy...","Reacting to the publication today of US Africa Command’s (AFRICOM) first quarterly assessment of civilian casualties resulting from its operations in Africa, which acknowledges that two Somali civilians were killed and three injured in an air strike, Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for Eastern Africa, said: 
“This first regular public report acknowledging AFRICOM’s role in civilian casualties is a welcome glimmer of transparency in more than a decade of deadly military operations that until now have been shrouded in secrecy. Now there must be accountability and reparation for the victims and their families – the US military has still neither contacted nor offered reparation to the families of any of the civilians it has admitted to killing. 
“There also needs to be an analysis of a wider range of strikes than those covered in this report, which leaves out dozens of strikes by only looking at the period after 1 February 2019. A year ago, following a ground-breaking Amnesty International report, AFRICOM pledged to review all of its operations in Somalia to assess whether it had misreported civilian casualties, but it has still not made the results public. 
“It’s a positive step for AFRICOM to give bereaved Somali families the opportunity to self-report civilian casualties via its website. However, this will not serve the vast majority of impacted civilians who live in remote areas where smartphones are banned and internet access is poor. Alternative means should be made available, including through establishing a mechanism in Mogadishu to allow clan elders or elected representatives to speak on behalf of civilians whose loved ones have been killed by US air strikes.” 
Background 
Today’s AFRICOM report reviews 91 air strikes it carried out in Somalia between 1 February 2019 and 31 March 2020. Out of 27 alleged civilian casualty incidents in that period – citing media reports as well as independent NGO reports from Amnesty International and others – the report “closes” 20 incidents and leaves seven open and under review. Among these are two covered in an Amnesty International investigation released earlier this month. 
Through gathering extensive testimonial evidence and expert analysis of images and video from strike sites, satellite imagery, and weapons identification, Amnesty International has investigated nine separate cases since 2017 where US air strikes have killed a total of 21 civilians and injured 11 more. Some of these involved to apparent violations of international humanitarian law. 
In contrast, AFRICOM has now admitted to a total of just four civilian deaths and three injuries in two incidents.

“While this represents a significant step for Saudi Arabia if implemented, the country’s continued use of the death penalty reached a shocking high last year with 184 recorded executions,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Regional Director. 
“The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment; no country should still be using it and Saudi Arabia’s record is particularly bad in this respect. Saudi Arabia must now establish an official moratorium on executions as a first step towards abolishing the death penalty completely. 
“It should also not be forgotten that dozens of peaceful human rights activists remain detained following convictions in grossly unfair trials solely for campaigning for equality and justice in a vastly repressive environment.” 
The Saudi Arabian authorities yesterday announced that the country will no longer use the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime. The death penalty will be replaced with a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. 
According to information obtained by Amnesty International, the Royal Decree excludes crimes under the counter-terror law. It is unclear what juvenile offenders would instead be sentenced to if tried under this law. Amnesty International has documented the Saudi Arabian authorities’ misuse of the counter-terror law, which has overly broad and vague definitions of “terrorism” and of a “terrorist crime,” and contains a number of provisions which criminalize peaceful expression of views. 
Saudi Arabia has for years flouted international law prohibiting the use of the death penalty against people below the age of 18 at the time of the crime. Amnesty International has long campaigned for the quashing of the death sentences of Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon – three young men from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a minority who were all arrested while under the age of 18 and are at imminent risk of execution following grossly unfair trials before the Specialized Criminal Court. 
The authorities have yet to publish the Royal Decree containing the announcement publicly, and its implementing regulations remain unclear. To Amnesty International’s knowledge, families of those sentenced to death have not yet received any information about cases of their loved ones. 
Last week, Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court issued a directive for courts to end discretionary flogging punishments, and instead, replace them with jail time and/or fines. It is still unclear whether this applies to mandatory flogging punishments for other offences under Shari’a, including for alcohol use and sexual offences. 
Law on Juveniles 
Recent announcement follows the Law on Juveniles, issued in 2018, which prevented judges from imposing discretionary death sentences on those under 15 years old. It did not stop them from using the death penalty in cases of those who are convicted of hadd crimes (those with fixed and severe punishments under Shari’a) or crimes punishable by qisas (retaliation), a category of crimes under Shari’a in which murder and bodily harm are punishable by the same harm, such as the death penalty for murder and infliction of the same injury for bodily harm. The law therefore fell short Saudi Arabia’s obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
The announcement, which is a step forward from the Law on Juveniles, must be followed by clearly implementing regulations which do not exclude any minors from the reform. 
Background 
In its annual Death Penalty report, Amnesty International revealed that Saudi Arabia executed a record number of people in 2019, despite an overall decline in executions worldwide. The Saudi authorities put 184 people to death last year, the highest number recorded using Amnesty International’s research logs citing Ministry of Interior figures since 2000.

Some claimants seeking to enter Canada have already been turned back to an uncertain fate in the US, potentially in violation of Canada’s international legal obligations under the Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture. 
The federal government has introduced some positive exceptions to the general ban it introduced last month. People crossing at land ports of entry who were exempt under the Safe Third Country Agreement will now be permitted to make their claims in Canada, as will US citizens, stateless persons and minors regardless of how they arrive. However, Amnesty International maintains that the measure puts some refugee claimants in danger and is out of step with public health measures. 
“Although the government of Canada continues to insist that it takes its non-refoulement obligations seriously, there is no legal basis to support that claim,” said Marisa Berry Mendez, Tactical and Crisis Campaigner at Amnistie internationale Canada francophone. “For weeks now, we have heard about an arrangement between the US and Canada, but the details have never been disclosed. There is a total lack of transparency about what happens to claimants who are denied entry at the border,” she added. 
The decision to renew the refugee ban comes on the heels of a worrying new policy adopted by the Trump administration. It allows for the expulsion of migrants, including possible refugee protection claimants, from the US without a hearing to the “country of last transit or home country.” Disturbingly, it contains no exemption for unaccompanied minors. It has already been used to expel thousands of migrants on the US southern border, including children, as well as a handful of migrants on the northern border. It is yet unclear whether refugee protection claimants who are refused entry into Canada at the US border could be swept up in the policy. 
Of the new US policy, Justin Mohammed, Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, said the following: “this policy decision is only the latest salvo in Donald Trump’s ruthless campaign to systematically dismantle refugee protection in the US.  Is it acceptable for Canada to deny refugee protection claimants entry when they face the possibility of detention in inhumane conditions, or even summary expulsion from the US? We know there is a better way. These refugee protection claimants could easily be subject to quarantines and testing right here in Canada, as is the case for other cross border travellers who are allowed to enter Canada.” 
The renewed border measure, as outlined in the Order in Council, is valid until 21 May 2020.

April 27, 2020 
Dear Premier Horgan and Deputy Commissioner Strachan, 
Amnesty International is writing this Open Letter to share our concerns and urge the provincial government and the RCMP to take effective and decisive action in response to an attack carried out against the Tiny House Warriors camp on April 19, 2020. The Tiny House Warriors camp is located near Blue River, in unceded Secwepemc territory in the interior of British Columbia. Indigenous land and human rights defenders have maintained a full-time presence there since July 2018, to uphold collective sovereignty and jurisdiction in opposition to the ongoing expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline and construction of associated work camps. 
At this time, we are writing to you jointly as we consider both the provincial government and the RCMP to have important responsibilities in responding to this incident so as to ensure that: 
Amnesty International has been able to conduct interviews with individuals familiar with the incident, including an eyewitness, and to review a range of publicly available materials.  
On April 19, at approximately 10:45 pm, Kanahus Manuel, a Secwepemc land defender, and a male Indigenous land defender who were in the Tiny House Warriors camp heard a noise suggestive of a disturbance outside. Three men and one woman had forcefully driven off-road vehicles through a number of large signs and banners that mark the camp’s entrance. 
The three men, who were demonstrably aggressive, tore down several red dresses set up at the camp as a tribute to missing and murdered Indigenous women, girls, and Two Spirit people, before physically attacking the male Indigenous land defender. Kanahus Manuel had turned on the high beams of her truck to illuminate the attackers but feared for her safety and ran for cover to one of the larger tiny houses. One of the intruders got into her truck, where the keys were still in the ignition, and drove it at high speed into the house in which she had sought refuge. The impact shook the home substantially, causing Kanahus Manuel to fall and knocking numerous items onto the floor. She had been shining a light from the window to make it evident that she was inside. The intruder then drove the truck into a telephone pole.  
Throughout the attack, Kanahus Manuel and the intruders had verbal exchanges, some of which were recorded on her phone and included misogynistic and racist comments. The incident lasted about 25 minutes. As soon as the intruders left the camp Kanahus Manuel began contacting family, friends and allies for assistance.  
Amnesty International is very concerned about the violence, threats and property damage that occurred and more generally about the menacing nature of the attack. The impact of this attack is heightened given the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Residents of the Tiny House Warriors camp have been diligent about implementing physical-distancing and other measures in response to the virus and are very disturbed that the individuals who carried out this attack did so in total disregard of those protective restrictions. 
We are aware that there is an RCMP investigation underway. We urge and expect that those responsible for the investigation will consider the likelihood that this may be a hate crime. We are also aware of tensions that exist between the Tiny House Warriors and the RCMP due to past arrests of residents of the camp and their supporters. In this context, it will be important that the investigation proceed in a manner that builds the trust and confidence of the Tiny House Warriors and Secwepemc leadership.   
Tiny House Warriors land defenders and First Nations leadership have emphasized to Amnesty International that they remain very fearful about the possibility of further incidents of this nature. In such circumstances, governments have a responsibility to take steps to provide reasonable measures of effective protection that are requested by human rights defenders. We urge the government to discuss appropriate protection measures with the Tiny House Warriors community and with First Nations leadership. 
The urgency of a strong response to this incident is all the greater as it is part of an ongoing history of harassment, intimidation, attacks and virulent online threats against the Tiny House Warriors. More widely it reflects growing concerns about vilification, threats and attacks against human rights defenders in Canada, particularly women and Indigenous rights defenders, actively engaged in campaigns and awareness building with respect to Indigenous land rights and the climate impact of the oil and gas industry.  Amnesty International has, in fact, frequently reported that this pattern of attacks against human rights defenders is increasing throughout the Americas. 
Amnesty International wrote to you, Premier Horgan, alongside Prime Minister Trudeau and all other provincial and territorial Premiers, on March 5, 2020, drawing attention to the worsening pattern of threats and attacks against human rights defenders in Canada and urging that governments across the country take individual and collective steps to provide more visible support and protection to defenders. We also wrote to Premier Kenney on September 10, 2019, noting concerns that the tone and nature of various aspects of his government’s “fight back strategy” would expose human rights defenders to greater risks. Notably it is reported that individuals involved in this recent attack against the Tiny House Warriors camp may have been driving vehicles with Alberta license plates. 
Incidents of this sort cannot be allowed to proliferate, and the nature of the threats and violence most certainly cannot be allowed to build. The BC government’s obligations under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, implemented provincially through the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, as well as the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders are at stake. 
We urge the government of British Columbia and the RCMP to respond decisively to this incident in a manner that demonstrates full recognition of the important role played by Indigenous, land and environmental human rights defenders in the province and sends a strong message that attacks and threats against them will not be tolerated. 
Sincerely,

If implemented, this will be a significant step towards respecting the rights to life, to security of person and to freedom from cruel treatment. Does it go far enough? Absolutely not. So Amnesty International is taking this moment to call on Saudi Arabia to take a big step: temporarily halt all executions while a roadmap to total abolition is created. 
In another positive move, Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court issued a directive in mid April for courts to end discretionary flogging punishments. Humane replacements could include jail time, fines or community service. It is still unclear whether this applies to mandatory flogging punishments for other offences under Shari’a law, including for alcohol use and sexual offences.

At Amnesty International we have extensive experience of dealing with traumatic stories and images – unfortunately this comes with the job of exposing human rights abuses. But experiencing these stories and images can cause what specialists call ‘vicarious trauma’, where we can feel real personal emotional responses to what we are viewing on our screens, even when it hasn’t directly happened to us. While vicarious trauma is a worst case scenario, it’s very normal for everyone to be feeling some emotional distress at the moment, and we need to be aware of that and take care of ourselves and others. 
If you are exposed to upsetting material your brain has the capacity to experience feelings of distress similar to those you would experience had you been there. Human brains are wired to try to protect us from anything that might be a threat to our safety, and when we see something shocking, our brains decide very quickly whether we are safe or whether we need to react. Chemicals like cortisol are released in the body to ready us for action. We sometimes call this response ‘fight, flight or freeze’. When experienced in everyday life, they can make us feel panicked, stressed, and unwell. 
Just as Amnesty understands the need to mitigate the impact of viewing distressing material, everyone needs to look after themselves in this digital age when they have been exposed to disturbing or upsetting content for long periods at a time. While it’s good to keep in mind that each person is different, and will find different coping mechanisms helpful, here are some suggestions that might work for you: 
It can be easy to dismiss signs that you are being affected by emotional distress but if you feel that your mood and behaviour are shifting because you’re consuming material which is making you worried, angry or stressed, give yourself the space you need to acknowledge this. Allow yourself time to process your experiences.   
There are lots of online resources which you might find helpful – here is just one with lots of advice on how to look after your mental wellbeing when you’re consuming a barrage of difficult material: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yZrcCFpp2o 
Connect with people you trust and let them know how you’re feeling. The chances are many people will be feeling similar, and it may help to chat with a friend, colleague or family member so that you can share your fears and worries with them. 
This could be a great time to keep that resolution to yourself to stop taking your phone to bed – this has been reported as helping you sleep better. 
Another good tip is to try to make sure you’re getting enough sleep in general.  It’s easy to stay up late streaming your favourite series, but it can be really beneficial to try to keep to a regular sleep routine and get 8 hours of sleep a night. 
We all need to take a screen break from time to time as this is so important for our general wellbeing. But this doesn’t just mean a break from your inbox, it can also apply to the amount of time you are spending online reading the news in general. Instead of just reading short social media posts and the latest headlines, it could be beneficial to set aside some time to read one or two well-researched articles every week. 
You could also take some time out for meditation or other calming techniques such as these: 
Grounding is a technique that helps to get your mind and body working together in the here and now, and is useful when you’re feeling overwhelmed. 
You could start by trying any combination of the following: 
You can also try a technique called ‘attention switching’. This is not the same as trying to suppress a thought or emotion, but involves switching attention between alternatives. 
If you would like to try this, just bring to mind an image that makes you feel safe, connected or protected. Make it a conscious process as you switch between the image and the one you are struggling with. Talk to yourself as you switch! Remember this is not an exercise to block out your experience, but to help you exert control over it.  
Focusing on your breathing can help to calm and regulate your bodily reactions and give you a sense of being anchored. There are many simple breathing techniques which you can use to help yourself feel calmer. Here are just a few for you to try: 
To come out of the breathing space, notice once more the contact your body makes with the chair and your feet on the floor. Allow the light to begin to filter through your eyelids and gradually lift your eyelids to allow the outside world back in. 
One of the most important things we can do in these uncertain times is to remember that whenever the headlines make us feel helpless in the face of the current crisis, there are steps we can take to look after ourselves. If we all take some time to talk to others, give ourselves a break, and recognise when we are feeling overwhelmed, we will stay stronger and healthier. Now is the time to come together and ensure that our mental wellbeing remains strong during this global pandemic.

“We are devastated to learn of Dr Abdullah al-Hamid’s passing while he remained in detention for his peaceful activism. 
“Dr al-Hamid was a fearless champion for human rights in Saudi Arabia, who was determined to build a better world for all. Our thoughts are with his family and friends, who for the past eight years had been deprived of his presence as a result of the state’s inhumane repression. 
“As a prominent human rights campaigner, Dr al-Hamid’s important work continues to resonate throughout the region. He, and all other prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia, should never have been in jail in the first place. 
“We again call on the Saudi Arabian authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those still imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their human rights.” 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid 
Dr al-Hamid, 69, was a founding member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA). The organization – whose slogan is ‘Know your rights’ – was committed to promoting the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other international treaties and standards. 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid suffered from hypertension, and was told three months ago by a doctor that he needed to undergo heart surgery. He was threatened by prison authorities that if he told his family about his health condition, they would cut his communication with his family. Dr Abdullah al-Hamid had suffered a stroke on 9 April and remained in detention, despite being in a coma in the intensive care unit at al-Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh. 
As a human rights defender, writer and academic, he had written extensively on human rights and the independence of judiciary. He was a professor of contemporary literature at al-Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Riyadh before being dismissed for his activism. He is survived by his wife and eight children. 
Dr al-Hamid was prosecuted repeatedly for his peaceful work since 1993. In March 2012, he and Mohammad al-Qahtani, a fellow ACPRA founding member, were arrested and interrogated regarding their work with ACPRA and their peaceful activism. In March 2013, they were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively, on charges of “breaking allegiance to the ruler”, “questioning the integrity of officials”, “seeking to disrupt security and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations”, and “instigating international organizations against the Kingdom”.

Worker organizations report that hundreds of Amazon warehouse workers in the USA have already stayed home from work this week, citing concerns including a lack of health protection at warehouses. 
Amnesty International also called on the e-commerce giant to protect the rights of workers who speak out, amid allegations that staff have been fired after voicing safety concerns. 
“We stand in solidarity with Amazon workers who are speaking up for their rights. Amazon warehouse and delivery workers are risking their lives in the midst of a pandemic to deliver essential goods to all of us,” said Joe Westby, Researcher at Amnesty International. 
“Amazon is one of the world’s wealthiest companies and its profits are surging as a result of this crisis. It is repugnant that the company’s workforce feel their safety is not being taken seriously. Jeff Bezos needs to step up and address the legitimate and vital concerns raised by Amazon staff – profits should never be put above people. 
“It’s outrageous that Amazon is set to end its policy to give workers the option to take unlimited unpaid leave, which was just instituted in March. With reports of new COVID-19 cases emerging at warehouses in Indiana and New Jersey, employees face an impossible choice of potentially putting their health at serious risk by going to work or having to leave the company. 
“Allegations that staff have been fired for speaking out are deeply disturbing. No Amazon worker should face reprisals for speaking out about safety concerns. Amazon must ensure that workers can report concerns about health and safety risks without fear of retaliation.”  
Background 
Amnesty International wrote to the US-based company Amazon requesting information about what steps it is taking to ensure it respects labour rights during the COVID-19 crisis but did not receive a response. 
Companies have a responsibility to respect all human rights wherever they operate in the world, including protecting their workers and providing safe working conditions. They must adhere to health and safety standards and properly implement national health advice in order to minimise workplace exposure to the virus. 
Under international laws and standards, employers must put arrangements in place that allow workers to report on health and safety risks. Workers’ safety concerns must be listened to and addressed through social dialogue. There must not be retaliation against the workers for raising concerns or lodging a complaint related to health and safety. 
Workers are entitled to remove themselves from a work situation that can reasonably be considered as posing a serious risk to their health. Until adequate measures are adopted and an imminent danger to life and health is addressed, employers cannot oblige workers to work in such conditions. 
As the COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world, people have increasingly turned to online commerce, and Amazon has experienced a surge of orders in most global markets. However, there have been strikes or walk-outs in France, Italy and in several locations in the USA over concerns about COVID-19 protocols and labour issues.

Standing in solidarity...","Today marks the seven-year anniversary of the collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory building in Bangladesh, which tragically left more than 1,100 workers dead and thousands more injured. Covid-19 has created new threats to the lives and livelihoods of garment workers. 
Standing in solidarity with Bangladesh garment sector workers, and with garment sector workers in all countries, Amnesty International joins Canadian labour and civil society organizations in urging Canadian brands, retailers, and the Canadian government, to address workers rights. 
Here is our joint statement: 
Protect the women who make our clothes: Canada’s unions and civil society organizations call for action 
Seven years after the tragic Rana Plaza building collapse, Bangladesh garment sector workers now confront even more risk and vulnerability in the fight against Covid-19. 
Canada’s unions and civil society organizations are calling for immediate relief for workers and protection of rights in global supply chains. 
The coalition says that concerns for workers cannot stop at Canada’s borders and the millions of women and men who make clothes in other countries cannot be abandoned. In particular, efforts to address and rectify dangerous working conditions following the Rana Plaza disaster must not be undone now in the midst of this global crisis. 
On April 24, 2013, the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka, Bangladesh killed at least 1,132 people and injured more than 2,500. 
The tragedy put a spotlight on substandard working conditions and low wages in the industry. In response to public outrage at the disaster, more than 200 global brands and retailers signed a legally binding agreement with Bangladesh and Global unions that achieved important improvements in workplace safety. The current pandemic has created new threats to the lives and livelihoods of garment workers. 
Brands and companies have cancelled orders down their supply chains leaving factories unable to pay workers’ wages, even for work already completed. This is leaving millions of people without income and job security. Women are particularly hard hit by this crisis. 
Eighty percent of Bangladesh’s four million garment workers are women. These workers have received poverty wages for years, barely making ends meet and have no financial savings to draw on. Without work, without income, with little access to health care and without any social safety net, they can easily slip into abject poverty and struggle to feed themselves and their families. 
In response to the crisis, the Bangladesh government instituted a nationwide public holiday for an extended period. Millions of workers have returned to their villages with empty pockets, unable to collect unpaid wages or severance pay from closed factories. Government relief packages are being channeled through factories, but are proving difficult for workers to access. Some factories have remained open where workers continue to work in cramped conditions, without personal protections. 
Canadian unions and civil society organizations stand in solidarity with Bangladesh garment sector workers and with garment sector workers in all countries, and urgently recommend the following: 
Payment of orders and wages & worker health and safetyCanadian brands and retailers must honour their obligations to suppliers andworkers by paying for orders that are completed or in production. They shouldensure the payment of wages or severance to all workers who were employed atthe onset of the crisis and ensure that workers who work during the pandemiccan follow World Health Organization protection guidelines and reserve the rightto refuse unsafe work.  
Emergency relief for workersGovernments, including Canada, should support global emergency reliefprograms for garment sector workers set up with contributions from internationalfinancial institutions, donor governments as well as brands and retailers. Theseprograms must maintain workers’ employment and wages.  
Mandatory Human Rights Due DiligenceThe Government of Canada should legislate companies to respect human rightsin their operations and supply chains. Such legislation should require companiesto conduct due diligence on their human rights and environmental risks, takeappropriate steps to prevent and mitigate such risks, and hold companiesaccountable in the courts if they abuse human rights.  
Rebuilding a just economy after the pandemicThe industry as a whole must change the current pricing and business modelmoving forward. Canadian brands must commit to establish more sustainableand resilient supply chains that respect workers’ rights and ensure suppliers payworkers living wages and social benefits.

0,The rights of sex workers are being ignored in the COVID-19 response: In conversation with Jenn Clamen of the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/womens-human-rights/rights-sex-workers-are-being-ignored-covid-19-response-conversation-jenn-clamen-canadian/,"Jenn Clamen is a powerful advocate for the rights of sex workers in Canada and around the world, and she is the Montreal-based National Coordinator for the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform.

The Alliance is a coalition of sex worker and allied organizations across Canada advocating for law and policy reform that respects and upholds the rights and safety of sex workers. Members of the Alliance have expertise, analysis and experience on the impact of criminal and other sex work-related prohibitions on the lives and wellbeing of those who sell or trade sex. 
Six weeks into COVID-related lockdowns across Canada, Jenn took time to speak with Amnesty about the devastating impacts that  responses to COVID-19 are having on sex workers in Canada. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the inequalities and human rights violations that the diversity of sex workers in our communities experience. 
The criminalization of sex work and sex workers place sex workers outside of social and legal projects and increase isolation and access to non-discriminatory health, legal, and social services. Criminalization of sex work means additional, unsolicited surveillance and overpolicing of sex work communities, particularly those who are already overrepresented in the criminal system: Indigenous, trans, Black, migrant, and racialized sex workers, and sex workers who use drugs. The criminalization of sex work means that the informal labour and income that sex workers generate is not recognized as legitimate labour, and leaves sex workers’ without recourse should labour exploitation arise. As a result, sex workers are not able to interface with law enforcement should they experience exploitation or violence, and not able to access workers’ rights mechanisms in a context of a pandemic. Sex workers are historically and currently targeted by the public, law enforcement and government in the context of infectious diseases, so many workers legitimately fear discrimination and are therefore avoiding contact with government and social services in the current context. 
The emergency measures implemented to “flatten the curve” and take care of communities in a context of COVID-19 have impacted the health and safety of sex workers, and also excluded sex workers from community supports. Sex workers who occupy public space are not able to physically distance in public space, and are also dependant on community for safety on the streets. As a result, sex workers are oversurveilled and trying their best to avoid law enforcement, which often leads to increased isolation and distance from much needed supports. Both indoor and outdoor sex workers who are not eligible for financial supports are unable to stop working because they need to feed themselves and their families. Many undocumented sex workers continue to lack access to much needed health supports, for COVID-19 or otherwise. 
As precarious and criminalized workers, sex workers often lack access to other forms of work and government financial relief. Current financial relief programs are focused around formal labour, and many workers, including sex workers, fall outside of that framework. To make matters worse, because sex work is not recognized labour, sex workers are also not and never have been able to access labour protections should labour exploitation exist in the workplace. In a context of a flailing economy, labour exploitation flourishes. Some sex workers, especially the most marginalized, are not in a financial position to be able to stop working altogether and are at increased risk of surveillance. 
Many sex workers have no income and no way of obtaining current government benefits, as they do not qualify for EI or CERB because they either have not made at least $5000 in the prior year or they did not file their taxes due to criminalization, immigration status or other precarity. Many sex workers would be equally unable to access lower-threshold government supports because of their social location and fear of the consequences of disclosing their name, whether because their income is criminalized and/or because they are undocumented and/or migrant. Many of the most marginalized do not have bank accounts for receiving direct or cheque deposits. These factors exclude sex workers from supports.  Also excluded from these income supports are more marginalized workers who don’t have bank accounts, who have strong reasons to be fearful of law enforcement and surveillance, and who won’t and can’t engage with government, and for whom the mainstream government benefit programs are not available. 
Some sex workers rely wholly on their income from sex work, and many sex workers do not declare their work in any formal capacity. While some sex workers are able to change the way they work in the context of COVID-19 by moving online or offering alternative services, many sex workers do not have the option of stopping direct contact sex work altogether. In all cases, because of physical distancing measures on all of society, it is harder for sex workers to find clientele. As a result, many are experiencing new and different kinds of poverty. If sex workers were provided with income support, they would not only be able to take care of their own health and communities in isolation, but they would also be recognized as workers. It is dehumanizing for sex workers, migrant workers, and other informal workers to be told that their lives don’t matter and that their labour isn’t recognized. Providing income support to only part of the population continues to send the message that only certain lives matter. 
Our ideal request is for the government to make funds available to informal, criminalized, and undocumented workers, in the same way that the CERB has been made available to tax-paying formal workers. Our ideal request would be that all workers in illegalized and informal work sectors, including sex workers, gig workers, migrant workers, and undocumented workers receive a universal basic income, or access to the $2,000 for up to four months available to others through the CERB. 
Overpolicing and surveillance: Sex workers are suffering from overpolicing and oversurveillance in public and private spaces where public health authorities have unjustly called on “citizens” to contact police and law enforcement on sex work establishments. Police also continue to over surveil Indigenous women on the street and not respond to calls for support when violence occurs in our communities. As everyone is currently taking directly from public health authorities, governments and public health should instruct police not to give tickets or oversurveillance people are homeless in public space. 
Safe injection sites have been closed because of a lack of life-saving and overdose equipment, and lack of prioritization of drug using communities. Overdose rates continue to rise, perhaps at a faster rate than death from Covid-19. Governments should re-open all of safe injection sites across Canada and provide them with PPE and other materials needed to save lives in the case of an overdose. 
A lack of access to medical and social services has resulted in increased mental health stress. Many organizations that have sex worker specific clinics have been closed, since organizations have been closed to drop-in visits. Access to non-discriminatory and sex work friendly health services are very difficult to come by, which results in sex workers not seeking medical help when needed for something sex work related. Some sex worker groups have maintained phone access to sex work friendly trained medical staff and this is needed across the country. 
Need for hotels rooms that are tolerant of drug and alcohol use: We need governments to open currently empty hotel rooms to homeless people and sex workers at risk of homelessness, and ensure the hotel rooms allow drug and alcohol use. Where hotel rooms are open across the country, sex workers using drugs or leaving the premises for cigarettes have been kicked out and not allowed back in. 
Criminalization of sex work creates further isolation for sex workers who do not have the option to stop working, and who are experiencing violence and harassment and are not able to go to the police for fear of repercussions of working during COVID but also because sex work is criminalized and sex workers rarely access police in general. Decriminalization of sex work and the removal of laws that criminalize sex work is even more important in this context. Calling for a moratorium on the use of any of the federal sex work and immigration laws that criminalize sex work is vital. This could include a suggestion to provinces and municipalities that now is not the time to surveil and ticket local sex work businesses. 
Sadly, many of the needs that sex workers have in the context of COVID-19, are needs that exist all-year round. Sex workers are often excluded from law and policy that protects and respects their rights as workers and as humans. 
Police repression is a significant factor in creating vulnerability to violence and poor working conditions. A context of repression makes it difficult to report human rights violations and other crimes and investigate acts of violence, of which sex workers are targets in a context of impunity. Both the legal and social construction of sex work as exploitation contribute to a climate of fear and disdain for sex workers that promotes violence and discrimination. 
The removal of criminal laws that sanction sex work is a vital step in protecting sex workers’ human rights.  The Canadian sex worker rights movements have called for the decriminalization of sex work for more than 50 years. Decriminalization is part of our larger struggle for the recognition and actualization of sex workers’ rights – including the right to autonomy, equality, self-determination and dignity. Many Canadian laws contribute and reinforce inequality, disadvantage and discrimination based on class, race, gender, citizenship status, mobility, mental health and other ways that people are situated. Decriminalization alone cannot overcome all of the injustices that many of us face, but it is a necessary step to respecting, protecting and fulfilling sex workers’ rights.

“Dr. Lopez-Gatell has been very clear that the best way to protect oneself from contracting COVID-19 is through social distancing; likewise, the Ministry of the Interior has publicly stated that the migrant population is among the most vulnerable. However, the lack of a strong response from the National Migration Institute to protect the lives and health of people in migration detention is extremely alarming,” said Erika Guevara Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
Amnesty International is concerned that, despite pronouncements by Mexican authorities regarding measures to protect the health of migrants, in practice, the National Migration Institute constantly puts the lives of these people at risk either by keeping them in detention or abandoning them at the country’s borders. 
“Amnesty International urges Dr Lopez-Gatell to make a public recommendation to the National Migration Institute, urging it to immediately release everyone in immigration detention and provide access to accommodation and health services to the migrant and refugee population in Mexico to protect them from the threat of COVID-19,” said Erika Guevara Rosas.

Abdulkareem al-Hawaj from Saudi Arabia was 16 when he allegedly took part in anti-government protests in the country’s Shi’a majority Eastern Province in 2012. Two years later, the teenager was arrested and charged with offences relating to his involvement in the protests. 
Abdulkareem was reportedly held in solitary confinement for the first five months, as well as beaten, intimidated and threatened with the death of his family during brutal interrogations in which he was pressured to “confess”. He had no access to a lawyer during pre-trial detention and interrogations. 
Abdulkareem was sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court on 27 July 2016, and on 23 April 2019, he was executed along with 36 others in a shocking mass execution. His family, like the families of the other men executed that day, learned of the deaths through the news. They never received the body of their loved ones to mourn them.    
Amnesty International believes the death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment. To take a life away whether by hanging, electrocution, beheading, shooting or lethal injection – in cold blood — is the lowest act. Sentencing to death someone who was below the age of 18 at the time of the crime is a violation of international law. 
When the death penalty is not used against critics to suppress dissent or spread fear among minority or unfavoured groups, it is often deployed to look tough on crime. Yet there is no credible evidence to suggest societies where the death penalty is practised are safer, or that executions deter crimes from being committed more than prison sentences.  
For more than 40 years, Amnesty International has called for an end to the death penalty — in all cases and without exception. So it is encouraging to see that our latest report shows that global executions have declined for a fourth consecutive year, dipping to yet another 10-year low. 
Global trend away from the death penalty 
In total, 657 executions were recorded around the world in 2019, a 5% drop from 2018. The data confirms a global trend that has seen the use of the death penalty decrease year-on-year since a peak of 1,634 known executions in 2015. 
The decline can be partly attributed to countries with a record of using the death penalty, executing fewer people in 2019 – such as Japan (from 15 to three), Singapore (from 13 to four) and Egypt (from at least 43 to at least 32). 
No executions were carried out in Afghanistan for the first time since 2010. Hiatuses were also reported in Taiwan and Thailand. Meanwhile Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Malaysia and Gambia continued to observe official moratoriums on executions. 
Although no country abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2019, momentum towards the global abolition of this horrific punishment continued to build. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, several countries took steps that could lead to the abolition of the death penalty, including Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Kenya and Zimbabwe. 
In the Caribbean, Barbados removed the mandatory death penalty from its Constitution while in the United States, the Governor of California, the US state with biggest death row population, established an official moratorium on executions, and New Hampshire became the 21st US state to abolish the death penalty for all crimes.  
Progress hampered by small number of states 
However, progress was marred by several developments including the sharp rise in executions in some countries including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
In total, the Saudi Arabian authorities executed 184 people last year, compared to 149 in 2018. 
The majority of executions were for drug-related offences and murder. However, Amnesty International also documented the increased use of the death penalty as a political weapon to crush dissent from Saudi Arabia’s persecuted Shi’a Muslim minority. 
In Iraq, authorities increasingly turned to the death penalty largely to punish suspected members of the armed group calling itself “Islamic State”. The number of people executed nearly doubled to 100 in 2019, compared to 52 in 2018. 
Lack of transparency 
Secrecy and the death penalty often go hand-in-hand. 
Despite requests from Amnesty International, many countries did not provide official information on their use of the death penalty. For example, Viet Nam, one of the top five executioners in 2018, only released partial figures for 2019, while China, North Korea and Iran continued to hide the true extent of their use of the death penalty. 
This only makes us more determined.

The Saudi authorities put 184 people to death last year, the highest number Amnesty has ever recorded in a single year in the country. 
Meanwhile the number of executions doubled in Iraq, and Iran retained its place as the world’s second most prolific executioner after China, where the exact number of people put to death remains a state secret. However these states are bucking a global trend which saw global executions decrease for the fourth consecutive year to at least 657 in 2019 from at least 690 in 2018 — the lowest recorded figure of the past decade. 
“The death penalty is an abhorrent and inhuman punishment; and there is no credible evidence that it deters crime more than prisons terms. A large majority of countries recognize this and it’s encouraging to see that executions continue to fall worldwide,” said Clare Algar, Amnesty International’s Senior Director for Research, Advocacy and Policy. 
“However, a small number of countries defied the global trend away from the death penalty by increasingly resorting to executions. Saudi Arabia’s growing use of the death penalty, including as a weapon against political dissidents, is an alarming development. Also shocking was the massive jump in executions in Iraq, which nearly doubled in just one year.” 
The top five executing countries in 2019 were: China (1000s); Iran (at least 251); Saudi Arabia (184); Iraq (at least 100) and Egypt (at least 32). 
Amnesty’s figures do not include China, where the number of executions, believed to be in the thousands, remains classified. Other major executing countries, including Iran, North Korea and Viet Nam, continued to hide the full extent of their use of the death penalty by restricting access to death penalty information. 
Spikes in executions in minority of countries 
Just twenty countries are responsible for all known executions worldwide. Among them, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen executed significantly more people in 2019 than in 2018. 
Saudi Arabia executed 184 people — six women and 178 men – in 2019, just over half of whom were foreign nationals. The figure was 149 in 2018. 
The majority of executions were for drug-related offences and murder. However, Amnesty International also documented the increased use of the death penalty as a political weapon against dissidents from Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a Muslim minority. 
On 23 April 2019, there was a mass execution of 37 people, 32 of them Shi’a men convicted on “terrorism” charges after trials that relied on confessions extracted through torture. 
One of those executed on 23 April was Hussein al-Mossalem. He had sustained multiple injuries including a broken nose, broken collar bone and leg fracture while being held in solitary confinement and subjected to beatings with an electric stick and other forms of torture. 
Mossalem had been brought before Saudi Arabia’s Specialized Criminal Court (SCC), which was set up in 2008 to try individuals accused of terror-related crimes but is increasingly used to suppress dissent. 
In Iraq, the number of people executed almost doubled from at least 52 in 2018 to at least 100 in 2019, largely due to the continued use of the death penalty against individuals accused of being members of the armed group that calls itself “Islamic State”. 
In South Sudan, authorities executed at least 11 people in 2019, the highest number recorded since the country’s independence in 2011. Yemen executed at least seven people in 2019, compared with at least four in 2018. Bahrain also resumed executions after a one-year hiatus, putting three people to death over the course of the year. 
Lack of transparency over use of death penalty  
Many countries failed to publish or provide official information on their use of the death penalty, highlighting the lack of transparency around the practice from many governments.   
Iran is second only to China in its use of the death penalty. It put to death at least 251 people in 2019, compared with at least 253 in 2018 – four of whom were below 18 at the time of the crime. However, a lack of transparency makes it difficult to confirm the real total number of executions – which may be far higher. 
In one case, Iranian authorities secretly executed two boys, Mehdi Sohrabifar and Amin Sedaghat, in Adelabad prison in Shiraz, Fars province on 25 April 2019. They were both arrested aged 15 and convicted on multiple rape charges following an unfair trial. Not only did they not know they had been sentenced to death before their executions, but their bodies bore lash marks, indicating they had been whipped before their deaths. 
“Even countries that are the strongest proponents of the death penalty struggle to justify its use, and opt for secrecy. Many of them take pains to hide how they use the death penalty, knowing it will not stand up to international scrutiny,” said Clare Algar. 
“Executions are taking place in secret all over the world. In countries from Belarus to Botswana and Iran to Japan, executions were being carried out without any advance notice to the families, lawyers or in some cases the individuals themselves.” 
Global abolition within reach 
For the first time since 2011, there was a drop in the number of executing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, with seven reporting executions during the year. Japan and Singapore sharply reduced the numbers of people they executed, from 15 to 3, and 13 to 4, respectively. 
No executions were carried out in Afghanistan for the first time since 2010. Hiatuses were also reported in Taiwan and Thailand which both executed people in 2018; while Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Malaysia and Gambia continued to respect official moratoriums on executions. 
Worldwide, 106 countries have abolished the death penalty in law for all crimes and 142 countries have abolished the death penalty in law or practice. 
Moreover, several countries took positive steps towards ending the use of the death penalty. 
For example, the President of Equatorial Guinea announced in April that his government would introduce legislation to abolish the death penalty. Positive developments, which may lead to the abolition of the death penalty, also occurred in Central African Republic, Kenya, Gambia and Zimbabwe. 
Barbados also removed the mandatory death penalty from its Constitution. 
In the United States, the Governor of California established an official moratorium on executions in the US state which has the biggest death row population, and New Hampshire became the 21st US state to abolish the death penalty for all crimes. 
However, attempts in the Philippines to reintroduce the death penalty for “heinous crimes related to illegal drugs and plunder” and efforts in Sri Lanka to resume executions for the first time in more than 40 years marred progress towards the abolition of the death penalty globally. The US federal government also threatened to resume executions after almost two decades without carrying out any. 
“We must keep up the momentum for the global abolition of the death penalty,” said Clare Algar. 
“We are calling on all states to abolish the death penalty. There needs to be international pressure on the world’s last remaining executioners to end this inhuman practice for good.”

Trump to sign an executive order “to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States”, Joanne Lin, the national advocacy director of Amnesty International USA, said: 
“While the scope of Trump’s new proposed policy is unclear, the message it sends is: the President is manipulating a pandemic to further the bigotry and xenophobia that have been hallmarks of his presidency from day one. 
“We are one country and there is no way we could address the spread of COVID-19 without the unending efforts of immigrants providing healthcare and home aid, staffing grocery stores, and producing food, whose work has been deemed essential while they are simultaneously struggling to access to care, support, and services. 
“As the United States leads in COVID cases in the world, measures that health experts agree will stop the spread, like access to widespread testing and self-isolation, have been derided and undermined by Trump. If President Trump wants to limit the spread and the deaths occurring under his leadership, now is the time to look to health experts, and not point fingers at immigrants.” 
Background and context 
Amnesty International has documented anti-immigrant policies enacted by President Trump since his first week in office, when he signed what has become known as the Muslim ban and set into motion a series of events that continue to leave families in uncertainty and danger to this day. Amnesty International USA has stood against the Muslim ban from its first iteration, calling on Congress to nullify it through passage of the NO BAN Act (H.R. 2214 / S. 1123). Amnesty USA’s members from around the country mobilized against the ban in states across the country, participated in a protest march and rally in DC, delivered a nationwide petition to Congressional leadership, and galvanized communities in airports and conducted gatherings to inform people of their rights. 
In the aftermath of the ban, AIUSA created a dozen case studies of the harms caused to individuals and families from Yemen, Iran, Sudan and elsewhere and documented the ways lives had been upended by the ban, and in 2019, Amnesty International USA’s researchers traveled to Lebanon and Jordan to conduct nearly 50 interviews with refugees that as a result of the ban, have been stranded in countries where they face restrictive policies, increasingly hostile environments, and lack the same rights as permanent residents or citizens. AIUSA’s report, “The Mountain is in Front of Us and the Sea is Behind Us,” documented how Trump’s discriminatory policies have decimated refugee resettlement from Lebanon and Jordan, which host the highest number of refugees in the world relative to their populations. Amnesty International has also detailed how returns of refugees from Lebanon to Syria is premature and, in late 2019, published a further report, Sent to a war zone: Turkey’s illegal deportations of Syrian refugees, detailing how Turkey has deported Syrian refugees to Syria where they are at grave risk. 
Amnesty International has documented how President Trump’s policy of family separation has in some cases constituted torture as defined under U.S. and international law, documented the negligent care and ill treatment of people seeking safety in the U.S. further jeopardizing them during COVID-19, denounced the Remain in Mexico policy which has pushed asylum-seekers into dangerous and precarious conditions in Mexico, and spoken out against asylum agreements and asylum bans that cut off access to the U.S. asylum system.

Indigenous Peoples continue to live with the impact of colonization and centuries of attacks on sovereignty and human rights violations, preventing control over healthcare, and appropriate community safety measures. Chronic underfunding of essential services, including safe water, healthcare services, and housing will devastate the communities’ ability to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Indigenous people also experience a higher rate of chronic disease and pre-existing medical conditions. All this increases the risk of severe COVID-19 cases; as an example, during the H1N1 crisis, Indigenous people were 6.5 times more likely to be admitted to the ICU than non-Indigenous people.  
Now more than ever, governments need to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in their emergency response plans, without repeating the oppression and human rights violations of previous governments.  Indigenous communities know what they need in order to keep their own people safe and healthy, this must be respected.  Communities hold the knowledge of their resources and deficits. One general, blanket approach will not meet the needs of all communities; urgent intervention that respects the specific needs of the communities is needed NOW to avert catastrophic consequences.    Furthermore, the federal government’s pledge of $315 million in pandemic assistance for all Indigenous communities is less than one-per cent of the $82 billion in funding assistance, but Indigenous people represent 5% of the population of Canada. This is discrepancy is simply unacceptable. The Canadian government has already been found to discriminate against Indigenous Peoples by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal: the inadequacies that already exist mean that all governments have legal obligations to correct the disparity that has been created over the centuries.   
It is also important to remember that the federal government will have to justify any distinction in the type and level of services it provides to status Indians, non-status Indians and Métis and can no longer argue that it has no jurisdictional obligation. If Canada has learned anything from Jordan’s principle, it is clear that appropriate responses to this pandemic must be person-first and need-based to avoid tragedy.  
This pandemic is all about human rights. The virus attacks the rights to health and to life. The economic crisis threatens the rights to livelihood, housing, and food. The shutdowns undermine rights to education, employment, and freedom of movement. Crucially, the disproportionate impact on Indigenous communities that face entrenched marginalization goes to the core of essential human-rights obligations.   
Governments have shown us in the last few weeks how quickly they can respond to an initial pandemic crisis, and to evolving and emerging developments in this new reality we face. Governments have proved to be flexible and compassionate, supporting people and our social institutions. We should see the same rapid and effective government response to support Indigenous communities.  
Sincerely,

She fled to Egypt in 2011 after being detained for her human rights work. There she continued to face harassment and threats for her activism, and faced years of limbo as she sought refugee resettlement in the US. During Write for Rights 2018, Amnesty activists from around the world spoke out for her safety. Nazik was finally resettled to Canada recently. Here is her story.  
Being a refugee is, for me, a matter of personal identity. Being a refugee is a statement of my struggle and the struggle of millions of other people around the world forced to leave their homes. Being a refugee is a reminder of the different global crises that drove us from our homes—conflicts, poverty, inequality, injustice, climate change, or sexual violence. 
People do not choose to be refugees; they are forced by the serious challenges facing humanity to leave their homes and to live either in refugee camps or in inhumane conditions in neighboring countries’ slums. The refugee crisis is not a personal crisis or even a regional crisis; it is a global crisis that demands urgent fundamental change. 
The reasons I left my home in Sudan to become a refugee were not unique to me. I was forced to flee nine years ago because of my advocacy against human rights atrocities and genocidal crimes. After being subjected to detention, court trials and death threats in Sudan, I went to Egypt to safeguard my life and to continue to advocate for justice and freedom in Sudan. 
I arrived in Egypt in early 2012. But I was only able to work freely in Egypt for less than two years. In 2014, the Egyptian government clamped down on human rights activists and my safety was threatened again. For the next five years I lived in hiding in Egypt as a refugee and human rights activist, moving from house to house many times. 
Threatened by Sudanese government agents, I was unable to obtain a Sudanese passport from Sudan’s embassy in Egypt. But I was at least able to get support from Amnesty International and other international organizations protecting human rights defenders—unlike many thousands of women and children refugees in Egypt, who are unable to find this kind of support. 
Without permission to work, refugees are forced to take low wage jobs and work illegally to support themselves. This situation increases the risk that employers will abuse them. This is especially true for women who often face sexual harassment at work as well as other kinds of violence and exploitation. Refugee children are often forced to work or drop out of school. Even if they manage to enroll in school, refugee children face racial discrimination and violence inside and outside schools. 
Egypt alone is hosting almost 300,000 refugees, the majority of them women and children. There are no refugee camps in Egypt, so refugees live in slums in big cities where they become victims of poverty, violence and discrimination. There are a few local organizations courageously helping refugees, but the organizations’ capacity is very limited compared to the needs of so many refugees.  
Hosting countries are supposed to be transitional stops with refugees eventually returning to their home countries or to a resettlement country. But the waiting can take years and sometimes even decades. Civil wars, brutal dictatorships, or climate change make it impossible for some refugees to return to their homeland. For these refugees, there is the long wait for resettlement in a third country. In my case I waited seven years for resettlement, with years lost because of President Trump’s “Muslim ban”, which stalled my resettlement process. For an activist refugee like myself, a longer wait means increased danger. Living at the mercy of the unknown brings physical and psychological trauma. For some, the wait is just too much of an emotional drain. 
 
This photo was used in Amnesty’s 2018 Write for Rights campaign to protect Nazik’s identity. As a refugee and a woman human rights defender in Egypt, she faced enormous risks. Nazik was also identified by a pseudonym: Awad.  
Finally, I was lucky to be welcomed by a generous community in Kingston, Ontario. Local refugee resettlement groups in Canada play an important role in making refugees feel at home. But after defining myself as a “refugee” for eight long years, I found I was unable to remove the “refugee” tag even after I became a Canadian permanent resident a few months ago. The refugee tag for me is a personal testimony of a journey of struggle and it has now taken on a new definition by becoming a “journey of survival”. Throughout my journey of struggle, the Amnesty community has been a lifeline of hope and solidarity. I’m so grateful that I’m able to write these words today because of that support. 
The refugees I left behind continue their journeys of struggle, even as more countries close their borders to refugees. But if we work together and imagine a world without suffering, we can work with refugees to ease their hardships and improve their living situations. The increasing numbers of refugees are a sign of failure in our global system. The whole of humanity shares the guilt for this situation, and so it is for the whole of the international community to come together and share the responsibility for supporting refugees and begin to create a better world for everyone everywhere.

It is also a chance to join others in calling attention to the urgency of protecting the place we all live. 
Our human rights are intertwined with the environment. People need a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment to fully enjoy their human rights, including the rights to life, health, food, and water. While other human rights, including the rights to information, freedom of expression, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice, are essential for protecting the environment. 
April 22nd is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. Although many wonderful celebrations had been planned across Canada and around the world, many of these events have been cancelled or revised due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for physical distancing. The global climate strikes, for example, that saw millions of people marching in the streets in 2019, have moved online. 
We encourage you to stay safe at home and join the next big climate strike online this Earth Day (Wednesday, April 22, 2020).  
To join the strike online here is what to do: 
1.    Make a climate strike sign2.    Take a photo of yourself holding the sign3.    Post to your favourite social media channel with the hashtag #climatestrikeonline. You can also put the sign in your window. 
We would love it if you would also tag Amnesty Canada at @amnestynow so that we can see your posts. 
Don’t use social media? There are many other ways you can take part! 
Although we are physically distant at the moment, we are more united than ever. We may be stuck inside, but we can continue advocating for human rights. After all, a focus on human rights is crucial to fight the covid crisis in a fast and fair way, and the same applies to the climate crisis. 
See you at the #climatestrikeonline!

Governments are obliged to protect people from discrimination and violence, including the public “outing“ of people with COVID-19 with the intent of endangering their safety. However, vaguely worded offences such as “false news” and “spreading misinformation” don’t meet the test of necessary and proportionate. Arrests under such provisions unjustifiably limit freedom of expression, and their use has a broader chilling effect leading to self censorship out of fear of reprisals. Ultimately, the best way to protect again misinformation is for authorities to ensure they distribute reliable, accessible, evidence-based and trustworthy information. 
Crises are often used as “cover” for some states to continue to target critical voices or even broaden patterns of repression. The COVID-19 pandemic is not exception. 
 
In Venezuela, the authorities are going to extremes to maintain tight control over public health matters and the government’s inadequate response to the pandemic. Darvinson Rojas was arrested on March 21 by Special Action Forces of the National Police and repeatedly pressed to reveal his sources around reported cases of COVID-19. He remains in detention and the charges against him are unclear. He was targeted in the context of widespread arbitrary detentions made against people critical of the government or claiming their human rights.  
TAKE ACTION: call on Venezuela to drop the charges against Darvinson Rojas 
 
In Russia, independent journalist Elena Milashina has once again been targeted for her reporting. The day after her article on the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic appeared in Novaya Gazeta on April 12, the Head of the Chechan Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, took to Instagram to issue a death threat by video and accused Novaya Gazeta and its journalists of being “puppets of the West” . The Presidential Press Secretary subsequently dismissed those very real and serious threats as “nothing out of the ordinary” and a mere “emotional” reaction “which is understandable in such a (COVID-19 pandemic) situation.” The Prosecutor General’s office also ordered that Elena Milashina’s article must be removed from the Novaya Gazeta website, claiming that is contained “false information”.

These measures must be coordinated with each Indigenous community, respecting their right to autonomy. 
In the context of the health emergency declared because of COVID-19 and the “State of Economic, Social and Ecological Emergency” throughout the country, President Iván Duque stated that the authorities would deliver food and money to the most vulnerable people. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the delivery of food to Indigenous, Black, Raizal, Palenquero, Afro-Colombian and Roma communities; Community Action Boards; community leaders; and human rights defenders. 
However, three weeks after the quarantine was imposed, Indigenous communities in the departments of Casanare, Vichada and Meta informed Amnesty International that they have received no support from government authorities, despite their strict compliance with the isolation measures. 
“Indigenous Peoples in Colombia are on high alert. The government is implementing preventive measures for COVID-19 in the country without adequately guaranteeing their fundamental rights. Historically they have not had access to health, water or food and in the context of this pandemic this situation is much more serious because they do not have the sanitary and social conditions to deal adequately with COVID-19,” said Fernanda Doz Costa, deputy Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The Colombian authorities must adopt additional social protection measures for those parts of population that are in a particularly vulnerable situation and are more likely to contract COVID-19. If the authorities do not take urgent action, Indigenous Peoples will find themselves at a crossroads facing two unthinkable paths: starve or die of the pandemic.” 
To date, the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC) has reported four confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the Yukpa Binational People and the Pasto People and one possible case among the Eperara Siapidara People. Access to health centres from most of the territories of these Indigenous Peoples is very expensive because of their remoteness and inaccessibility. 
The Claretian Norman Pérez Bello Corporation told Amnesty International about the difficulties posed by the mandatory quarantine for the way of life and livelihoods of more than 3,000 Indigenous people in the departments of Casanare, Vichada and Meta. In these semi-nomadic communities, isolation measures exacerbate their situation of vulnerability because they cannot access their means of subsistence as they cannot move within their territories. Moreover, these are Indigenous Peoples believed to be on the brink of physical and cultural extinction. 
The level of risk is also a concern for Indigenous Peoples living in settlements on the outskirts of towns and cities, as they have no way of growing their food and survive by working in informal jobs, which they are currently unable to do. Many of these communities do not have access to clean water or hygiene products, making personal cleanliness to prevent COVID-19 infection impossible.

Although we derive many benefits from mining, it is absolutely crucial that the mining industry adhere to international human rights standards. Too often, we hear of human rights abuses related to mining, including: forced labour; child labour; people threatened, harmed, raped or killed for opposing mining projects; unsafe working conditions; toxic contamination of water; people forcibly evicted from their homes; a lack of respect for Indigenous rights; and more. 
On May 14th  join us for a mining justice webinar and hear directly from people whose lives have been negatively impacted by Canadian-owned mines in Asia, Africa and South America and who are fighting for justice. 
During the webinar, we will also launch a parliamentary e-petition. By signing the petition and sharing it with your contacts you can help us convince the Canadian government to hold Canadian companies accountable for human rights abuses overseas. 
<Sign up here for the webinar> 
Thursday, May 14th, (8:30pm Atlantic; 7:30pm Eastern; 6:30pm Central; 5:30pm Mountain; 4:30pm Pacific).

While cyber-surveillance is a longstanding threat to human rights defenders and others, this new normal means options for using physical security alternatives (like simply communicating sensitive information in person rather than online) are seriously diminished. This raises the human rights stakes. It can mean everyone has more exposure to cyber-attacks and scammers who are seeking to exploit the outbreak. Here are six top tips on how to keep safe online.  
1. Update phone, computer and apps 
Your devices and any programmes that communicate with the internet should be up to date to reduce the risk of attack. Most browsers update automatically but look at the apps you use to read documents or view photos and videos you have found online. 
If you are using old versions of these apps it is more likely there will be bugs that can leave your devices vulnerable. 
“You could download a file from the internet, and it could exploit one of these bugs, which is a common way people are attacked,” says Etienne Maynier, Security Researcher at Amnesty Tech. Also make sure you use trustworthy software from trustworthy sources, like the Apple Store or Google Play. 
 
2. Think before clicking 
Phishing scams try to exploit fear and uncertainty, and those linked to COVID-19 are no different. Emails or SMS messages promising new information on the virus can contain malware in links and attachments – this is a typical social engineering strategy used by scammers who reel people in by purporting to be imparting urgent information. 
“If the phishing attacks come from cyber criminals, they are most often seeking to access devices so they can steal financial information. They can also use ransomware to lock down the device and try to extort money to unlock it again,” says Maynier. 
If you do not know the person or are not familiar with the organization that has sent the email or message, do not click on the link or open the attachment. 
Also look out for anomalies in the way the message is written – often there are typos or the language used sounds off. If the message purports to be from an organization you know, but you are unsure it’s authentic, go to the website rather than opening any information sent in the email. 
3. Protect your privacy 
  
Spending more time online can mean exposing more of your personal information. This is a good time to review your privacy settings. 
“You can limit a lot of the data that Google is collecting, such as location information and the history of searches you have done, by disabling that in your Google account,” says Maynier. “You can’t really control what data Facebook is collecting, but you can control what people see,” he adds. 
Facebook and Google carry out unparalleled tracking of our lives online, so now could also be time to experiment with services that do not belong to the world’s tech giants. Messaging app Signal is a non-profit alternative to Facebook-owned WhatsApp which not only offers end-to-end encryption but also stores less metadata. 
4. Connect on video chats safely 
Video conferencing has exploded during the pandemic as colleagues, family and friends turn to apps which allow large-scale group calls. Questions have been raised over how safe they are – Zoom had to retract a claim that it was end-to-end encrypted and Taiwan has now banned government agencies from using it on privacy and security grounds. 
It’s worth exploring lesser known alternatives like open source Jitsi Meet, which does not require users to download software or create an account. For chats with a smaller group of people it is safer to use services that have end-to-end encryption like Signal, WhatsApp or Wire. 
 
5. Do a digital spring clean  
Getting rid of accounts that you no longer use reduces data exposure. “By deleting them there is less data on you out there and that reduces privacy risks,” Maynier says. 
Part of the spring clean should also include installing a password manager which can store all your passwords in encrypted form and generate new unique passwords that are hard to guess. Try KeePassXC which is open source and offline. There are also commercial services online, such as LastPass and 1Password, which offer these services for a fee. 
6. Navigate the ‘infodemic’ 
 
As well as safeguarding privacy and security it is also important to learn how to deal with the sheer volume of information coming our way as we scour the internet for answers on the pandemic. 
As scientists rush to better understand the virus, there is a wealth of misinformation and disinformation circulating online about everything from supposed cures for the virus to claims that 5G technology is linked to the outbreak. 
Check the original source of the information you are receiving and try to verify the content with other trusted sources. Some major news organizations now have their own fact check teams and send out newsletters debunking stories that have gone viral. The World Health Organization also has a COVID-19 myth-busting page. 
Companies like Facebook and Google have said they are taking steps to counter the spread of false information but be aware that governments may also seek to seize on the issue of so-called “fake news” to crack down on lawful free speech. 
“Rumours and unsubstantiated information can run rife during health emergencies,” says Maynier. “It’s important we don’t add to our own and others’ stress by sharing false information.” 
Above all, one of the most important things we can do to stay safe online – now and in future – is to stand up for digital rights. Governments and companies the world over are racing to create more invasive surveillance tools in response to the pandemic. Some of these may save lives, but others may be harmful to privacy and other human rights in ways that will change our lives for years to come. Now is the time to come together and ensure that not only we, but also our human rights online, survive the pandemic.

Dr Abdullah al-Hamid, a prominent human rights campaigner serving an 11-year sentence for his peaceful activism, suffered a stroke on 9 April and is currently in a coma in the intensive care unit at al-Shumaisi Hospital in Riyadh. 
“It is heartbreakingly cruel that Dr Abdullah al-Hamid remains in detention, even while in a coma,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“Dr al-Hamid, and all other prisoners of conscience in Saudi Arabia, should never have been in jail in the first place. All those imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their human rights must be immediately and unconditionally released. 
“Older prisoners and those with existing health conditions who are at high risk of contracting COVID-19 should also be immediately considered for release or alternatives to detention. All those still awaiting trial should also be released.” 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid has hypertension, and was told three months ago by a doctor that he needed to undergo heart surgery in the months ahead. He was threatened by prison authorities that if he told his family about his health condition, they would cut his communication with his family. 
Among the prisoners of conscience who remain in detention in the kingdom are several prominent women’s rights campaigners, including Loujain al-Hathloul. 
Conditions in several of Saudi Arabia’s overcrowded prisons significantly raise the risk of COVID-19 spreading. Amnesty International has previously expressed concern over the authorities’ failure to provide adequate medical care in the country’s prisons. 
Abdullah al-Hamid 
Dr Abdullah al-Hamid, 69, is a founding member of the independent Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA). 
As a human rights defender, writer and academic, he has written extensively on human rights and the independence of judiciary. He was a professor of contemporary literature at al-Imam Muhammad bin Saud Islamic University in Riyadh before being dismissed for his activism. He is married and has eight children. 
In March 2012, Dr al-Hamid and Mohammad al-Qahtani were arrested and interrogated regarding their work with ACPRA and their peaceful activism. In March 2013, they were sentenced to 11 and 10 years in prison respectively, on charges of “breaking allegiance to the ruler”, “questioning the integrity of officials”, “seeking to disrupt security and inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations”, and “instigating international organizations against the Kingdom”. 
Women human rights defenders 
Loujain al-Hathloul, along with a number of prominent Saudi women’s human rights defenders and activists, was arrested in May 2018. These courageous activists had been peacefully advocating for the right of women to drive and an end to the male guardianship system. 
Loujain al-Hathloul is being tried on a variety of charges linked to her peaceful human rights activities. She has endured a range of human rights violations while in prison, including torture, sexual abuse and other forms of ill-treatment. For the first three months of her detention, she was held incommunicado with no access to her family and lawyer. Since January 2020, she has also been subjected to spells in solitary confinement. 
Currently, 13 women’s rights activists remain on trial facing prosecution for their peaceful activism, and risk being sentenced to prison under anti-cybercrime legislation for their human rights work. Of the 13, five remain in detention – including Loujain al-Hathloul, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Sada, Nouf Abdulaziz and Maya’a al-Zahrani. They should be released immediately and unconditionally, and all charges against them and against those women who were conditionally released, should be dropped.

Due to the expanded number of categories for this year’s Media Awards, 10 judges reviewed almost 170 submissions from across the country. The submissions were published or broadcast between October 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. 
In a first for the Media Awards, Toronto Star reporter Shree Paradkar won in two separate categories – Long-Form Text and Short-Form Video – for her incredible story about the Prerna Girls’ School in Lucknow, India, which is helping empower 1,000 girls from lower economic classes. It was part of the Atkinson Series on Education Without Oppression. 
“We were incredibly impressed by the field this year — so many important stories. But we all found it remarkable that in the middle of all of this, there can be such a powerful, uplifting human rights story,” said Elamin Abdelmahmoud, Curation Editor at Buzzfeed News, who was one of the judges for the Long-Form Text category this year. 
Shree’s short video, which was co-produced by videographer and editor Kathryn Mallinson and editor Kelsey Wilson, further illustrated this important story. 
Sadiya Ansari, a Media Awards judge and journalism professor at Centennial College, added, “While we know how intensely girls and women in India and around the world are impacted by patriarchy, Shree brings to life a solution: an alternative way of learning about the world so these girls don’t have to unlearn the ‘hidden curriculum’ many schools carry that reinforce the harmful norms and narratives girls hear about themselves.” 
Shanifa Nasser’s exceptional piece, which won the Short-Form Text category, highlights the ways in which Muslim people are being targeted by police and intelligence agencies in Canada. 
“Shanifa Nasser does an excellent job of reporting not only how widespread it appears to be, but the real harm it causes — from sharing information with foreign agencies, preventing people from getting jobs and putting them on no-fly lists,” said Sadiya Ansari. “What was particularly effective about this piece is that it presents one solution to this problem — a new student support hotline staffed by lawyers to help Muslim students targeted by this practice.”  
APTN reporter Trina Roache’s Law of the Land, winner of the Long-Form Video category, examines the issues that have sparked Indigenous blockades across the country – both recently and for decades past. 
Olivia Ward, a former Toronto Star foreign affairs reporter, said this film “powerfully traces the grievances that are the root cause of the anguish that Indigenous people have suffered, their last-ditch attempts at redress, the government’s often draconian as well as politically inadequate and unjust responses, and what needs to be done to move forward. 
“The film accomplishes this without playing to stereotypes, misconceptions and preconceived notions of Indigenous protests.” 
Reporter Justin Ling, along with CBC producers Jennifer Fowler, Erin Byrnes, and sound designer Cesil Fernandes created the winning podcast series Uncover: The Village. It’s a gripping account of how Toronto Police allowed deep-seated, decades-long prejudice against the city’s gay community impede their investigation into Bruce McArthur’s shocking serial murders. As they bungled, people died. 
“Weaving relentless on-the-ground reporting with a rich array of archival materials, Ling shows us that the prejudice that prevailed more than 40 years ago remains very much with us today,” said Bill Schiller, former foreign correspondent with the Toronto Star and previous Amnesty International Canada Media Award winner. “‘Uncover: The Village is sweeping and yet pin-point detailed. With its blend of high-level sound, music and writing, this is storytelling of the highest order.” 
In the Mixed Media category, freelance reporters Jillian Kestler-D’Amours and Megan O’Toole travelled the 2,000-kilometre Trans Mountain pipeline route from Burnaby, B.C. to Edmonton, Alberta, interviewing stakeholders in the multi-billion-dollar expansion project. 
Judge Samantha Fink, winner of the 2019 Amnesty Canada Youth Media Award, said Jillian and Megan won “for their sensitive story telling that centred the voices of those most affected, for the depth of their research and for their sophisticated use of digital tools including photos, videos, graphics and maps that gave readers multiple access points to understanding a complex story.” 
Ryerson University journalism students Sarah Chew, Katie Swyers, Martha Currie, and Stephanie Liu earned much-deserved recognition for their documentary film, Trafficked. The piece explores the reality of human trafficking through the real-life stories of two survivors of sex trafficking. 
“While many pieces were able to eloquently portray an important human rights issue, this film’s ability to promote the victims’ agency, empower their audience, and reach suggestions of a solution were the main reasons for our choice,” said Samantha Fink. “We believe the creators did an excellent job of guiding their viewers into the corners of this local, yet often hidden, significant human rights story.” 
Amnesty International would like to give an immense thanks to the 10 judges* who put a tremendous amount of time and effort into reviewing this year’s Media Awards submissions. They are: 
*Note: In order to avoid any real or perceived conflict of interest, no judges served on panels for categories in which they had submitted entries themselves or were personally or professionally affiliated with others who had done so. 
Regrettably, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Amnesty International Canada has postponed the Media Awards ceremony, which was originally scheduled for May 6. The winning journalists will be recognized at a later date. 
“At a time of an unprecedented national and global crisis — as people, societies and governments everywhere scramble to understand and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic — we are once again reminded of the essential role that journalists play in ensuring the public has access to comprehensive, accurate and insightful information and analysis,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada.  “So often, human rights lie at the heart of the most urgent challenges we face.  We honour and celebrate this year’s Media Awards winners for their tremendous commitment to telling those human rights stories in ways that both inform and inspire.”

The...","People’s rights are being violated by governments in Europe and Central Asia, who are cracking down on protests and seeking to erode the independence of the judiciary to avoid accountability, Amnesty International said today as it published its annual review of human rights in the region. 
The organization praised those brave people who took to the streets to defend their own and others’ rights but warned that governments continue to perpetrate human rights violations with impunity across the region. 
“In 2019, people in Europe and Central Asia were threatened, intimidated, prosecuted, subjected to excessive use of force by police, and suffered discrimination. However, the grassroots mobilization of courageous people who dared to stand up and hold states accountable provides a ray of hope for the future,” said Marie Struthers, Europe Director at Amnesty International. 
Independence of the judiciary under threat 
In Poland, the independence of the judiciary – essential for ensuring fair trials and upholding human rights – was threatened as the ruling party took bolder steps to control judges and courts. 
Judges and prosecutors found themselves at risk of disciplinary proceedings for speaking out in defence of the judiciary and risked becoming victims of human rights violations themselves. Many were subjected to smear campaigns on state and social media. 
Concerns also mounted about the independence of the judiciary in Hungary, Romania and Turkey. Judges in Hungary came under attack from multiple directions as the government continued its attempts to undermine the independence of the judiciary. In May, the European Commission warned Romania that it should address issues including interference with judicial independence by the executive, or potentially face having some of the member state’s rights suspended for persistent breach of the EU’s founding values. In Turkey, a judicial reform package was passed by Parliament. The reforms failed to address the extreme political pressure on the judiciary or to end unfair and politically motivated prosecutions and convictions. 
Freedom of peaceful assembly 
Independent courts were vitally needed in 2019 to safeguard individual freedoms as state overreach came to the fore, with restrictions on protests in France, Poland and Turkey as well as prosecution of protesters in many more. 
Major protests took place in numerous countries across Europe including France, Austria, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic and Hungary, with people protesting against austerity measures and corruption, and in defence of social justice and the independence of the judiciary. Protests and strikes urging governments to take measures against climate change became a regular occurrence in major European cities.  
Many states repressed the demonstrations through measures that breached the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression. In France, Austria and Spain, hundreds of people were injured by the police during protests. Police resorted to excessive force in France, and violently disrupted peaceful gatherings in Turkey where blanket bans on gatherings were often used to deny the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. States frequently failed to hold their security forces accountable for violence perpetrated during the protests. 
Some judges adjudicating in cases relating to protests were harassed or demoted by the Polish authorities. 
In Moscow, and other Russian cities, the largest numbers of peaceful protesters seen in many years stood up against the authorities’ refusal to allow opposition candidates to take part in the city elections. The resultant crackdown led to criminal convictions for two dozen participants, simply for exercising their right to protest. 
“The reprisals against participants of mass protests in Moscow kick-started an unprecedented solidarity campaign that signals the further awakening of human rights awareness and people power in Russia,” said Marie Struthers. 
Migration 
European states continued to avoid accountability for human rights violations resulting from their migration policies by “outsourcing” border control to countries with questionable human rights records. In 2019, migration policies continued to prioritise the protection of borders over the protection of human lives. Despite the deteriorating security situation there, European countries continued cooperating with Libya to contain migrants and asylum-seekers in the country. 
In November, the Italian government extended its agreement with Libya on migration for a further three years, despite continuing evidence pointing to systematic human rights violations including torture in Libya’s detention centres. 
Reports of grave human rights violations against asylum-seekers and refugees, and their continued denial of access to protection, failed to deter the EU from partnering with Turkey to curb migration via the 2016 EU-Turkey Deal. Ahead of Turkey’s incursion into north-eastern Syria in October, Amnesty International conducted dozens of interviews which suggested hundreds of Syrians were likely forcibly deported from Turkey between May and September, under the guise of “voluntary returns”. The deal is also causing unprecedented overcrowding of the camps in the Aegean islands, where tens of thousands of people live in destitute conditions. 
Human rights defenders under attack 
Civil society, journalists and others responsible for holding governments to account faced pressure in 2019. 
“Human rights defenders, journalists, NGOs and other people campaigning for a fairer and more just society were all at the sharp end of government crackdowns in 2019,” said Marie Struthers. 
“Their work to hold authorities to account, will only be more vital during the COVID-19 crisis and in its aftermath. The humanity and solidarity they show towards the most marginalized members of our societies are needed now more than ever, and will continue to be essential during the post-COVID-19 recovery.”

After hearing one of my classmates speak about Amnesty International by raising awareness about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada, I was interested in learning more about the organization and advocacy work overall. 
In March 2019, I joined the National Organizers Program of Amnesty International Canada where I have been able to connect and collaborate with inspiring members from across the country. Since joining the program, I have focused my efforts on bridging awareness and advocacy to student groups and organizations. During my undergraduate degree in business, human rights was a topic that was never heavily mentioned in any courses that I took. Now in social work, I have been able to observe the integration of human rights and advocacy at a much deeper level. Through my work with Amnesty International, I wish to encourage participation and awareness of advocacy and human rights action by working with students that may not receive exposure through their academics or extracurriculars. 
 
By working with Enactus York – a student-run entrepreneurial organization that seeks to create projects around social issues – I have been able to create a platform for discussions and actions on human rights to take place in an organization that is composed primarily of business students. In November 2019, the group engaged in a Write for Rights event where they were able to write letters advocating for cases involving youth. This was an exceptionally impactful moment for me as it brought a team of students together to truly use their voices for human rights defending. 
 
In addition to being involved with the National Organizers Program, I work with Amnesty International’s Action Network on Women’s Human Rights. This group focuses on issues that impact women both locally and globally that are rooted in gender inequality. My work with this group has further inspired my future goals of continuing to work in the area of gender-based discrimination and violence through a career in law and social work.  
Although it has only been one year, I have learned a great deal from being involved with Amnesty International. I look forward to continuing to grow and learn from others while working towards promoting advocacy and human rights activism.

A total of 157 organizations and 144 individuals – including Indigenous organizations, civil society groups, unions, academics and former politicians– are urging federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments to adopt robust oversight measures to strengthen human rights protection and guard against potential human rights violations during the current public health crisis. 
“Everything about this pandemic – providing treatment, curtailing its spread, dealing with the economic fall-out, ensuring that the needs of marginalized communities are met, and looking ahead to long-term transformative change – is all about human rights. And many of the public health measures being adopted by governments inevitably and necessarily lead to restrictions on other rights,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “With so many essential rights directly at stake, oversight measures are an essential means of maximizing human rights protection and minimizing human rights violations.” 
The impact of the COVID-19 virus, and the restrictive measures being adopted in response, disproportionately impact on First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, Black and racialized communities, the elderly, people living with disabilities, women and children at risk of violence in the home, refugees and migrants, official minority language communities, prisoners, sex workers, people who are living in homelessness or inadequate housing, people who use drugs, precariously-employed workers, people who are marginalized on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation and other at-risk communities.

“In trying to distract from criticisms of his own administration’s response, President Trump is undermining global efforts to protect people from one of the worst health crises in over a century.” 
“This crisis can only be solved through collective effort. COVID-19 does not respect borders, and Trump’s withdrawal will harm the United States as well as other countries fighting the virus. While other world leaders are pledging more support to the WHO, President Trump’s proposal to slash their resources at this moment of crisis will undermine efforts to save lives and halt the spread of the virus. The WHO cannot do its job if it is held hostage to the whims of powerful states, and other countries must do all they can to ensure this reckless decision does not hamper the fight against COVID-19.” 
“The Trump administration should immediately reconsider its suspension of funding. Congress should also take immediate action to halt any measures which reverse the United States’ longstanding commitment to protecting international public health. History will judge harshly those who play with people’s lives for their own political gain.” 
Background  
The WHO is the primary international body with a mandate to support global public health. In addition to playing a key role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it implements numerous programs to prevent, control, and treat Ebola, measles, malaria, HIV and AIDS, and many other diseases. The United States is currently the largest contributor to the WHO. 
Under President Trump, the United States has increasingly withdrawn from critical United Nations initiatives. Since he took office, the United States has withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency (UNESCO) and the global accord to tackle climate change.

The Coalition works to promote understanding and implementation of international standards for advancing the human rights of Indigenous peoples, in particular, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
In light of the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, and the particular threat that it poses to vulnerable communities with inadequate access to health care, housing, water and other essential services, it is imperative that federal, provincial and territorial governments respect the right of Indigenous peoples to set conditions of entry into their territories. Indigenous communities must be able to restrict access of industry workers, tourists, cottagers, and others. Where Indigenous communities have required suspension of certain activities in their territories, this must be respected. 
Guidelines defining “essential services” during the COVID-19 crisis includes manufacturing in the oil, gas, mining and electricity industries. However, the risk to Indigenous peoples and their communities cannot be understated. Where Indigenous communities have required such industry to stop operating in their territories, this must be respected. It is a discriminatory double standard for federal and provincial governments to enact physical distancing measures and legislation in response to this pandemic yet allow hundreds of workers in camps to continue working. 
In remote areas of Canada, large work camps house thousands of workers, with conditions that could spread contagious illness extremely quickly.  Indigenous communities in such regions would be exposed to outbreaks of the pandemic. There is already unsustainable pressure on health care systems in remote jurisdictions.  Every effort must be made to contain the spread of the virus and safeguard the lives of all. The extreme risk to Indigenous peoples and their communities cannot be understated. 
Across all jurisdictions in Canada, people are urged to stay home. Surely exploration, construction and expansion of major resource development projects cannot be considered essential when they endanger the health and lives of persons in highly vulnerable Indigenous communities.

Berta was gunned down by contract killers on March 2, 2016. 
 
Bringing to justice everyone responsible for the killing of Berta is vitally important to end the impunity that fuels more killings of forest and water defenders. Front Line Defenders Global Analysis 2019 reports that 31 other defenders were killed in Honduras last year. 
Pressure from inside and outside Honduras is making a difference but more is needed!  
In December 2019, seven men were sentenced to between 30 and 50 years in jail for their role in carrying out the assassination of Berta. Her organization COPINH has recognized the importance of activism by Amnesty Canada supporters. Read more in this blog about what we have helped to achieve together. 
Berta’s organization and her family have asked us to continue our efforts, in the hope of ensuring those who gave the orders and paid for the killing of Berta are brought to account. 
Messages from Canada carry weight, says Berta’s daughter Bertha Zúniga Cáceres, who courageously carries on the work her mother led to defend Indigenous rights and the environment. 
 
  
Watch the following inspiring short videos to learn more about Berta Cáceres, the struggle for which she was killed, and what her daughters want us to know about the importance of coming together to carry on Berta’s work for human rights and the environment.  
If you haven’t already, please sign the e-action here and also found at the bottom of this page. Please encourage friends to sign too by sharing on social media. Remember that expressions of concern from Canada have already helped to bring to justice those who carried out the murder of Berta. Berta’s family and organization are counting on us to keep up the pressure in order to bring to justice the masterminds behind the murder and stop the green light for more violence against earth defenders. 
Honduran authorities use twitter and are mindful of their international image. Tweet your call to them from Canada for action to bring to justice the masterminds behind the killing of Berta. You can use this image and add symbols and words to turn it into a personal message of support for the cause of Berta and other Earth Defenders in Honduras. 
Be sure to use the hashtag #JusticaParaBerta. Also be sure to tag Berta’s organization COPINH and Honduran authorities, as in the sample tweet below.

This past March, groups of activists in Regina, Ottawa, Stratford, Timmins, St. Mary’s and Toronto met to watch video footage of Berta Cáceres and then worked together to create individual and joint messages of support for Berta’s organization and its efforts to seek justice. Each participant shared photos of their artwork on their individual and the group’s social media channels, together with a link to our Justice for Berta online petition. Below are some photos of what happened in the different locations. 
IN ST. MARY’S AND STRATFORD … a poetry circle and a group of textile artists came together for a series of meetings that resulted in the creation of a collaborative poem and a beautiful banner inspired by the words of Berta. They carried the banner through their community to attract attention and once social isolation ends, they plan to hang the banner at community events where they will collect signatures for Justice for Berta and the protection of other threatened earth defenders.  
“The Art Build in Stratford/St Mary’s was a testament to the power of small groups,” says participant and textile artist Alizon Sharun. “Our sessions were creative, productive and enjoyable, bringing together people who did not all know each other, and were not all aware of Berta’s case. We left knowing much more and wanting to work together again. The poetry group is embarking on another collaborative poem.” 
  
 
 
  
  
IN OTTAWA … members of the local Amnesty group and youth organizers added colour, symbols and personal messages to black and white artwork with the evocative words ‘BERTA MULTIPLIED’. Those words are used in Honduras to signal to the authorities that killing Berta did not stop the struggle to protect water and life in Lenca territory. Participants of the art-build in Ottawa took photos with their finished images to share on social media. Then they created a banner with all of the images arranged around the words JUSTICE FOR BERTA. This banner will be used at future activism events and at a handover over of petitions and post cards to the Honduran Embassy. 
 
   
 
 
 
IN TORONTO … members of our Business and Human Rights/Indigenous Issues team worked together to paint a banner to support the defenders who continue Berta’s work.  
“Deciding on artistic elements of the banner forced us to take a more critical approach to our work,” reflects National Youth Organizer Shantel Watson. “We looked for symbols that we believed represented the struggles of Honduran Land and Water Defenders while communicating our solidarity with the Lenca People appropriately. This focused work was a great opportunity to engage more closely with members of our network.” 
 
 
Another group of activists IN TORONTO gathered to create tree hangings. 
“The tree of life is symbolic of Berta’s life and legacy,” reflected Micah Molina of the AI Toronto Action Network for Women’s Human Rights (ANWHR). “It is fitting that we macramed the trees with recycled material. Then we talked about how we could utilize the tree hangings at future human rights events. I thought this was a fantastic way to pay homage to Berta, call for justice through art, and build community.” 
Karen Castillo, of the National Organizers Program, had this to say: “I was thinking about Berta and her daughters and hoping that our weavings would let the community know they are not alone. I have always felt that art is one of the most powerful and beautiful ways of doing activism.” 
ANWHR activist Saba Abbas agreed: “For me, working on the macramé tree of life helped me find hope in the face of a tragic loss such as that of Berta. The beauty of art is that it brings the community together and sensitizes us to painful human right violations without weighing us down or making us lose hope.” 
  
   
 
IN TIMMINS … a small but dedicated group led by long-time activist Anita Spadafore literally got hands-on, creating heartfelt messages in English and Spanish on brightly coloured paper hands. The idea was to create something eye-catching, symbolic and easy to transport to Honduras for delivery to Berta’s family and organization. This installation can be hung anywhere, using bright twine. Anita called the local newspaper ahead of the art-build and convinced a reporter to write a story about why people in Timmins were taking action for a far-away human rights defender and her rural community. Once self-isolation measures are lifted, the Timmins group plans to organize another art-build with local students, building on past experiences creating Butterflies for the families of the disappeared in Mexico and blue river messages for land and water defenders in Guatemala. 
  
 
 
IN REGINA … members of the University of Regina Amnesty group took inspiration from Berta and from the young activists who took part in the Ottawa art build. They used the BERTA MULTIPLIED image to create their own messages of shared cause with water defenders under attack in Honduras. The students posted their images on social media to attract online attention. Their art work was used to create an eye-catching display on campus and encourage other students to come over to sign petitions and post cards. 
“When we were invited to organize an art-build to mobilize action for Justice for Berta, we weren’t sure what an art-build was all about!” admits student Kathryn Beatrice Bermudez. “But our group was up for giving it a try. The creative approach was great. Lots of people responded.” 
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
Do you have connections at your library, a local school, place of worship or elsewhere in your community where you could set up a table and gather signatures on our post card action? 
Our goal is to show Honduran authorities that thousands of Canadians are watching and raising their voices with Berta’s organization COPINH to demand that those who ordered the killing of Berta are brought to justice.

The global pandemic is a frightening time for humanity. Yet all around us, people are working hard to adapt to our current reality, support one another, protect the vulnerable, and together dream of a better future. In urging all levels of government to respect human rights and protect essential workers and their families, frontline healthcare workers, and communities, we are speaking together with one, unified voice.  
People across Canada living in remote, rural and Indigenous communities with lesser access to health services, hospital beds and crucially, ventilators to help the critically ill, are calling on all of us to help them shut down the known pathways of infection into their communities.  They are asking us to help them stay healthy by staying away.  
However, in March, the federal and provincial governments issued a lengthy list of essential services including the energy sector, construction and mining. Mines, hydro dam construction, pipeline construction, exploration and energy projects remain operational in many regions of Canada. And people worry that these designated essential services are putting their communities at risk.  
Shockingly, many industrial work camps which house hundreds to thousands of workers, remain open, leading rural mayors, Indigenous leaders, and frontline healthcare workers to sound the alarm about the potential for worker to community transmission. While steps have been taken to reduce workforces at some sites, some union leaders in Alberta say it isn’t a matter of ‘if’ but rather ‘when’. For Indigenous peoples and organizations, this is an unacceptable and unnecessary risk.  
In April, the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador criticized the Quebec government for allowing mining operations to resume, noting the decision to do so without consultation compromises efforts made by Indigenous communities to slow the spread of the virus and ignores the State’s duty to consult. In British Columbia, the BC Building Trades Council called for the scaling down of megaproject construction over health and safety concerns. Construction workers, it noted, often do not have access to washrooms, running water, soap or hand sanitizer at their job sites. 
The Union of BC Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) has also criticized the decision to deem megaproject construction as essential noting that these activities pose risks to Indigenous communities through inevitable community interactions. The UBCIC has pointed out that, “corporate exceptionalism cannot become a pandemic response strategy for the Governments of BC and Canada.” We could not agree more.  
For more information on Amnesty’s call to suspend construction of the Site C dam to protect the human right to health, please read and sign our latest action.  
Extractives projects require workers to spend time together in confined spaces and their living conditions include shared dining, sleeping, exercise and bathing areas. As our friends at MiningWatch Canada point out, social distancing is nearly impossible while working at many of these projects. Fly in-Fly out operations mean that workers are exposed to infection while travelling on planes and through airports, which puts the health of their families, communities and other workers at risk.  
To limit the turnover in camps, some companies have implemented longer shift rotations, in some cases moving from two-week rotations to 4 week or longer rotations. However, longer shifts and time away from loved ones can lead to increased exhaustion and stress, higher risk of accidents or lowered immunity, especially for workers with underlying health conditions. 
In addition, contract workers hired to drive buses, clean, serve food and provide housekeeping services such as laundry, face exposure risks, yet may not have health care benefits, sick leave or other forms of job security to turn to if they become infected.  
While the media have reported a number confirmed cases of infection and quarantine in camp, there is currently no publicly available data on the infection rates at these industrial sites. Canada must make information about transmission and infection rates at industrial sites across the nation transparent so that communities can prepare themselves by taking appropriate precautions.  
Companies have been forced to respond quickly to the crisis by adapting their operations to manage health risks, comply with government orders, and manage dramatic economic disruptions. However, despite these challenges, businesses must respect human rights.   
Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, all companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, wherever they operate, “regardless of their size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure.”  They are also required to “identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address their impacts on human rights.” The fact that human rights obligations of States and responsibilities of companies are clear, however, is not an assurance that they will be upheld. Communities, while vigilant, are constrained by lockdown and other social distancing measures from holding State and corporate actors to account.  
Canadian mining companies operate in more than 100 countries around the world. Some States, like Mexico, Honduras, and the Philippines, have suspended mining operations and ordered projects to enter into care and maintenance mode (to prevent underground tunnels from flooding for example). However, other countries have declared mining an essential service, allowing operations to continue, even when stockpiles of minerals are already adequate.  
There are troubling reports from frontline human rights defenders that in some cases companies are exploiting lockdown orders and social distancing requirements to push through new permit approvals, even though legally required public participation is impossible during the pandemic.  
After Alberta suspended environmental reporting rules and the United States suspended the Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement of environmental laws, communities are worried that under the guise of economic stimulation, industry lobbyists will successfully pressure governments to further loosen or streamline environmental and consultation processes. Amnesty International and our community partners will be monitoring this in the weeks ahead.  
States must not use the crisis as an excuse to roll-back environmental standards on climate, water, or air pollution. Even where standards have been suspended, business’ responsibility to respect human rights remains and exists independently of compliance with national laws and regulations. 
 
In Amnesty’s view, States must not use the economic situation generated by the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to roll-back environmental standards and delay transition towards a zero-carbon future. A massive energy sector bailout using public money could serve to further entrench fossil fuel dependency at a time when the sun is setting on this industry. In order for Canada to remain consistent with its carbon-reduction targets, any assistance to fossil fuel companies should be aimed directly at workers, maintaining current services and be conditioned on meeting Canada’s phase-out timeline. Funds must not go towards energy exploration, expansion, construction or development.  
As we look to the future, any Canadian economic recovery package must facilitate a human-rights consistent transition towards renewable energy, favoring social and human rights protections and the right to an adequate standard of living. Canada’s recent announcement that it would put $1.7 billion dollars towards cleaning up orphaned oil and gas wells abandoned by bankrupt companies and keep energy sector workers employed is a step in the right direction. Moving forward, abandoned well clean up funds should be administered through an independent fund with representation from Indigenous peoples, affected landowners and communities. 
Further investments in retraining energy workers, retrofitting buildings to be more energy efficient, improved and expanded public transportation, local and Indigenous food security, and adaptation to climate heating are not only possible, but necessary.  
All of us want the crisis to end soon. And we want to look out for one another until it does. Let’s work together to make sure that communities at risk and all workers are protected and supported. And let’s dream together of the kind of low-carbon, vibrant future we want to have emerging from this global economic and health crisis.

From the late 1950’s to the 1980’s, many children were adopted not just out of their Indigenous community, or out of province, but some were sent as far away as Germany, Britain, and Australia. The Provincial, Territorial and Canadian governments gravely violated the rights of these families: to belong to their Indigenous nation, to learn their culture and language, to not be subjected to assimilation, and to not be subjected to genocide. 
To learn more about the work being done to reconnect and support families, please read Colleen Hele-Cardinal’s introduction below and look for more information and ways to support the Network of Survivors coming soon.  
 
My name is Colleen Hele-Cardinal. I am the co-founder of the Sixties Scoop Network formerly known as the National Indigenous Survivors of Child Welfare Network. I began in 2014 with an idea to visualize our displacements using an interactive online map to show Canadians and the world what the Sixties Scoop looks like for survivors who have been displaced from their traditional homelands and territories.  Thousands of Indigenous children grew up in non-Indigenous households losing their vital connection to their language, ceremonies, kinships, identity and connection to their traditional land. 
With collaboration from Dr. Raven Sinclair’s Pe-kīwēwin Project we are excited to announce the launch of In our own Words: Mapping the Stories of 60s Scoop Survivors Diaspora*. This innovative and first of its kind of GIS interactive mapping program is a tool for Sixties Scoop survivors to: 
1.  Visualize 60’s Scoop survivors displacements across Canada, U.S and overseas by province and territory. 
2. Create a collective platform to share our stories, videos and photos. 
3. Set-up a search function with a database for survivors and their families still looking for extended families. 
The mapping project is completely voluntary and participatory. Survivors can directly input their own information into the online mapping system which will auto-populate their location of origin to displacement and repatriation if applicable. We recognize that each users experience will be unique. Users will have the option to share as little or as much information about themselves as they want, as well as short videos, pictures and a short narrative about themselves. If survivors choose to locate family members or want to be found, they have the option of uploading a picture, file, short video or details on the person whom they are looking for and/or who may be looking for them with a search function built into the map. Participants will have the option of removing any of their identifying visual data from the platform at any time. However, anonymous statistical data on province/area of child welfare removal, First Nations, Metis, Inuit identity, adopted or not adopted will be kept to inform public knowledge. The Sixties Scoop Network will have access to the platform’s visual data and Sixties Scoop survivor users will have access to their own information. 
The scope of this project is international because so many Sixties Scoop survivors were displaced through Canada’s colonial child welfare policies across provinces, borders and overseas. The Sixties Scoop is still a relatively unheard-of phenomenon that took place in the late 1950’s to early 1980’s behind closed doors with Indigenous children being apprehended, relinquished, solicited and transported across provinces, borders and overseas by social workers.  Our goal is to make the map go viral and receive as much user traffic as possible for it to become a visual tool to represent our truths. 
The second stage of the map is to disseminate the project through facilitated hands-on teaching workshops in urban cities across Canada, the USA and select cities overseas where we know adoptees were taken and still may live. Our goal is to launch that phase later this year.  This initiative is estimated to cost $50,000

“Today’s ruling means Hong Kong’s repressive mask ban is only partially revoked. Authorities will be able to target people for wearing masks in any protest that is not ‘authorized’. In the past few months, we have seen police imposing excessive restrictions on freedom of assembly, cracking down on entirely peaceful protests and declaring them unlawful. 
“At a time when the vast majority of Hong Kongers wear masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the idea of maintaining this ban is absurd, not to mention a potential threat to public health. 
“Today’s ruling also revives the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO), which essentially provides a blank cheque for the government to restrict human rights without any conditions or safeguards. 
“The Hong Kong authorities should not use emergency rules as a smokescreen for further tightening restrictions on freedom of expression, whether in times of social unrest or COVID-19. All emergency measures should be with a legitimate aim, with necessary and proportionate restrictions and subject to a time limit.” 
Background 
Hong Kong’s Court of Appeal today partially overturned an earlier ruling that the ERO and mask ban were unconstitutional, following an appeal by the Hong Kong government. The Court ruled that it is constitutional for police to enforce the mask ban in unauthorized protests. 
According to Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance, those wishing to organize a protest are required to obtain “a notice of no objection” from the police before an assembly may proceed. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has expressed concern that the application of the Ordinance can facilitate excessive restrictions that are not in line with Hong Kong’s obligations under the ICCPR to respect and protect the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly. 
In 2019, the Hong Kong police adopted a tougher approach to restricting public assemblies. 47 protests were banned by authorities, but still went ahead – some with mass participation. 
The Court also ruled today that the Hong Kong government has the power to issue emergency regulations on the grounds of public danger.  
In October 2019, the government announced a sweeping ban on full or partial face-coverings at protests. The mask ban was fast-tracked using the ERO. 
In November 2019, Amnesty International Hong Kong expressed concerns over the ERO and the mask ban in its submission to the Hong Kong legislature.

The United States has the largest immigration detention system in the world, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) holding nearly 40,000 people in over 200 centers across the country. Detainees at several ICE detention facilities have launched hunger strikes to demand their freedom and protest against dangerous and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions. 
“Today, the health and safety of every one of us is bound together. The United States has confirmed more cases of COVID-19 than any other country in the world, yet ICE continues to fail to adopt effective measures to prevent the pandemic in immigration centers across the country, putting everyone’s safety in peril,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“ICE’s unnecessary detention of tens of thousands of people poses a massive threat to public health. Detaining anyone solely for migration-related reasons during a global pandemic is cruel, reckless and deadly. ICE must urgently provide alternatives to detention and grant humanitarian parole to immigration detainees except in the most extraordinary of circumstances requiring ongoing detention.” 
ICE and its detention facilities have failed to adequately provide soap and sanitizer or introduce social distancing. Nor has it halted the unnecessary transfers of people between facilities in the interest of public health, routinely transporting thousands in and out of facilities. ICE’s unnecessary and punitive detention of people based solely on their migration status constitutes ill-treatment and discriminatory denial of the right to health. ICE has the obligation to grant humanitarian parole to immigration detainees before any more people in its custody contract COVID-19. Thus far, ICE has failed to adopt even the most minimum necessary measures to protect public health both in and around its large network of facilities. 
While downplaying the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in its detention facilities, ICE has concealed and understated the number of detainees who may have been exposed to or contracted COVID-19, hiding vital information about potential outbreaks from the people detained, their lawyers and loved ones, and the public. Amnesty International has received consistent reports of suspected COVID-19 cases and lockdowns in multiple ICE facilities, where lawyers said ICE officials refused to comment on the health situations. Lawyers have reported that they lack information about risks in ICE facilities, and that those being monitored for COVID-19 are often not being tested. ICE personnel and employees who engage in ICE operations face significant risks of contracting COVID-19, which they can then transmit to those who are detained, as well as their home communities. 
Those living with underlying illnesses – including people who are immunocompromised due to HIV – have shared through their lawyers disturbing accounts of substandard health care and inadequate conditions. Those dangerous conditions put them at heightened risk to contract and become severely ill or die from COVID-19, including medical personnel failing to provide antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV, as well as denial of requests for hand sanitizer and face masks. 
As the pandemic spread across the United States since January, ICE continued to receive and to detain families in its family residential centers, in some cases receiving families who were already symptomatic of illness, according to lawyers. At the Dilley facility, personnel of ICE and GEO Group failed to provide those detained with COVID-19 education, hand sanitizer, or protective or cleaning supplies, despite some people’s pre-existing health conditions. Facility staff did not make testing for COVID-19 available and had no plans to do so. 
A pregnant mother from Honduras who was seeking asylum with her four-year-old daughter, described her fear of contracting COVID-19 and dying, due to the inadequate conditions and care at the Dilley facility: “I cannot keep a sufficient distance from other people to keep myself safe from contracting the virus if they have it. I must be close to others all of the time. I share a room, bathroom, and the dining hall. All locations in this jail are communal.” 
Staff at ICE’s Karnes facility have also lacked access to COVID-19 tests and have not followed US public health standards for preventing the spread of COVID-19. Nearly all families reported routinely poor health care, which was not even adequate for treating headaches and the common cold. Parents and children in the facility were sick with cold-like symptoms, such as coughs, congestion, and fever, and numerous staff exhibited similar cold-like symptoms. Staff did not consistently wear masks or practice social distancing. 
Amnesty International calls on ICE to urgently provide alternatives to detention, and grant humanitarian parole to immigration detainees except in the most extraordinary of circumstances requiring ongoing detention. ICE should prioritize those who are older, have underlying medical conditions, or are otherwise at higher-risk if they contract COVID-19. ICE should also immediately release all children and families it is holding in immigration detention, and the US Congress should conduct public oversight to ensure DHS is using its authority to parole as many people as possible from ICE detention. Amnesty International urges US state governors and local authorities to utilize their authority to instruct immigration detention facilities, and county and local jails, to reduce their immigration detainee occupancy. 
Background and context 
On March 24, Amnesty International issued guidelines for governments in the Americas to adopt human rights-compliant responses to COVID-19. On March 17, Amnesty International and partner organizations called on the 11 US governors whose states host the majority of immigration detainees, to use their public health and licensing authority to instruct federal immigration detention facilities and county and local jails and prisons to substantially reduce their detainee occupancy capacity. 
On March 31, 2020, the four lead UN agencies on human rights, global health, migrants and refugees, issued a joint statement calling for the release without delay of migrants and asylum seekers being held in cramped and unsanitary immigration detention conditions. The agencies also called for the immediate release of all children and their families, as well as those detained without sufficient legal basis.

0,Bangladesh: COVID-19 response flaws put older Rohingya refugees in imminent danger,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/bangladesh-covid-19-response-flaws-put-older-rohingya-refugees-in-imminent-danger/,Older refugees are both the most at risk from the pandemic and the least included in the humanitarian response Dangerous lack of access to even basic information Mistakes made during general humanitarian response efforts for Rohingya refugees are being repeated Older Rohingya refugees in...,"Older Rohingya refugees in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh are being left behind in the humanitarian response to COVID-19, which could have devastating consequences given the high risks older people everywhere face from this deadly pandemic, Amnesty International said today. 
Bangladesh, together with the UN and other humanitarian partners, has made efforts to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading to the camps outside Cox’s Bazar, including a decision, as of 23 March, to increase COVID-19-specific assistance, stop large gatherings, and order preventative measures. But basic, accurate information about the illness and measures to prevent its spread is failing to reach many people in the camps, and especially older people, as the humanitarian response pays insufficient attention to their specific needs. 
“At the best of times, humanitarian organizations struggle or fail to meet the specific needs of older people in refugee and displacement camps. Repeating this same mistake amid the COVID-19 pandemic puts older Rohingya women and men in imminent danger – with some of them not even receiving the most basic information about what is happening and how they can best stay safe,” said Matt Wells, Crisis Response Deputy Director – Thematic Issues at Amnesty International. 
“Donor countries and humanitarian organizations should urgently work together to remedy this lack of accessible information and implement a plan to ensure that older refugees are not left behind yet again in this time of elevated global risk.” 
In the last week of March, Amnesty International interviewed 15 older Rohingya women and men living in seven of the 34 refugee camps near Cox’s Bazar, in south-eastern Bangladesh. The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) indicates there are more than 31,500 refugees age 60 or older in the camps, among the almost 860,000 Rohingya forced to flee Myanmar, most of them since late 2017 as a result of crimes the UN has said likely amount to genocide. 
Mistakes being repeated 
In June 2019, Amnesty International released a report on the impact of conflict and displacement on older people in Myanmar. It examined how, in the Bangladesh refugee camps, the humanitarian response has failed to respect older people’s rights to health, food, water, and sanitation. Many problems stem from not including older people’s views and inputs and from not considering their needs and risks when designing assistance. 
These same mistakes are being repeated with the COVID-19 response, despite all medical evidence demonstrating that older people are one of the most at-risk populations. 
Most older people interviewed by Amnesty International had received little specific information about COVID-19. Before large gatherings were barred and preventative measures like social distancing ordered, there were some informational meetings in the camps, but many older people were not informed. Those who knew about them were unable to attend because of physical disabilities that made it difficult, if not impossible, to navigate the camps’ hilly terrain. 
Fear is rampant 
Only one of the 15 older people interviewed by Amnesty International had anyone come to their shelter to provide information about COVID-19. A few others received news through family members about the disease and preventative measures like frequent hand-washing. Most had heard primarily from religious leaders and neighbours, with little detail other than the virus was very dangerous and they needed to “live clean”. As a result, fear is rampant. 
“I’m very afraid, because if the virus arrives to the camp, no one will be alive, as here many people are living in very small place,” said Hotiza, a woman around 85 years old.    
Poor access to information about COVID-19  
Access to information for all residents has been restricted in the camps generally since the Bangladesh authorities cut off access to telecommunications and the internet in September 2019. Amnesty International, the UN, and many other organizations have called for such restrictions to be lifted immediately. 
However, even if telecommunications are restored, efforts specifically targeted at older refugees will remain vital, as many do not have access to smartphones. Amnesty International’s report on older people showed how the humanitarian response is too often rooted in an assumption that information and assistance will filter to older people through their families, which fails to respect older people’s rights and causes harm.  
To their credit, the Bangladesh authorities and humanitarian organizations have designed creative ways to disseminate information, including through attaching megaphones to tuktuks and blasting messages in the camps in the Rohingya language about COVID-19 and preventative sanitary measures. But while most older people interviewed knew such messaging was happening, they often were not able to hear the messages in detail or at all. 
Sayeda, in her 80s, said: “I don’t know anything about that virus, just people are saying something about a virus on the megaphone, but I don’t hear well, that’s why I don’t know anything… I’m always thinking, what are they saying on the microphone.” 
Some older people had not even received the most basic of information. 
“I didn’t hear any new things, just people are saying, ‘A disease is coming, pray,’” said Abdu Salaam, 70, who said he had a physical disability that left him unable to walk well. He also lacked access to adequate care for pain and other significant health problems. 
In the absence of sound medical advice, the family of at least one older person interviewed had resorted to buying an unproven medicine to “save” them from the virus. 
Improving the COVID-19 response 
The humanitarian response needs to tap into networks of Rohingya volunteers who can go shelter-to-shelter to bring older people information and to hear from older people about how to best prepare a response that meets their needs. This should focus particularly on groups most at risk of not getting timely and accurate information through other means, especially older people living alone, older women, and older people who are primary caregivers for young children. Volunteers should be carefully trained to ensure they do not expose older people to infection, including by maintaining as much distance as possible during shelter visits. 
Critical information that should be prioritized includes a clear understanding of COVID-19 symptoms and preventative measures. Most older people interviewed by Amnesty International knew, for example, that sanitation was important, but associated it primarily with washing hands after using the toilet and before eating; and not allowing children to play in dirty areas. While these are important measures in general, they are woefully insufficient for and unspecific to COVID-19. 
Donors, the UN, and humanitarian organizations must further act urgently to ensure older people can put preventative measures into practice, including by ensuring older people have access to sufficient water and sanitation infrastructure – addressing the specific challenges faced by older people living alone and older people with limited mobility, among others. 
Older people are also particularly at risk of being harmed by well-meaning restrictive measures, including in their access to food and health care. As documented in Amnesty International’s 2019 report, older women and men often have difficulty accessing camp clinics and, even when they can, find many clinics lack essential medications for non-communicable diseases like high blood pressure. As a result, older people rely disproportionately on purchasing life-saving medications at market stalls. 
As of 31 March, pharmacy stalls remained open in the camps, even as many other shops have been closed to reduce risks associated with crowds. Any decision to close pharmacy stalls must include measures that ensure older people still have access to essential medications. 
The current challenges in the camps near Cox’s Bazar during the COVID-19 pandemic show how the UN and donors appear to be replicating the same failure to prioritize older people as they have long done in wider humanitarian efforts. The UN Global Humanitarian Response Plan to COVID-19 did not include older people as a separate “most affected and at-risk population group”, unlike children, and women and girls. Rather, “old age” was included at the end of a list of “conditions” framed as “people suffering from…”. The result both undervalued the risks of COVID-19 to older people, by not including them as a specific group; and propagated a discriminatory idea that older age is something one “suffers from”. 
“Older displaced people face a devastating combination: they are the group most at-risk of COVID-19, and they are also the group least included in humanitarian response. Their invisibility must end now. Governments, donors, and humanitarian organizations must put older people at the centre of their planning and response, to minimize the deadly consequences of this global pandemic,” said Matt Wells.

More than 50 years after untreated mercury was dumped into the English and Wabigoon Rivers, causing widespread mercury poisoning and loss of cultural traditions, the community has finally signed a deal with the federal government for a mercury care home.   
In 2017, the federal government committed to building a mercury care home for community members suffering from the impacts of mercury poisoning. After years of delay, a $19.5 million dollar agreement to build a care facility was finally signed on April 2nd. This agreement is an important step forward for justice, but long-term funding for the operation and services of the facility still needs to be secured.   
 
  
  
  
“Canada, and Minister Miller have made sacred promises to us in this contract and in person, and we will make sure that those promises are honoured. We will see that the Mercury Care Home is built well, built quickly, and meets the care needs of our people.” – Chief Rudy Turtle    
  
  
  
While more pressure is needed to secure long-term funding, this agreement is certainly a victory for the people of Grassy Narrows who have been calling for justice for decades. Amnesty International supporters have been taking action in solidarity with Grassy Narrows for more than 10 years. This past December, Grassy Narrows was included as a case in Amnesty’s annual Write for Rights campaign. More than 400,000 letters from around the world called for justice for Grassy Narrows, including 15,000 letters here in Canada. Thank you to everyone who continues to support the people of Asubpeeschoseewagong in their call for justice so that they and the next generations of young people can have a healthy future.

As one Indigenous nurse recently told Amnesty International by telephone: “I explain the importance of not leaving our villages. We are over 400 people in this Indigenous territory. If one person gets COVID-19, it can contaminate us all.”  
Worries about the spread of the virus among Indigenous peoples have increased, as this week the first case among Brazil’s Indigenous peoples was confirmed: in Amazonas state, a 20-year-old Indigenous Kokama woman tested positive for the virus.  
In Brazil, these fears have a long history. Epidemics of infectious diseases repeatedly hit Indigenous communities, the impacts worsened by the low standard of health services provided by the government. Amnesty International spoke recently to two health providers at Brazil’s Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health (SESAI). What they described does not bode well for the weeks and months ahead: a lack of protective equipment and hand sanitizer among SESAI’s health workers, as well as general staff shortages from years of maintaining the agency on a shoe-string budget. The dire situation prompted the Coalition of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil–APIB to demand that the government implement an Emergency Action Plan. 
Even while the COVID-19 pandemic threatens the health of Indigenous peoples in Brazil’s Amazon, pressure over their traditional lands is increasing as grileiros –individuals who illegally seize land – sense an opportunity to exploit the crisis. Although it’s currently the rainy season in the Amazon (which runs from roughly October to May) many grileiros are active, plotting out lots and cutting access paths through the jungle. 
Even before COVID-19, pressures on Brazil’s Amazon were increasing. Using satellite monitoring of deforestation, INPE (Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research) reported the loss of 469 km² in the Amazon in the first two months of 2020 – up 71.2% over the same period in 2019. 
One of the unavoidable effects of voluntary ‘lockdowns’ in Indigenous villages is a reduction of their ability to patrol their territories. A Manoki Indigenous leader in Mato Grosso state told Amnesty International that patrols conducted jointly with IBAMA (the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) in February 2020 had found new paths into their territory and signs recently put up by grileiros to mark out new plots of land. He added “now we have suspended our monitoring. We had one inspection planned for April but we cancelled.” 
Brazil’s decree that environmental protection is an “essential service” during the pandemic exists only on paper. In practice, under the current circumstances environmental authorities have less capacity to implement their enforcement role. For example, a FUNAI (National Indian Foundation – the state agency that oversees land demarcation and other issues relating to Indigenous peoples) officer in Pará state who spoke to Amnesty International on condition of anonymity said that at least one key protection base in the region of Altamira was down to two staff instead of the usual four. 
According to a recent estimate published by Reuters, roughly one-third of IBAMA’s field operatives won’t go to the field because they are over 60 or have pre-existing medical conditions that put them at greater risk from the virus. Field inspection staff are further hampered by logistical difficulties caused by fewer flights and closures of hotels and restaurants. 
These impediments follow on from a year in which the Bolsonaro administration undermined Brazil’s system of inspecting and monitoring protected areas. There have been changes of key personnel: in one particularly worrying move, a former missionary was recently appointed to be the head of FUNAI’s department for isolated and recently contacted tribes.  
During 2019, budgets were slashed, patrols reduced. The number of environmental fines levied by IBAMA in 2019 fell by 34% over 2018. Correspondingly, as documented Amnesty International in November 2019, some cattle farmers and grileiros have intensified their efforts to illegally seize protected land to graze cattle there. 
The few government officials remaining on the front lines are extremely worried. An environmental agent responsible for a national park in Rondônia state, and who spoke to Amnesty International on condition of anonymity, told us they had received information that “invaders intend to take advantage of the situation (of the pandemic) to invade this week.” Another FUNAI official who covers an Indigenous territory in Rondônia state said that “organized crime will take advantage of the state’s fragility during the pandemic to attack and destroy the protected areas.” 
COVID-19 – and the economic slow-down that may follow – means Brazil’s government needs to do more, not less, to protect Indigenous peoples and the Amazon. Brazil should ensure Indigenous peoples have equal access to health care and protective measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As a matter of urgency, Brazil also needs to step up monitoring and patrols of Indigenous territories and environmentally protected areas in the Amazon region, while taking all measures to ensure the safety of government officers. In the months ahead, Brazil needs to strengthen Indigenous and environmental protection agencies, including with financial and human resources. Authorities should ensure the current health crisis will not be an opportunity for grileiros to destroy the Amazon forest.

Technology can and should play an important role during this effort to save lives, including by spreading public health messages and increasing access to health care. However, in the name of combatting the disease, some governments are rushing to expand their use of surveillance technologies to track individuals and even entire populations. 
If left unchecked and unchallenged, these measures have the potential to fundamentally alter the future of privacy and other human rights. 
Is surveillance to tackle COVID-19 legal? 
Governments have an obligation to guarantee the right to health and to prevent, treat and control epidemics. In order to do this, they may temporarily restrict some human rights to respond to health emergencies in timely and coordinated ways. However, increased surveillance measures will be unlawful unless they can meet strict criteria. Governments must be able to show that measures implemented are provided for by law and are necessary, proportionate, time-bound, and that they are implemented with transparency and adequate oversight.   
What this means in practice is that surveillance measures must be the least intrusive measures available to achieve the desired result. They must not do more harm than good.   
Lessons learnt from recent history tell us that once these surveillance capabilities and infrastructure are in place there is a real danger they become permanent fixtures. In the wake of the attacks of 11 September 2001 (9/11), government surveillance apparatus expanded significantly. Once these capabilities and infrastructure are in place, governments seldom have the political will to roll them back. 
Using Personal Location Data 
Many countries are using cell phone data to track people’s movements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Austria, Belgium, Italy, the UK and Germany are all reportedly gathering anonymized or aggregated location data from telecom companies to help track coronavirus contacts. 
Other countries are using cell phone data but without the added protections of anonymization or aggregation. For instance, media reports suggest that Ecuador’s government has authorized GPS tracking to enforce compliance to quarantine. The Israeli authorities’ move to permit the security service to use cell phone data of infected persons has already raised privacy concerns. This system is apparently already operational, with 400 people recently receiving SMS messages warning them of potential contact with infected persons. 
In South Korea, authorities have been sending health advisory texts which have been accompanied with personal details of infected patients, including hyperlinks which open to detailed data about their movements. This measure has raised alarm bells because it breaches medical confidentiality and fuels stigma against people with the virus. It does not appear to meet the conditions required for surveillance to be lawful and is a violation of the right to privacy. 
These measures raise important questions about our personal information is collected, used and shared. Once personal data is collected, there is a real danger of it being shared and used for purposes other than health tracking. 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data  
Several states are turning to AI and big data technologies to combat COVID-19. China is reportedly using a mix of ‘smart’ thermal scanners and facial recognition technologies in public places to track the spread of the virus. Chinese tech giant Alibaba has rolled out a health tracking feature that uses data about personal health and assigns a colour-coded health status to an individual. Green is for ‘safe’, yellow requires a seven-day quarantine and red is for a 14-day quarantine.  This system is used to determine people’s access to public spaces. Worryingly, the app shares this data with law enforcement authorities. 
In Poland, the government has rolled out an app intended to ensure compliance with home quarantining. It reportedly sends prompts for selfies to be uploaded, which are then verified using facial recognition and location data to ensure that the person hasn’t violated quarantine orders. Similar apps are reportedly being rolled out in other countries, including one in India which seeks geo-tagged selfies. 
AI technologies could also increase the possibility of unlawful discrimination and may disproportionately harm already marginalized communities. Many of the technologies being deployed use opaque algorithms with biased data, and using these in decision-making entrenches discrimination against certain groups. 
Governments should not use surveillance technologies which gather forms of data beyond what is legitimately needed to contain the disease. In addition, governments must address data protection and discrimination concerns.   
Private Surveillance Companies 
While public-private collaborations can provide necessary creative solutions to deal with health crises, many governments are turning to surveillance companies with deeply worrying human rights records. 
For instance, controversial surveillance vendors Clearview AI and Palantir are reportedly in talks with US authorities. The Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, which has a history of selling to abusive governments, is now selling a big data analysis tool which claims to track the spread of the disease by mapping people’s movements. 
Like NSO Group, many surveillance companies have a history of operating in the shadows and have remained unaccountable for their human rights abuses. 
It is critical that companies involved in the fight against COVID-19 identify, prevent, mitigate and account for any human rights risks that may arise from the pandemic context with regard to their operations, products and services. Companies must not use the COVID-19 crisis to evade their human rights responsibilities. 
Beyond the pandemic 
As we come together to face this unprecedented crisis, it is important to have a long-term view of the measures we are undertaking to combat the virus. These may outlast the crisis and could define what surveillance in a post COVID-19 world looks like. It is important that human rights for all remains at the centre of that vision for the future.

In doing so, they are pushing people into unhygienic and unsafe environments, contrary to international human rights and public health guidelines. 
“Migration status is irrelevant to every human being’s dignity and their right to live. Instead of putting people’s health at increased risk, governments should be doing everything in their power to protect them,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“In order to effectively combat COVID-19 in the Americas and avert thousands of preventable deaths, states should swiftly release people from immigration detention, only detain migrants in extraordinary cases and ensure their access to lifesaving healthcare without discrimination.” 
CANADA 
On 24 March, Amnesty International wrote to the Canadian government to express concerns over its inadequate efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among immigrant detainees and recommended swiftly reducing to an absolute minimum the number of people held in immigration detention facilities. 
While the Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA) only detains a few hundred people in its immigration detention facilities at any given time, the rate of deaths per capita among Canadian immigration detainees is several times higher than that of immigration detainees in the United States. 
The CBSA must detain people only in the most exceptional circumstances and should generally end migration-related detention. In addition to the real risks to the physical health of people in detention during the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological stress is significant for those detained, and for their families. Immigration detainees at the Immigration Holding Centre (IHC) in Laval, Quebec have been so anxious about the risk of contracting COVID-19 in detention that they have gone on hunger strike, as they demand to be released. Psychological impact should be seriously taken into consideration when determining whether it is necessary to detain or maintain detention. 
Curaçao 
As of 30 March, Curaçao restricted entry to Curaçao to all travellers, including legal residents, until 12 April. 
Authorities in Curaçao also often detain Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers and deny them access to international protection. A visit by Refugees International in April 2019 concluded: “Not only has the government of Curaçao failed to put in place a protection scheme for this population, it has enforced an ‘active removal strategy’ by arresting, detaining, and deporting Venezuelans with irregular status.” 
As of March 2020, the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform estimated there were 16,500 Venezuelans on the island, but it was unclear how many of those were in migratory detention. During Amnesty International visits in 2018 and 2019, the organization observed appalling conditions including overcrowding, lack of hygiene and inadequate bedding in the areas where people with irregular migration status were detained. 
In May 2018, several cases of ill-treatment upon arrest or in detention were reported to Amnesty International, including those of guards sexually abusing women detainees by asking them for sexual acts in exchange for soap and sanitary towels. In January 2020, asylum lawyers on the island told Amnesty International that several Venezuelans, who had been detained for over eight months already at that time, went on a hunger strike to protest against the conditions in detention. 
Curacao should release and grant access to necessary healthcare and other essential services for all migrants and asylum seekers in migration-related detention.   
MEXICO 
Following the closure of Mexico’s border with Guatemala, and restrictions put in place by other Central American governments, authorities have failed to consider alternatives to detention for migrants who are stuck in detention, instead of being released through deportation by bus to Central America. Although the government announced that detention centres are at 45-percent capacity and are following all sanitary recommendations to prevent spread of COVID-19, some detention centres are reportedly overcrowded and even mixing children and teenagers with adult populations due to a lack of space, such as the detention centre in Tenosique in the state of Tabasco. 
On 31 March, a Guatemalan asylum seeker died after a protest by migrants demanding their release led to a fire in the Tenosique detention centre. Amnesty International has received information that could indicate that law enforcement authorities present initially refused to open the gates despite the fire in the premises. To date, Mexican authorities have not made public any information on this death in migration custody, nor regarding over the over ten migrants and asylum seekers that information indicates were wounded in the events. This has not been the only protest in recent days. 
On 24 March, hundreds of migrants and asylum seekers protested at Mexico’s largest migration detention centre, “Siglo XXI” in Tapachula, Chiapas state, while protests in other detentions centres have also been reported. 
Detainees are still at serious risk of any outbreak and the response from authorities has been insufficient. Furthermore, with no clarity on how long migrants and asylum seekers will remain detained, Mexican authorities could be at risk of breaking their own migration laws and allowing for a regime of indefinite detention, flouting international human rights standards. 
Mexican authorities have the responsibility to work towards finding viable and appropriate alternatives to detention, and must start working on doing so right now, especially for groups in a vulnerable situation. The National Migration Institute (INM) confirmed on 17 March that 3,059 irregular migrants remained in detention. 
Mexico should swiftly release as many migrants and asylum seekers as possible from immigrant detention centres, whose right to physical and mental health cannot be upheld in these facilities. 
Due to the dire security situation of migrants and asylum seekers in Mexico, where they are prime targets for violence and exploitation, Mexican authorities must not only release them from detention, but also provide them with emergency humanitarian protection to ensure all migrants and asylum seekers have access – free from discrimination – to essential services, care and safety, including adequate food and healthcare. 
TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO 
On 18 March, Trinidad and Tobago responded to COVID-19 by banning entry of all non-nationals for 14 days, and four days later closed its international borders to nationals as well. 
Trinidad and Tobago has no national legislation on refugees. The Regional Inter-Agency Coordination Platform estimates that some 24,000 Venezuelans live in the country as of March 2020. As of January 2020, 17,391 had applied for asylum with UNHCR, the UN refugee agency mandated to process such claims. Approximately 16,500 of those were also granted temporary visas and work permits in 2019, after the government registered them during a two-week period. 
Nevertheless, the country continues to criminalize and detain migrants and refugees – particularly those fleeing the crisis in Venezuela – who enter irregularly, contrary to international human rights standards. Police said they detained 33 Venezuelans on 17 March, while, as of 23 March, 60 Venezuelan men and women were being detained for irregular entry at the Cedros police station, according to media reports.  
Despite repeated formal requests sent to the Ministry of National Security, Amnesty International has been unable to visit Trinidad’s Immigration Detention Centre (IDC), where in recent years hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants and asylum seekers have been held, among other nationalities. Other independent human rights organizations and NGOs are also not permitted access. The precise number of those currently detained at the IDC is unclear, though its capacity is estimated at 150. 
One of the few institutions that has been able to visit the centre – the Joint Select Committee on Human Rights, Equality and Diversity – observed in June 2018 a range of health and sanitation concerns in the detention facilities, which could put detainees at heightened risk of harm during any outbreak of COVID-19. The Committee specifically observed: “the lack of financial resources to construct a designated area for detainees who need to be quarantined due to illness or other considerations.” 
The government of Trinidad and Tobago should release any migrants and asylum seekers held in immigration detention solely for irregular entry or while awaiting their asylum claims and grant them access to necessary healthcare and other essential services, free from discrimination. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
The United States has the largest immigration detention system in the world, with an average daily population of nearly 40,000 immigrants and asylum seekers in over 200 facilities. 
On 24 March, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a US immigration detention facility. Since then, ICE has revealed that 33 of its personnel and employees have contracted the virus, and dozens of detainees have been quarantined as potentially at risk. 
Amnesty International has received disturbing accounts from detainees of dangerous conditions in ICE immigration detention facilities, which puts people with underlying medical conditions at higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19.   
Next week Amnesty International will release a report documenting how DHS officials and ICE facilities have failed to adopt adequate measures to ensure public health for everyone, including by supplying soap and sanitizer to those in detention, facilitating social distancing in line with global standards, and providing adequate and responsive health care to those exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.

More than 100 civil society groups joined Amnesty in signing the statement, including Access Now, Human Rights Watch and Privacy International. 
“Technology can play an important role in the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, however, this does not give governments carte blanche to expand digital surveillance. The recent past has shown governments are reluctant to relinquish temporary surveillance powers. We must not sleepwalk into a permanent expanded surveillance state now,” said Rasha Abdul Rahim, Deputy Director of Amnesty Tech. 
“Increased digital surveillance to tackle this public health emergency, can only be used if certain strict conditions are met. Authorities cannot simply disregard the right to privacy and must ensure any new measures have robust human rights safeguards. Wherever governments use the power of technology as part of their strategy to beat COVID-19, they must do so in a way that respects human rights.”

Effective March 21, 2020, an Order-In-Council prohibits refugee claimants arriving from the United States to enter Canada for the purposes of refugee protection. 
The Canadian Council for Refugees, Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers, Amnesty International, and BC Civil Liberties Association jointly call on the government to reconsider its closure of the Canada-US border to refugees. This closure violates international law. With Refugee Rights Day being marked across Canada on April 4, these organizations are calling attention to the grave threat to refugee rights with the prohibition on refugee arrivals at the land border. 
According to Dorota Blumczynska, President of the Canadian Council for Refugees, “The right to seek asylum, to seek refuge, cannot and must be not compromised in the midst of this global pandemic. In fact, in times of such tremendous uncertainty, we must recommit and uphold the rights which are fundamental to our existence. It is abhorrent to turn away refugees who have every legal right, under both Canadian and international law, to enter Canada in order to save their lives. The Government of Canada with support from our Public Health Officials has the means to put in place self-isolation requirements for arriving refugee claimants. Refugee claimants, including families with children, are equally invested in the wellbeing of their loved ones, their neighbours, and friends and would pose no greater threat to public health than arriving international students or temporary foreign workers.” 
Turning back refugee claimants to the US violates Canada’s legal obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention, protected rights under section 7 and section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, and could violate the Convention against Torture. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has published key legal considerations on refugees seeking asylum in the context of the COVID-19 response. These legal considerations clearly stipulate that imposing a blanket measure to preclude the admission of refugees without evidence of a health risk and without measures to protect refugees from forced return to persecution or torture would be discriminatory and would not meet international standards. 
“Canada’s decision is out of step with public health measures designed to curb the spread of COVID-19, and runs counter to our international legal obligations. From moral, public health and legal perspectives, closing the border to refugee claimants is wrong. Turning refugee claimants away—including as a result of the decision to shut down the Canada/US border—exposes refugees, who face increased hardship, danger and ostracization worldwide related to this pandemic, to serious human rights violations, including inhumane immigration detention conditions and the risk of refoulement to torture and other human rights abuses,” states Alex Neve, Secretary General at Amnesty International Canada. 
According to Harsha Walia, Executive Director of the BC Civil Liberties Association, “The federal announcement to temporarily suspend refugee arrivals at the Canada-US border violates international law, refugee rights, and principles of human rights. It is also not necessary to preserve public health. Refugees must be actively included in, not excluded from, our public health response. This decision is particularly disturbing as we celebrate Refugee Rights Day on April 4. Refugees have a right to safety and the COVID-19 pandemic is a global one; we can’t displace the pandemic beyond our borders.” 
“We urge the Prime Minister to reconsider. The government had earlier announced a sensible plan to ensure safe housing and quarantine for refugees crossing in to Canada during the COVID-19 crisis. The vast majority of refugees were crossing at a specific location, and this ensured orderly processing into the refugee system, and fulsome application of public health measures. If this policy is maintained, even in the short term, the federal government must secure firm assurances that refugee claimants who are turned back at the border and into ICE custody, are not returned to their country of persecution, nor placed into immigration detention. Canada should also commit that such claimants will be able to return to the border after the crisis is over, without prejudice to their ability to seek refugee protection in this country,” further states Maureen Silcoff, President of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. 
The groups maintain that the closure of the border to refugees is unnecessary and unjustified. It endangers both refugees and our public health. We do not have to choose between tackling the pandemic and upholding human rights: we can and should do both.

Europe at a Crossroads sets out clear guidance on what governments should and should not do in response to the ongoing pandemic. These include ensuring people’s right to health, guaranteeing the rights to housing, water and sanitation, and ensuring protection for the most vulnerable in society. 
“Restrictions on some of our most basic human rights are spreading across Europe almost as fast as the virus itself. Whilst many of these are necessary to protect public health, history will not judge kindly those that use the pandemic as a pretext for discrimination, repression or censorship,” said Marie Struthers, Europe Director at Amnesty International.  
“While states have an obligation to take steps to control the spread of the pandemic, human rights must be kept at the centre of all prevention, containment and treatment efforts.”  
Amnesty International’s central call to states is that authorities take all measures to the maximum extent their resources allow to counter the pandemic and fulfil everyone’s right to health. 
It also means recognizing that some groups face a heightened risk of infection. For example, older people and people with specific underlying health conditions are likely to face more serious health risks associated with COVID-19. 
Vulnerable groups such as asylum seekers, refugees and migrants, particularly those in overcrowded camps, face greater risk of infection. Likewise, marginalized groups such as Roma, the homeless and people deprived of liberty in prisons, immigration detention centres, and other types of institutions must be protected.   
States must take account of the fact that women and children may be at increased risk of domestic violence and victims may be forced to self-isolate with their abusive partners or relatives. Resources and measures need to be allocated to mitigate risks and ensure they continue accessing protection and support services during the crisis and that such services are accessible to all women, including those with irregular immigration status without fear of deportation.   
Many European governments have passed emergency laws and taken measures that restrict freedom of movement, association, expression and public assembly, the right to private and family life and the right to work. While some emergency measures are justified, governments must ensure that such measures are always lawful, necessary and proportionate, and are temporary and subject to independent oversight and review. 
While restrictions on movement may be required, the pandemic should not be used as a pretext to turn refugees away. The right to seek asylum must be recognized, and people should not be returned to places where they could be at risk of serious human rights violations. 
“As the days go by it is increasingly apparent that the COVID-19 crisis is affecting everyone. But some people in our societies are suffering a great deal more than others,” said Marie Struthers.  
“This crisis reveals how exclusion, inequality and human rights violations are interconnected. But this crisis also gives European governments an opportunity to make the radical changes needed for us to be the society we want to be. A society that puts human rights at the forefront of any measures we taken, ensures that no one is left behind, and takes care to protect the groups most at risk.”

Those are the words of Cuba’s well-known opposition leader and prisoner of conscience José Daniel Ferrer following his transfer from prison to house arrest in early April.  
Enjoy this short but heartfelt message of thanks to individuals and organizations around the world for their solidarity or this longer one in which his passion is visibly undiminished. Both were translated to English by Amnesty International’s Urgent Action participant, Michael Lima Cuadra (Twitter: @ngotranslations. IG @ngoresearcher) who spoke with José Daniel Ferrer recently.  
Here is Michael’s background on José Daniel Ferrer and his account of their conversation:  
  
    José Daniel Ferrer is a leading figure in the movement for democracy and human rights in Cuba and a former prisoner of conscience.  
Since 1992 he has been persecuted by State Security (political police) for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of opinion and expression.  Following his arrest in 2003 during the crackdown on dissidents known as the Black Spring, he was declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. He served 8 of a 25-year sentence for his role as a Varela Project leader in the eastern provinces, collecting signatures to hold a referendum demanding changes to the constitution such as freedom of speech and freedom of association.   
    In retaliation for his role as the leader of the Patriotic Union of Cuba—a movement he founded in 2011 and which in less than a decade has carried out the largest number of public demonstrations in the island —Ferrer was arrested and imprisoned once again on October 1, 2019. Three other members of his organization— José Pupo Chaveco, Fernando González Vaillant and Roilán Zárraga—were also arrested that day.  
    During more than six months of imprisonment in the Aguadores prison in Santiago de Cuba, Ferrer was subjected to physical and psychological torture. “I was harassed all the time and subjected to sleep deprivation. I was prohibited from reading and writing. My cell was small, stinky, and filled with insects and mosquitoes. Time there passed excruciatingly slowly.” Under extreme isolation, “a minute seems like an hour. An hour feels like a day. A day turns into a month.”   
At the trial that took place on February 26, 2020, Ferrer and the other UNPACU activists were convicted of “injuries” and “privation of liberty.”  Their conviction and subsequent sentencing – in a nation where the judiciary lacks independence and is subordinated to the interests of the ruling Communist Party – has been called “shameful” by Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.  Cuban authorities prevented Amnesty International, the European Union, and the foreign press from attending the trial. Based on eyewitness accounts from relatives who attended, the trial was plagued with gross irregularities. It has been reported that witnesses for the defense were harassed by state security agents. Crucial recorded testimony from the accuser’s wife denouncing how State Security pressured her husband (the accuser) to give false testimony against José Daniel Ferrer – was deliberately excluded by the judge.   
    In a phone conversation with José Daniel Ferrer on April 5, 2020 he pointed out that the trial was a farce and took great pride in speaking truth to power: 
Even though the regime prohibited me to speak during the trial and rang a bell to shut me up every time I spoke, I stood up to them, challenged their orders and answered back at different moments. I told them I was the one making the accusations and conveyed to them that in Cuba there are no independent courts and they [the regime] were violating their own constitution. Talking back to my jailers during the trial is something I take tremendous pride in as I was unable to do so during the 2003 trial.”   
    Thanks to an international campaign in solidarity with José Daniel Ferrer and the other political prisoners, they were released from the Aguadores prison in Santiago de Cuba on April 3, 2020 and placed under house arrest. While it is good news that the courageous activists are no longer in prison where they were at risk of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, they should never have been arrested for peacefully expressing their ideas. Their house arrest convictions of four and a half years for José Daniel Ferrer, five years for José Pupo Chaveco, four and a half years for Roilán Zárraga and three years and eight months for Fernando González, are arbitrary sentences and should be vacated.  
    José Daniel Ferrer has conveyed his heartfelt gratitude to Amnesty International supporters for their solidarity: “My fraternal embrace and gratitude to Amnesty International for their vital work to raise global awareness and motivate other organizations such as the European Union to take action.”

“This is a welcome, though long overdue, step towards providing truth and accountability for the victims of US air strikes and their families in Somalia and beyond. It’s shocking that it has taken more than a decade of AFRICOM’s secret air war in Somalia for this to happen. 
“We continue to stand in solidarity with families of civilians who have been killed or injured in US attacks, only to have their loved ones smeared as ‘terrorists’ and have their plight ignored. The truth must come out and they deserve transparency, accountability and reparation – all of which have been sorely lacking from the US military to date. 
“We denounce violations of international humanitarian law by all sides and will continue to provide AFRICOM with the findings of our in-depth independent investigations into credible reports of civilian deaths and injuries and violations of international humanitarian law. And we will continue to push for thorough, independent and impartial investigations into credible allegations of violations.” 
Yesterday evening, AFRICOM pledged to publish quarterly reports on the status of its internal investigations into reported civilian casualties, something US-led military operations elsewhere in the world are already doing. 
The military statement came just hours before Amnesty International today published the latest in a series of investigations into civilian casualties resulting from US air strikes in Somalia. 
To date, the organization has gathered extensive testimonial evidence and relied on expert analysis of images and video from strike sites, satellite imagery and weapons identification to investigate nine separate cases where US air strikes have killed a total of 21 civilians and injured 11 more, some of which were due to apparent violations of international humanitarian law. 
Last April, AFRICOM admitted to its first civilian casualties in the decade-long war in Somalia, citing Amnesty International’s advocacy in its statement. However, in that and every other case, AFRICOM and other US authorities have failed to contact the families of the dead or offer reparation.

US...","Civilian casualties continue to mount from the US military’s secret air war in Somalia, with no justice or reparation for the victims of possible violations of international humanitarian law, Amnesty International warned as it released details of two more deadly air strikes so far this year. 
US Africa Command (AFRICOM) has conducted hundreds of air strikes in the decade-long fight against the armed group Al-Shabaab, but has only admitted to killing civilians in a single strike that took place exactly two years ago today. This lone admission was prompted by Amnesty International’s research and advocacy.  
“The evidence is stacking up and it’s pretty damning. Not only does AFRICOM utterly fail at its mission to report civilian casualties in Somalia, but it doesn’t seem to care about the fate of the numerous families it has completely torn apart,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“We’ve documented case after case in the USA’s escalating air war on Somalia, where the AFRICOM thinks it can simply smear its civilian victims as ‘terrorists,’ no questions asked. This is unconscionable; the US military must change course and pursue truth and accountability in these cases, in line with its obligations under international humanitarian law (the laws of war).” 
Two new cases in February alone 
Amnesty International unearthed evidence that AFRICOM killed two civilians, and injured three more, in two air strikes in February 2020. 
After both strikes, AFRICOM issued press releases claiming it had killed an Al-Shabaab “terrorist,” without offering a shred of evidence of the victims’ alleged links to the armed group. 
By contrast, Amnesty International found no evidence that the individuals killed or injured were members of Al-Shabaab or otherwise directly participating in hostilities. The organization interviewed the victims’ relatives, community members and colleagues; analysed satellite images, photo and video evidence from the scene of the strikes; and identified the US munitions used. 
On 2 February, at around 8pm, a family of five was sitting down to dinner in the city of Jilib, in Somalia’s Middle Juba region, when an air-dropped weapon – likely a US GBU-69/B Small Glide Munition with a 16-kilogramme warhead – struck their home. Nurto Kusow Omar Abukar, an 18-year-old woman, was struck in the head by a heavy metal fragment from the munition and killed instantly. The strike also injured her two younger sisters, Fatuma and Adey, aged 12 and seven, and their grandmother, Khadija Mohamed Gedow, aged around 70. 
The girls’ father, Kusow Omar Abukar, a 50-year-old farmer who was in the house during the strike, described the attack to Amnesty International: “I never imagined it was going to hit us. I suddenly heard a huge sound. It felt like our house had collapsed. … The sand and the smoke filled my eyes.” 
In the middle of the afternoon on 24 February 2020, a Hellfire missile from another US air strike hit the Masalanja farm near the village of Kumbareere, 10 kilometres north of Jilib, killing 53-year-old Mohamud Salad Mohamud. He was a banana farmer and Jilib office manager for Hormuud Telecom, and he left behind a wife and eight children. 
A senior Hormuud official expressed disbelief that Mohamud Salad Mohamud had been targeted, since he had previously worked for international humanitarian organizations and had been arrested several times by Al-Shabaab: “When I heard the news of his death, I thought he was killed by Al-Shabaab. I have never imagined he would be killed by [the] US or by the Somali government. This was very strange. I don’t know how to explain it.” 
These two air strikes were among a string of 20 retaliatory attacks US forces carried out in Somalia after an Al-Shabaab assault on a US airbase in Manda Bay, Kenya, in early January. AFRICOM’s commander, US General Stephen Townsend, vowed to “relentlessly pursue those responsible” for the attack, which killed a US soldier and two contractors, and destroyed five aircraft, including two rare and valuable spy planes. 
“Nothing can excuse flouting the laws of war. Any US or Somalia government response to Al-Shabaab attacks must distinguish between fighters and civilians and take all feasible precautions to avoid harm to civilians,” said Abdullahi Hassan, Amnesty International’s Somalia Researcher. 
No reparation for family in El Buur 
The recently bereaved civilian families in Middle Juba region join many more Somali civilians who have lost loved ones to US air strikes but have seen no accountability or reparation to date. 
In one key example, on 1 April 2018, a US air strike hit a vehicle driving from El Buur, north of Mogadishu. 
Just over a year later, AFRICOM publicly admitted that the strike had killed a woman and young child. It was its sole admission of civilian casualties in an air war in Somalia that has lasted over a decade. Despite the family of the victims of this strike contacting the US Embassy in Mogadishu in April last year, at the time of writing, neither the Embassy nor AFRICOM had reached out to them to offer reparation. 
US ramps up air strikes 
In the first three months of 2020 alone, US forces have conducted a total of 31 air strikes in Somalia, according to the monitoring group Airwars. This is double the pace of 2019, when AFRICOM conducted a record 63 strikes in the country. 
Since Amnesty International’s ground-breaking March 2019 report The Hidden US War in Somalia, the organization has carried out in-depth investigations into eight US air strikes that killed civilians in Somalia’s Lower Shabelle and Middle Juba regions. Along with the El Buur strike, they killed a total of 21 civilians and wounded 11. In every case AFRICOM has failed to contact the families of the deceased. 
“The US military should not be allowed to continue to paint its civilian victims as ‘terrorists’ while leaving grieving families in the lurch. Much more must be done to reveal the truth and bring justice and accountability for US attacks which killed so many Somali civilians, some of which amount to apparent violations of international humanitarian law,” said Abdullahi Hassan.

Prisoners and detainees, including tens of thousands of people arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared, are at risk of contracting the disease as they are held in unhygienic conditions in locations across the country operated by the country’s security forces. 
“In Syrian prisons and detention centres, COVID-19 could spread quickly due to poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water and severe overcrowding”, said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“This government has a long record of denying prisoners and detainees the medical care and medicines that they urgently need. Anyone detained must have access to prevention and treatment services as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens lives. 
“All prisoners of conscience – political activists, human rights defenders, and others imprisoned solely for peacefully exercising their rights – must be immediately and unconditionally released. The early or conditional release of prisoners at high risk, such as older prisoners or those with serious medical conditions, should also be considered.” 
As of 30 March, the Syrian Ministry of Health had acknowledged a total of 10 cases of COVID-19 in the country, and one death. 
Background  
Since the start of the crisis in Syria in 2011, anyone perceived to oppose the Syrian government is at risk of being arbitrarily detained or forcibly disappeared and subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, in many cases leading to death in custody. According to the UN in 2019, an estimated 100,000 people are currently detained, abducted or missing in Syria. 
Amnesty International has documented the arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance of scores of people targeted for their peaceful activism. Others were detained by security forces because they are relatives of wanted people who fled the country, or after being reported by informers on false accusations. 
Amnesty International has extensively documented inhumane conditions in military prisons in Syria, including Saydnaya, and other detention centres. These conditions include severe overcrowding in cells; lack of access to medicine and medical treatment; and lack of inadequate access to sanitation, food and water. Former detainees have also told Amnesty International that they were held in cells with bodies of deceased detainees for several days. Others said that they were subjected to torture and ill-treatment. 
Amnesty International found that the Syrian government’s systematic use of torture and the mass deaths of detainees in custody across detention facilities in Syria amounted to crimes against humanity.

“Today we have cause to celebrate as thousands of pregnant girls across Sierra Leone will be allowed back into classes nationwide when schools reopen after COVID-19. 
 
“This inherently discriminatory ban which was formalized for almost five years now has already deprived too many young women of their right to education, and the choice as to what future they want for themselves. It has now rightly been consigned to the history books. 
“Indeed, pregnant girls are given back their dignity and we welcome the government announcement to overturn with immediate effect the ban on them attending school. It’s a victory for all those who campaigned tirelessly to make such a great change happen. 
“We now hope that authorities in Sierra Leone will develop strategies to address the negative societal attitudes and stigmatization that pregnant girls have been facing for years.  This decision gives also hope to other pregnant girls in Africa who have been stigmatized, discriminated against and, in some countries, also banned from school.” 
Background 
Today, Sierra Leone’s Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education issued a statement announcing that the 2010 government decision preventing pregnant girls from attending school and sitting exams was overturned with immediate effect. It is to be replaced by two new policies focused on the ‘Radical Inclusion’ and ‘Comprehensive Safety’ of all children in the education system. President Julius Maada Bio made it clear that his ‘New Direction’ Government makes decisions based on both evidence and constitutional due process. 
On 12 December 2019 the regional Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) Community Court of Justice ruled that the ban should be revoked. The case challenging the ban was brought by Sierra Leonean NGO (WAVES) in partnership with Equality Now and the Institute for Human Rights and Development in Africa (IHRDA). Amnesty International intervened as an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”). 
The organization has previously documented how the ban put the rights of thousands of girls under threat. The ban was formally issued in April 2015 during the Ebola crisis. Due to Ebola, there was a sharp increase in teenage pregnancies and government should put measures in place to ensure this doesn’t happen in this time of COVID-19.

The pain of the COVID-19 pandemic, a defining event of our times, will continue long after the virus subsides. When the immediate crisis is over many will have experienced unimaginable loss. 
Many will have lost loved ones, huge numbers will have lost jobs and perhaps homes, and hundreds of millions will have experienced the anxiety and loneliness of social isolation. 
But we will have gained something too –  a choice. 
When we emerge from this collective trauma we can choose to go back to our old trajectory. Or, we can learn from this experience and make different choices for the future. 
Every person on the planet has a stake in fighting this virus. As Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), put it, “we have an unprecedented opportunity to come together as one against a common enemy: an enemy against humanity”. 
Although the pandemic has brought out some ugly xenophobic scapegoating, it has also been marked by millions of small acts of kindness which have brought communities closer together. If we choose to reject racism and hatred, the heartwarming solidarity we have seen in recent weeks can be translated into action on a grand scale. 
We can go beyond supporting our neighbours and make a collective decision to provide safety for people who are homeless or displaced. This crisis has opened many people’s eyes to the fragility of others’ circumstances, exposing the inequalities which have left so many in urgent need of shelter and healthcare. We can and should continue to protect these people after the pandemic is contained. 
We can say no to more austerity measures like the ones which have been imposed in many countries over the last decade, often hitting the most marginalized people hardest. Governments responding to the profound economic and social consequences of the pandemic will need to do things differently. 
We can choose to get far more serious about the climate. Emissions have fallen dramatically in some parts of the world, as flights are grounded and cars disappear from the streets. The human cost has been unconscionably high; but when this is over, will we simply turn the engines on again? Or will we resolve to fight for a more sustainable future, brought about through a just transition from fossil fuels? We are seeing a new precedent for dramatic government action and fiscal interventions on a massive scale to safeguard life, health, and economies in the face of a huge threat. Can this guide us in our response to the still deeper existential threat ahead of us? 
We must seize the chance to strengthen healthcare systems and reclaim the idea of health for all – backed by adequate resources. This crisis is already laying bare the fragility of health systems around the world, including those which mostly rely on individuals’ ability to access and afford care. This pandemic has shown that the individual is only protected when the whole is protected. 
We can choose to rethink social security fit for a new era. COVID-19 hits the most economically precarious hardest, unleashing the harshest consequences of inequality. People who make a living in the informal economy lack any kind of safety net, even though they provide vital services to society; the same goes for women who carry out the majority of unpaid domestic work around the world. 
Many “gig” workers simply cannot afford to socially distance themselves; yet people such as delivery drivers are critical enablers of other people’s social distancing. Will we gain a new appreciation for the importance of all these forms of work? Will the pandemic provide the impetus for more inclusive protection? 
We can demand that a line be drawn on surveillance and the use of technology for social control. China widely used surveillance technology in its efforts to track and curb the spread of COVID-19, a seemingly beguiling model which is turning heads in many countries. But once in place, powerful technologies like this are not so easily put aside. Can we push back against the Faustian bargain of sophisticated surveillance as the price we are told we must pay for our health? 
Finally, we can choose to rebuild trust. Many politicians have benefited handsomely in recent years from attacking technical expertise and undermining evidence and science. They have tried to silence truth with cries of “fake news” and attacked journalists relentlessly. But now that our lives depend so obviously on science and access to reliable and accurate information, can public trust in evidence be restored? 
These choices are ours to make – and let’s be sure we make the right ones. It’s the best way of honouring all those who have suffered throughout this pandemic.

From moral, public health and legal perspectives, closing the border to refugee claimants is wrong. 
On March 19, 2020, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of Canada announced new border entry restrictions that preserved the right to seek refugee protection while also protecting public health through non-discriminatory screening and self-isolation measures. Then, on March 20, the government abandoned this sensible and humane approach, and announced a new decision made with the US government to shut the border almost entirely to people seeking refugee protection in Canada when entering from the US. 
Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Amnesty International Canada call on the Government of Canada to immediately reverse this unnecessary, inhumane and harmful decision, and to respect Canada’s obligations under international law. 
Banning Refugee Claimants Puts People in Danger 
A refugee claimant’s right to be protected from forced return is the cornerstone of international refugee legal protection. Returning people to the US who are seeking protection risks endangering their lives by putting them in precarious limbo. We know from medical and human rights experience that when a person seeking refugee protection is refused at the border, they are put in highly vulnerable situations and tend to turn to riskier underground methods. 
While international refugee and human rights law affirms that states may put in place measures which can include health screening or testing of persons seeking international protection upon entry and/or putting them in quarantine, such measures may not result in denying them an effective opportunity to seek refugee protection or result in refoulement. 
Banning Refugee Claimants is Poor Public Health Practice 
The Canadian government’s March 20 Order in Council imposes certain measures to avoid the “introduction” of COVID-19. Accepting refugee claimants and testing them for COVID-19 is a proactive and protective public health measure. Refugee claimants can and should receive the same health screening, testing referral and mandate to self-isolate as all others entering Canada. The government can provide accessible health information (in multiple languages) about best-known public health practices to limit the spread of COVID-19 to protect individuals and the public (e.g. physical distancing, diagnostic tests, case identification and tracing, mobilization of the public to prevent onward transmission). It can also coordinate and communicate with local groups to ensure that housing and transportation is provided for refugee claimants as needed, avoiding use of detention and holding people in enclosed or densely populated spaces. 
Refugee claimants must be actively included in, not excluded from, outbreak prevention and public health response plans. Public health measures only work by protecting everyone and fail when some populations are not included — whether they are citizens, refugee claimants or undocumented persons. 
Banning Refugee Claimants is Illegal 
Canadian government measures relating to the COVID-19 pandemic must respect human rights standards and obligations under Canadian law, as well as treaties to protect refugee claimants, allowing anyone who enters Canada, whether or not at an official port of entry, to apply for refugee protection. 
This new “reciprocal arrangement with the US government” to ban and return refugee claimants arriving from the US violates Canada’s legal obligations to protect refugee protection claimants. Under the 1951 Refugee Convention, people fearing persecution have a right to seek protection in another country and to have that claim adjudicated. Legal guidance listed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on protections in the COVID-19 pandemic makes clear that states may not put in place measures that categorically deny people seeking protection an effective opportunity to do so. 
In summary, Canada’s ill-conceived decision to close the border as a COVID-19 public health measure will endanger people, runs counter to best practice for outbreak control, and flouts the international legal norms that Canada consistently claims to defend. Canada has an opportunity to exemplify the international standard it wants to set by protecting the public’s health and upholding international law.

“Instead of addressing the overcrowding crisis in detention centres, Cambodian authorities have used the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to further harass and detain government critics,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director. “Meanwhile, Cambodian prisons and drug detention centres are dangerously overcrowded and lack even the most basic health services. They are a ticking time bomb for the country and potentially its neighbours.” 
At least seven people have been charged and sent to pre-trial detention amid a crackdown on allegedly “false” information related to COVID-19, six of whom are activists or members of the banned opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP).  In total, at least 22 people have been arrested in relation to sharing information about Covid-19 since January, with the majority released without charge after signing pledges to refrain from spreading false information online. 
On Wednesday, 25 March, Prime Minister Hun Sen stated that he was considering invoking Article 22 of the Constitution in order to declare a state of emergency and warned that human rights could be further restricted as a result. 
On 5 March, Ouk Kimseng, spokesperson for the Information Ministry reportedly stated that “ill-intentioned people are spreading fear among people, causing scares among citizens. Prime Minister Hun Sen considers them as terrorists, these people are problematic to our society… We are working with Facebook and tracking individuals or groups to take action against them.” 
“The Cambodian government appear more focused on using this pandemic to silence its critics rather than protecting its people and their right to adequate health care. The Cambodian authorities must cease their harassment of critics and address the urgent health needs of all people in Cambodia,” said Nicholas Bequelin. 
Overcrowded detention centres a “ticking time bomb” 
According to government data, Cambodia’s prisons held 37,000 people at the end of 2019 despite having an estimated capacity of just 26,593. As of January 2020, Cambodia’s largest prison – Prey Sar, in Phnom Penh, the capital – held over 10,000 prisoners, making it approximately 500% over capacity. 
Up to 40% of all prisoners are in pre-trial detention and thousands are held for minor, non-violent offences such as use or possession of drugs. The national prison population has skyrocketed by approximately 70% since December 2016 as a result of the government’s punitive and abusive anti-drugs campaign. 
Sreyneang*, a woman who was released from the CC2 women’s and minors’ facility in Prey Sar in November 2019, told Amnesty International: “The sleeping space for me and my one-year old son was only about 30- or 40-centimetres width across, it was so tight. If I slept on my side, my son could sleep on the floor. If I slept on my back, he had to sleep on top of me.” 
“The inhumane conditions in Cambodian jails and other detention centres make it impossible for detainees and staff to take preventive steps, including physical distancing and isolation,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “These conditions were never acceptable, and now they risk lighting a fuse for what could quickly become dramatic and exponential levels of community transmission of COVID-19.” 
Thousands more are currently held against their will in so-called drug “rehabilitation” centres and “social affairs” centres spread across Cambodia. Compulsory drug detention, where people suspected of using drugs are sent with the aim of making them stop using drugs, is inherently arbitrary. While the total population in Cambodia’s drug detention centres is not publicized, information received by Amnesty International suggests that overcrowding inside these centres is as severe as in prisons. 
Maly*, a sex worker who was detained for five months at Orkas Khnom, a drug detention centre in Phnom Penh, after she was arrested in a street sweep in 2019 told Amnesty International of the severe overcrowding she experienced: “Sixty people were in my small room and it was so tight that we could not even move or lie down flat when we were sleeping. We had to press against each other on our sides.” 
“Cambodia’s squalid drug detention centres are rife with human rights violations, and the current COVID-19 crisis will only exacerbate the dangers for people held there. Compulsory drug detention centres must be closed permanently without delay, and those detained must be immediately released with sufficient provisions of health and social services available to them,” said Nicholas Bequelin. “ 
“These people, often with weak immune systems and pre-existing medical conditions, need urgent protection. The current crisis offers the Cambodian authorities an opportunity to ensure that drug treatment services are truly voluntary and rooted in communities.” 
Background 
Both in prisons and other detention centres, overcrowding, inadequate nutrition, and poor sanitation mean that thousands of detainees in Cambodia suffer from health problems, putting them at particular risk amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Every year, thousands of people suspected of using drugs, homeless people, sex workers, and people with mental illnesses are arrested in drug raids and city beautification sweeps and are detained in “social affairs” and “drug rehabilitation” centres around Cambodia. These detention centres have faced sustained criticism over the years, including allegations of torture, forced labour, sexual violence, and other forms of ill-treatment. 
On 25 March, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, warned governments of the “catastrophic” consequences for both detainees and wider communities of failing to address prison overcrowding and poor detention conditions in the context of COVID-19. She called on governments to “release every person detained without sufficient legal basis” and to “release those particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, among them older detainees and those who are sick, as well as low-risk offenders”. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments across the world, including Ethiopia, Bahrain, and Iran have taken decisive action to ease overcrowding in places of detention by releasing people held on politically-motivated grounds, on minor and non-violent charges, pre-trial detainees, and people with underlying health conditions. 
Amnesty International is urging governments to review the need for continued custodial detention in order to safeguard the health of people in detention, prison staff, and the general population. Governments should consider if prisoners qualify for parole, early or conditional release, or other alternative non-custodial measures. They must fully take into account individual circumstances and the risks posed to specific groups of prisoners, such as older people or those with serious medical conditions, including those with a weakened immune system. 
Given that the spread of transmissible diseases is a public health concern, especially in the prison environment, it is desirable that, with their consent, all detainees can have access to free COVID-19 screening tests, including those who are scheduled for early release. For those who remain in detention or prison, the authorities must provide a standard of healthcare that meets each person’s individual needs and ensures the maximum possible protection against the spread of COVID-19.

“Colombia is one of the world’s most lethal countries for human rights defenders and social leaders and, in the context of COVID-19, they now face even greater risks. Due to the restrictions imposed to contain the pandemic, state protection measures have been weakened, they can no longer keep moving from one location to another for their safety, and their attackers know that public security forces are focusing on issues related to the pandemic,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“The Colombian authorities cannot let human rights defenders suffer attacks and threats. The state must maintain its protection schemes and must generate collective protection strategies for communities at risk, while implementing preventive measures to contain COVID-19.” 
Amnesty International has received information that the protective measures offered by the National Protection Unit to at least two defenders have been reduced in recent days. In one case, due to a reduction on the number of his bodyguards, the defender has been forced into hiding for fear of being attacked by armed groups who have threatened him because of his human rights work. Another defender no longer benefits from nightly patrols, which could expose him to attacks. 
On 24 March, Amnesty International issued a series of recommendations to states in the Americas to ensure that their responses to COVID-19 are in line with their international human rights obligations. UN experts have also told states that measures taken in the context of the pandemic should not result in the silencing of human rights defenders.  
In the past week, at least six social leaders and human rights defenders had been killed in Colombia. On 19 March, Ivo Humberto Bracamonte Quiroz, a councillor from Puerto Santander and director of the online news program NPS, was killed while exercising in Puerto Santander’s Beltranía neighbourhood. 
On the same day, three armed men killed Marco Rivadeneira, a leader of Putumayo’s campesino (peasant farmer) communities and member of the Mesa Nacional de Garantías, after dragging him of a campesino meeting in Puerto Asís’s Nueva Granada neighborhood. 
Angel Ovidio Quintero Gonzalez, a social leader and president of the council in San Francisco in the department of Antioquia, was also killed that day. The San Francisco mayor reported that Quintero was the victim of a shooting and, although he managed to escape from it, his body was found in a river hours later. 
On 24 March, the Regional Indigenous Organization of Valle del Cauca (ORIVAC) reported that two Embera indigenous leaders, Omar and Ernesto Guasiruma, were killed in a rural area of the municipality of Bolivar while complying with the government quarantine at their home. ORIVAC also reported that two members of the same family were injured in the attack. 
Carlota Isabel Salinas Péres, a leader of the NGO Organización Femenina Popular, was also killed on 24 March in the municipality of San Pablo in the department of Bolivar. At around 8pm, armed men arrived at her home in the Guarigua neighbourhood and shot her dead. Her partner is still missing today.

“In light of the COVID-19 crisis, UK authorities should urgently consider releasing some people who are currently in detention or prison, especially those who are more at risk from the virus. Julian’s Assange’s claim of being vulnerable to COVID-19 must be rigorously examined.
“Those with underlying medical conditions and the elderly should be immediately considered for alternatives to detention if they do not pose a threat to themselves or society, and there should be a presumption of release for people charged with a crime and awaiting trial.
“The government should also consider amending sentencing guidelines to recommend non-custodial measures for people who have been convicted of lesser criminal offences.
“Decreasing the prison population and the number of people in detention centres is a crucial means of slowing the spread of COVID-19 and keeping people safe. If Julian Assange is shown to have an underlying condition that puts him at risk, he should be immediately released on bail, as should any detainees and prisoners at such risk who does not pose a risk to society.
“For those who remain in detention or prison the UK must provide a standard of healthcare that meets each person’s individual needs and ensures the maximum possible protection against the spread of COVID-19.”

Background
The general provision of health care for prisoners is a state responsibility. Prisoners should enjoy the same standards of health care that are available in the community, including when it comes to testing, prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
Conditions in UK prisons and detention centres are substandard. It is imperative that health and safety protocols are put in place to effectively ward off harm while ensuring that prisoners’ and detainees’ rights are protected.

“The response to this pandemic must be based on cooperation and sharing of resources, because national strategies will not be enough on their own. Not only is helping the most marginalized the right thing to do, inadequate healthcare in any part of the world is a risk to us all. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has shown how connected we all are,” said Netsanet Belay, Research and Advocacy Director at Amnesty International.
“On Thursday G20 leaders need to produce a concrete and coordinated plan for mobilizing resources to help people in the global south. They have a lot of financial measures at their disposal and they must consider them all. We will beat this virus together, for everyone, or not at all.”
Background
Amnesty International is calling for the G20 to adopt concrete and measurable policies and plans in order to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic at home and abroad, protect people’s health, and reduce its economic impacts.
Such measures must guarantee access for all to preventive care and good quality and affordable treatment, including those most at risk or less able to implement preventive measures through poverty, homelessness, or living and working in environments where they are more exposed to the virus. Transparency in decision-making is essential, requiring access to information, media freedom, and open civic space

0,Yemen: Illegal detention remains rife after five years of war,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/health-and-human-rights/yemen-illegal-detention-remains-rife-after-five-years-of-war/,"Unlawful detention during the ongoing conflict in Yemen – ranging from politically-motivated death sentences, to forcibly disappearing and torturing detainees in ‘black sites’ – remain rife ahead of the fifth anniversary (Wednesday 25 March) of the war, Amnesty International has...","Unlawful detention during the ongoing conflict in Yemen – ranging from politically-motivated death sentences, to forcibly disappearing and torturing detainees in ‘black sites’ – remain rife ahead of the fifth anniversary (Wednesday 25 March) of the war, Amnesty International has said.
Since the current conflict erupted in March 2015, scores of people – including journalists, academics and members of the Baha’i faith – have been disappeared and detained, primarily because of their human rights activism, political affiliation or their conscientiously-held beliefs.
“The last five years of relentless conflict have been a breeding ground for serious violations against detainees on both sides – in some cases amounting to war crimes,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director.
“Huthi forces have detained dozens of people – including those of the Baha’i faith – on trumped-up charges and many have been sentenced to death. It is absolutely abhorrent that so many members of the Baha’i community remain at risk of execution for their conscientiously-held beliefs and peaceful activities.
“We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience in Yemen, and for truth and justice in the many cases of enforced disappearance and torture linked to unlawful detention.”
In the past year alone, the Huthis and their allied forces have stepped up their use of an anti-terrorism court as a way to settle political scores, often handing down death sentences on spurious accusations of espionage and “aiding an enemy country” following grossly unfair trials. Meanwhile, UAE forces and their allies in southern Yemen have been running a network of secret detention sites where they forcibly disappeared and tortured dozens of individuals, in what amount to war crimes.
To mark the anniversary, Amnesty International will launch a year-long campaign focusing on arbitrary detentions, specifically on cases that constitute violations of freedom of expression, association and religion.
Last month, representatives of the parties to the conflict agreed to what would be the largest UN-sponsored prisoner exchange.
Huthi targeting of religious minorities and others
In a new public statement, Amnesty International has documented the cases of 66 individuals whose proceedings are all ongoing, bar one. All were brought before the Sana’a-based Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) – a court traditionally reserved for terrorism-related cases – in the last five years. Journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents and members of religious minorities are among those subjected to unfair trial on spurious or trumped-up charges by this court. All of the individuals are being tried on charges of spying, which are mandatorily punishable by death under Yemeni law.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; the guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the offender; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment.
Civilian suffering
Since 2015, all parties to the conflict in Yemen committed repeated and serious violations of international humanitarian law.
Huthi forces, which control large parts of the country, have indiscriminately shelled residential neighbourhoods and launched missiles indiscriminately into Saudi Arabia. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which support the internationally-recognized Yemeni government, continue to bomb civilian infrastructure and carry out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring hundreds of civilians. All parties have also suppressed freedom of expression through arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment in custody.
Civilians are trapped in the middle of the conflict, and bear the brunt of the violence. To date, more than 233,000 people have been killed and injured. The spiralling humanitarian crisis has left approximately 14 million people on the brink of famine. The situation has been exacerbated by years of poor governance, resulting in poverty and causing immense suffering.
Inevitably, given the prolonged nature of the conflict and the use of unlawful tactics by all parties, coping mechanisms for the civilian population are at breaking point. An estimated 22 million Yemenis currently require humanitarian assistance to survive.

“The Trump administration’s ban on asylum-seekers coming from Mexico has nothing to do with making Americans safer from the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump is engaging in fear-mongering to justify racist and discriminatory policies whose only purpose is to demonize people seeking safety. Closing the southern border is a reactionary measure that has virtually no basis in fact.”
“The Trump administration cannot suddenly suspend U.S. obligations to people seeking safety. A blanket ban on asylum-seekers goes against the U.S. government’s domestic and international legal obligations, plain and simple. A similar 2018 ban was swiftly declared unlawful by every court to have considered it as an egregious violation of the right to seek asylum.”
“The Trump administration has already sent tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to harm’s way in Mexico, forcing them to survive in dangerous and precarious conditions and exposing them to appalling risks of kidnapping, torture, and other abuses. Instead of doubling down on these failed tactics, the Trump administration should reverse these cruel and punitive policies and allow people to seek safety following the process required by U.S. and international law.”
Background:
Yesterday, Amnesty International USA, along with Human Rights First and Physicians for Human Rights, sent letters to governors and state health officials in 13 states asking that they pressure the federal government to release immigration detainees being held in their states and urged the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security to release asylum-seekers and immigrants currently held in inadequate conditions in immigration detention facilities. During a public health crisis, the government must act to protect the health of all people and ensure access to care and safety, not indiscriminately turn them away at borders or keep them locked up in unsanitary and crowded conditions with substandard medical care.

“History has shown that, in times of crisis, governments often do not assess and redress human rights violations until after the fact,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada’s English branch. “By taking proactive steps now, to put strong oversight in place, governments have an important opportunity to deliberately ensure that human rights concerns will be anticipated, identified and minimized from the outset.” 
Amnesty International recommends that Human Rights Oversight Committees be made up of a wide range of experts and reflective of communities facing the greatest vulnerability to human rights violations. That could include representatives from federal, provincial and territorial human rights commissions, Indigenous peoples’ organizations, civil society and academics. The Committees would be tasked with providing prompt and immediate advice to governments across the country with respect to the human rights impact of decisions being taken as well as recommendations regarding areas of COVID-19-related human rights concerns where action is needed. The Committees would regularly report publicly. 
The recommendation is among 10 guiding human rights principles that Amnesty International is calling on all governments across Canada – at federal, provincial, territorial and municipal level – to integrate into their responses to the COVID-19 outbreak. 
The guiding framework includes calls to treat and respond to COVID-19 as a human rights obligation, while strictly limiting any measures that infringe on other human rights. Further, governments should recognize that the virus itself, as well as restrictions adopted to contain its transmission, may cause particular harm to communities that already disproportionately experience human rights abuses. That includes Indigenous communities, people experiencing intimate partner and family violence, women forced out of the labour force to fulfill caregiving responsibilities, people living in situations of inadequate housing, workers who are precariously employed, people living with disabilities, refugee claimants and individuals held in prisons and immigration detention centres. It is also vital that all aspects of the response to COVID-19 be subject to an intersectional Gender-based Plus Analysis. 
Please see the attached for the full human rights framework. 
“Governments across the country are responding to the unprecedented novel coronavirus crisis with extensive public health campaigns, restrictions on freedom of movement and social interaction, and massive amounts of economic stimulus,” said France-Isabelle Langlois, Director of Amnesty International Canada’s francophone branch. “Many of those measures are fully in line with human rights standards. However, most do not adopt an explicit human rights approach and some breach important human rights obligations. 
“The bottom line is simple: human rights must be at the heart of Canada’s response to COVID-19.”

“In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic that confronts us, there are growing concerns about the precarious situation of people deprived of their liberty across the Americas. In Colombia, overcrowded prisons make it impossible to isolate people who may have contracted the virus. In addition, limited access to health services and hygiene products, and the lack of constant water supplies, increase the risks of exposure to infection and affect recovery conditions.” 
“We must leave no one behind in the face of this pandemic. The Colombian government must immediately implement a strategy for the prevention of infection among the prison population, including a strategy to reduce overcrowding. To this end, it should consider the release of people in provisional detention and the early or conditional release of prisoners at risk. Likewise, the authorities must carry out a thorough, impartial and independent investigation into the use of force during the control of the protest and the reasons that left multiple people dead and injured in order to guarantee access to truth, justice and reparation for the victims and their families.” 
According to a report by the Ombudsman’s Office, Colombian prisons are more than 50% overcrowded. A total of 121,670 people are being held in Colombia’s 134 prisons, when they only have a capacity of 80,763. In light of this, the National Prison Movement (Movimiento Nacional Carcelario) warned that an outbreak of coronavirus within the prisons would be very dangerous, since they do not have sufficient facilities or tools to ensure hygiene and other appropriate prevention measures for everyone there. 
States have an obligation to guarantee the right to health of all people deprived of their liberty, and to ensure that they have access to the same standards of health care as those available in wider society. The Colombian government must take all appropriate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within detention facilities, and in the event of its spread, ensure that people deprived of their liberty can access specialized medical care without complications. In addition, it should allocate specific funds and resources exclusively to guarantee the implementation of health and hygiene measures within detention centres. 
To reduce prison overcrowding, the authorities should consider granting the release of people in pre-trial detention and early or conditional release of prisoners at risk in the event of contagion, including older people and those suffering from underlying medical conditions or with weak immune systems.

The paper, which sets out four things governments should do and four things they should not, affirms that states must not discriminate; leave high-risk groups behind; use repression or excessive force in enforcement of public health measures; or censor or limit access to evidence-based information or prevention. States must also guarantee workers’ rights and social security; guarantee access to adequate water, sanitation and health care for all; ensure a gender-focused response to the pandemic; and protect people’s right to privacy. 
“The spread of COVID-19 in the Americas brings a grave and unprecedented challenge to a region already ravaged by widespread violence, corruption, environmental destruction and economic inequality, in which millions of people continue to flee their homes in search of safety. Governments will forever be remembered by how they respond to this situation. History will not judge kindly those that use the pandemic as a pretext for discrimination, repression or censorship,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International. 
“With President Trump labelling this a ‘Chinese virus’, while political representatives in Brazil have also blamed China for the outbreak, we’ve seen leaders in the Americas dangerously fueling racism and discrimination through their public responses. Instead of exacerbating this crisis, governments in the Americas must put human rights at the forefront of any measures they take, ensure that no one is left behind, and be careful to protect the groups most at risk, including refugees, displaced people and those living in camps, people living in poverty, women, informal workers with limited protections, detainees and groups at risk of serious complications from exposure to the virus.” 
At this early stage of the pandemic in the Americas, Amnesty International has already noted human rights being pushed to the side as governments respond to COVID-19. 
Aside from using discriminatory language, the Trump administration has also mostly closed the United States’ borders with Mexico and Canada, signaling its intent to turn its back on refugees and asylum seekers in need of international protection. Similarly, Justin Trudeau’s government has turned its back on asylum seekers attempting to enter Canada by crossing the border with the United States. 
In Venezuela, authorities under Nicolás Maduro’s government have arbitrarily detained at least two public health workers for denouncing the lack of resources to manage the effects of the pandemic. 
Meanwhile, in Honduras, the Juan Orlando Hernández administration has revoked a wide range of constitutional rights, including to free expression and due process, under the state of emergency it declared on 16 March.

Since the current conflict erupted in March 2015, scores of people – including journalists, academics and members of the Baha’i faith – have been disappeared and detained, primarily because of their human rights activism, political affiliation or their conscientiously-held beliefs. 
“The last five years of relentless conflict have been a breeding ground for serious violations against detainees on both sides – in some cases amounting to war crimes,” said Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Research Director. 
“Huthi forces have detained dozens of people – including those of the Baha’i faith – on trumped-up charges and many have been sentenced to death. It is absolutely abhorrent that so many members of the Baha’i community remain at risk of execution for their conscientiously-held beliefs and peaceful activities. 
“We call for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience in Yemen, and for truth and justice in the many cases of enforced disappearance and torture linked to unlawful detention.” 
In the past year alone, the Huthis and their allied forces have stepped up their use of an anti-terrorism court as a way to settle political scores, often handing down death sentences on spurious accusations of espionage and “aiding an enemy country” following grossly unfair trials. Meanwhile, UAE forces and their allies in southern Yemen have been running a network of secret detention sites where they forcibly disappeared and tortured dozens of individuals, in what amount to war crimes. 
To mark the anniversary, Amnesty International will launch a year-long campaign focusing on arbitrary detentions, specifically on cases that constitute violations of freedom of expression, association and religion. 
Last month, representatives of the parties to the conflict agreed to what would be the largest UN-sponsored prisoner exchange. 
Huthi targeting of religious minorities and others 
In a new public statement, Amnesty International has documented the cases of 66 individuals whose proceedings are all ongoing, bar one. All were brought before the Sana’a-based Specialized Criminal Court (SCC) – a court traditionally reserved for terrorism-related cases – in the last five years. Journalists, human rights defenders, political opponents and members of religious minorities are among those subjected to unfair trial on spurious or trumped-up charges by this court. All of the individuals are being tried on charges of spying, which are mandatorily punishable by death under Yemeni law. 
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; the guilt, innocence or other characteristics of the offender; or the method used by the state to carry out the execution. The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment. 
Civilian suffering 
Since 2015, all parties to the conflict in Yemen committed repeated and serious violations of international humanitarian law. 
Huthi forces, which control large parts of the country, have indiscriminately shelled residential neighbourhoods and launched missiles indiscriminately into Saudi Arabia. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which support the internationally-recognized Yemeni government, continue to bomb civilian infrastructure and carry out indiscriminate attacks, killing and injuring hundreds of civilians. All parties have also suppressed freedom of expression through arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance and torture and other ill-treatment in custody. 
Civilians are trapped in the middle of the conflict, and bear the brunt of the violence. To date, more than 233,000 people have been killed and injured. The spiralling humanitarian crisis has left approximately 14 million people on the brink of famine. The situation has been exacerbated by years of poor governance, resulting in poverty and causing immense suffering. 
Inevitably, given the prolonged nature of the conflict and the use of unlawful tactics by all parties, coping mechanisms for the civilian population are at breaking point. An estimated 22 million Yemenis currently require humanitarian assistance to survive.

“This is beyond disappointing and disgraceful,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “Today’s news only serves to further inflame misconceptions and racism rather than offering reassurance and leadership. When it comes to refugees, Canada is stepping back at a time when we need to step forward.”  
Yesterday, the Canadian government announced it would allow refugee claimants to cross the border and spend 14 days in isolation, a move welcomed by Amnesty International and other organizations as a means of both preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic and protecting refugees. But in an unexpected and shocking reversal, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced today that individuals crossing the border irregularly, including refugee claimants, will not be allowed into Canada and will be returned to the United States instead.  
“Over the past week, we have seen many restrictive government measures to stem the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may be appropriate to uphold the basic rights to life and health, but this move does not meet that test,” said Neve. “With this 24-hour policy about-face, the Canadian government is now violating our important international obligations to refugees, at a time when concern about their vulnerability to COVID-19 mounts worldwide. Canada is better than this.”  
Background:  
The United States has similarly closed its northern and southern borders. Amnesty International has decried the decision to close the US/Mexico border to refugees, highlighting that it will only deepen a grave human rights crisis.

This article originally appeared in The Toronto Star., March 19, 2020.  
Amidst the uncertainty and fear that has taken hold globally as the scope and impact of the COVID-19 virus continues to evolve, we cannot lose sight that human rights principles are essential to all aspects of this crisis. 
And already people everywhere are responding in ways that resonate with the universal human rights vision, through compassion, community and putting others first. 
As many of us hunker down in the safety of our homes, health care, transportation, grocery store, sanitation and other workers head out to ensure that we are supported. 
More broadly, people are looking out for friends and neighbours, and are refraining from actions that may put others at risk or impede efforts to contain the pandemic. That starts with the simple act of staying home and getting out of the way of the virus. 
It might be tempting to assume that human rights advocates are preparing to decry that restrictive measures being adopted by governments in Canada and around the world are impermissible, but it’s not so simple. 
The necessity for governments to curtail the spread of COVID-19 is itself a crucial human rights responsibility, including upholding the rights to health and to life. Government failure to act decisively would be a grave human rights concern. 
Clearly, many of the measures being adopted infringe, often onerously, a range of crucial human rights. That includes the rights to education and a livelihood, and to freedom of movement, association and assembly. Rights are being violated by school closures, border closings and travel bans, shutting down restaurants and other businesses, and limitations on gatherings of specified numbers of people. 
International human rights treaties recognize that governments may need to limit those rights for exceptional reasons, including public health. Those restrictions are not necessarily contrary to upholding human rights. They are part of the human rights package, if done right. 
There are, nonetheless, vital human rights imperatives that apply. 
First, the power of governments to encroach upon human rights in a time of emergency is no carte blanche. Restrictions must be necessary, proportionate, legitimate, time-limited and no broader than strictly needed. Very importantly, limits cannot be discriminatory. And certain rights, such as the right to life, the ban on torture and the freedom of religion can never be abridged. Through public transparency, media coverage and political debate we must all be vigilant that restrictions meet those requirements. 
Second, care must be taken to respond to heightened vulnerability faced by particular communities, be that related to the pandemic itself or restrictions that are put in place. An intersectional gender analysis is crucial. 
Measures of self-isolation and quarantine may substantially increase the risk of violence and abuse in the home for women and children. Indigenous leaders have noted how devastating a COVID-19 outbreak would be in isolated First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities. There are concerns the virus may spread rapidly in jails and immigration detention centres, whose populations are disproportionately made up of Indigenous, Black and other marginalized communities. Border bans may run afoul of international obligations with respect to refugees and migrant workers. The increased risks for people living with disabilities, precariously employed workers and homeless people are all urgently apparent. These and other urgent human rights realities require close attention. 
Third, international cooperation is essential. With nations everywhere shutting down and looking inward, it has never been as urgent to demonstrate global solidarity. We have the good fortune of living in a country with a sophisticated, publicly funded health-care system. That is not a universal reality. Sharing information, expertise and resources is vital at this time. 
Fourth, there can be no space for racism. Social media streams have been full of heartbreaking reminders of how easily this happens, including hateful comments in playgrounds and President Trump’s frequent labelling of COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” If you hear it, call it out and shut it down. 
Finally, there will be important long-term human rights work coming out of this crisis. A post-COVID-19 human rights agenda is already starting to emerge, including global health-care reform, gender equality, addressing poverty and inadequate housing, and crucial lessons with respect to the rights of Indigenous peoples, environmental sustainability and the climate crisis. 
The bottom line? Human rights are our best guide through this crisis, and must be embraced in its aftermath.

It was quickly removed, and anyone using it blocked. 
China’s move to initially cover up the crisis and restrict valuable public health information swelled online criticism of the government. The existing system of surveillance and censorship ramped up in response. But Chinese netizens fought back, substituting “sensitive words” for alternatives on a daily basis. At one point, images of pandas were used to represent the domestic security bureau, and “Ministry of Truth” (from George Orwell’s novel 1984) substituted for the Communist Party’s Propaganda Department. Journalists, students, and activists developed a rapidly expanding alternative dictionary to keep ahead of the censors. 
Censorship and surveillance in China are hardly news. Their impact during the current pandemic, however, highlights why the focus can’t simply be on expanding health services and enforcing quarantines by any means necessary. 
An obligation to act 
Governments are obligated to protect their citizens, and that does mean acting quickly to slow the spread of COVID-19. Many are turning to emergency powers to control the outbreak. 
In Canada, our news coverage and social media seems almost exclusively dedicated to COVID-19 updates, focusing notably on countries not used to experiencing “emergencies”. Many people feel they are facing something unprecedented as their sense of security – both personal and national – is threatened. For others, this is yet another challenge added to day to day insecurity. 
Crises often mean that those already in precarious situations are put at even greater risk. Think about how the public health advice you are hearing plays out in a community without access to clean water, basic sanitation or functioning medical centres – or a crowded living situation such as a prison, shelter or refugee camp. And while some among us focus on solidarity and support, others retreat and increasingly view the world as “us versus them”. 
International human rights standards clarify that states of emergency must be publicly declared, time limited, proportionate, and tied to a specific set of circumstances. It’s not an excuse for a wide-ranging, indefinite crackdown. While temporary limits can be put on a range of rights – such as the right to association by limiting the size of gatherings – some protections can never be suspended, including freedom from discrimination, arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and torture and ill-treatment. 
Genuine security means protecting everyone’s human rights 
It’s tempting but risky to talk about “balancing” rights. After the attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001 – an event increasingly referenced in light of significantly reduced international airline traffic — there was frequent debate about balancing security and human rights. But all too often that meant sacrificing the rights of some for the so-called security of others. Genuine security for everyone means putting human rights at the centre of our response. That is as true now as it was then. 
Many countries are putting measures in place to prevent people’s exposure to COVID-19 including quarantines (individual and specific areas), travel restrictions and border closures. While obviously restricting freedom of movement, depending on how they are implemented, quarantines can create new and problematic barriers to food, water, shelter, sanitation, health care, education, and the ability to work. Border closures and travel restrictions can disrupt everything from the right to seek asylum to the delivery of humanitarian aid. 
Countries engaging in censorship and surveillance as part of their “response” aren’t just harassing activists, feeding suspicion or covering up. They are endangering lives. Access to information is a fundamental part of health care. It’s crucial during a pandemic when authorities are asking people to change their behaviour in order to slow the spread of the virus. And as new information becomes available, it needs to get into the hands of the right people. Responses are most effective when stakeholders can access accurate, timely information about the nature and extent of the crisis and plan together — globally, nationally and locally. 
The guiding principle should always be to use the least restrictive measures possible, respect people’s right to dignity, and allow them as much control as possible over their lives. Excessive enforcement and monopolizing of resources not only causes disproportionate harm of those already vulnerable and marginalized, but it also undermines public trust and cooperation in the overall response to the crisis. That cooperation is needed between states as much as on an individual and community level. Governments with the means must help countries with fewer resources to prepare for and deal with any outbreaks. Production of a future vaccine and other innovative approaches must  not be turned into an exclusive enterprise. 
Pay attention to racism, gender impact and inequality 
Regardless of what triggers a state of emergency, authorities need to work to prevent stigma and discrimination. Since the start of the pandemic, people perceived to be from East Asia have been harassed, subjected to racist abuse, and attacked. Businesses have been boycotted. Social media has spread hateful words and images, and political leaders including the US President have referred to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus”. Those who contract the virus or are suspected of infection, their families, and the health workers who treat them must not become a pariah class. 
In previous health emergencies, women and girls have been particularly at risk. Women are often in care-giving roles, both in the informal sector and the health and social sector, making them at higher risk of exposure to illnesses. Gender inequality around health seeking and decision making remains a serious concern beyond the current pandemic. All response efforts should include a gender analysis to ensure that the rights of women, girls and gender non-conforming people are protected and that they receive appropriate support. 
Long term view 
As states of emergency end, the impact of the crisis often continues. Implementation of some measures may have deepened existing inequities and/or created new challenges. And some governments, of course, may have decided to take advantage of the situation and maintain a state of emergency for other repressive reasons. The pressure to “move on” may mount. 
In the long term, areas most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will need a wide range of support. International cooperation cannot wind down simply because the number of reported cases has dropped. Help will be needed to rebuild health systems and economies. Some groups and communities disproportionately affected may need special assistance. 
Hopes are growing that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis will open the door to much needed initiatives including global health care reform, gender equality, and strategies to address poverty and inadequate housing. 
We are in it together 
Those in Canada sharing internet memes about the shortage of hand sanitizer – pointing out that hoarders have forgotten that it’s only effective if we ALL can use it – are tapping into a bigger picture whether they know it or not. A pandemic reminds us how interconnected we are. Human rights give us framework for moving forward, together.

The ceasefire came into effect at 9pm on November 21 November. 
The children are playing outside again, despite the torrential rain. They were stuck indoors during eight days of relentless Israeli bombardments. 
By the time that ended in excess of 160 people were dead – including more than 30 children and scores of other unarmed civilians. 
For the duration of the onslaught they were stuck indoors – at home, seeking refuge with relatives or in schools which the UN refugee agency turned into temporary shelters for thousands of families forced from their houses by the bombings. 
Not that staying indoors was necessarily safe either. Many died or were injured in their homes or those of their neighbours when the bombs fell. 
In Gaza City I found grieving members of the al-Dalu family digging through rubble looking for the bodies of relatives killed four days earlier when an Israeli fighter jet bombed their home. 
No-one in their house survived the attack during which claimed a total of 12 lives including all the 10 members of the al-Dalu family present at the time. 
Five children, four women and the father of four of the children. 
The grief-stricken owner of the house, a soft-spoken man in his mid-50s, told me of his loss, listing the names of those he’d lost. 
“My wife, Tahani, 52, my two daughters, Ranin, 25 and Yara, 16, my son Mohamed, 29 and his 25-year-old wife Samah and their four children – a seven-year-old girl called Sara and three boys, Jamal, Yousef, and Ibrahim, aged five and four years and nine months; and my 75-year-old sister Suhaila who was in a wheelchair,” he said. 
“I left the house in the morning with my son Abdallah and went to my supermarket, as we had run out of food. My wife later called me and told me also to bring some toys for the children to take their minds off the bombing. 
“In the early afternoon I was praying before heading back home and when I finished praying I found my son in tears; he said neighbours had called saying our home had been bombed. We rushed back and found a pile of rubble where our house had been. 
“There were no survivors. I lost everything that was dearest to me. Why? Were my wife, my children and my grandchildren and my paralyzed sister terrorists? Did they harm Israel in any way? I want to see justice done; I don’t want anything else; only justice. The International Criminal Court should do its duty so that those responsible for these crimes are brought to justice.” 
Next door, two neighbours – a 79-year-old woman and her grandson – were crushed to death by the collapsing walls of the al-Dalu family house. Others in their family were injured. 
In another neighbourhood five-year-old Mohammed Abu Zur and two of his aunts were killed and 25 other relatives, 15 of them children, injured when their neighbours’ house was bombed. They are the victims of so called “collateral damage” caused by reckless bombardments which the Israeli army launched against densely populated residential areas. 
They knew that they were almost certain to kill and injure unarmed civilians not involved in the conflict and to cause destruction and damage far beyond their actual targets. 
And these cases are not exceptional. In the few days I’ve been here in Gaza I’ve investigated many more cases of children and other unarmed civilians killed and injured in Israeli bombardment between 14 and 21 November. 
Once again civilians bore the brunt. The impunity afforded to those responsible for similar attacks in the past has no doubt contributed to their recurrence during this latest escalation of the conflict. What is needed now is an independent investigation to ensure that victims are not once again denied justice and reparation.

Two years ago, 350 people from the Coastei community in north-western Romania lost their homes when they were forcibly evicted by local authorities. They were not given any written or detailed communication or sufficient notice – the evicted families were only told  that they needed to move themselves and their belongings within two days! 
	Amnesty members responded in a big way, when supporters from 80 countries wrote letters during Write for Rights on International Human Rights Day, calling for justice for those who had lost their homes. Members in Canada also wrote 150 messages of solidarity directly to those from the former Coastei Road community. 
 More words of thanks to Amnesty International letter-writers 
	In Canada, nearly 30,000 participants wrote persuasive letters to authorities on Human Rights Day, urging an end to human rights abuses. Many also chose the option of writing letters of hope and solidarity directly to the people featured in our actions. These are some of their words of thanks, upon receiving letters from Amnesty International supporters …	  
Yolanda Oquelí, Guatemala“Its the most beautiful thing I’ve received in my life! I’m going to frame them. There are some drawings from children of 8 and 9 years old that are so pretty!”	Prior to Write for Rights, Yolanda Oquelí was the subject of one of Amnesty International’s ongoing Individuals at Risk actions, after she was shot for speaking out against a proposed mining operation in Guatemala. Following our campaigning in the fall, authorities responded by providing her with protection, but activists in her community continue to be the subject of violent attacks. 
 Geng He, wife of Gao Zhisheng, China“Following a Letter-Writing Marathon (‘Write for Rights’) organized by Amnesty International at the end of last year and the international community’s actions, the family of the Gao Zhisheng was granted a second prison visit on 12 January of this year. It is a small improvement, but it could not be achieved without the international community’s concerns and the effort and support from the membership of Amnesty International, for which my family and I feel most grateful.”	A prominant lawyer in China, Gao (pictured with his son) remains detained for his human rights work. 
 Taghi Rahmaniosa, husband of Narges Mohammadi, Iran:“Your organization has always been a great support for me and I say that as someone who has spent 14 years of my life behind bars. My wife, Narges Mohammadi and I, as human rights activists, have always been warmed by Amnesty International’s dedication to promoting human rights. For me, Amnesty International is the symbol of an organization that wants human rights for all people. An organization that, free from any political affiliations, urges governments and other entities to respect human rights.”	Narges, pictured here, is an Iranian women’s rights activist and a mother of 5-year-old twins who was sentenced in April 2012 to six years in prison on charges related to her human rights work. 
 Luis Evelis, Indigenous people at Risk, Colombia:“Your letters and expressions of concern about this grave emergency can help prevent Indigenous Peoples from being wiped out. So that we don’t lose these cultures, their wisdom; entire Indigenous Peoples, human beings.”	Amnesty International Canada is raising the profile of the threats to Indigenous peoples in Colombia through a photo gallery that is touring the country. During Write for Rights, many schools in Canada got involved in writing on the pressing issues: teachers at Mount Royal Collegiate in Saskatoon and Beaverlodge Regional High school in Beaverlodge, Alberta, for example, got their students involved and sent in packages full of dove messages to President Santos. Children as young as 5 prepared dove images and adults wrote thoughtful solidarity messages. 
 Dinebari David Vareba, from the Bodo community, Nigeria:“I think this solidarity, I would say, is the highest we have had…. assisting the Bodo people to actually have a better situation in the disaster which they had. I am so impressed by first of all, Amnesty International organizing this, for inviting us.” 
	In 2008, two consecutive oil spills, caused by faults in a Shell pipeline, resulted in thousands of barrels of oil polluting the land and creek surrounding Bodo, a town of 69,000 people in Nigeria’s Niger Delta. No proper clean up has ever taken place. The Bodo community had some recent good news, when the court of the Economic Community of West African States ordered the Nigerian government to punish oil companies over pollution.  But pressure is needed to make sure that the government adheres to this judgment. 
In an inspired act of generosity for Human Rights Day, Christian & David from Nigeria’s Bodo community, wrote messages of support to people who lost their homes in the Coastei community in Romania.

President Mohamed Morsi decision to give the army new policing powers has raised new concerns about Egypt’s future, raked up painful memories of the past. 
In protests around the Presidential Palace on Friday, we saw tanks and armoured vehicles belonging to the Presidential Guard parked in the streets. 
Protesters were climbing on them and taking pictures. A few fearless parents even let their children climb on them, posing with the soldiers. 
The scenes were eerily reminiscent of the days after the “25 January Revolution”, when many welcomed the army on the streets after the 18 days of mass protests that ended the rule of Hosni Mubarak. 
But the military ruled with an iron fist; more than 120 protesters were killed in demonstrations and in excess of 12,000 civilians were tried unfairly by military courts. 
And it was clear on Friday that many found the reappearance of the army deeply unsettling. 
“Remember Maspero?” cried one woman in the crowd, referring to the army’s suppression of a protest by Coptic Christians in October 2011 in which 27 were killed. 
She began to chant slogans against the army. 
Many are still waiting for truth and justice for the 17 bloody months of army rule that ended in June. 
But the announcement the army will have policing powers until the results of a constitutional referendum are published may also pave the way for new abuses. 
One person worried about the future is Azza Hilal Ahmad Suleiman, who was beaten by soldiers suppressing a protest at Cairo’s Cabinet Offices in December last year. 
Today, she told us: “The President is giving the army more powers in addition to his own extended powers… It is as if we are back to military rule but even worse.” 
Under President Morsi, there have been some steps towards justice. An investigative judge was appointed to investigate the former Head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (the SCAF), his chief of staff and the former head of the military police. 
But it is not clear where the investigation will lead; under Egyptian law, the military can rule on whether or not a crime falls under its remit, making justice for many painfully elusive. 
Only three low-ranking soldiers have been convicted of human rights violations during the rule of the SCAF, for their role in suppressing the Maspero protests. In the only other case, a military court cleared a doctor of overseeing forced “virginity tests” on women protesters. 
A member of a fact-finding Committee set up by the President to investigate human rights violations during the “25 January Revolution” and the SCAF told us they are still preparing their final report, due this month. 
The Committee has reportedly uncovered new evidence of human rights violations committed by officials and members of the security forces. 
But it is again unclear whether their report will mark a step towards real accountability, or whether its findings will be brushed aside or buried by the authorities. 
For now, the army’s role in the coming days is a source of great concern. 
One ominous sign was during Friday’s protests, when we asked one officer about why he was letting protesters get so close to the Presidential Palace. 
“I’m following orders,” he told us. “If the orders say clear the area of protesters, that’s what I’ll do.”

Last month we drove northwest from Ramallah to visit the small village of Budrus, which gained international attention a decade ago when residents started protesting against the fence/wall erected by Israel. 
Regular protests there against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank continue, and clashes between village youths and members of the Israeli army have become a weekly, if not daily, occurrence. 
The main reason behind the protests is still the wall, described by the Israeli government as a security fence and by Budrus residents, and Palestinians throughout the West Bank, as an ‘apartheid wall’ and a way for the Israeli government to annex more Palestinian lands. 
The majority of the wall is located inside the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). In Budrus, it consists of rolls of barbed wire, multiple fences and sensors, and a road on the other side patrolled by Israeli military jeeps, all of which work to separate villagers from their farming lands. 
There are no Israeli settlements or towns nearby, but Israeli troops regularly enter the village.  The encounters between them and Budrus residents can be fatal. 
We visited the fresh grave of a 16-year-old boy, Samir ‘Awad, buried in the cemetery next to his school in the west of the village, about half a mile from the wall. 
Scattered between the graves were different kinds of tear gas canisters shot by the Israeli army during confrontations. 
Witnesses and village authorities told us that Samir’s life was cut short on 15 January 2013, when he was shot by Israeli soldiers with live ammunition, after he went through an opening in the first barbed wire fence while hanging out with his friends after finishing their exams. 
“We used to go down to the fence and throw rocks at the sensors and try to cut parts of it. It is our way to protest the occupation,” Samir’s friend told Amnesty International. 
Witnesses we spoke to claimed that the soldiers had ambushed the youths before shooting Samir in the back and head from close range without giving him a chance to get out of harm’s way. An inquiry by B’Tselem, a leading Israeli human rights organization, found that the soldiers were not in any danger and shot Samir ‘Awad in contravention of open-fire regulations. This would mean that it was an unlawful killing. 
The Israeli authorities’ first obligation is to conduct a thorough, independent, prompt and effective investigation, but Israel’s military investigations consistently fail to meet these international standards. Even though Israel’s military police have opened an investigation into Samir’s death, village residents believe that those responsible for killing him will not be held to account, as in so many other cases throughout the OPT. 
This climate of impunity allows for daily abuses by Israeli forces in the OPT. 
Villagers in Budrus told us that the whole population suffers from the effects of tear gas every time there is a confrontation with the Israeli army. The soldiers use it extensively, including inside the village, often firing directly at villagers and their homes even though this is against army regulations. Villagers choke on the gas and some have been hit by gas canisters and injured. 
We had a taste of this ourselves. That afternoon in the cemetery, we had a panoramic view of a confrontation between several youths and a number of soldiers. 
Three youths started walking towards four army vehicles parked behind the wall, throwing stones. However, before they got close to them they were intercepted by two soldiers fully equipped with weapons who entered the village through a gate in the wall, followed by a military vehicle. The soldiers began firing large amounts of tear gas. 
My colleague filmed the beginning of the confrontation. As the tear gas reached us, many of the children around me started running away from the gas towards their homes. 
My eyes started to water and burn with a stinging irritation, and I started to find it difficult to breathe.  My colleague who was filming had made good use of a scarf to cover his mouth and nose, but he was also suffering. His eyes were visibly watery and red and he could barely keep them open. I suggested he move away but he insisted on continuing to film as the soldiers descended on the four youth while firing more tear gas at them. 
I decided to move away as the pain in my eyes was worsening, as were my breathing problems. I planned to walk as far away as possible until I could find an area in the village free from tear gas, then wait for my colleague to join me. 
As I walked through the village I came across a group of children who had been playing football when I passed them earlier. They had stopped their game, covered their faces, and were rushing to their homes. 
One of the children turned to look at me on the threshold of his house and said: “The gas affects us indoors too”. 
I continued walking eastward, but the tear gas drifted in the same direction. When I reached the easternmost end of the village I realised that it was wishful thinking that I could escape its effects. 
As I stood there waiting, my eyes were still in pain and the banging of the tear gas launchers could still be heard. The launcher was still shooting canisters when my colleague finally joined me about 40 minutes after the beginning of the incident. He had left the scene soon after I did, going to a home to interview a boy who had been injured in a previous confrontation with the army, but even inside, he said he could still feel the gas. 
This persistent use and abuse of tear gas doesn’t make the headlines, but nobody should have to live day after day in such conditions, and the soldiers responsible for these daily abuses should be held accountable.

On Tuesday morning Bridget Tolley did what no mother wants to do—search for her missing daughter. Laura Spence and her friend Nicole Whiteduck were last seen on Sunday morning in Kitigan Zibi, a community north of Ottawa. 
Tolley is the co-founder of the grassroots organization Families of Sisters in Spirit—one of Amnesty International’s key partners in the Stolen Sisters campaign to end violence against Indigenous women in Canada. She provides support to Indigenous families across Canada whose daughters, sisters, mothers, and aunties have gone missing or been murdered. And while she understands very well the pain of losing a loved one—her mother was killed in 2001 by a police cruiser—until this week she had not experienced what many of the families she works with have gone through when a loved one vanishes. 
While dealing with her own fear and grief, Tolley had to contact authorities, liaise with the media, launch a search of the community, and run a social media campaign, all while taking care of her infant grandchild. She was quoted in the media as saying that all her work with families of missing women did not prepare her to launch a search of her own. No one should be expected to know what to do when a loved one goes missing. 
We were relieved when Tolley’s daughter and her friend were found safe on Thursday morning. 
Tolley’s experience underscores the importance of making resources available in a timely fashion not only to help locate missing women and girls, but to provide support services to the family members who have had their lives turned upside down.

Holly’s cousin, Loretta Saunders, was murdered in Halifax earlier this year. Follow the Am I Next? campaign on Facebook.  
Amnesty International talked to Holly as part of a series marking the 10th anniversary of the Stolen Sisters report on violence against Indigenous women. We asked Holly for her reflections on progress made and remaining challenges in making sure that there are No More Stolen Sisters. Here is what she had to say. 
How are you working to address violence against Indigenous women?	My goal is to empower women, educate the public, always be a good role model for other women, and to walk in honor of those who came before me. I don’t take a terribly loud approach, because we are talking about “violence.” I try to remember my compassion, and empathy, and I try to keep a little piece of myself always in reserve, to remind myself that we all have a voice, and some just need a little lift to get there. 
What is the importance of families working together?	There’s a history of passive genocide over a period of hundreds of years. Our women are being stolen and murdered. Our children are being stolen and given away. Anything we are doing to survive through that is progress. And we are—we are progressing. 
I see a lot of our warrior women burning out. Some have been on the same boat for the rough ride for so long that the seasickness weighs in their hearts and on their faces. We, the family members of the missing and murdered, are a group of people you can never be prepared to be part of. And nobody would wish that on you. We didn’t set out to become activists—we were forced into it by circumstance without training. 
The personal battle we sometimes endure as family members is disheartening. We have our personal struggles—to find out loved ones, wonder about her murder—and that in itself is akin to torture. But then we also have to struggle to convince the government to respond to the travesty when even we cry and scream out for help. 
As someone new to the walk for justice for our women (my family lost Loretta only in February), I feel a little like a torch has been given to me. This is something I would never want, but I know I am keeping good company with so many strong family members. 
I don’t look forward on passing a torch to anyone else though. When Tina Fontaine’s body was found my heart broke again. 
Are there things you think most Canadians don’t understand yet?	Canadians don’t understand the impact of colonialism yet.  Either the majority dismiss it or don’t have any idea what it is. I think social media and the unity and solidarity that is coming together in the past year is doing a better job at making Canadians feel like this also is something that belongs to them and that they are responsible. 
I really believe in Canadians. I think Canada will come through and not let the issue out of their mouths and minds anytime soon. That’s a good thing.  We are talking more and more. They are coming along well. 
What action would you like to see at the government level?	A national inquiry of course! Owned and operated Indigenous peoples and family members. 
What do you want to see ten years from now?	In ten years from now, I want to see more community programming and money sunk into more services offered to Aboriginal families. I would like to see more unity within our own people. 
What is more important is what I don’t want to see. I don’t want to see this happen to any more families. No more missing and no more murdered women.

Amnesty International has long called for a comprehensive, coordinated national plan of action to address gaps in current policies, programs and services; involve Indigenous women’s organizations in identifying the necessary solutions; and ensure accountability in their delivery. 
Implementation of a National Action Plan to end violence against women is also necessary to fulfill Canada’s international human rights commitments. 
In January 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution that called on all states to eliminate all forms of violence against women “by means of a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained approach, adequately supported and facilitated by strong institutional mechanisms and financing, through national action plans…” The call for comprehensive, sustained National Action Plans has been reaffirmed in subsequent resolutions. 
Canada played a leading role in these UN resolutions calling for National Action Plans. Canada is not exempt from the position, which it has supported at the UN, that all states should adopt National Action Plans to end violence against women. 
The Native Women’s Association of Canada, the Assembly of First Nations and many other Indigenous and civil society organizations have called on Canada to adopt a comprehensive and coordinated National Action Plan to stop violence against women. 
A National Action Plan should include: 
To be successful, a National Action Plan should be developed in collaboration with Indigenous women’s organizations to ensure their full and effective participation in defining needs and solutions and must be accompanied by measures to ensure accountability to Parliament and to the Indigenous women and their families who the plan would serve. 
A National Action Plan is not an alternative to a National Public Inquiry. An independent inquiry would be a powerful tool to ensure that the National Action Plan is well informed and well supported.

According to the report, 1,017 women and girls identified as Indigenous were murdered between 1980 and 2012—a homicide rate roughly 4.5 times higher than that of all other women in Canada. 
In addition, the report states that as of November 2013, at least 105 Indigenous women and girls remained missing under suspicious circumstances or for undetermined reasons. 
These appalling statistics are consistent with previous estimates from sources such as Statistics Canada that have long pointed to a greatly disproportionate level of violence against that First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls. The latest numbers also underline what Indigenous women and advocacy organizations have long been saying–that this violence requires a specific and concerted response from police and all levels of society. 
The RCMP’s release of official, national police statistics confirming these previous estimates is an important and welcome step because such numbers are critical to inform and mobilize police and public response. 
Unfortunately, in the hands of some government officials and media commentators, the new RCMP statistics have become, not a source of clarity and a resource for action, but an excuse for misrepresenting the reality of Indigenous women’s lives and an excuse for continued inaction. 
The RCMP report does not tell us everything we need to know about violence against Indigenous women. The release of this report is not a substitute for a national inquiry. 
The RCMP report does not reflect the voices of affected families and communities. Nor does it provide a vehicle for the consideration and implementation of the solutions that they have identified. And even as a statistical picture of missing and murdered Indigenous women, the RCMP report has important gaps that need to be acknowledged. 
In its statistics on homicide, the RCMP report only includes cases where the original investigating police force has concluded that a murder has taken place. The report explicitly does not include unexplained and suspicious deaths. 
Amnesty’s own research has raised concerns that deaths of Indigenous women and girls are not always fully and properly investigated and that as a result some murders of Indigenous women and girls may have been wrongly classified as accidental deaths. 
In addition, police in Canada do not consistently record the Indigenous identity of victims of crime. Statistics Canada reports that in 2009, for example, police recorded failed to note whether the victims of crime were Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal in 384 out of 610 homicides. Some victims of crime are being inaccurately identified as non-Aboriginal because police have not had proper training on why accurate identification is important and how it’s to be determined. 
The RCMP report acknowledges the unreliability of current police practices of determining Indigenous identity. The report claims that a file review, carried out over a period of several months, established the Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal identity of all but 95 homicide victims whose identity was previously recorded as “unknown.” The RCMP did not review files to determine whether Indigenous women had been inaccurately recorded as non-Indigenous. 
The RCMP report also does not distinguish between First Nations, Inuit and Métis women and girls. As a consequence, it does not provide any information on whether the homicide rate is the same or differs among these groups. The report provides a number of statistics on the lives of the victims. The nature of many of these statistics—such as history of illegal drug use or involvement in illegal activities—suggests an inappropriate focus on the possible role of the victim’s own actions and behaviours. 
The report does not include any information on how many of the women and girls previously sought help or protection from the police or service agencies or the response they received. 
Although the report breaks down the statistics according to some potentially significant factors—such as whether homicides were committed outside the residence (27% for Indigenous women compared to 20% for non-Indigenous) —it does not provide figures for homicides on and off reserve. 
The report does not identify how many of the perpetrators of the crime were Indigenous and how many were non-Indigenous. The report also does not provide any information on the numbers of perpetrators and the role of others in helping carry out or cover up the crime. 
However, the report does however provide important information on the relationship of the perpetrators to the victims, suggesting significant differences in the threats faced by Indigenous and non-Indigenous women. 
Previous research, including reports by the Native Women’s Association of Canada and Amnesty International’s own research, show that violence against Indigenous women and girls is pervasive, taking place in the home and in the streets of Canadian cities, and that the perpetrators include Indigenous and non-Indigenous men alike. 
Nothing in the RCMP report changes this conclusion. 
The vast majority of murders are committed by someone known to the victim. This is true for Indigenous and non-Indigenous women alike. 
However, there is at least one significant difference revealed by the RCMP report. 
In the case of Aboriginal women, spouses, family and other intimates account for 62% of homicides, compared to 74% of murders of all other women. The difference is largely accounted for by greater number of murders of Indigenous women and girls by people the police categorize as “acquaintances”, including friends, co-workers, neighbours, authority figures and other people known to, but not intimate with the victim. 
In the 22 year period covered by the RCMP, acquaintances were found to be responsible for the murder of more than 300 Indigenous women and girls in Canada. 
The rate of homicide by acquaintances was 7 times greater for Indigenous women and girls than for all other women in Canada. 
During the same period, the RCMP found that strangers were responsible for the murder of 81 Aboriginal women and girls.Clearly, domestic and family violence are critical issues that must be addressed in any meaningful national strategy to address violence against Indigenous women and girls. 
At the same time, it’s also clear that characterizing the threats to Indigenous women’s lives as exclusively about domestic violence – as some government spokespersons and media commentators have done – misrepresents the issues and obscures crucial aspects of these threats. 
Regardless of the identity of the perpetrator, or their relationship of the perpetrator to the victim, it’s clear that their actions needed to be examined in the context of the discrimination, marginalization, and impoverishment that put Indigenous women in harm’s way. Amnesty International’s 2004 Stolen Sisters report concluded that all these factors work together to compound the risks to Indigenous women, encouraging some men to target Indigenous women for acts of racist and misogynist violence, and in denying Indigenous women equal access to services such as shelters that are required for their safety. 
The kind of statistics released by the RCMP need to collected and made public on an ongoing basis. To ensure the accuracy and completeness of this data, specific guidelines and training need to be provided to officers in all police services to ensure that they understand when to record Indigenous identity and how this information is to be used.

As Executive Director of the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society, Cindy has brought a landmark discrimination case to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to challenge the federal government’s chronic underfunding of children’s services on First Nations reserves and for First Nations children in the Yukon. The closing arguments in that hearing will take place October 20-24 and will be webcast live at fnwitness.ca. 
We spoke with Cindy as part of a series of conversation with Indigenous advocates and leaders to mark the 10th anniversary of Amnesty International’s report Stolen Sisters: A Human Rights Response to Discrimination and Violence against Indigenous Women in Canada. 
You’ve said that the government is removing more First Nations children from their families and communities today than at the height of the residential school era. What’s happening? Why are so many First Nations kids being taken into care? 
What we know from the research is that First Nations children are being removed at astonishing rate because of neglect. When I talk about neglect I mean poverty, poor housing, and substance misuse related to the residential school trauma. All of those are things we could do something about. But unfortunately, like many other programs on First Nations reserves across Canada, child welfare is underfunded – according to the Government of Canada’s own estimates by about 34% compared to what other children in Canada receive. And the Government of Canada says itself that this level of inequitable funding contributes to the growing numbers of First Nations children in care. 
So we can see the direct connection between the multi-generational impacts of residential schools and colonization to the lack of culturally-based resources on reserve to the high numbers of children ending up in foster care. 
That’s why this case is so important. We want to make sure those families have an equal chance to raise their children at home. 
In its official apology to residential school survivors, the Canadian government acknowledged that the harm that was inflicted didn’t stop with the physical and sexual abuse of students, but that there was also a lasting harm caused by the removal of children from their families and cultures. Do you see the continued removal of children from their families and culture today as inflicting new harms to the children and their communities, just like the residential school era? 
Absolutely. 
One of the documents that literally took my breath away when I was a witness at the Human Rights Tribunal was a spreadsheet that was prepared by the Department of Indian Affairs about the number of First Nations children in foster care. It doesn’t just  say that in a given year you have 9000 kids in foster care, it actually talks about it in a way that kids would think about it, which is how many nights have I been away from my family? It added up the number of nights that First Nations kids on reserve and in the Yukon spent in foster care between 1989 and 2012. Cumulatively, First Nations children have spent over 66 million nights away from their families. That’s 187,000 years of childhood. And in too many cases those children are being placed in non-Aboriginal homes where they’re not learning their culture, they’re not learning their connections to their families, they’re not learning their languages. 
So I would argue that we’re going to see many of those same harmful effects in this generation of First Nations children that we saw in residential schools if we don’t stop what we’re doing right now and make sure these kids have a proper chance to grow up with their families because that’s where they learn their cultures. 
There has been a growing movement across Canada demanding action on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, not just about investigating the crimes, but dealing with the root causes that are putting these Indigenous women and girls in danger in the first place. Do you think that the kinds of harm caused by the massive levels of removal of First Nations children from their families are part of these root causes? 
Absolutely. We need to look no further than the tragic recent case of Tina Fontaine who was a child in care.  And all these adults who are at risk and vulnerable today were once children who were at risk and vulnerable. 
There’s a famous study called the Adverse Childhood Experiences study, the ACE study in the United States, which showed that when children have multiple experiences of harm – it could be a child who is in a home where there are multigenerational effects of residential schools, where there is poverty, where there is no clean drinking water as is the case in 1 in 6 First Nations communities, and where they’re going to a lousy school – if you add up all those things, those experiences are going to play out well through their adulthood. In fact, it even puts them at higher risk for things like coronary disease and diabetes. 
So you can see that the seeds we plant in childhood have lifelong consequences. If we plant seeds of discrimination then we set in play a strong likelihood of a tragic and difficult adulthood.  But if we plant seeds of justice and equality and culture that breeds self-confidence, we’re going to see those same positive experiences grow throughout their lives. 
What I don’t want to see is another generation of First Nations adults having to recover from their childhoods as so many survivors of the residential schools have had to do and as so many families of the murdered and missing women are now doing. 
What outcome are you hoping for with the case that’s you’ve brought before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal? 
I’m pretty optimistic that the Tribunal, based on the overwhelming evidence of inequality and the harms to these kids, is going to find that Canada has discriminated against this generation of First Nations children. The most important thing to me though is the remedy. We brought this case because we want the problem fixed. 
We were kind of naïve in that we used to think we could fix the problem by working with the government, which we did for a period of ten years before filing this complaint, and identifying evidence-based solutions that the federal government could more than afford. In fact, when we brought forward the last proposal, developed with 20 leading experts from across Canada, it would have cost less than 1 percent of the surplus budget for the federal government to do the right thing for these kids and the government walked away. 
So I really want that remedy implemented for child welfare. But I also want these same inequalities that affect children in health, education and water to end. As a country we need to do better than continuing this longstanding pattern of discrimination against First Nations children, young people and their families. They deserve equality going forward. 
Thank you, Cindy. Is there anything you wanted to add? 
I would say that the role of the public is really critical. Reconciliation to me is about not having to say sorry a second time. 
If you want to learn about this case that’s before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, you can go online at our website www.fnwitness.ca where you’re going to find all the court documents. And on October 20 to 24th, you’ll be able to watch the closing argument via a live webcast, free of charge, and you’ll hear all sides of the case. 
In my view, there is no more important legal case in the country right now. As the saying goes, this one drives a red hot poker stick into the conscience of the nation. If the federal government is indeed discriminating against First Nations children in foster care, that should be at the top of everyone’s policy agenda, moral agenda, and political agenda because it’s totally out of step with the values that the country stands for, 
So please do watch. Don’t turn away. We really do need all of your help and your support as we move forward to build not only a more just world for First Nations kids, but to build a better future for Canada in the process.

This will give youth the opportunity to showcase their talents and passion for human rights, alongside Canada’s top journalists in this field! 
These awards, which have been presented for excellence in journalism and human rights since 1995, honour the efforts of journalists to increase Canadian’s awareness and understanding of a variety of national and international human rights issues. This award will recognize the role Canadian youth plays in the promotion of human rights and it will also highlight the contribution that the young generation has on this conversation. While we often talk about how youth are the leaders of tomorrow, this award recognizes the leaders that youth are today. 
“I guess I was kind of mad. I mean when you feel strongly about something you start to look into it and you start to research it and yeah, that’s how I got around to writing it.” 
-finalist for the Amnesty UK Young Reporter Award 2013 
In pursuit of a vision where every person in the world can enjoy all the human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights standards, Amnesty International’s mission is to conduct research and take action to prevent and end grave abuses of all human rights – civil, political, social, cultural and economic. From freedom of expression and association to physical and mental integrity, from protection from discrimination to the right to housing- these rights are indivisible. 
The Youth Media Award includes many ways of covering human rights issues; whether it be printed, broadcasted or posted online, this award allows all submissions as long as they contain a national or international human rights issues, emphasizing how they impact young people. The competition is open to any student at a Canadian university or college who has had an article published or a piece broadcast or posted in a recognized student media outlet during the period from 30 September 2014 through 31 May 2015. 
To submit a piece of work, you can email it to youth@amnesty.ca by the end of May 2015. Whether it’s your work or you’d like to nominate someone else’s work, we encourage you to take that step and get youth’s voice out there by submitting a piece of work to Amnesty International Canada. 
The winner will be announced in September 2015 with a prize of $500. The winner will also later receive an Amnesty International Canada Youth Media Award Certificate at the annual Amnesty International Canada Media Awards event held in Toronto; the winner will be able to meet and network with some of the most recognized journalists in the country!

Remind the Prime Minister and all party leaders that..."," Canada’s commitment to resettling refugees has been modest and processing rates painfully slow. Remind the Prime Minister and all party leaders that Canadians welcome refugees. 
At long last – anguished by the heartbreaking photo of little Alan Kurdi’s lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach and challenged by the images of thousands of refugees desperately and determinedly clashing with police along the Greek/Macedonian border or setting off on foot from Budapest’s train station to reach Germany – the world gets it. 
We have long talked of the Syrian refugee crisis. We have talked of the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. We have talked of the European refugee crisis. 
We have talked of the responsibilities borne by Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon – Syria’s neighbours – now sheltering 4 million Syrian refugees, 2 million in Turkey alone.  The numbers are so high in tiny Lebanon that 1 out of 5 people in the country are now Syrian refugees.  
We have long talked of the challenges faced by Italy, Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary. 
But it was not until the tragedy of Alan Kurdi’s senseless, pointless and so avoidable death on the Mediterranean’s cruel high seas last week – and then the agonizing realization that his family had a Canadian connection and his uncle had tried, unsuccessfully, to come to Canada for safety – that our understanding at long last shifted. 

It was not until that moment that finally – across the country, our leaders, our premiers, our mayors, our neighbours – we all finally understood, accepted and agreed.
This is not a Syrian crisis, a Jordanian/Lebanese/Turkish crisis.  It is not an Italian/Greek/Hungarian crisis. Nor is it a European crisis. It is, of course, all of those things; very desperately so.
But above all else it is a global refugee crisis. And a global crisis means global responsibility and global solutions. And that includes Canada.

This global crisis calls us, as Canadians, to act for so many reasons:

because of our commitments as a nation to human rights and humanitarian causes;
because of our wealth and good fortune as a nation;
because of our Syrian friends, neighbours and co-workers who already live with and among us across the country and worry about the safety of relatives left behind;
because of our abilities, capacities and resources as a nation that has so often resettled large numbers of refugees in the past; andsimply because it is the necessary and right thing to do.

Over the past week there has been much debate about numbers.  Commentators have pointed to disappointing past commitments; levels which Amnesty International has long said were too low.  There have been recollections about what we’ve done in the past, such as at the time of the Vietnamese refugee crisis over 35 years ago.  And there have been shameful comparisons to what other nations are doing now.
But those really are not the important questions we need to answer right now. 
The crucial questions in front of us now are what is the need, what are we capable of and how do we make sure it happens.
The Syrian crisis is unlike any refugee situation we have faced in generations.  Our contribution must therefore be unlike anything we have mustered in generations.
And we need to be thinking in that immediate time frame: now.  This is not about what we will do over 2, 3 or 4 years.  It is what we must and what we will do now.

Here are 8 key steps that point the way forward.

Amnesty International has called for an immediate commitment to resettle a minimum of 10,000 Syrians through government sponsorship – not spread out over several years – but now.  That means ensuring that they will arrive in Canada before the end of this year.  That needs to be followed up with similar generous sustained commitments over the years to come. 
We need to expedite family resettlement.    That option should have offered safety for Alan Kurdi and his extended family.  It failed.  Families should be reunited immediately with the paperwork and processing happening once relatives are safely here in Canada.
Private sponsorship of Syrian refugees – the impulse for which has erupted so naturally and generously across the country – needs to be well supported and the many barriers that slow it down have to be lifted.
There needs to be a dramatic increase in the levels of financial, human and logistical resources that are so needed to ensure speedy processing – not the agonizingly protracted processing of refugee applications that is today’s reality.  There are nowhere near enough resources even for the numbers currently being processed. There has to be a significant and immediate boost.  Otherwise, no matter the commitments, no matter the aspiration – this will all be an illusion.
Doing more to assist Syrian refugees cannot come at the expense of other refugees from other parts of the world.  Our commitment to refugees fleeing conflict and persecution in other countries must continue.
Canada has been generous in providing funding to UN and humanitarian agencies working with refugees and IDPs on the ground in Syria and neighbouring countries.  But still those needs remain dramatically underfunded.  Just last week there was news that the Word Food Programme was curtailing food distribution to over 200,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan because of funding shortfalls.  Canada should keep writing those cheques and pushing and encouraging other nations to do similarly.
Alongside these moves Canada can and should intensify its efforts to find a resolution to the crisis in Syria that has provoked such massive displacement.   One place to start would be to work for a comprehensive global arms embargo against Syria.
Finally, we need coordination, political will and leadership.  Offers and ideas are pouring in from individual Canadians, community initiatives, church groups, mayors and premiers.  We have heard expressions of sorrow and concern from the Minister and the Prime Minister but we have yet to see anything from government that is new and different. There is no sense of how the generosity that is flooding in from across the country at local levels will come together, no confidence yet that it will be matched by decisive federal level action and no idea of how it will transform into an effective plan.  

The need for leadership is urgent.
Canada’s response to the Syrian refugees crisis must be both immediate and sustained.  It must offer much more generous government sponsorship beginning with 10,000 refugees resettled to Canada by year’s end and building from there.  Barriers to private sponsorship must be lifted and families reunited.  Resources must be put in place.  There has to be bold, visionary leadership to make it all happen.
That is what we owe to Alan Kurdi, his family and the countless other Alan Kurdis who need and deserve safety.  And we owe it now.

Her name is Hilda. Like me she is a mother filled with pride and love for her children. Nothing was more evident as she told me about her son Jorge Antonio and how he was studying to be a teacher in the rural community of Ayotzinapa. 
I can only imagine how Hilda is feeling now. 
 
September 26 marks a terrible anniversary for Hilda and her family. It was on that fateful day one year ago, that Jorge Antonio and dozens of other teacher-training students from Ayotzinapa were on their way to a demonstration when they were fired on by Mexican police. 
Three students were killed and others seriously wounded. Eyewitnesses saw the police taking away 43 students.  They were never seen again. Jorge Antonio was never seen again. 
I met Hilda last April during the Ayotzinapa to Ottawa Caravan, a grassroots initiative co-sponsored by Amnesty International. I accompanied her as she met with a senior advisor to Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister and appealed for pressure on Mexican authorities to properly investigate and find the disappeared students.  
I was moved beyond words as Hilda and surviving student Jorge Luis Balbuena courageously testified to Parliament’s Subcommittee on International Human Rights about the lethargic pace of investigators, the indifference of Mexican authorities and the dangerous threats against those speaking out. 
Hilda, Jorge Luis and all the families and classmates of the disappeared students of Ayotzinapa deserve both our admiration and our active support. Since last September 26 they have done everything possible to find their loved ones. 
Yet one year later, they are still asking: “Where are the 43?” 
There is no doubt that the official investigation has been nothing short of a white-wash, a cover-up orchestrated by the highest levels of government. Key forensic evidence was handled without care or never processed at all. Important lines of investigation were never pursued. Official “conclusions” shared with the press were based on the testimony of witnesses who later claimed they were tortured into confessing to abducting the students. 
Efforts by top government officials to convince the world that the students were killed by a drug gang and their remains burned in a dumpster have been exposed by experts as lacking in evidence and credibility. Indeed in a report on September 6, a group of independent experts appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights concluded it was scientifically impossible for that number of bodies to have been burned in a dumpster in the conditions claimed by the authorities. 
Meanwhile, Mexican authorities barred the independent experts from interviewing soldiers of the 27th infantry battalion based in the town where the students were attacked and taken away – begging the question: what is it that the authorities are trying to hide? 
Shockingly, what happened to the students of Ayotzinapa is no isolated case. More than 26,000 people are reported disappeared or missing in Mexico, almost half of them during the current government of President Peña Nieto. 
Authorities do little if anything to investigate, sending a message that these crimes are tolerated amidst widespread collusion between state security forces and organized crime. The few victims of disappearances and abductions whose remains have been found have displayed evidence of torture. Indeed, torture is out of control with a 600% rise in reported cases in the past decade. 
As I write, Hilda and the families of the 43 missing students are on a hunger strike in Mexico’s capital. They want a real investigation, they want justice but most of all they want their kids back. 
We can help! 
Please sign this petition action without delay. Share it with others. Together we can show Mexico’s government that Canadians – a huge source of tourism income in Mexico – have not forgotten the missing students of Ayotzinapa and we expect action. 
Then light a candle for Hilda, for Jorge Antonio, for his classmates, for their families and know you are part of a global movement that will not give up.

Since joining Amnesty International, my human rights focus has expanded to include efforts supporting the work of Earth and Land Defenders in Latin America and Canada. As a member of the Amnesty International Toronto Business&Human Rights and Indigenous Rights Specialized Team, I have been involved in the organization of various events such as a screening of the short documentary “Uprivers” which highlighted the environmental and social impacts of the Mount Polley Mining Disaster in British Colombia. We also organized the “Indigenous Issues Are Election Issues” event in 2019, where individuals from the GTA were invited to write letters to federal election candidates, urging them to make the implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples a priority if elected. 
 
Since joining the National Organizers Program of AI Canada, I have been supported in my own endeavors.  In 2019, I partnered with my alma-mater to educate high school students about the significance of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. This action – supported and inspired by the Red Feather Project- is an art-based initiative created by digital arts and photography instructor Heather Reid, to raise awareness about Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada. I worked with members of the Red Feather Committee to ensure that this initiative was inclusive of members of the 2SLGBTQQIA community. We invited Laureen-Blu Waters, a grandmother elder advisor to the National Inquiry to join us in a discussion panel at Cardinal Leger Secondary School in Brampton. The panel taught students about the history of colonialism and how it has informed gender and racial based discrimination and violence against Indigenous peoples. On the National Day of Action for MMIWG on October 4th, we had two-spirit Ojibway performer Neenokasi, also referred to as Hummingbird, share their talents and knowledge with us during a vigil which was held for students and members of the public to attend. 
 
Recently, I was chosen to represent Amnesty International Canada as the only youth member of the Canadian English-speaking delegation to this year’s Global Assembly. This is an incredible honour for me, and a role that I remain committed to through intense preparation leading up to the Assembly this summer. 
Following the completion of my undergraduate degree in International Relations, it is my intention to study international human rights law, after which I hope to not only practice law, but to also specialize in human rights and anti-corruption investigative research. 
Being involved with Amnesty has helped me to craft my career path and to fulfill what I believe to be one of my key purposes in life. From fundamental skill building to networking and mentorship, this organization has provided me with all of the critical tools that I have needed to be successful in my human rights activism and advocacy.

0,Trump Administration Using Coronavirus Pandemic to Justify Discriminatory Ban on Asylum-Seekers at Southern Border,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/trump-administration-using-coronavirus-pandemic-to-justify-discriminatory-ban-on-asylum-seekers-at-southern-border-2/,"Following reports that the Trump administration intends to issue a new rule that would allow U.S. agents to turn back all asylum-seekers entering from Mexico in light of the coronavirus pandemic, Charanya Krishnaswami, Advocacy Director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) issued...","Following reports that the Trump administration intends to issue a new rule that would allow U.S. agents to turn back all asylum-seekers entering from Mexico in light of the coronavirus pandemic, Charanya Krishnaswami, Advocacy Director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) issued the below statement: 
“The Trump administration’s ban on asylum-seekers coming from Mexico has nothing to do with making Americans safer from the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump is engaging in fear-mongering to justify racist and discriminatory policies whose only purpose is to demonize people seeking safety. Closing the southern border is a reactionary measure that has virtually no basis in fact.” 
“The Trump administration cannot suddenly suspend U.S. obligations to people seeking safety. A blanket ban on asylum-seekers goes against the U.S. government’s domestic and international legal obligations, plain and simple. A similar 2018 ban was swiftly declared unlawful by every court to have considered it as an egregious violation of the right to seek asylum.” 
“The Trump administration has already sent tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to harm’s way in Mexico, forcing them to survive in dangerous and precarious conditions and exposing them to appalling risks of kidnapping, torture, and other abuses. Instead of doubling down on these failed tactics, the Trump administration should reverse these cruel and punitive policies and allow people to seek safety following the process required by U.S. and international law.” 
Background: 
Yesterday, Amnesty International USA, along with Human Rights First and Physicians for Human Rights, sent letters to governors and state health officials in 13 states asking that they pressure the federal government to release immigration detainees being held in their states and urged the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security to release asylum-seekers and immigrants currently held in inadequate conditions in immigration detention facilities. During a public health crisis, the government must act to protect the health of all people and ensure access to care and safety, not indiscriminately turn them away at borders or keep them locked up in unsanitary and crowded conditions with substandard medical care.

“This shameful assault on freedom of expression targets journalists who have uncovered the reality of numerous human rights violations in China, from Xinjiang to Hong Kong. These publications have also been among those providing in-depth investigations into Wuhan’s COVID-19 outbreak. 
“This latest escalation of the tit-for-tat row between Beijing and Washington threatens to severely undercut the flow of accurate and independent information from China. At a time when the world needs to work together to combat the devastation wrought by the virus, the banishment of these journalists could potentially have grim public health consequences – globally and within China. 
“It’s particularly disturbing that these journalists are also being summarily denied the right to work in Hong Kong and Macau – a decision that should be left to the respective governments. This appears to be yet another example of how the territories’ purported autonomy and freedoms under the ‘one country, two systems’ model are gradually being eroded. 
“The Hong Kong government must urgently clarify the implications of this announcement for its autonomy under the Basic Law.” 
Background 
The Chinese government today demanded US journalists working at the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose press credentials expire by the end of 2020 to return their press cards within 10 days. It further announced they would be prohibited from working as journalists in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau. 
Authorities also ordered the three media outlets, along with Voice of America and Time magazine, to provide details about their operations in China. 
The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the decision was in response to “unwarranted restrictions on Chinese media agencies” in the US. On 2 March, the US government imposed a personnel cap on four Chinese state media outlets – Xinhua News Agency, Chinese Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corporation and China Global Television Network.

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.– Article 1, Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, Indigenous Peoples were not invited to participate, and international law concerning collective human rights remained vague and failed to protect the group rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
But we now have the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
The Declaration affirms the pre-existing collective human rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as the human rights of Indigenous individuals. It provides a framework for justice and reconciliation, applying existing human rights standards to the specific historical, cultural and social circumstances of Indigenous Peoples. 
The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is the most comprehensive international human rights instrument to specifically address Indigenous Peoples’ economic, social, cultural, political, civil, spiritual and environmental rights. 
The rights recognized herein constitute the minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.– Article 43, United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
The Declaration is not merely aspirational. The intent that all States should live up to these standards has been repeatedly reaffirmed through subsequent UN General Assembly resolutions. What’s more, Canadian courts have established that declarations and other sources of international human rights law are “relevant and persuasive” sources for interpretation of human rights in Canada’s Constitution. 
And yet, Canadian governments continue to violate their international, treaty and constitutional obligations to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples.

The...,"An exclusive new visual investigation by Amnesty International and SITU Research shows that Iraqi security forces intended to kill or severely maim dozens of protesters when they fired military-style grenades directly into crowds on the streets of Baghdad from last October onwards. 
The organizations’ interactive website, Smokescreen – Iraq’s use of military-grade tear gas grenades to kill protesters, includes a 3D reconstruction of deadly incidents captured on video around the capital’s Tahrir Square and Jimhouriya Bridge. The distinctive grenades are known to have mortally wounded at least two dozen protesters in that area since October 2019. 
Ballistics simulations and spatial analysis presented on the Smokescreen website show how the projectiles were fired to kill or cause serious bodily harm. 
“Overwhelming evidence points to a pattern of Iraq’s security forces deliberately using these heavy tear gas and smoke grenades to kill, rather than disperse, protesters, in direct violation of international human rights law,” said Brian Castner, Senior Crisis Adviser on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. 
“The security forces knew how deadly these abhorrent weapons were, but continued to fire at will, leading to a string of at least two dozen gruesome fatalities.” 
“The videos analyzed for this report clearly show a pattern of abuse and lethal use of force against Iraqi civilians. It is critical to analyze these weapons in relation to the urban spaces in which they are deployed – this visual investigation tracks the performance of the weapon in relation to the streets, plazas and spaces of assembly where so many have been killed,” said Brad Samuels, Founding Partner of SITU Research. 
Deadly design 
The new analysis builds on an earlier Amnesty International investigation that was the first to identify the distinctive grenades – sometimes nicknamed ‘smokers’ by protesters – as two types based on high-explosive military grenades designed for combat. These include M99 grenades made by Serbian manufacturer Sloboda Ĉaĉak as well as M651 tear gas grenades and M713 smoke grenades manufactured by the Defense Industries Organization (DIO) of Iran. Independent weapon investigators later corroborated this. 
Weighing around 250 grams, these grenades are up to 10 times heavier than standard tear gas canisters. However, they are fired at roughly the same muzzle velocity – the speed at which they leave the grenade launcher – meaning they have significantly more force upon impact, especially when fired at a low angle. 
Such force resulted in horrific casualties as heavy metal slugs pierced protesters’ skulls and bodies, with smoke often still billowing from the open wounds. The fatalities were among the most graphic ever seen by the experienced Amnesty International investigators verifying the videos. 
SITU Research used a digital model to simulate firing one of the grenades into ballistic gelatin – analysis commonly used by weapons and forensics experts to test the type and severity of wounds caused by bullets and other projectiles. The grenade had a remarkably similar impact on the gelatin as a 12-gauge shotgun slug specifically designed for hunting. In other words, when fired directly at a target at a low angle, the so-called “less lethal” grenades are every bit as deadly as heavy ammunition that is expressly designed to kill. 
Intent to kill, not disperse 
Reviewing verified eyewitness video from the scene, Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab and SITU Research pieced together how Iraqi security forces deployed these weapons. 
In multiple videos taken from different vantage points on or near the Jimhouriya Bridge, masked security forces at barricades and on a patrol boat can be seen firing the grenades at a low angle directly towards a crowd of protesters nearby. In other footage, the grenades can be seen whizzing past the protesters’ heads at high velocity. 
Through reviewing eyewitness video as well as gathering testimonies from protesters and medical workers, Amnesty International has documented more than two dozen deaths caused by these heavy grenades since the protests began in October. Since the research relied on verifying available video evidence and corroborating with testimony on the ground, the real number may be much higher. 
Disturbingly, following a lull in their use in late November and December, images emerged showing fresh use of the grenades in January and February 2020. 
Excessive use of force 
Since 1 October 2019, throughout the protests in Baghdad and southern Iraqi governorates, Amnesty International has documented security forces using excessive – and, in hundreds of cases, lethal – force to disperse protesters in a variety of other ways. This includes masked gunmen and snipers using live ammunition, hunting rifles and shotguns firing pellets and birdshot, batons used to mete out severe beatings and a host of other instances of inappropriate and unlawful weapon use. 
Despite this widespread, arbitrary use of force, including hundreds of killings, virtually nothing has been done to hold the Iraqi security forces to account. 
“This new analysis just reinforces our belief that these munitions have no legitimate use in policing demonstrations. The Iraqi authorities must recall these grenades from use immediately, and there must be independent and impartial investigations into their use and into the wider pattern of violations that resulted in hundreds of killings and thousands of injuries during the protests,” said Brian Castner.

Decades of Manitoba Hydro operations in the north of the province are associated with harms to the land, water, and animals, as well as profound adverse impacts on the health, safety, and wellbeing of Indigenous peoples. The impacts include a heighted risk that Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people will experience violence. 
Amnesty International was invited to provide testimony to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls on the findings of Out of Sight, Out of Mind, a report which outlines the harmful impacts of resource development on Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people in northeast British Columbia (BC). 
After testifying, we were approached by advocates from Manitoba who said that everything in Amnesty’s report echoed the experience of Indigenous peoples in northern Manitoba. We were invited by the Manitoba Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO), an organization representing First Nations in northern Manitoba, and York Factory First Nation, to travel to Manitoba and learn more about the impacts of decades of hydro development in their territories, and in particular, the impacts on Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people. 
We met with community members and leaders in York Landing, Thompson, and Winnipeg, and learned about the devastation caused by decades of hydroelectric power development in northern Manitoba. We heard about the eroding land base on which First Nations can practice their culture. Entire communities, including York Factory First Nation, have been relocated because of hydroelectric development. Rising and rapidly changing water levels have led to shoreline erosion, disrupted animal migration patterns, decimated fish spawning grounds, and increased dangers for boaters and people relying on ice roads for winter travel. 
Elders spoke about unhealthy animals including fish, and how the inability to harvest medicines and country food has profoundly impacted food sovereignty in rural and remote First Nations. One community member said, “they were recommending we tell the elders not to eat so much fish anymore. We can’t tell elders to limit the amount of fish to eat.” This has led to once-thriving fishing industries closing, which has had profound and far-reaching negative impacts on communities. An elder said, “We’ve been speaking for the land and the animals. It’s out of control. The world is using up our resources in our territories. And it’s going to look like a waste land.” 
Decades of hydroelectric development northern Manitoba has been accompanied by decades of workers coming to the region to build dams. Indigenous women courageously shared with Amnesty their painful stories of working as cooks or housekeepers in labour camps housing workers and experiencing racist, sexist, and homophobic harassment and violence, including sexual violence, committed by industry workers. Some of the incidents happened decades ago. Some of the incidents happened only months prior. 
The discussions that Amnesty had with community members covered the decades-long impacts of multiple hydroelectric projects, but front and centre in every discussion were the urgent, pressing and harmful impacts associated with construction of the Keeyask mega-dam currently under construction outside Gillam, Manitoba. 
York Factory First Nation, Fox Lake Cree Nation, War Lake First Nation, and Tataskweyak Cree Nation are partners with Manitoba Hydro in the Keeyask Hydropower Limited Partnership to construct the dam. Under the Joint Keeyask Development Agreement, members of all First Nations have opportunities to work on dam construction and in the 2,500 person camp for workers at the project site. 
First Nations partners in the project have community members working at Keeyask. Some community members spoke of the promise of job training and meaningful employment. Some felt the project had brought much needed training opportunities, for example, the opportunity for kitchen helpers to be trained as cooks. Many felt the job opportunities were not as substantive or plentiful as they had been led to believe when their communities entered into partnership with Manitoba Hydro. 
The common thread throughout all our conversations were concerns about pervasive racism, sexism, and homophobia at the Keeyask project site, which has led to harassment and violence, including sexual violence, and the profound impacts this has had on women who have gone to work in the camp. Many people spoke of frustration that First Nations partners in the project did not appear to have the power to compel changes to promote the health, wellness, and safety of community members working at the project. 
Amnesty was told of racist slurs written in mud on walls at the camp, and racist slurs regularly being directed at Indigenous workers, including sexually explicit and racist slurs directed at Indigenous women working in the camp. We heard about Indigenous women being assaulted while serving food to workers, and Indigenous women being sexually assaulted. An Indigenous woman, who had worked at Keeyask, spoke about the “sexual harassment of our women…  I always felt unsafe for the housekeepers, caterers, people in the kitchen, the women. I always wondered about the safety of the women, and I do even today. It hasn’t been easy.” 
Community members we spoke with did not feel comfortable reporting harassment and violence using the available camp reporting procedures, lacking trust in the process, and fearing reprisals. We heard of situations where people returned to their home community and then reported incidents of harassment and violence to trusted community members, community leaders, and/or law enforcement. Leaving camp before a shift was complete could result in termination; workers were willing to risk termination to return home to report the abuse they experienced in camp. Concern was also expressed about the lack of police presence in the camp despite knowledge of multiple sexual assaults; the nearest police detachment is a 40km drive away in Gillam. 
An elder spoke with Amnesty about the specific impacts of previous and current industry labour camps on her community. The elder said, “There was a big camp out of the town. There was a big bar that held 1,000 people. You’d get on a bus and go to the bar and drink and then leave. Of course, they were always after women. It had a really bad impact on the community. There were girls getting raped and everything. And this is happening now. But you know when you’re walking around in your community and there’s men driving around looking for a woman, it’s scary. Grandmothers are talking about their granddaughters coming to Keeyask, and they’re scared and worried. I wouldn’t send my grandchild to work there because it’s not safe.” 
The elder summarized that we heard repeatedly from community members about rampant drug and alcohol at the Keeyask labour camp. Amnesty heard about a rise in drug overdoses in nearby communities, and the inability of existing community resources to meet increasing service needs. 
Community members also spoke about workers ‘blowing off steam’ in their off hours, including workers going into nearby urban centres, using drugs and alcohol, and committing acts of violence against Indigenous women and girls, including sexual violence. 
The overwhelming message from everyone that Amnesty spoke with is that Manitoba Hydro projects are harming their communities, and these harms need to be addressed, and future harms prevented. 
In August 2018, a report released by the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission, a follow-up to a previous cumulative impact study conducted by the provincial government and Manitoba Hydro, described the devastating impact that decades of hydroelectric development have had on First Nations in northern Manitoba, including allegations of sexual assault and other violence by workers brought into the communities to build the dams. Everything that Amnesty heard from community members was consistent with the finds of this report. And everything that Amnesty heard was consistent with our own research in BC. 
Amnesty International carried out research in northeast BC on the intersection of gender, Indigenous rights, and energy development, leading to the 2016 release of the report, Out of Sight, Out of Mind. The report documented a pattern of human rights abuses associated with energy development—including oil and gas and hydroelectricity projects—which led to violations of the right to free, prior, and informed consent, dislocation and disconnection with the land which is so vital to sustaining culture, and harms to the physical environment. 
These projects also rely on workers from outside the region to meet labour demands. High wages for resource sector workers, and the large numbers of workers attracted to the region, have driven up local prices for essentials such as food and housing. However, not everyone has access to these wages. In fact, women’s wages in the northeast are well below the average for women in Canada. This has created sharp inequalities in the northeast. The consequence is that those without access to resource sector wages—particularly Indigenous women and girls—are forced into economically precarious conditions where they experience food and housing insecurity. 
The economic insecurity experienced by many in the northeast is a concern in its own right. In addition, economic insecurity is also associated with increased risk of violence against women. The presence of a very large, young, mostly-male transient workforce adds to this risk, because young men are statistically more likely to be perpetrators of violent crime. These concerns are further compounded by patterns of drug and alcohol abuse among some resource industry workers which can fuel violence. Misogyny and racist attitudes toward Indigenous peoples, largely unaddressed in public life, have also made Indigenous women and girls more likely to be targets of violence. 
On top of all these impacts, government statistics show that Indigenous women and girls across Canada face much higher rates of violence than all other women and girls. 
Numerous studies in Canada and around the world conducted over more than three decades link resource development with factors that can lead to increased levels of gender-based violence. Governments—and crown corporations—have long known about these risks but have failed to address them. 
The Manitoba Clean Energy Commission Report, subsequent media coverage, and testimony from community members makes it clear that the harmful impacts of Manitoba Hydro operations on Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people, have been ongoing for decades and continue at the Keeyask project site. 
Manitoba Hydro has said it is adequately addressing the situation. Yet that’s not what we heard from community members. Manitoba Hydro’s motto should be “good for all Manitobans, good for human rights and the environment.” And the rhetoric should match the lived reality for Indigenous peoples, and in particular Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people.

Community members also spoke about workers ‘blowing off steam’ in their off hours, including workers going into nearby urban centres, using drugs and alcohol, and committing acts of violence against Indigenous women and girls, including sexual violence. 
The overwhelming message from everyone that Amnesty spoke with is that Manitoba Hydro projects are harming their communities, and these harms need to be addressed, and future harms prevented. 
In August 2018, a report released by the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission, a follow-up to a previous cumulative impact study conducted by the provincial government and Manitoba Hydro, described the devastating impact that decades of hydroelectric development have had on First Nations in northern Manitoba, including allegations of sexual assault and other violence by workers brought into the communities to build the dams. Everything that Amnesty heard from community members was consistent with the finds of this report. And everything that Amnesty heard was consistent with our own research in BC. 
Amnesty International carried out research in northeast BC on the intersection of gender, Indigenous rights, and energy development, leading to the 2016 release of the report, Out of Sight, Out of Mind. The report documented a pattern of human rights abuses associated with energy development—including oil and gas and hydroelectricity projects—which led to violations of the right to free, prior, and informed consent, dislocation and disconnection with the land which is so vital to sustaining culture, and harms to the physical environment. 
These projects also rely on workers from outside the region to meet labour demands. High wages for resource sector workers, and the large numbers of workers attracted to the region, have driven up local prices for essentials such as food and housing. However, not everyone has access to these wages. In fact, women’s wages in the northeast are well below the average for women in Canada. This has created sharp inequalities in the northeast. The consequence is that those without access to resource sector wages—particularly Indigenous women and girls—are forced into economically precarious conditions where they experience food and housing insecurity. 
The economic insecurity experienced by many in the northeast is a concern in its own right. In addition, economic insecurity is also associated with increased risk of violence against women. The presence of a very large, young, mostly-male transient workforce adds to this risk, because young men are statistically more likely to be perpetrators of violent crime. These concerns are further compounded by patterns of drug and alcohol abuse among some resource industry workers which can fuel violence. Misogyny and racist attitudes toward Indigenous peoples, largely unaddressed in public life, have also made Indigenous women and girls more likely to be targets of violence. 
On top of all these impacts, government statistics show that Indigenous women and girls across Canada face much higher rates of violence than all other women and girls. 
Numerous studies in Canada and around the world conducted over more than three decades link resource development with factors that can lead to increased levels of gender-based violence. Governments—and crown corporations—have long known about these risks but have failed to address them. 
The Manitoba Clean Energy Commission Report, subsequent media coverage, and testimony from community members makes it clear that the harmful impacts of Manitoba Hydro operations on Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people, have been ongoing for decades and continue at the Keeyask project site. 
Manitoba Hydro has said it is adequately addressing the situation. Yet that’s not what we heard from community members. Manitoba Hydro’s motto should be “good for all Manitobans, good for human rights and the environment.” And the rhetoric should match the lived reality for Indigenous peoples, and in particular Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people. 
Take action now calling on Manitoba Hydro to address the discrimination, harassment, and violence at Keeyask!

COVID-19 will have serious human rights impacts that are only just emerging and will exacerbate existing inequalities and human rights violations. We must continue our critical human rights work while not contributing to the transmission of this virus or the panic surrounding it. 
Here are some ways that you can take action in the time of COVID-19: 
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will not affect us all equally. The virus and state responses to it will exacerbate existing human rights violations, such as chronic underfunding of services for Indigenous communities here in Canada and the reality that many Indigenous communities in Canada remain without safe, running water. 
As news and cases of coronavirus spread around the world, so do racism and xenophobia. We all must speak and act against racist and xenophobic remarks and policies, especially as state responses escalate. While many of us will retreat into our homes to help stop the transmission of the virus, we must remember the outside world and ensure that nobody is excluded or left behind. 
The effects of this pandemic on individuals and communities will also vary based on access to essential services like healthcare and the economic ability to take time off work, limit the use of public transit, and other public health recommendations. Speak out about the need for paid sick days for everyone and universal access to healthcare. 
State responses to COVID-19 also risk violating human rights. Amnesty International will continue to monitor and report on states’ responses and human rights obligations. You can learn more here. 
Mutual aid and community care need to be at the centre of our activism. Those who are most vulnerable, including the elderly, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are precariously employed, need to be at the centre of our activism and concern. 
Physical distancing is important to limit transmission to those who are most vulnerable. Make sure you are following the advice of public health officials. 
Check in on those in your community who might be the most vulnerable. Consider starting a neighbourhood pod to check in on your neighbours and support those who are unable to leave the house.

“Two years is too long to wait. The lack of solid results in identifying those who ordered the assassination, or clarifying the circumstances of the crime, that has characterized the last year of the investigation demonstrates that human rights defenders can be killed in Brazil and that these crimes go unpunished,” said Jurema Werneck, executive director of Amnesty International Brazil. 
“Brazil needs to take this step forward and signal to the global community that it will not tolerate this or any other kind of violence against people like Marielle Franco, who mobilize to build more just societies. We know the investigation is being undertaken under strict secrecy, but transparency is not the same thing as telling secrets. Marielle’s and Anderson’s families, as well as society as a whole, have the right to know what has been done and what progress has been made in the investigation.” 
The preventative detention on 12 March 2019 of two men accused of killing Marielle and Anderson was an important step forward in the investigation, but little progress appears to have been made since then in making clear the circumstances surrounding the killings, who ordered them, and why.  
On 13 March 2019, Amnesty International and Marielle Franco’s family met with the Governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Wilson Witzel, and the State Attorney General, Eduardo Gussem, who promised to make progress and conclude the investigation of the killings, as well as guaranteeing the speed, independence and transparency of the investigation. Yet, instead of this happening, the last year was characterized by leaks of information about the case, creating the impression that the authorities were stuck inside a labyrinth. 
“We cannot avoid pleading, fighting and calling for justice for Marielle, who worked to build a better life for people. And we cannot sit still, without seeking the authorities in charge and going everywhere to ask for justice and try to find out who ordered the killing of Marielle Franco and why. We are going to go ahead with all the support we have been receiving from the world over, because today Marielle is a symbol of resistance for everyone, especially women,” said Marinete da Silva, Marielle Franco’s mother. 
Monica Benicio, the widow of the murdered councilwoman, said she has experienced “Two years of great pain and struggle. To transform the grief into a struggle was not only a way to stay alive without my partner, but also a way of understanding that fighting for justice for her murder is a way of honouring her struggle as a human rights defender to ensure that nothing like the barbaric violence against her takes place ever again. The message that the Brazilian state is sending to the world is that some lives matter more than others and that this can happen again because there is impunity for those who kill a black, LGBTI woman from an impoverished background. How many more Marielles must die in Brazil?” 
Amnesty International has requested new meetings with the Governor of Rio de Janeiro and the State Attorney General, in the hope of hearing from them about the investigative efforts undertaken over the last year, and to renew the global pressure on them to provide answers. The meetings were scheduled for Friday 13 March. Since day one of this case, 983,000 people worldwide have participated in Amnesty International’s campaign for truth and justice. 
“We want to further amplify the voices of the 983,000 people who over the last two years have contributed to Amnesty International’s efforts to pressure the authorities for justice. We want more people to understand the importance of what Marielle did for those who are most in need in Rio de Janeiro and in Brazil, as well as her commitment to defending human rights. Marielle wasn’t better than anyone else and would not have wanted special treatment, but when a human rights defender is silenced, the rights of all people are threatened,” said Jurema Werneck. 
In Amnesty International’s 2019 annual report on the state of human rights in the Americas, published on February 27, the organization noted that Latin America is the most dangerous region in the world for human rights defenders. In the last year Brazil has seen public authorities putting anti-human rights rhetoric into practice through administrative and legislative measures that have tangible effects restricting and violating people’s rights.

Christine McLean is ready to retire. After running a successful electrical business in Calgary for the last 20 years, the Kamloops, BC born and raised McLean planned to move back to BC with her husband, Eric. In 2014 they began laying plans to spend their retirement years living in what Christine describes as, “paradise” – a gorgeous log cabin on a large, treed lot perched above the stunningly beautiful Mitchell Bay on Quesnel Lake. For Christine, it is a place for the spirit to rest and the heart to soar. 
For Secwepemc and Nuxalk activist Nuskmata (Jacinda Mack), Quesnel Lake is part of her cultural heritage. Raised in the northern Secwepemc community of Xat’sull, Nuskamata spent her youth out on the land and eventually came to work for her Secwepemc community as the Natural Resources manager. Her mother taught her that for Indigenous peoples, “our economy walks on the land and swims in the waters.” She calls the relationship between her community and the land a ‘love story’.  
Quesnel Lake isn’t just any lake: it’s a deep, fjord lake nestled inside a rare interior rainforest in central British Columbia. The area is spiritually and culturally important to the Secwepemc people, one of the original peoples who have lived in the area for thousands of years. The Secwepemc name for the lake is Yuct Ne Senxiymetkwe, or “Greatest of Lakes” and the area is regarded as the birthing waters of the rivers and tributaries where wild salmon return to spawn every year.   
 
These waters are an important ‘incubator’ for wild salmon. The delicate ecosystem is also home to rainbow and cutthroat trout, some of the cleanest water in the world, and a host of wild game, medicines and berries. 
It is also an important area for tourism:  guided eco-tours, fishing and hunting are extremely popular.  Residents fondly recall amazing their visitors by dipping a cup into the middle of the lake and drinking deep of its cool, clean water.   
Most importantly, Quesnel Lake and surrounding waters provide food security and cultural identity for Secwepemc people and neighboring Nations. 
For Nuskmata, Quesnel Lake is part of her children’s bloodline. For Christine, retiring to Quesnel Lake was a dream come true. 
For both women, waking up to the news on a hot, summer day in 2014 that the tailings dam at the Mount Polley copper mine, just a few kilometers up-stream from Quesnel Lake, had broken, was the beginning of a long nightmare. 
   
Just after 1am on August 4, 2014, the Mount Polley copper mine’s tailings pond embankment crumbled, sending 25 million cubic metres of mine waste rushing downstream and into Quesnel Lake. Along the way, it scoured a 9-kilometer path down what had once been a tiny, meandering creek, cutting a deep channel through the forest and devastating a massive area of land where Hazeltine Creek empties into Quesnel Lake. Five years on, despite reclamation efforts, the area has not fully recovered.      
As terrible as the tailings dam collapse has been, residents were shocked to learn in the following months and years, that not only would the province fail to levy any fines on the company, it would not press charges, nor allow private prosecutions, nor hold the company to account. Residents say they thought the government had ‘polluter pays’ rules in place to take care of them and clean up the environment. In fact, taxpayers have carried the cost of much of the disaster clean-up. The Mount Polley disaster, says Christine, has shown the weakness of BC’s mining laws and has sent a message to mining companies that they can cause environmental and human rights harms and get away with it.  Residents say they are deeply disappointed in the BC government.  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
After the disaster, the Province of British Columbia established an expert group to study the causes of the tailings dam collapse, but the group was not tasked with assigning blame to any of the parties. However, it did make important recommendations for improving tailing dam safety at the more than 100 tailings dams in existence throughout the province. It ominously warned that BC could expect more tailings dam failures if the government did not act to step up monitoring, repairs and upgrades, and reporting of these sites.   
BC’s Auditor General documented the BC government’s poor track record of making sure mining companies comply with BC’s regulations. She recommended that the province create a compliance enforcement unit separate from the Ministry of Energy and Mines, arguing that the Ministry’s mandate of enforcing the rules while also promoting mining investment is inherently incompatible. 
For residents and Indigenous communities affected by the disaster, the scale of the reforms required to bring BC’s mining laws and regulations in line with international best practices means that their road to justice will be long.   
Both the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights and the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination called separately on Canada to hold those responsible for the disaster to account and to provide remedy to those harmed.  Yet, more than five years on, Canada has failed to act. 
To make matters worse, in 2017, the outgoing BC Liberal Party (and recipient of significant political donations from the mine operator’s parent company, Imperial Metals) granted Mount Polley Mining Corporation (MPMC) a 5-year permit to discharge filtered mine waste from the mine site into Quesnel Lake. Indigenous peoples and settler groups, like the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake, strongly opposed the company’s permit application, citing concerns about impacts on the environment, health and human rights.  Their concerns have been supported by experts.  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
In fact, a preliminary study carried out for the First Nations Health Authority documented the terrible impacts of the disaster on the mental and physical health, cultural practices and finances of Indigenous peoples in the region. It made a number of important recommendations to various levels of government to study the impacts and uphold the human rights of the 47 affected communities. Despite public opposition to the company’s discharge permit application, the permit was approved and MPMC installed two water discharge pipes from the mine site into Quesnel Lake.  
  
 
The affected communities say that granting the company permission to discharge mine waste into Quesnel Lake, after refusing to hold the company accountable, is adding insult to injury and they are calling on the province to:  
The magnificent Quesnel Lake is more than a body of water: it is a relative, a living entity, a source of nourishment, joy and a home to many species. It must be protected and cherished in its own right.   
For Christine McLean, the right to a healthy environment for her family, friends, neighbors and the Indigenous Nations that have relied on Quesnel Lake and its tributaries for generations, is paramount. That is why she is personally mounting an appeal of the company’s water discharge permit at the BC Environmental Appeal Board in 2020. We encourage Amnesty members and supporters to support her appeal.   
For Nuskmata and her family, they will never stop speaking out for justice for Quesnel Lake and for the rights of Indigenous peoples to be upheld and respected by government and companies. As she told the UN Working Group on Business and Human Rights experts panel, “We call on Canada to respect our Indigenous Laws and our rights. This is a crisis situation for our people and our lands. We are in crisis, as are the salmon, the moose, and the water for our children. I want to be able to look my children and grandchildren in the eye and to say that I did all I could to protect the land and the water.”   
This World Water Day, spare a thought for the magnificent Quesnel Lake and those who rely on its health and well-being. Please support area residents, Indigenous communities and the Concerned Citizens of Quesnel Lake by urging the Province of British Columbia to listen to their voices and pull the pipes from Quesnel Lake!

March 5, 2020 
Dear Prime Minister and Premiers, 
RE: Urgent need to respond to violence and hate directed at human rights defenders in Canada 
We are writing this Open Letter, in advance of next week’s First Ministers’ Meeting, to urge that you individually and collectively commit to measures that will ensure that human rights defenders across Canada, particularly women and Indigenous human rights defenders working on issues related to territory, land and the environment, are recognised for their human rights work and able to carry out that vital work free from threats and violence, in a safe and enabling environment. 
Last month, Albertans, Canadians and people around the world were appalled when a sticker associated with an Alberta-based company, X-Site Energy Services, depicting a drawing of global climate crisis activist Greta Thunberg in a manner suggestive of her being sexually assaulted, came to light. While there have been many expressions of dismay and disgust about this particular sticker, by politicians, oil industry officials, journalists, activists and others, it is imperative to recognize and acknowledge that this is not a unique or singular incident. It is reflective of a wider concern for which much more serious and concerted action is urgently needed. 
After the existence of the sticker came to the attention of and then was made public by a concerned member of the public, Michelle Narang, on February 26th, it was rightfully widely condemned.  On February 27th, Alberta’s Minister of Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women, Leela Aheer stated that the image was “completely deplorable, unacceptable and degrading.”  She urged that “whoever is responsible should be ashamed and apologize immediately.”[1] That same day Jason Kenney called the image “odious”, also on Twitter.[2]   
In a tweet on February 29th Greta Thunberg responded by stating: “They are starting to get more and more desperate… This shows that we’re winning.”[3] X-Site Energy Services published an apology on its website on March 2nd, saying that the sticker “does not reflect the values” of the company and that they are “taking action to condemn this image and its publication.”[4] There has also been condemnation of the sticker in the House of Commons.[5] At the same time, the RCMP has reportedly stated that they have investigated the image and determined that it does not “meet the threshold of a criminal matter.”[6]   
Those responses cannot in any way be the end of the matter. With respect to this particular incident, so much remains unexplained and unclarified about the approval, production and circulation of the sticker. Premier Kenney, we expect that your government will take steps to investigate further. And we look to all of your governments to adopt appropriate measures to end and prevent further threats and smear campaigns against human rights defenders.  
In our earlier Open Letter sent to Premier Kenney on September 10, 2019 we particularly urged the government of Alberta to “hold all actors involved in the province’s oil and gas industry – including companies, industry associations and advocacy groups supportive of the industry – accountable for their human rights responsibilities, in particular respecting the rights and safety of human rights defenders, Indigenous peoples and persons of all genders.”[7] This is an important opportunity to do so. 
But the concerns that this sticker has brought to light are not limited to the province of Alberta, Greta Thunberg, X-Site Energy Services or merely to companies in the oil and gas industry.  This is in fact reflective of a deeply troubling pattern of increasing levels of threats and attacks against human rights defenders worldwide. Notably, Amnesty International, UN officials and numerous human rights organizations have documented that amidst rapidly increasing danger for human rights defenders around the world in recent years, defenders who raise concerns related to territory, land and the environment face even greater risk, particularly in our hemisphere, the Americas. The nature and levels of threats and attacks against women and Indigenous human rights defenders is particularly disturbing. 
By no means is Canada immune from these disturbing developments. That is why, in our September 10, 2019 Open Letter to Premier Kenney, we noted that, 
“Amnesty International is aware of women human rights defenders in Canada who have received explicit and disturbing threats of violence, including sexual violence. For instance, women involved in anti-pipeline campaigns – many of them Indigenous women – have been the target of online intimidation by social media campaigns, and many have reported receiving threats, including threats of violence and sexual violence. This hostility is particularly concerning in light of the well-documented human rights concerns related to online harassment and abuse, as well as the disproportional levels of violence faced by Indigenous women in Canada. Research by Amnesty International and others demonstrates the harmful, unintended consequences of energy development on Indigenous women and girls.”[8] 
In recent weeks, with rising tensions and backlash to blockades and solidarity protests across the country associated with the construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline in the territory of the Wet’suwet’en people in British Columbia, there have been many reports[9] of Indigenous people being subjected to increased levels of hateful and racist taunts and threats, including threats of sexual violence against Indigenous women. 
It is against that very disturbing backdrop that the implications of this recent sticker associating Greta Thunberg with a suggestion of sexual assault must be understood.  That is why we are writing to you Prime Minister Trudeau, and to all Premiers across the country. We are looking to you to demonstrate leadership at this time by: 
We would welcome an opportunity to meet with you to discuss Amnesty International’s concerns and recommendations further.

An Amnesty International investigation has found that Sudan’s crackdown on protests against the government of deposed President Omar al-Bashir in 2018 and 2019 involved all branches of the country’s security forces and revealed new evidence about how protesters were killed. 
In a new report, “They descended on us like rain”, the organization documents how the police, the National Intelligence Security Service (NISS) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) at different times led deadly assaults on protesters. 
“During our research many victims and their families clearly pinpointed specific arms of the security forces that ruthlessly attacked protesters. We have documented evidence of the specific killings and which of the security forces were involved,” said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty International’s Director for East and Southern Africa. 
“We are urging Sudan’s transitional authorities to hold thorough, effective and independent investigations into all protester killings and other human rights violations. The investigations must cover all phases of the protests, particularly from mid-December 2018 to 2 June 2019. Every victim must get justice.” 
The security forces used excessive force to inflict maximum harm on protesters committing egregious human rights violations, including arbitrary mass detention of thousands of people, torture and other ill-treatment. They also invaded hospitals, arrested and beat medical staff and patients. 
The report also documents gruesome incidents and testimonies of rape and sexually assault of female protestors. 
NISS crackdowns  
The NISS, renamed the General Intelligence Services (GIS) in July 2019, and its shadowy armed operational units were responsible for the first lethal crackdowns on protesters in December 2018 and led attacks on protestors until April 2019 when Omar al-Bashir was deposed. 
Its armed operation unit in Atbara ‘Hyaṯ Alamlyat’, shot at protesters on 20 December 2018 resulting in the first deaths of the Sudan protests – three people in Atbara, the city where the Sudanese protests were sparked off by the sky-rocketing price of bread. 
“This deadly crackdown in Atbara, which despite its long history in trade unionism and resistance had never witnessed protester killings, threw the city into a state of shock and mourning,” said Deprose Muchena. 
The first victim Tariq Ahmed, an engineering student in his early 20s at the Nile Valley University, was shot in the chest and died an hour later in hospital. The second victim, 27-year-old Isam Ali Hussein, a labourer, was shot in the head, also dying an hour later in hospital. The third victim, Mariam Ahmed Abdalla, was shot dead inside her house. 
“Tariq and all other people who were killed by NISS officers were only exercising their rights to freedom of assembly and their families must get justice,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Amnesty International documented 77 protestors killed between mid-December 2018 and 11 April 2019, while the government said 31 had been killed. 
Enter the RSF 
After Al-Bashir was deposed by the military, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was deployed to help disperse protesters. 
On 3 June, RSF officers led a deadly raid on peaceful protesters at the sit-in area outside the military headquarters in Khartoum in which at least 100 people were killed. Those who survived the attack identified not only RSF officers, but also NISS officers and the police as having been involved in the massacre. 
On 13 June, Lieutenant General Shams al-Deen al-Kabashi, spokesperson of the Transitional Military Council which was running the country at the time, publicly admitted that the Council had ordered the dispersal of protestors on 3 June. 
“The unprovoked attack on protesters filled with hope and peacefully looking forward to a quick resolution of the political crisis was a despicable violation of the Sudanese people rights. All those found responsible, including through command responsibility, must be brought to justice through fair trials, but without resorting to the death penalty,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Conflicting data on fatalities 
Based on data from various credible sources, including the Committee of the Families of the Martyrs of the December 2018 Revolution, Amnesty International estimates that at least 100 people were killed, and more than 700 others injured in the 3 June attack. 
Hundreds of protesters were also arrested, many of whom were subsequently released. At least 20 are still missing, according to Fadia Khalaf, founder of the Initiative for Missing People. 
“We were flabbergasted to discover that not one government agency could precisely and authoritatively say how many people were killed in the protester crackdowns. All agencies had widely divergent data for the numbers of people killed on 3 June 2019,” said Deprose Muchena. 
Sudan’s National Human Rights Commission reported 36 killed – 15 at the sit-in area and 21 outside the area, the Ministry of Health reported 46, while the Attorney-General reported that 87 protestors were killed on 3 June. 
Non-government sources such as the Legitimate Sudan Doctors Syndicate (LSDS) reported 50 killed while the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (CCSD) reported 127 killed. 
“The Sudanese authorities must spare no effort to properly document and verify the true extent of atrocities committed, including by among other things, involving the affected families,” said Deprose Muchena.

It’s the story of life-changing impacts on the local ecology and on communities who rely on the river for their survival. It’s also the story of their courageous struggle to defend environmental human rights amid deadly attack. Most of all, it’s a story that cries out for attention in both Canada and Colombia in these times of climate emergency. 
The massive HidroItuango dam cuts across the Cauca River in a region of Colombia hard hit by decades of armed conflict and horrendous human rights violations.  
 
The dam was promoted as a feat of engineering that would generate nearly a fifth of Colombia’s energy needs. 
Export Development Canada – a crown corporation that claims all its transactions are “environmentally and socially responsible” – approved millions of dollars in loans in 2016 to Empresas Públicas de Medellin (EPM), the company building the dam. 
However, warnings were sounded about the HidroItuango dam long before Export Development Canada decided to provide financing. 
In 2012, anthropologist Jorge Eliécer David Higuita published Chronicles of an imminent ethnocide in the Cauca River Canyon, an award-winning book that concluded the hydro project was “disastrous” for local communities, including the Indigenous Nutabes. 
Families and communities dependent on the Cauca River for fishing or other livelihoods began to organize in a Movement called Ríos Vivos (Spanish for “living rivers”) and speak out against environmental impacts and destruction of ancestral ways of living. They also reported forced evictions, increased militarization and worsening violence. 
 
In September 2013, the body of Ríos Vivos community leader Nelson Giraldo was found with bullet wounds and his throat cut. Amnesty International issued an Urgent Action, expressing fear for the safety of other members of Ríos Vivos and their families. “Those opposing the development of HidroItuango have repeatedly been labelled as guerrilla fighters by the security forces”, Amnesty’s appeal said, warning that that this put members of Ríos Vivos at risk of being killed or made to disappear. 
 
Between 2013 and March 2018 alone, Ríos Vivos reported more than 150 attacks by state security forces, paramilitary groups and unknown perpetrators during evictions and peaceful protests. 
There have been other threats to rights and safety. 
According to the Centre for International Environmental Law, HidroItuango flooded 4,500 hectares without first removing the area’s vegetation, generating large quantities of methane, a greenhouse gas. This flooding was undertaken even before the dam structure itself was completed and without informing, relocating or compensating communities in the impacted area. 
These impacts were compounded in May 2018, when a water diversion tunnel – built over a year before the company obtained the required licence from environmental authorities – became obstructed. 
“The tunnel’s blockage and subsequent collapse would cause the Hidroituango dam to nearly burst, endangering tens of thousands of people,” reports Amnesty International’s NGO partner Above Ground in a case study entitled EPM’s Disastrous Dam. 
The resulting floods and landslides destroyed homes and forced a chaotic emergency evacuation of thousands of people. 
 
But the crisis did not end there. Amid concerns over the integrity of the dam’s structure, EPM closed two floodgates. This choked off 80% of the Cauca River’s flow, according to Above Ground, killing tens of thousands of fish. 
 
The river defenders of Ríos Vivos say responsibility for these and other impacts of the dam lies not only with the company behind the project but also with financial institutions outside Colombia that provided funding.  
Ríos Vivos has successfully pressed the Inter-American Development Bank to investigate its funding of HidroItuango, citing inadequate environmental impact assessment, community participation and access to information. 
Ríos Vivos spokesperson Isabel Zuleta (second from left below), raised the same concerns in a meeting with executives of Export Development Canada in Ottawa last November, accompanied by Amnesty International Canada, Above Ground, the Americas Policy Group and the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
 
“Without foreign money, HidroItuango would not have been possible,” Ms. Zuleta said. “Responsibility for the social and environmental harm it has caused, the exacerbation of violent conflict and the ongoing impact on our lives therefore rests with the investors as well. Six leaders of Ríos Vivos have been assassinated. Most of us have been threatened with death unless we stop speaking up. It’s a very difficult situation.” 
Back in Colombia, Isabel Zuleta remains at grave risk. One anonymous message she received threatened that she would be shot in the head. 
Isabel Zuleta courageously refuses to be silenced. Despite ever-present danger, she finds hope in the growing movement of people in Canada who are also determined to raise their voices for environmental human rights and those who defend them in Colombia. 
 
“I’m absolutely sure I would not be alive today were it not for solidarity,” Isabel told Amnesty. “Every message of concern sent, every urgent action appeal, you can’t imagine how important that is for those of us who face violence in our territories. I’m enormously thankful for the support but I also urge you to press for action to ensure that money from Canada is not invested in projects that cause harm in my country. So much damage and suffering has resulted from the HidroItuango dam. We cannot allow this story to be repeated.”

Hearings on the case were held last week. Amnesty’s Julia Hall was there as an observer. 
In this context, publication of disclosed documents mirrors the work of investigative journalists. Punishing this kind of activity can have a chilling effect on the right to freedom of expression, leading journalists to self-censor from fear of prosecution. 
Amnesty International strongly opposes any possibility of Julian Assange being extradited or sent in any other manner to the USA. Such a transfer brings with it the risk of serious human rights violations including possible detention conditions that would amount to torture and other ill-treatment (such as prolonged solitary confinement. Additionally, the fact that he was the target of a negative public campaign by US officials at the highest levels undermines his right to be presumed innocent and puts him at risk of an unfair trial. 
International human rights law and standards forbid the transfer of an individual to another country where there is a real risk they would face serious human rights violations.

In view of the disturbing global trend of misogynist messages currently disseminated by some political and religious leaders, and the increase in oppressive and sexist policies and practices, women around the world are joining forces to consolidate and protect the rights and freedoms achieved to date. The women’s movement seeks to ensure that, far from restricting rights, further progress is made in combating the inequalities persisting in many corners of the planet. Millions of women are challenging discourses that demonize them and attempt to jeopardise the feminist movement, as well as advocates of women’s rights, gender equality and sex education. 
A discourse defending traditional values and a specific definition of the family is gaining ground and promoting an agenda that denies equality as a women’s right, the need to implement specific policies to address gender violence, their right to make decisions with regard to their bodies and to their sexual and reproductive health. This reactionary standpoint is also targeting defenders and activists for being who they are and for doing the work they do. It is a discourse that runs counter to the international agreements already recognised by the United Nations at the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, which this year celebrates its 25th anniversary, and which have been ratified by a large number of countries. 
“We are concerned that this type of discourse is part of the political agenda in what appears to be a global strategy against women’s rights. It is not by chance that buses with the same messages against diversity, or denying the existence of violence against women, have made appearances in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Chile, Colombia or Kenya. That is why women are reacting more energetically than ever, the feminist movement is becoming stronger and the younger generations are becoming increasingly involved in the struggle,” said Ana Rebollar, deputy director of Amnesty International Spain. 
Violence against anonymous women 
Women suffer violence due to the very fact of being women. It exists in every country. In Spain, from 1 January 2003 to 2 March 2020, 1,046 women were killed by their partners or former partners. After years of political consensus to take specific measures against a scourge that increasingly affects younger women, some political parties are attempting to conceal this type of violence within the broader concept of domestic violence that camouflages and denies the existence of the structural inequality that is at the root of violence against women. This is despite the international consensus on the existence of specific violence based upon discrimination against women (1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, ratified by 189 countries). 
In Mexico, where 10 women are killed every day, women have taken to the streets to protest against this violence, which is not considered from a gender perspective by the Attorney General’s office, and in view of the images coming to light of brutally murdered women. Ninety percent of the cases of femicide go unpunished in Mexico. 
Veto on equal education 
However, one of the main sticking points in different parts of the world is education on equality, diversity, and addressing gender-based violence. With the argument that no one can make this kind of decision in relation to their own children, countries such as Paraguay and Brazil prohibit sexual and reproductive education, as well as material relating to gender equality and non-discrimination. A similar law is currently awaiting approval in the Polish Parliament that could control this type of education. Countries such as Spain are making progress in this direction in some regional autonomies. 
“The freedom of families cannot outweigh the right of children and adolescents to receive tools enabling them to identify and combat situations of discrimination in their lives; to know and live freely and without fearing their own identity; and to acquire knowledge to deal with their sexuality whilst freely deciding about their own bodies”. 
The president of Paraguay promised to burn books with this type of content, Brazil supported sexual abstinence campaigns, and Poland might punish those who teach this kind of content to children under 18 with up to three years in prison. However, societies are clearly responding; Paraguayan students are mobilizing to demand comprehensive sex education from their government; in countries like Peru, pressure from civil society, including Amnesty International, has led the Supreme Court to bring a lawsuit against the unjustified gender focus in students’ academic content. 
Control over women’s bodies 
While attempts are made to limit sexual and reproductive health education for minors, even in countries with high rates of teenage pregnancy, laws still exist that can put women in prison for up to 10 years, as is the case in Honduras, or even for decades in countries such as El Salvador. This happened to Evelyn Hernandez, sentenced to 30 years in prison for a miscarriage; despite being found innocent in a court of law, the prosecution has appealed the sentence. 
Organizations such as Open Democracy have reported that in some countries, including Mexico, Ecuador or Costa Rica, where voluntary termination of pregnancy is regulated in some cases, conservative groups are providing “false and distorted” information to women who attempt to terminate their pregnancies. They intimidate them with false claims of greater cancer risk, claiming that their partners will become gay, or that they are more likely to physically abuse other children. 
In view of this, in countries such as Slovakia, thanks to social pressure, Parliament voted against forcing women to see ultrasound scans of the foetus before terminating the pregnancy. This measure constituted an attempt to deter the reproductive rights of the women, undermining their privacy and autonomy. 
Harassment of activists and politicians 
Women’s rights defenders in particular are being victimised by this sexist trend. Once again, in all parts of the world, those who raise their voices continue to be subjected to aggression, threats, intimidation, criminalization, and even murder. They are subjected to smear campaigns, they are insulted and their lifestyles and even the way they dress are questioned. 
Amnesty International continues to denounce cases such as: Ebtisam El Saegh of Salam for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain, who was sexually assaulted and brutally beaten for her human rights work. In Iran, Yasaman Aryani and her mother Monireh Arabshahi were sentenced to 9 years and 7 months in prison for distributing flowers to other women and promoting the non-obligatory use of the veil. The Iranian lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh, who defended the rights of these women, was sentenced to 38 years in prison and 148 lashes. They were all accused, among other things, of “disturbing public order”, “committing a sinful act by appearing in public without a hijab”, and even “inciting corruption and prostitution”. 
Activists such as Carola Rackete, the captain of the Sea-Watch 3, after rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean, was insulted by the Italian Minister of the Interior, and acts of sexual violence against her were encouraged within different political and social spheres. Moreover, she was attacked for being a woman and for her appearance. A similar fate befell 14 Polish women activists, who unfurled an anti-fascist banner during a demonstration in which people displayed racist and fascist symbols. They were called “bitches”, “left-wing scoundrels”, “whores” and were assaulted. They were finally tried for obstructing a peaceful demonstration; however, the mobilization of citizens secured their acquittal. 
Women who participated in the Green March for the legalization of abortion in Argentina were also targeted and harassed on social media. One in three women suffered violence on social media and were accused of “murdering”, “baby killing” and of being “feminazis”. In India, one in five women parliamentarians and politicians are attacked for their work; they suffer sexist remarks in reference to their appearance, their marital status, whether or not they have children, and regarding their ethnic and religious background. 
The strength of the feminist movement 
Nonetheless, the pressure from women’s movements cannot be underestimated. When countries like Saudi Arabia wish to whitewash their image, tainted by reports of human rights violations, they do so by publicizing advances in women’s rights, such as being able to drive, despite the continued imprisonment of activists such as Loujain al-Hathloul, who was jailed in May 2018 for posting a video of her driving and claiming this right for the women of her country. 
The Chilean women’s anthem against sexual assault, A Rapist in Your Path, has been sung on all five continents, and has even reached parliaments, like in Turkey, where female members of the secular opposition sang it in protest against the arrest of seven women who chanted this anthem in a mobilization in the streets of Istanbul. According to Amnesty International’s analysis, only 9 out of 31 European countries have laws that define rape on the basis of absence of consent. But determined women, survivors and activists have been bringing about change country by country. In 2018 alone, Iceland and Sweden became the seventh and eighth countries in Europe to adopt new legislation in line with international law and standards, followed by Greece in 2019.  Spain could become the 10th country in Europe to clearly define rape as sex without consent, following the recent announcement by the government of a new bill on comprehensive responses to sexual violence. 
Amnesty International will participate in the mobilizations on 8th March, International Women’s Day, in different countries around the world, with the intention of showing more than ever our support for women’s movements, and of echoing their voices in all their diversity and in the fight for recognition of all their rights.

“Missing truth, missing justice” examines the insurmountable defects of the Hong Kong police’s accountability mechanisms. The briefing sets out the need for establishing an independent commission of inquiry to investigate widespread human rights violations that occurred during the mass protests which erupted last year. 
“Each passing day that the Hong Kong government stubbornly resists establishing an independent inquiry adds to the accountability vacuum and erodes public trust further,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director. 
“Hong Kong’s existing police complaint system is not fit for purpose. No institution should be trusted to investigate itself – the police is accountable to the public. 
“It is essential that the government urgently allows an impartial body to establish the full facts of the protests and make recommendations to address them.”    
The call for an independent inquiry into the police’s use of force remains one of the key demands of the Hong Kong public, and has been echoed by the United Nations. Last October, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights called for an “effective, prompt, independent and impartial investigation”. 
The Hong Kong government has nonetheless continued to resist establishing a separate investigatory mechanism, such as a commission of inquiry. Instead, it claims the existing Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) is adequate for dealing with allegations of police violence and other misconduct.  
“The mass protests that rocked Hong Kong in the latter half of 2019 are not over. The authorities may be counting on the coronavirus epidemic to extinguish the unrest, but unless they take action the demonstrations – and abuses linked to them – are eventually likely to return.” said Nicholas Bequelin. 
“The police’s use of unnecessary and excessive force with effective impunity has left the people of Hong Kong deeply frustrated. An independent inquiry is essential to establishing accountability and delivering justice for the brutality seen on the streets since last summer. Hongkongers deserve the truth.” 
In July 2019, the IPCC decided to conduct a fact-finding study into several public order events connected to the protests and invited an expert panel to take part. 
The panel stepped down in December 2019, saying the IPCC lacked the investigative powers and capabilities necessary to “begin to meet the standards citizens of Hong Kong would likely require of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights”.  
“Public trust towards the government and police has plummeted, and a commission of inquiry is a vital first step towards healing the deep wounds left by the protests. Setting up an independent commission to investigate human rights violations committed since the protests in June 2019 would be an acknowledgement by the government that something has gone wrong and that urgent attention and rectification is needed,” said Nicholas Bequelin. 
“A commission of inquiry with adequate resources and investigative powers can tackle the root causes of human rights violations on a larger scale. That means, crucially, its recommendations can prevent the same situation from reoccurring and break the cycle of violence, including that employed by some protesters.” 
Throughout the protests, Amnesty International documented an alarming pattern of reckless and indiscriminate tactics by the Hong Kong Police as they adopted a zero-tolerance approach to policing assemblies. 
Widespread human rights violations included unnecessary and excessive use of force, such as the dangerous use of rubber bullets and bean bag rounds; beating protesters who were not resisting; misuse of pepper spray and tear gas; and use of water cannons. 
Amnesty International collected several accounts of detained protesters being severely beaten in custody and suffering ill-treatment, in some cases amounting to torture. 
Strong evidence suggests that the police not only failed to de-escalate tension, but also fuelled it further through the use of unnecessary and excessive force and the persistent impunity for such behaviour.

Hilda is the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Liaison Unit Manager with Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) and she is based in Thompson, Manitoba.  MKO is a non-profit, political advocacy organization providing a collective voice on issues related to the rights of member First Nations in northern Manitoba. MKO was a Party with Standing to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. 
Amnesty International spoke with Hilda in advance of International Women’s Day 2020. 
My role at MKO is as Manager of the MMIWG Liaison Unit and our role is to support families who have experienced the loss of a loved one through homicide, have a loved one who is missing, and we also work with individuals who are survivors of violence. We also focus a lot on prevention and awareness and wellness and healing.  We also build partnerships with various organizations to further support impacted individuals who seek service from our program. 
I think the report has educated many Canadians, and I also feel that the report has really brought a lot of light to the need for immediate action in addressing many of the systemic failures and barriers for Indigenous women, girls, two-spirit, and gender diverse people. 
I think the most important thing the National Inquiry’s Final Report has done is to carry the voices of loved ones who are no longer with us and really, in sharing those stories, highlighted the need for governments to self-reflect on how they need to change their policies and legislation and allow Indigenous peoples to go forward in providing their own solutions and recognizing that they are rights holders. Moving forward, Indigenous representation needs to be at the table both in the decision-making, the planning, and the implementation phases of the 231 Calls for Justice. 
I think there is a huge opportunity for the 231 Calls for Justice to be transformative if the government takes them seriously and recognizes the need to provide adequate resourcing for the implementation of the Calls for Justice, and for all Canadians to recognize that they also have a responsibility to be part of the solution to ending the violence by taking certain calls for justice and implementing them on their own. Because we are all part of the solution of ending this genocide in Canada. 
It was critical because I don’t feel that as an Indigenous woman who is from a hydro-impacted community that Indigenous womens’ lives should come at the cost of economic activities. If there’s activities happening in our territories, there need to be mechanisms to protect us from all types of violence. We should not be experiencing violence so others can benefit economically. 
We are hopeful to hear from the government soon, as I feel the MKO MMIWG Liaison Unit would be instrumental in providing valuable information into the National Action Plan as we are on the ground working and hearing directly from those who have been impacted.   We are also rooted in community and Indigenous ways of being. 
There have been a few meetings with the Manitoba government with respect to implementing the calls for justice. They’ll be announcing a Manitoba plan soon and MKO and the Manitoba MMIWG Coalition are going to be involved in meetings related to this. I know that initially when the National Inquiry’s final report was launched we had an event in Thompson with key representatives from government and they all committed to reviewing the Calls for Justice but I haven’t heard too much since then. I think everyone is waiting to see what the federal government is doing because ultimately they hold the purse strings. 
I really believe that if governments don’t act Indigenous women and girls and two-spirit people will continue to die and experience violence at very alarming rates. It’s already been declared a national tragedy and it’s going to get worse and more communities and more families will be impacted if we don’t do something. It’s an opportune time for government to act right now. The government has talked about reconciliation and this is a path forward for that. 
My vision for Canada is that every little girl in every First Nations in Canada has a dream and is able to fulfill that dream and our communities are thriving.  We are reclaiming our roles as matriarchs and living a life we deserve as Indigenous people.

“The Moscow summit represents an opportunity for Russia and Turkey to prioritize the safety of civilians. 
“The fate of almost one million people forced from their homes now hangs in the balance as this meeting goes ahead. 
“After nine years of fighting characterized by utter disregard for civilians’ lives, new attacks in Idlib – including the ongoing targeting of schools and hospitals – is causing more untold misery to civilians, many of whom have already been forced to flee multiple times in this humanitarian horror story. 
“As a matter of priority, Russia and Turkey should pressure the Syrian government to end attacks on civilians to avoid escalating deaths and injuries and further displacement. 
“All parties to the conflict must allow civilians wishing to flee the fighting to do so by granting them safe passage, and they must facilitate access of humanitarian organizations to civilians who are unable to leave.” 
Background 
For years, civilians in Idlib have been enduring the ordeal of a prolonged siege and unlawful attacks. Compounding the already dire humanitarian situation is the fact that many local and international organizations have had to suspend aid due to the ongoing attacks. 
Today, millions in Idlib suffer from limited access to basic services such as health care, education and clean water. Amnesty International is calling on all parties to the conflict to end unlawful attacks, and allow access for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid to all those in need at all times. 
The international community must act immediately and pressure all sides to respect international humanitarian law to avoid further humanitarian catastrophe in Idlib.

Police have summoned at least 20 human rights defenders and political activists to give statements or undergo questioning later today. Among them is lawyer Fadiah Nadwa Fikri, one of the protest organizers. She was already questioned on 3 March and was forced to allow the police access to her Twitter account. 
“Police summons in response to peaceful protests are a return to Malaysia’s authoritarian past,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director. 
“This new government must not reverse human rights progress achieved over the last two years. These investigations are baseless and must be dropped – Malaysian people in the country must be allowed to come together and demonstrate peacefully.” 
Following a week of political confusion, on 29 February the King appointed Muhyiddin Yassin, a former Home Minister, as the country’s new Prime Minister. It followed days of uncertainty after the country’s previous leader, Mahathir Mohamad, resigned from the post after splits emerged within the Pakatan Harapan coalition he headed up. 
Yassin was appointed after he received support from the longtime ruling party, UMNO, who were defeated at the polls in 2018. The move sparked outcry from those who considered his appointment to be a denial of the 2018 election results, which saw the reformist Pakatan Harapan bloc coming into office. 
An assembly organized via social media to protest against the appointment of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin was held on 29 February 2020 in Dataran Merdeka, Kuala Lumpur. Another demonstration was held in front of a shopping centre in downtown Kuala Lumpur the following day. 
Fadiah Nadwa Fikri was initially singled out by the police as the organizer of the protests, before others were called in for questioning. She is currently being investigated under the Sedition Act and Communications and Multimedia Act. 
All other activists summoned for questioning are understood to have taken the stage at last weekend’s protests, which is why they are believed to have been targeted by the authorities. 
The Sedition Act has long been used to target human rights defenders, political activists and other critics who speak out against those in power in Malaysia. It provides for severe criminal penalties against those found guilty, including up to three years in jail, a heavy fine, or both. 
“Malaysia’s new government must urgently reassure the public that it will respect and protect the human rights of all people in Malaysia – including government critics,” said Nicholas Bequelin. 
“Changes in government must not stop vital human rights reforms, including the abolition of repressive laws such as the Sedition Act.” 
Background 
Malaysian authorities have repeatedly used laws such as the Penal Code, the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) and the Sedition Act to target peaceful protestors. 
The Sedition Act criminalizes a wide array of acts, including those “with a tendency to excite disaffection against any Ruler or government” or to “question any matter” protected by Malaysia’s Constitution. Those found guilty can face three years in jail or be fined up to MYR 5,000 (approximately USD 1,570). 
The law does not comply with international human rights law, and violates the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, which are enshrined in Article 19 and 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and also guaranteed in the Malaysian Constitution. 
Fadiah Nadwa Fikri is being investigated under Section 4(1)(a) of the Sedition Act which defines the offence of attempt to commit seditious acts, and Section 233(1)(a) of the Communications and Multimedia Act which defines the offence of improper use of network facilities in order to harass another person.

At least 22 of the children were shot dead by Iranian security forces unlawfully firing live ammunition at unarmed protesters and bystanders, according to the findings. 
The children killed include 22 boys, aged between 12 and 17, and a girl reportedly aged between eight and 12. Details of their deaths are included in a new Amnesty International briefing, ‘They shot our children’ – Killings of minors in Iran’s November 2019 protests. 
“In recent months an increasingly gruesome picture has emerged of the extent to which Iranian security forces unlawfully used lethal force to crush last year’s nationwide protests. However, it is still devastating to learn that the number of children who fell victim to this brutality is so shockingly high,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. 
“There must be independent and impartial investigations into these killings, and those suspected of ordering and carrying them out must be prosecuted in fair trials.” 
Amnesty International has gathered evidence from videos and photographs, as well as death and burial certificates, accounts from eyewitnesses and victims’ relatives, friends and acquaintances on the ground, and information gathered from human rights activists and journalists. 
In 10 cases, Amnesty International learned from the description of injuries on the death or burial certificates it reviewed, or information from credible sources, that the deaths occurred as a result of gunshots to the head or torso – indicating that the security forces were shooting to kill. 
In two of the cases, burial certificates set out in detail the devastating impact on the children’s bodies. One cited injuries including bleeding, a crushed brain and a shattered skull. The other indicated that the cause of the death was extensive internal bleeding, and a pierced heart and lung. 
In one child’s case, there are conflicting reports on the cause of death, with one referring to fatal head injuries sustained by beatings by security forces and another referring to the firing of metal pellets at the victim’s face from a close distance. 
Twelve of the 23 deaths recorded by Amnesty International took place on 16 November, a further eight on 17 November, and three on 18 November. The protests started on 15 November. 
The 23 children are recorded as having been killed in 13 cities in six provinces across the country (Esfahan, Fars, Kermanshah, Khuzestan, Kurdistan and Tehran), reflecting the widespread nature of the bloody crackdown. 
“The fact that the vast majority of the children’s deaths took place over just two days is further evidence that Iranian security forces went on a killing spree to quash dissent at any cost,” said Philip Luther. 
“As the Iranian authorities have refused to open independent, impartial and effective investigations, it is imperative that member states of the UN Human Rights Council mandate an inquiry into the killings of protesters and bystanders, including these children, in the November protests.” 
On 25 February, Amnesty International wrote to Iran’s Minister of Interior Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli to provide him with the list of the names of the 23 children recorded as killed, along with their ages and places of death, and to seek the authorities’ comments on the circumstances of their death. As of 3 March, the organization had received no response. 
State cover-up and harassment 
Amnesty International spoke to relatives of some the children killed who described being subjected to harassment and intimidation, including surveillance and interrogations by intelligence and security officials. At least one family received veiled death threats against their surviving children, and were warned that “something horrible” would also happen to them if they spoke out. 
This corresponds with a broader issue where families of those killed in protests are being intimidated by the state from talking openly about their deaths. Most have reported being forced to sign undertakings that they would not speak to the media, and observe restrictions on how they commemorate their loved ones in order to be able to receive their bodies. In many cases, security and intelligence officials have placed the families under surveillance, and attended their funeral and memorial ceremonies in order to ensure that the restrictions are observed. 
Families of children killed also reported being forced to bury them quickly in the presence of security and intelligence officials, thereby preventing them from seeking an independent autopsy. Such conduct appears aimed at suppressing incriminating evidence. 
In general, Amnesty International’s research has found that the families of those killed in protests have been consistently excluded from autopsies undertaken by the state forensic institute and denied access to information on the circumstances of their deaths, including details of the ammunition that killed them and the weapon that fired it. 
In some cases, officials washed and prepared the bodies of victims for burial without notifying their families and then handed them the bodies, wrapped in shrouds, just minutes before the scheduled burial. Amnesty International understands that in these cases, security and intelligence officials generally sought to prevent families from pulling back the shrouds to see the bodies of their loved ones. As a result, some families say they were not able to see the impact of injuries. 
In other cases, authorities have also refused to hand over the belongings of the victims to their relatives, including their phones, raising suspicions that they worried these contained evidence of unlawful actions by the state. 
“As if the loss of their loved ones was not cruel enough an experience to bear, families of children killed during the protests are facing a ruthless campaign of harassment to intimidate them from speaking out,” said Philip Luther. 
“The authorities also seem to be desperate to prevent bereaved relatives finding out the full truth about the killings, and getting hold of evidence that would incriminate those responsible. This bears all the hallmarks of a state cover-up.” 
Background 
Protests erupted in Iran on 15 November 2019 following a sudden government announcement about a fuel price hike. According to credible reports compiled by Amnesty International, at least 304 people were killed and thousands injured between 15 and 18 November as authorities crushed the protests using lethal force. During and following the protests, the Iranian authorities arbitrarily detained thousands of detainees and subjected some to enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment.

For some, the Women’s March represented an opportunity to demonstrate on a large-scale their rejection of the plethora of misogynistic comments and actions made by the 45th President of the United States. However, for others, particularly Black, Indigenous, transgender, non-binary and women of colour, the Women’s March marked yet another instance of toxic white feminism. The lack of intersectionality has rightfully created cause for concern. As we approach International Women’s Day on March 8, two members of Amnesty’s National Youth Action and Advisory Committee (NYAAC) reflect on their participation in the Women’s March. 
“Attending the Women’s March in 2017, there was a strong feeling of solidarity and unity that I think was shared by many of those participating. It was an undeniably powerful movement and a historical event that I am glad to have been a part of. As a woman of colour, it was especially important to me to see members of other minority groups marching alongside me and being given a platform to use their voices. At the 2018 Women’s March in Montreal, I heard speeches from members of Indigenous, racialized, and LGBTQ groups. I saw signs that highlighted feminism’s intersectionality with other issues, such as mental health, ableism, religion, asylum-seeking, and sexual health. I can only speak for myself, but the Women’s March has always been a day where I am hopeful, a day where I believe that yes, we’re all standing here together against a patriarchal system. It’s the day after the March where I can’t help but think, no, that’s not enough. While there’s obviously power in the numbers and strength in the momentum that the March is able to generate, the reality is that once it is over, most women go back to live in that patriarchal system which favours the white, upper-class, cis-women that often reinforce it.  
I can see why some women, like myself, from racialized and other minority groups may feel reluctant to participate in the Women’s March. Because while that rush of empowerment is great, you recognize that “woman” does not mean the same thing for everyone there. There are those with privilege who can come out and show solidarity, but most of the time will go on to promote their own version of feminism that excludes women of other identities. Meanwhile, historically marginalized women will continue to face microaggressions and systemic violence in their daily lives. For the Women’s March to truly be an inclusive, welcoming, and safe space for all, there needs to be more than just one day of solidarity. White, cis, historically privileged women need to accept and act on the fact that the feminist movement does not imply gender alone, and this needs to be felt all other 364 days of the year.” – Maha Asad 
“As a white woman, I have always seen myself being represented in the feminist movement. This is not something that can be said by my sisters internationally, and quite frankly, I have a problem with it. I personally attended the march against Donald Trump in 2019 in Washington D.C., this was an iconic year for the march for many reasons. However, it was also eye-opening for me as most of the people I was marching alongside looked like me. 
In my head, this was for one of two reasons; these were the women who felt welcome in the space or, they were the women who felt safe showing up. Either way, this is a problem that I feel needs to be addressed. Talking with other womxn and folks at the march representing a plethora of different organizations with heavily varying mission statements, it became quickly apparent to me that it was difficult to identify an organization that accepted all womxn identifying folks in their movement. Often, trans women and sex workers were left out of the group and conversations – these were often run by white women. White women have and continue to control the narrative, yet, they are far from the ones who are harmed most by misogyny and the patriarchy at this time. It is time for those who have been left out of critical discourses for so long to be able to take ownership of the feminist movement and shape it to fit their needs, and have white women be the allies, rather than the other way around.” – Cass DeFreitas

“By failing to take this historic opportunity to move towards the decriminalization of abortion in Colombia, the Constitutional Court has turned its back on women and their struggle to end the cycle of violence and the control mechanisms of which they have been the victims. Amnesty International regrets the Court’s decision to continue restricting women’s sexual and reproductive rights instead of setting a positive example for the region,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas Director at Amnesty International.
A 2006 ruling by the Constitutional Court (C-355/06) decriminalized abortion in cases where the pregnancy poses a threat to the health or life of the woman, when a serious malformation means that the foetus is not viable and when the pregnancy is the result of rape. This week, the Constitutional Court could have made a ruling in a case that would have represented a further step towards decriminalizing abortion, but it chose not to do so.
In many of its judgments the Constitutional Court has recognized that the right to abortion services forms part of the sexual and reproductive rights guaranteed in Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Colombia is party to this treaty, which it signed in 1980 and ratified in 1982, and therefore has an obligation to comply with its provisions. 
The Constitutional Court has also recognized that the voluntary termination of pregnancy is closely linked to women’s right to health, set out in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Colombia is a party to this treaty, which it signed in 1966 and ratified in 1969, and therefore must not breach the obligations undertaken. 
Amnesty International calls on Colombia to fulfil its human rights obligations, which have been reflected not only in Colombian jurisprudence but also at the constitutional level.

“We sincerely hope reports of coronavirus in Evin and other prisons in Iran are untrue, but this should be a wake-up call to the Iranian authorities to improve conditions of detention and access to health care for everyone in detention. 
“We renew our call to immediately and unconditionally release Nazanin, a prisoner of conscience who shouldn’t even be behind bars at all.
“Nazanin’s health has already suffered because of her mistreatment in prison, where she has previously been denied vital medical care. From numerous past cases, we know the Iranian authorities will sometimes use the denial of medical treatment as an extra layer of punishment for prisoners of conscience, so there are already heightened fears for Nazanin.
“The risk of coronavirus infecting prisoners in Iran adds urgency to the need to improve conditions of detention. Prisoners are usually held in overcrowded, unsanitary and poorly-ventilated conditions. This, combined with the denial of adequate medical care, often exacerbates prisoners’ pre-existing medical problems or contributes to new ones, sometimes causing irreparable damage to their health.
“Though it remains unconfirmed, the slightest possibility of prisoners being exposed to the coronavirus in Evin Prison raises grave concerns and is a chilling prospect for Nazanin and other prisoners, including jailed human rights defenders.”
Grossly unfair trial and ongoing health concerns
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 41, a British-Iranian dual-national charity worker, was arrested at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport on 3 April 2016 prior to boarding a plane back to the UK after a regular family visit to the country with her infant daughter Gabriella. After being detained in solitary confinement without access to a lawyer, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group” in a grossly unfair trial by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran.
Zaghari-Ratcliffe is presently serving a five-year jail sentence in Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison. Since being jailed, she has suffered a serious decline in her physical and mental health, something her husband has repeatedly drawn attention to during a high-profile campaign on his wife’s behalf. Her requests for periods of temporary release – for which she is eligible – have been met on only one occasion (August 2018), followed three days later by a return to jail. Amnesty described her return to jail on 26 August as a “crushing disappointment”. She is suffering from numerous health problems – including severe arm, neck and back pain – and there have been serious concerns over her mental health. 
Amnesty has designated Zaghari-Ratcliffe a prisoner of conscience targeted solely for the peaceful exercise of her rights to freedom of expression and association. Amnesty has repeatedly called on the Iranian authorities to release her immediately and unconditionally.

Yesterday, following a meeting...","The inhumane measures which the Greek authorities are taking to prevent people from entering the country are an appalling betrayal of Greece’s human rights responsibilities and will put the lives of people fleeing violence at risk, Amnesty International said today.
Yesterday, following a meeting of Greece’s National Security Council, the authorities announced they would temporarily suspend the registration of asylum claims from people who enter the country irregularly. This measure will be coupled with the immediate return without registration of new arrivals if the return to their country of origin is “possible.” It’s not clear how the Greek authorities are interpreting “possible” in this context.
“Everyone has a right to seek asylum. Deporting people without due process could mean sending them back to the horrors of war or expose them to grave human rights violations, breaching the fundamental principle of non-refoulement,” said Eve Geddie, Director of Amnesty International’s European Institutions Office.
‘’The reckless measures being taken by the Greek authorities are a blatant breach of EU and international law that will put lives at risk. People seeking asylum are once again being used as bargaining chips in a callous political game.”
Greece also announced that from today its armed forces will conduct exercises with live ammunition near the Evros land border and the Aegean Sea. Thousands of people have gathered at Turkey’s land and sea borders since the Turkish authorities announced on 28 February they would no longer prevent people from crossing there.
According to reports, thousands of people have arrived at the borders of Turkey with Greece. Since last Thursday, clashes have been reported between Greek police and people at the land border, with the police using excessive force and indiscriminately firing tear gas into crowds to stop them from crossing into Greece.
Meanwhile, arrivals have increased on the Greek islands and yesterday, according to reports, locals on Lesvos prevented boats from coming ashore. They also attacked activists and the cars of volunteers and journalists. Amnesty is urging the Greek authorities to take all possible measures to protect people arriving in Greece and the organizations and individuals who are on the ground supporting them.
“Greece must refrain from using excessive force and ensure search and rescue operations can operate at sea. People who are seeking asylum in Greece should be helped, not treated as criminals or a security threat,” said Eve Geddie.
“EU member states must also do far more to share responsibility for asylum seekers arriving in Turkey, both through financial support and ensuring safe pathways to Europe.
“The European Commission must also urgently coordinate any support that might be required to Greece and Bulgaria, to ensure asylum seekers have access to adequate reception and asylum procedures.”

“There is no doubt that those sentenced to death today have been convicted of serious crimes, including deadly attacks. However, the death penalty can never deliver justice, all the more so when it has been issued after a trial in which dozens of defendants say they were subjected to enforced disappearance and torture. 
“We are calling on the Egyptian authorities to retry the defendants in proceedings that comply with international human rights law and fair trial standards, without recourse to the death penalty.”
Background
The 37 defendants are among 208 defendants convicted of carrying out 54 militant attacks between 2013 and 2014. These included killing high-ranking police officers and bombing a security directorate office in the city of Daqhaliya, as well as an assassination attempt on the former Egyptian interior minister, Mohamed Ibrahim, in 2013.
The court also sentenced 61 defendants to life sentences and 88 others to prison terms ranging from five to 15 years. The remaining 22 individuals died during the course of the trial.
Amnesty International has serious concerns about the fairness of the trial. According to a report issued by the Egyptian Front for Human Rights in 2019, many of the defendants who were detained said they were subjected to enforced disappearance and torture: 70 defendants told prosecutors that they were subjected to enforced disappearance for periods up to five months, during which 62 of them said they were tortured by being beaten, subjected to electric shocks to the genitals or suspended for prolonged periods while handcuffed and naked.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life; it is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

The Canadian justice system is fraught with racism that disproportionately impacts Black people and communities across the country, resulting in racial profiling, harsher sentencing, mistreatment in prison, denial of services, and other injustices which can be compounded for people with intersecting identities (e.g. Black Muslims, Black 2SLGBTQ folks, etc.) On March 21, 2020 — the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination — Amnesty International Canada will raise awareness and advocate for the elimination of racial discrimination in policing. 
_______ 
Carding is when police officers stop, question, and document individuals without any evidence that they have been involved in, or have knowledge of, an offence. Bias and stereotyping play into the officers’ decisions of who to stop and why, which affects many racialized groups, but especially Black people.  
Carding is a form of systemic police racism that disproportionately impacts Black people in Canada. Carding can often be the first point of contact that can lead to further mistreatment, violence, and racism within other segments of the justice system as well as negative mental and physiological health outcomes.  
Racism in policing, including carding, violates many rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, such as:   
Article 3 on life, liberty and security of person;  
Article 7 on equal protection without discrimination before the law;  
Article 9 on arbitrary detention, arrest, or exile;  
Article 13 on freedom of movement;  
and the list goes on.  
Carding does not lower crime rates and according to Justice Michael Tulloch, “there is little to no evidence that a random, unfocused collection of identifying information has benefits that outweigh the social cost of the practice.” Negative impacts on racialized groups, and particularly on Black individuals, far outweigh any supposed benefits that police claim result from carding.  
In 2017, some restrictions were introduced to carding in Ontario, but to no avail. Without adequate monitoring and accountability measures, and with loopholes in the regulation’s language, carding is still a regular practice in Ontario. In order to achieve a complete ban on carding, we need strong legislation, monitoring, and enforcement to hold perpetrators to account.  
Activists and anti-racism organizations have been leading the way on speaking up against this form of racial profiling. Prominent human rights organizations and UN experts have raised the alarm on anti-Black racism in policing, and we should ensure their recommendations are turned into action. A permanent and effective ban on carding is one step towards curbing systemic racism in policing.

This led to an independent investigation by the Saskatoon Health Region, where more women disclosed that they too had been coercively or forcibly sterilized. 
As media coverage of the issue increased, more Indigenous women courageously broke their silence and reported that they too had involuntarily sterilized. In 2017, a class action lawsuit representing some of the women was filed. In 2018, the United Nations Committee on Torture affirmed that sterilization without consent is a form of torture and called on Canada to take urgent steps to end the practice and ensure redress for survivors. 
To date, over 100 Indigenous women, from all over Canada, have come forward to Alisa Lombard, the lawyer leading the class action lawsuit. Some of the women signed consent forms under duress. Some did not sign consent forms. Most were sterilized via tubal ligation, but some, like Dene-Métis-Athabasca Chipewyan storyteller, author, actor, and activist Morningstar Mercredi, were subjected to forced abortion and removal of an ovary. 
At age 13, Morningstar was raped, became pregnant, went to a hospital after she experienced spotting, and underwent a termination she did not consent to. The procedure involved removal of one of her ovaries. She later had one son but was not able to have more children after an ectopic pregnancy at age 19. Morningstar wanted to have more children, and decades later, the impacts of having her fertility taken away from her are profound.  
Rather than interview Morningstar and asking her to re-live her trauma once again, with her permission, we have included an excerpt from her memoir, Morningstar: A Warrior’s Spirit. 
After my fourteenth birthday, I began hemorrhaging. I phoned a girlfriend and told her what was happening; she told me to go to hospital immediately. I phoned a taxi and left… 
The doctor had to operate to remove a cyst. So he said. 
I lie on the table in pain, floating over my body. The doctor is disgusted and annoyed as he reaches for a scalpel. An obese nurse nods. He takes the scalpel and slices my flesh open a few centimetres beneath my belly button, haphazardly cutting my skin deeply to my panty line. A young nurse looks up at him with shock but seems afraid to say anything while the senior nurse coldly watches over. My skin is pulled apart and the doctor examines my womb. The young nurse appears shocked by his unprofessional malice. Within seconds he has removed a tiny foetus and my left ovary. The young nurse, appalled, looks to her senior nurse for understanding but is ignored. Both nurses are ordered to clean up. Blood is sponged and the ten-centimetre cut is closed with crude stitches. 
My tiny unborn baby is carried away. I’m watching the doctor, floating above and feeling his anger and racism toward me, wondering why. I know he is justifying his actions. He doesn’t think another Indian girl should bear children, and in his mind, he is doing society a favour. The young nurse leaves the operating room in tears; the senior nurse remains smug in support of the doctor’s procedure. 
After the operation, I lay in bed afraid, alone, and lonely. 
[six weeks later] 
The next day she took me to a doctor to ensure that I was ok. I sat in the doctor’s office after he examined me. His eyes became teary as he looked at me with sincere empathy. He asked what the incision on my abdomen was from, which he said was healing well. I said nothing. 
He said that in his professional opinion there was no medical reason for any doctor to make incisions so haphazardly or bluntly. I still wouldn’t respond. Both he and a nurse encouraged me to talk. They told me I had had a nervous breakdown. They pleaded with me to tell them what happened. I looked at him. 
My mind spiraled into the crevices of my childhood. The sexual abuse, the hopelessness, rapes, drugs, alcohol, men, and homelessness. Vivid images of being butchered during the operation. I subconsciously held my breath as I thought about what the surgeon had said to me after the operation: “Your chance of becoming pregnant is less than that of an average woman.” 
I knew it hadn’t been a dream. 
These memories and images cascading in front of my eyes in merciless damnation, I whispered to the doctor and nurse, “I was born. That’s what happened.” 
NOTE: Excerpts from Morningstar’s memoir, written in 2004, were written based on what she could remember at that time. Morningstar describes observing herself – out of body – during the surgery. Morningstar could not talk about what happened until she was in her fifties when her PTSD was triggered forty years later, she knew she received a doctor’s note confirming her pregnancy in her home community before she decided to leave to have her baby.  
She was 27-30 weeks pregnant when an abortion was performed and her left ovary removed without her consent, or her parents’, although she was told her mom had been reached, which was untrue. The reference to a cyst was fabricated by the doctor when she asked what was wrong. At age fourteen, alone in the hospital, she had no one to advocate for her, hospital staff did not contact authorities, police or social services on her behalf before or after surgery.

Amnesty International submitted to the House of Commons Standing Committee that forced and/or coerced sterilization in Canada is a serious human rights violation that disproportionately impacts Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit persons. The prevalence of medically unnecessary sterilizations on Indigenous women without their free, full, and informed consent – a practice which has gone on since the 1800s until the present day –  is the result of racial bias against Indigenous peoples in the provision of health services in Canada. 
Amnesty’s submission highlighted to a July 2017 report by the Saskatoon Regional Health Authority that documented the experience of 16 women who were coercively sterilized between 2005 and 2010. The report noted pervasive structural discrimination as a root cause of these. A class action lawsuit filed in October 2017 led to over 100 more Indigenous women coming forward with allegations of sterilization without full, free and informed consent. 
Our submission further noted that forced and/or coerced sterilization is considered torture under the UN Convention Against Torture, to which Canada is a party.  The UN Committee against Torture (UNCAT) signalled in its 2018 review of Canada that this was a troubling human rights issue of great urgency. We noted the federal government’s responsibility for the Canada-wide implementation of the UNCAT recommendations as well as the necessity for federal coordination and leadership to address this issue. In light of this, we expressed concerns over the inadequate federal response against this extremely pressing, serious, and ongoing human rights violation. 
Amnesty International submitted these concerns in a similar brief to the Standing Senate Committee on Human Rights in April 2019 as well. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S RECOMMENDATIONS  
Amnesty International, along with other organizations including Indigenous women’s organizations, called on the federal government to take urgent action, particularly to do the following:

We write this Open Letter to you with respect to recent developments at the International Criminal Court (ICC) respecting the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory.
As Canada’s leading representatives on the international stage, you have been important supporters of the indispensable work of the Court. Indeed, one of Minister Champagne’s primary tasks, as per the recent mandate letter from the Prime Minister, is to: “Reinforce institutional institutions like the International Criminal Court…” This continues an intrepid Canadian tradition, beginning with its leadership during the preparatory work for the Court in the 1990s, and culminating in Canada’s ratification of the Rome Statute in 1998 and its domestic enactment of the Statute through the War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Act in 2000. Since then, Canada has provided funding, skilled legal professionals and political support for the Court, all of which is critical to the goal of ending criminal impunity and ensuring accountability for the most serious crimes committed on the international stage.   
As you will recall, on 20 December 2019, the Prosecutor of the ICC, Ms. Fatou Bensouda, announced that she was satisfied there was a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation into the possible commission of war crimes in Palestine – the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza – from 2014 onward. At the same time, the Prosecutor stated that she had decided to refer a preliminary issue of jurisdiction – seeking a ruling on the territorial scope of the ICC’s jurisdiction with respect to the situation – for a speedy ruling by the Pre-Trial Chamber at the ICC.
In her announcement, the Prosecutor stated that, in her view, there were at least four areas of investigation by her Office into the possible commission of war crimes: 
Israel’s conduct of the Gaza war during the summer of 2014 (Operation Protective Edge);
The 240 Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank;
The lethal shooting by the Israeli military of Palestinian demonstrators at the Gaza frontier in 2018-19; and
The indiscriminate shooting of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel.   
Amnesty International and the Special Rapporteur for the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 welcome the announcement by the Prosecutor. We believe that the advancement of the complaints respecting war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territory to a full investigation stage at the ICC offers a crucial opportunity to break the cycle of impunity for war crimes and paves the way for the many thousands who have suffered as a result of these crimes to finally achieve long overdue access to truth, justice and reparations. Accordingly, we are writing you to urge the Government of Canada to support the decisions of the Prosecutor respecting this matter.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been marred by a strong streak of impunity and a deplorable lack of justice. Without in any way overlooking or excusing breaches of human rights standards by Palestinians, the primary responsibility for the continuation of the 52 year old occupation, and its many gross violations of human rights, rests with Israel, the occupying power and the much stronger party to the conflict. In defiance of the international community’s express direction, Israel has: 
illegally annexed East Jerusalem,[1]
built 240 illegal settlements, and settled more than 650,000 settlers, in East Jerusalem and the West Bank,[2]
refused to end the occupation and recognize Palestinian self-determination on the territory occupied in 1967,[3] and
continued to construct a wall that lies primarily, and illegally, within the occupied Palestinian territory.[4] 
The international community has frequently criticized Israel’s conduct of the occupation, but only rarely has it sought consequences for Israel’s ongoing defiance of its direction which might reverse the ominous trends on the ground that are making a two-state solution that has been promoted by Canada and other governments increasingly improbable.  It is our belief that, as long as Israel believes that it enjoys impunity from its violations of international law, it will continue to deepen its five-decade-long occupation and, in the near future, seek to illegally annex significant portions of the West Bank. This is the impact of impunity wherever it becomes the norm.
A number of independent international commissions of inquiry, established by organs of the United Nations over the past decade, have affirmed the lack of accountability on the part of Israel. For example: 
The 2009 UN Human Rights Council independent report into the 2008-09 Gaza conflict (Operation Cast Lead) stated that: “justice and respect for the rule of law are the indispensable basis for peace. The prolonged situation of impunity has created a justice crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory that warrants action.”[5]
The 2013 UN Human Rights Council independent report into the implications of the Israeli settlements called upon Israel: “to ensure full accountability for all violations…and to put an end to the policy of impunity.”[6]
The 2015 UN Human Rights Council independent report into the 2014 Gaza conflict (Operation Protective Edge) expressed concerned that: “impunity prevails across the board for violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law allegedly committed by Israeli forces…Israel must break with its recent lamentable track record in holding wrongdoers accountable…”[7]
The 2019 UN Human Rights Council independent report into the lethal shootings in 2018 at the Gaza frontier concluded that: “To date, the Government of Israel has consistently failed to meaningfully investigate and prosecute commanders and soldiers for crimes and violations…Scarce accountability measures arising out of Operations Cast Lead (2008-09) and Protective Edge (2014)…cast doubt over the State’s willingness to scrutinize the actions of military and civilian leadership….”[8] 
The ICC is one of the few remaining international forums where the conduct of Israeli decision-makers regarding its illegal actions under international human rights and humanitarian law might be held meaningfully accountable. If the investigations into purported war crimes within the occupied Palestinian territory that would be conducted by the Prosecutor result in a fundamental rethinking by the Israeli political and military leadership of its entrenched occupation, then this process at the ICC would have a decisive and positive impact on breaking the conflict’s logjam where resolutions, peace conferences and diplomatic statements have failed.
As such, we profoundly disagree with the statements made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in his 20 December 2019 letter to Prime Minister Trudeau. In his letter, he stated that the Prosecutor’s decision was “unfounded and outrageous”, and had turned the ICC into a “political tool to delegitimize the state of Israel”. Prime Minister Netanyahu said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to investigate the complaints of war crimes against Israel, and that the Prosecutor’s investigation will perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Impunity and a deep disregard by Israel for international law and the clear direction of the international community over several decades have played a substantive role in perpetuating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Seeking justice and accountability at the international level for victims and survivors of grave human rights violations cannot be seriously regarded as undermining the path to peace.
Accordingly, we urge Canada: 
To support the Prosecutor’s motion before the Pre Trial Chamber that the “territory” over which the ICC may exercise its jurisdiction under the Rome Statute for the purpose of formally investigating the purported commission of war crimes in this situation comprises the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza;
Should the Pre Trial Chamber rule in favour of the Prosecutor’s motion on territorial jurisdiction, to support the work of the Prosecutor in conducting the formal investigation into the purported war crimes; and
Not to take any steps at the ICC or any other international forum that would oppose the work of the Prosecutor in this regard. 
On a related matter, may we say that we appreciate the UN General Assembly vote by Canada in December 2019 in support of Palestinian self-determination. This resolution recognizes both the strong international consensus on this issue as well as the importance of international law as the indispensable framework for a just and durable peace between Israelis and Palestinians.
Upholding the integrity and independence of this ICC investigation would be another strong indication of Canada’s regard for the importance of those international legal standards, notably in the areas of international human rights, international humanitarian law and international criminal law. 
We would welcome the opportunity to met with you at your early convenience to discuss our concerns and recommendations.
Sincerely,

In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court of Canada has decided that a human rights lawsuit against a Vancouver-based mining company can be heard in British Columbia, and not Eritrea where the human rights abuses allegedly occurred.
The Eritrean plaintiffs say they were forced to work in a gold, copper and zinc mine largely owned by Nevsun Resources. The employees allege they suffered gross human rights abuses while working for the Canadian mining company, including forced labour and torture. Nevsun argued that the case should be heard in Eritrea, not Canada.
“This ground-breaking decision sends a clear message to Canadian corporations that they can and will be held accountable for alleged human rights abuses overseas,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “This sets a precedent that should reverberate globally as well, as the drive to ensure effective remedies for individuals and communities impacted by corporate human rights harms needs to be strengthened around the world.”
In a 5-4 decision penned by Justice Rosalie Abella, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that “there is no longer any tenable basis for restricting the application of customary international law to relations between states.”
Further, the majority judgement observed that the appeal “involves the application of modern international human rights law, the phoenix that rose from the ashes of World War II and declared global war on human rights abuses. Its mandate was to prevent breaches of internationally accepted norms. Those norms were not meant to be theoretical aspirations or legal luxuries, but moral imperatives and legal necessities.”
In 2014, three Eritrean men filed a claim against Nevsun Resources, a Canadian mining company. The plaintiffs sought accountability for human rights violations – including allegations of torture, slavery, forced labour and crimes against humanity – during the construction of the company’s gold and copper mine in Bisha, Eritrea. According to documents filed in court, the company had prior knowledge and understanding of the likelihood that its business relationships would involve the use of conscripted labour.
Today’s historic decision is important because it clarifies that Canadian companies can be held accountable in Canada when implicated in human rights violations overseas. In the past, some court cases involving the human rights conduct of Canadian companies overseas have not been heard in Canada because companies successfully argued that the cases should be tried in the countries where the alleged abuses took place. Yet this is highly problematic where a fair trial is not guaranteed in the host country, due to a lack of judicial independence and other violations of international human rights norms.
Amnesty International, which intervened jointly with the International Commission of Jurists in the Supreme Court case, has been urging Canadian courts to be open for justice and ensure respect for the right to an effective remedy for over a decade. Bringing cases of this nature to justice is vital because impunity only fuels the belief that those responsible for corporate human rights abuses are untouchable. This decision supports Amnesty’s position that corporate actors should not be able to dodge accountability for their role in human rights violations abroad.
Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists very much appreciate having been represented on a pro bono basis by a legal team made up of Paul Champ of Champ & Associates, Jennifer Klinck of Juristes Power Law, and Professor Penelope Simons and Professor François Larocque with the Faculty of Law at the University of Ottawa.

We support the shelters.” The organization works to ensure that government actions to end gender-based violence and violence against women are rights-based and informed by the experiences and insights of their members from across Canada. They led a collaborative process to create a Blueprint for Canada’s National Action Plan on Violence against Women, which Amnesty International endorsed, and lead advocacy in support of a National Action Plan. 
Amnesty spoke with Lise in Ottawa in the lead-up to International Women’s Day 2020. 
Our bottom line is that the levels of service and the levels of protection that women have access to shouldn’t depend on their postal code. Depending on where you live in Canada, it impacts what levels of services and protections you have access to. Funding is provincial and territorial. Sixty-four per cent of shelters across the country do not have an annual cost of living increase, and 20% haven’t received an increase in at least 10 years. 
A shelter is like any house. You have to pay your taxes and your heat. Your expenses increase but budgets do not. Often programs suffer because you have to put more of your money into operating costs. 
Fundraising is a major part of the work of shelters because they can’t make ends meet without it. All shelters have to fundraise. In a city like Toronto you can hold a $250 per plate benefit dinner. But no one can do that in a small northern community. 
We are always advocating for more shelters, but we’re also advocating for more access to affordable housing. Women can’t get out of shelters because there’s no affordable housing for them to go to when they leave shelters. 
Second stage shelters are most needed for women at the highest risk for domestic homicide and there are little to none of them in rural areas across the country.  
There are fewer second stage shelters in rural areas, on reserve, and in communities with large Indigenous populations. There are few second stage shelters that are Indigenous-run or have Indigenous-specific programming. 
Second stage shelters are independent units. Women live in an apartment and stay from 6-24 months. They are really important for women rebuilding their lives. The governments of Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador don’t fund any second stage shelters. 
The length of stay in an emergency shelter varies from three weeks up to no limit depending on the province. Women are supposed to find affordable housing in three weeks in Alberta, for example. Some shelters have a maximum stay of 30 days. In some it’s three months. In Ontario and Quebec there is no limit to how long a woman can stay in an emergency shelter. 
Every year, our Shelter Voices survey records how many women and children are served violence against women shelters and transition houses across Canada. In 2019, 78% of the requests for shelter were denied. The rate has been consistent for the past four years. 
The issue in any major city in Canada is that there’s a slim chance of finding space in a violence against women shelter on the day you call. In a rural area, the chance is actually greater that you will find space—if there happens to be a shelter in your community, and there’s many communities without shelters. For example, the Ottawa Citizen ran an article about how Ottawa shelters were full, but a shelter an hour drive away from Ottawa had space. But this less than ideal for women who have children in school. In rural areas, the high cost of transport is a big issue. If a woman is calling and in distress, often the shelter will pick up the transportation cost, and this cost can be very high in rural communities. These communities also have less access to legal aid, counselling, and other services. 
The federal government has promised a National Action Plan but we have no idea what they have in mind. There needs to be more money invested into this. The money is also about recognizing that this is a societal issue. This is a non-partisan issue. This National Action Plan needs to cover over a decade at least and will span more than one government term. It needs to be developed with that in mind. 
There has to be money transferred to provinces and territories, as was done for the national housing strategy. We need to recognize that this is a societal issue. It can’t be dealt with by just funding discreet projects. It’s bigger and broader than that. 
On the ground, it’s about more services and more coordination of the services.  
All levels of government need to be involved. On reserve shelters receive less funding than provincial counter parts and that needs to be addressed. There is need for substantive equality in access to services. 
The National Action Plan must be well resourced. It must be developed with stakeholders and this includes service providers and survivors. It’s really important that it addresses the continuum of violence from bullying in schoolyards to femicide. 
Actions must be clear and coordinated. It’s about consistency. Consistency across and within jurisdictions in terms of policy and legislation. Sometimes it’s about recognizing there are tools in place (i.e. death review committees) in some provinces but not in others. The National Action Plan needs to recognize best practices and make sure that, for example, every province has a death review committee and their recommendations are implemented. 
The National Action Plan needs to include tools to measure progress and change. There are civil society monitoring tools like the Canadian Femicide Observatory. We need government funded tools to measure progress. The National Action Plan needs to be measurable and accountability tools need to be built into the plan. 
Turn away rates from shelters will be lower. A woman will have a decent chance of finding space in a shelter when she needs it. Society will recognize this is a societal issue that needs addressing. There’s a lot of work to be done in terms of public perception and what’s acceptable. 
It’s also about women’s empowerment. We want levels of violence to decrease. And need services available across the country when women need them. 
The National Action Plan sounds high level and policy but it’s about women’s lives. We need people to realize that it may sound complicated, but it will help save women’s lives. 
It’s about changing systems and increasing services. But changing systems that impact the every day lives of women. And it will ensure consistency across the country.

“This week has underscored the threat to the right to freedom of expression and access to information worldwide should Julian Assange be sent to the USA to be prosecuted under espionage charges.
“The potential chilling effect on journalists and others who seek to reveal information in the public interest from their sources is self-evident. Journalists around the world will know that they could be charged for espionage or under terrorism laws as a threat to national security simply for exposing war crimes or other human rights violations. That would leave us all ignorant of facts and information we need to hold our governments to account for such wrongdoing.
“We heard with concern how, over the last few days, Julian Assange has been subjected to strip searches and led around in handcuffs. The prison service must ensure that such measures are strictly necessary and proportionate. Amnesty International intends to follow up with the UK authorities to ensure that Mr Assange is not being mistreated while in Belmarsh prison.
“Over the past four days, Julian Assange repeatedly tried to address the court saying that he could not hear the proceedings, was not able effectively to communicate with or give his lawyers instructions, and that he could not focus or concentrate in the secure dock due to the medications he is taking.
“We are concerned that if adequate measures are not in place for the May hearings to ensure his effective participation in the proceedings, the fairness of the proceeding will be at risk.”

The call comes as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights’ latest report on Sri Lanka raises concerns about human rights commitments being rolled back.
The Sri Lankan government has said it will no longer be cooperating with the UN Human Rights Council’s landmark resolution 30/1, which the previous government had co-sponsored, to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights in the country.
“Sri Lanka’s decision to go back on its commitments to the Human Rights Council requires a robust response by the Council, including steps towards the creation of an accountability mechanism to ensure the victims of the nearly three-decade long conflict get the justice that is owed to them,” said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana, South Asia Researcher at Amnesty International.
Instead of implementing the commitments they have made through UN Human Rights Council resolutions, the Sri Lankan government has said it will pursue a national effort to achieve “sustainable peace” through an “inclusive, domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process.”
“Sri Lanka has a long history of failed domestic accountability mechanisms. Their successive failures have bitterly disappointed victims of human rights abuses and violations, many of whom have waited years for an outcome that has failed to materialize. They need an international mechanism that is both trusted and can be effective,” said Thyagi Ruwanpathirana.
“The limited but significant gains made in recent years are at risk of being rolled back, even as we see space shrinking for civil society in Sri Lanka over recent months.”
In January and February 2020, Amnesty International has documented several cases of harassment, intimidation and attacks on human rights organizations, media outlets and journalists in Sri Lanka.
Background
In 2015 the Government of Sri Lanka co-sponsored a landmark UN Human Rights Council resolution, 30/1, making commitments to promote reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. It renewed these commitments in two further UNHRC resolutions in 2017 and 2019. In the resolutions, Sri Lanka committed to “establish a judicial mechanism with a special counsel to investigate allegations of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law” and affirmed that “a credible justice process should include independent judicial and prosecutorial institutions led by individuals known for their integrity and impartiality.” It also affirmed “the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsel’s office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators.” Close to five years later, Sri Lanka has not yet established the mechanism.
Following the change of government in 2019, the new government announced its intentions to withdraw its co-sponsorship of the resolution’s commitments, and declared the Government’s commitment “to achieve sustainable peace through an inclusive, domestically designed and executed reconciliation and accountability process, including through the appropriate adaptation of existing mechanisms, in line with the Government’s policy framework.” The government elaborated that “this would comprise the appointment of a Commission of Inquiry (COI) headed by a Justice of the Supreme Court, to review the reports of previous Sri Lankan COIs which investigated alleged violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (IHL), to assess the status of implementation of their recommendations and to propose deliverable measures to implement them keeping in line with the new Government’s policy.”

“2019 brought a renewed assault on human rights across much of the Americas, with intolerant and increasingly authoritarian leaders turning to ever-more violent tactics to stop people from protesting or seeking safety in another country. But we also saw young people stand up and demand change all over the region, triggering broader demonstrations on a massive scale. Their bravery in the face of vicious state repression gives us hope and shows that future generations will not be bullied,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“With yet more social unrest, political instability and environmental destruction looming over the region in 2020, the fight for human rights is as urgent as ever. And make no mistake, the political leaders who preach hate and division in a bid to demonize and undermine the rights of others will find themselves on the wrong side of history.”
Protesters and human rights defenders faced rampant violence and state repression
Protest movements, often led by young people, rose up to demand accountability and respect for human rights in countries like Venezuela, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Haiti, Chile and Colombia last year, but authorities typically responded with repressive and often increasingly militarized tactics instead of establishing mechanisms to promote dialogue and address the protesters’ concerns.
The repression in Venezuela was particularly severe, with the Nicolás Maduro government’s security forces committing crimes under international law and grave human rights violations, including extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions and excessive use of force, that could amount to crimes against humanity. In Chile, the army and police also set out to deliberately injure protesters to discourage dissent, killing at least four people and seriously wounding thousands more.
In total, at least 210 people died violently in the context of protests across the Americas: 83 in Haiti, 47 in Venezuela, 35 in Bolivia, 31 in Chile, eight in Ecuador and six in Honduras.
Latin America is once again the world’s most dangerous region for human rights defenders, with those dedicated to protecting rights to land, territory and the environment particularly vulnerable to targeted killings, criminalization, forced displacement, and harassment. Colombia remained the most lethal country for human rights defenders, suffering at least 106 killings, mostly of Indigenous, Afro-descendant and campesino leaders, as its internal armed conflict continued to rage.
Mexico was one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists, with at least 10 killings in 2019. It also suffered a record number of homicides but persisted with the failed security strategies of the past by creating a militarized National Guard and passing an alarming law on the use of force.
Gun violence remains one of the biggest human rights concerns in the United States, with too many guns and insufficient laws to keep track of them and keep them out of the hands of people who intend harm. A new rule announced by the Donald Trump administration in January 2020 has made it far easier to export assault rifles, 3-D printed guns, ammunition and other weapons abroad to spread rampant gun violence beyond US borders, particularly to other countries in the Americas. Similarly, in Brazil president Jair Bolsonaro signed a series of decrees and executive orders that, among other concerning outcomes, relax regulation on the possession and carrying of firearms.
Governments took aggressive stances against migrants, refugees and asylum seekers
The number of men, women and children to have fled Venezuela’s human rights crisis in recent years rose to almost 4.8 million – an unprecedented figure in the Americas – but Peru, Ecuador and Chile responded by imposing restrictive new entry requirements and unlawfully turning away Venezuelans in need of international protection.
Further north, the US government misused the justice system to harass migrants’ rights defenders, unlawfully detained children fleeing situations of violence and implemented new measures and policies to attack and massively restrict access to asylum, in violation of its obligations under international law.
As people continued to seek protection in the United States due to persistent, widespread violence, the Trump administration has pushed them into danger. It has forced tens of thousands to wait in dangerous conditions in Mexico under the disingenuously named “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP) policy, also known as “Remain in Mexico.”
The United States is forcing increasing numbers of asylum-seekers into secretive, rapid-deportation programs that eviscerate their right to counsel. It has also pressured neighboring countries into effectuating violations of the right to seek asylum, strong-arming Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras into signing a series of ill-conceived, counterfactual “Safe Third Country” agreements.
Following the Trump administration’s threats to impose new trade tariffs, the Mexican government not only agreed to receive and host forcibly returned asylum seekers under MPP, but also deployed troops to stop Central Americans from making their way to the US-Mexico border.
Impunity, the environment and gender-based violence remain major concerns
Impunity remains the norm across the region. The Guatemalan government undermined victims’ access to justice for grave human rights violations by shutting down the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) last year, before the government in neighboring Honduras announced the end of the Mission to Support the Fight against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) in January 2020.
Environmental concerns continued to rise across the Americas, with the Trump administration formally announcing its intention to withdraw from the Paris agreement, while severe environmental crises in the Amazon affected Indigenous Peoples in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador. Brazil was hit particularly badly, with president Bolsonaro’s antienvironmental policies fueling devastating wildfires in the Amazon and failing to protect Indigenous Peoples from the illegal logging and cattle farming behind land seizures.
Having taken office at the start of 2019, president Bolsonaro swiftly put his wider anti-human rights rhetoric into practice through a number of administrative and legislative measures that threaten the rights of everyone in the country. Meanwhile, the emblematic 2018 killing of the human rights defender Marielle Franco remains unsolved.
Despite some progress and the growth of diverse women’s rights movements in the Americas, gender-based violence remained widespread. In the Dominican Republic police routinely raped, beat and humiliated women engaged in sex work in acts that may amount to torture. Little progress has been made in terms of women’s sexual and reproductive rights across the region. Authorities in El Salvador continued to criminalize women and girls – especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds – who suffer obstetric emergencies under the nation’s draconian total ban on abortion, while a girl under 15 gave birth every three hours in Argentina, the majority after undergoing forced pregnancies that resulted from sexual violence.
Human rights victories and reasons for optimism in 2020
The last year has also brought some positive news. By the end of 2019, 22 countries had signed the Escazú Agreement, a ground-breaking regional treaty on environmental rights. Ecuador became the eighth country to ratify the agreement in February, meaning just three more need to do so for it to enter into force. 
In the United States, a court in Arizona acquitted the humanitarian volunteer Scott Warren of “harbouring” two migrants in November after he provided them with food, water and a place to sleep, and a federal judge reversed the conviction of four other humanitarian volunteers on similar charges in February.
The acquittal of Evelyn Hernández, who was charged with aggravated homicide after suffering an obstetric emergency in El Salvador, was another victory for human rights, although prosecutors have since appealed the verdict. Young women and girls also emerged at the forefront of the largely youth-led movements standing up for human rights that brought optimism for 2020, as evidenced by powerful feminist demonstrations in places like Argentina, Mexico and Chile.
“The ‘green wave’ of women and girls demanding sexual and reproductive rights and an end to gender-based violence showed unstoppable momentum across the Americas. From Santiago, Chile, to Washington, DC, their awe-inspiring performances of the feminist anthem ‘A Rapist in Your Path’ gave us the soundtrack to solidarity in 2019 and renewed optimism for what we can achieve this year,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas.
“As we enter a new decade, we cannot afford for the governments of the Americas to keep repeating the mistakes of the past. Instead of restricting people’s hard-fought rights, they must build upon them and work towards creating a region where everyone can live in freedom and safety.”

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT?  
Environnement Jeunesse (EnJeu) is a Montreal-based non-profit focusing on raising awareness and encouraging advocacy among Quebec youth on environmental issues. In November 2018, EnJeu filed an application for authorization to bring a class action lawsuit against the Canadian government on behalf of all Quebecers under the age of 35. They argued that the Canadian government is violating the rights of their generation under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms (namely, the rights to life, security, equality, and a healthy environment) by failing to adopt greenhouse gas emission targets that are sufficient to effectively combat dangerous climate change. They also characterized Canada’s failure to comply with its international environmental agreements including the Paris Agreement as gross and intentional negligence. 
EnJeu asked the Court to order the government to implement measures necessary to curb climate change so as to respect these fundamental rights. They also requested punitive damages. 
The Quebec Superior Court rejected EnJeu’s request for the authorization of the class, meaning that it did not meet the requirements to be proceed as a class action lawsuit. The Court found the age 35 cut-off to be arbitrary and inappropriate, since it did not consider the rationale for choosing it to be adequately justified. It also determined that EnJeu did not have the authority to act on behalf of the persons under age 18 in their proposed class. The judge also questioned the theoretical nature of the violations in question and whether a class action was the appropriate vehicle for such an issue. 
EnJeu has appealed the Superior Court’s decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal. They argue that their decision to focus on youth, i.e. persons under 35, is not arbitrary. They are within their rights to focus on the needs and interests of youth, who they argue will be disproportionately impacted by climate inaction, even though the entire population may be affected by the climate crisis. EnJeu is also contesting the judge’s determinations on the inclusion of minors in the class and the appropriateness of a class action in this case. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE  
Amnesty International is intervening at the Quebec Court of Appeal to bring an international human rights perspective to the procedural debate around class action authorization. Our position is that the Court must consider Canada’s international human rights obligations in interpreting the relevant Canadian law, which the court of first instance failed to do. 
International human rights law enshrines the right to life, liberty, the security of the person, and equality in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Canada is a party; the ICCPR guarantees the right to an effective remedy to any person whose rights under the ICCPR have been violated. Moreover, the right to an effective remedy is widely recognized as customary international law, binding on all states. 
International human rights law also guarantees specific protections for children, under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Canada is also a party, which creates an obligation to consider a child’s best interests in all decisions pertaining to children, including those made in a court of law. This also applies to states taking legislative measures that ensure the wellbeing of children. The Convention also guarantees the right of children capable of forming their own views to express their views in judicial proceedings that affect them.   
We also argue that minors are particularly vulnerable to obstacles that hinder their access to justice (including financial and logistical barriers). Thus, the vehicle of the class action lawsuit can facilitate obtaining access to justice for minors and should constitute an effective remedy for violations of their fundamental rights. Ultimately, the Quebec Superior Court’s decision imposed excessive barriers to the use of a class action in its inflexible interpretation of the relevant legal criteria, thereby denying youth access to an effective remedy. 
STATUS OF THE CASE  
On 11 July 2019, the Quebec Superior Court rejected the request for authorization for the class action. EnJeu has appealed this decision to the Quebec Court of Appeal. Amnesty International was granted intervener status by the Court on 12 February 2020. The hearing for this appeal is currently pending.

“The launch of a women’s football league in Saudi Arabia is no doubt a step that will be welcomed by Saudi citizens – but as with other reforms relating to women in the Kingdom, it is also a painful reminder of the abysmal situation for the very women and men who have fought for such change.
“In recent months, Saudi Arabia has worked hard at ‘sportswashing’ its reputation – trying to use the glamour of sport as a public relations tool to improve its international image, particularly following the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
“This drive to improve the overall situation of women in Saudi Arabia can only be welcomed when it goes hand-in-hand with the inclusion of the brave individuals who fought for decades for this change. Instead, they are still locked up and undergoing trials as a form of repression, while those responsible for their torture in detention remain free.
“If Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was genuine about women’s rights, he would immediately and unconditionally release all those still detained for their peaceful human rights work.”
Background
The Saudi Sports For All Federation today announced the creation of the Women’s Football League, stating it would “bolster women’s participation in sports at the community level and will generate increased recognition for women’s sports achievements”.

FACT: Most refugee claimants seek protection in a neighbouring country. Since 2014, Turkey has hosted the largest refugee population (3.7 million people), almost all of whom are from neighbouring Syria. Germany hosts the most refugees in Europe (1 million people), and no other European or North American country is in the top 10 host countries. Canada is home to less than 1% of the world’s refugee population. 
 
Chart from: https://www.unhcr.org/globaltrends2018/ 
  
MYTH: In 2018, Canada is taking in more refugees than the United States. 
FACT: Last year, Canada was the top country of “refugee resettlement,” which is a process where refugees identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) are given protection in a third country. In 2018, the United States made drastic cuts to its refugee resettlement program, and consequently – without Canada substantially increasing resettlement numbers – Canada took the number one spot in 2018. That year, Canada resettled 28,100 refugees while the United States resettled 22,900.  However, the United States (and many other countries) still host far more refugees than Canada. 
  
MYTH: Refugee protection claimants who cross the Canada-US border between regular ports of entry like Roxham Road in Quebec are “illegals” jumping the line to get in to Canada. 
FACT: Under Canadian and international law, it is not illegal to cross the Canada-US border if the purpose for crossing is to make a claim for refugee protection. 
Here are the relevant provisions in Canadian law: 
 
SOURCE OF GRAPHIC: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-asylum-seekers-in-canada-has-become-a-divisive-and-confusing-issue-a/ 
Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act state that a person who comes to Canada to seek refugee protection cannot be charged for certain crimes related to their entry into Canada, while the regulations state that irregular crossers must report to the authorities without delay. 
Canada’s international law commitments also recognize the unique circumstances of refugee protection claimants. For example, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees says that refugees must not be punished for “illegal entry or presence” in a country in which they are seeking protection. 
  
MYTH: The number of refugee protection claims by irregular border crossers is unmanageable and unprecedented. 
FACT:  Although there was a sharp increase in the number of irregular border crossers claiming refugee protection in the spring of 2017, the numbers have been relatively stable over the past few years. 
 
Aside from refugee claims, the total number of boarder crossers are down. Approximately 40,000 irregular border crossers were intercepted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2017 and 2018 – the two years spanning the height of the so-called “crisis.” In 2019, there were even fewer than either of those two years. By contrast, US Customs and Border Protection apprehended over 1 million people on its southern border in the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years. 
  
MYTH: The US is safe for refugees, so Canada should not allow them to ask for protection here. 
FACT: The United States may be safe for some refugees but definitely not all, particularly under the administration of President Donald Trump. Amnesty International has documented multiple human rights violations committed against refugee protection claimants in the United States, including family and child separations, illegal and arbitrary detentions, illegal pushbacks and “metering” of claimants at the US-Mexico border, and inadequate conditions in child detention facilities. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has stated that new restrictions in the US to block people from claiming protection at the southern US border is against international obligations.  Moreover, new agreements reached with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to send refugee claimants to those countries to claim asylum there are arguably illegal. 
  
MYTH: “Real” refugees come from refugee camps. 
FACT: The word “refugee” is a legal term, and is defined as someone who is outside of their country of nationality and has a “well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” A person’s wealth, social status, method of arrival in Canada and transit through another country are not relevant to determining whether they meet the legal definition of a refugee. Today, 60% of refugees today are not in camps, but rather live in urban settings.

Prime Minister of Canada
80 Wellington Street
Ottawa, Ontario
K1A 0A2
February 24, 2020
Dear Prime Minister,
The past several weeks have brought the deeply disappointing state of reconciliation and regard for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada to the fore with a degree of urgency rarely witnessed. Right across the country, protests of resistance and of solidarity by Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous communities, sparked by deep concern about the construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline through Wet’suwet’en Territory in British Columbia, have led to a national conversation about rights, reconciliation, the economy and the environment, that has been both troubling and encouraging.
We write to urge that your government demonstrate the leadership that is very much needed at this critical and potentially pivotal moment, working closely with Indigenous peoples’ leadership and organizations and with provincial and territorial governments, to advance foundational change to truly progress with meaningful reconciliation and full respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples in Canada. 
It is unacceptable and untenable to rely primarily on a strategy of responding one-by-one to the mounting number of instances of barricades, injunctions, and law enforcement. Instead, there is a pressing need for comprehensive and concrete action, beyond the aspirational words and lofty promises that are usually offered, that will build confidence that the journey of reconciliation is truly underway.
Amnesty International visited Tyendinaga today, in the aftermath of the Ontario Provincial Police’s enforcement action which has reportedly resulted in the arrest of ten protesters. It was notable to us that all community members we spoke with described a feeling of betrayal and broken trust, particularly given the dialogue that had begun with Minister Miller on February 15th, reiterated in his assurance to Tyendinaga leadership the following day, in his letter of February 16th, that he “welcome[s] the invitation to talk again in the near future to continue our open and respectful dialogue.” What happened today was not consistent with that assurance.
We should be ashamed as a country that we find ourselves in the current situation.   
Measures should have been adopted long ago to ensure proper respect for Indigenous rights in Canada.
We should have in place a fair, accessible, non-adversarial and expeditious process for resolving land claims.  
Legal reforms should have been enacted, years ago, to ensure that the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is part of our national fabric. 
The vital human rights safeguard of free, prior and informed consent should by now have been embraced by all governments in Canada as the blueprint for a nation-to-nation relationship rooted in respect and justice; rather than the scaremongering talk of it being a veto that stands in the way of Canadian prosperity. 
We appreciated the restraint that your government demonstrated in the initial phases of the blockades and demonstrations that have been organized, highlighting how important it is to pursue dialogue and not rush to the use of police force as a response. That is of vital importance given that there is a long historical context of unrelenting human rights violations against Indigenous peoples, going back hundreds of years, that give shape to the realities that are at the root of contemporary concerns.
Many politicians and commentators have rashly and often aggressively insisted that Indigenous peoples must exhibit patience. It is time to recognize that the contrary is the case. Indigenous peoples have shown nothing but patience, for far too long, in the face of racist laws, unjust policies and unspeakably cruel violence, as their rights have been violated, dismissed and ignored. If anything, it is time for governments across Canada, businesses and the Canadian public to be the ones expected to be patient.  
As many have noted, the call for patience is particularly inappropriate with respect to the Wet’suwet’en people, who have waited for 23 years for their land rights to be recognized following the groundbreaking 1997 Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw decision; and for the Tyendinga Mohawks who have waited for over 170 years for the return of their lands taken as part of the Culbertson Tract.    
While your government did initially show remarkable restraint, you have of course in the end given a nod to enforcement action, which is now being pursued by national, provincial and municipal police forces across the country. That enforcement will not bring resolution to the deep concerns that underly these rights struggles and protests. For many communities it only adds to decades of trauma associated with violent and repressive police and judicial action that has been at the heart of the most shameful and upsetting chapters of Canadian history.
We have written to you previously urging that at a minimum Canada comply with the decision of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination with respect to the Coastal GasLink pipeline, TransMountain Pipeline Expansion and Site C dam. The importance of governments in Canada living up to the country’s international human rights obligations in those three situations and many others has been frequently reiterated by Indigenous peoples across Canada, yet your government has not shown any intention to do so.
We therefore call on you to take the following steps: 
Ensure that land defenders are not criminalized and that people who have been arrested for defending the land and who have not engaged in acts of criminal violence are released unconditionally.  
Respond immediately to the December 2019 ruling of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, including suspending construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the absence of the free, prior and informed consent of the Wet’suwet’en people and the withdrawal of the RCMP from their traditional territory.
Move immediately on longpromised legal reforms, notably a legislative framework for implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Engage directly and personally in discussions with Indigenous chiefs, elected and hereditary, so as to demonstrate that you recognize that these are not simply matters of barricades and law enforcement, but are the very essence of a respectful and rights regarding nation-to-nation relationship. 
Prime Minister, you face an unprecedented opportunity to break with decades of failure when it comes to the relationship with Indigenous peoples in Canada. To do so means putting rights first, embracing the full complexity of reconciliation and making it clear to all Canadians that while the road ahead will not always be easy, it is the only path to a just and sustainable future for our country. 
We are available to meet with you at your convenience to discuss these concerns and recommendations further.

Since 1984, AI Group 6 has had a regular spot in the Guelph weekly Saturday market for Amnesty Urgent Action petitions. About 20 members share the work. They sign up every 2 or 3 months for a first or second shift at the market, which runs from 7 am to noon. The group has never missed a shift in more than 35 years! If we were to miss one, we would lose our highly competitive market vendor place.  The market charges $16 a week, mostly paid for by donations from group members and by some signers. 
Each petition, usually a main one with a copy to the country’s ambassador, attracts about 70 signatures every week, suggesting that there have been a quarter of a million signatures since the project started. Most petitions come from the UA Network, since one of our members distributes these in Guelph to many of the market participants, but some petitions are taken from the AI Canada website. 
Coordination of the group by a series of selfless coordinators over the years is by email, so it’s a relatively straightforward process. The group gets together about once a year, often to sign cards on Human Rights Day in December. 
For many in Guelph, signing the weekly petition is a regular part of a visit to the market, something that keeps the Amnesty flame burning in the city.

The men were among 17 defendants who were sentenced to death by a military court in October 2018, in relation to deadly attacks on three churches and a police checkpoint that killed 88 individuals.
“The attacks on Coptic Christian churches and a police checkpoint in 2017 were appalling, and the perpetrators should be held to account for their crimes. But a mass execution is no way to deliver justice. These men were executed following an unfair military trial and amid allegations that they were subjected to enforced disappearances and torture. Everyone is entitled to a fair trial, regardless of the charges that they are facing,” said Phil Luther, Amnesty International’s MENA Research Director.
“Since 2013, death sentences have soared in Egypt, with the authorities often putting people to death in grossly unfair trials marred by torture allegations. We call on Egypt to halt this alarming trend. The other defendants accused of involvement in these horrific crimes must be retried in a civilian court in proceedings that comply with international human rights law and fair trial standards.”
According to a joint report issued by the Egyptian Front for Human Rights and Committee for Justice, several defendants in the case told prosecutors that they were subjected to enforced disappearance and torture, based on the casefile of the case.
Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception regardless of the nature of the crime, the characteristics of the offender, or the method used by the state to kill the prisoner. The death penalty is a violation of the right to life; it is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment.

Bringing to justice everyone responsible for the killing of Berta is vitally important to end the impunity that fuels more killings of forest and water defenders. Front Line Defenders Global Analysis 2019 reports that 31 defenders were killed in Honduras last year. 
Pressure from inside and outside Honduras is making a difference. In December 2019, seven men were sentenced to between 30 and 50 years in jail for their role in carrying out the assassination of Berta. Her organization COPINH has recognized the importance of activism by Amnesty Canada supporters. Read more in this blog about what we have helped to achieve together. 
Now Berta’s organization and her family are appealing for us to redouble our efforts to help ensure that those who gave the orders and paid for the killing of Berta are brought to account.  Messages from Canada carry weight, says Berta’s daughter Bertha Zúniga Cáceres, who courageously carries on the work her mother led to defend Indigenous rights and the environment. 
 
Watch the following inspiring short videos to learn more about Berta Cáceres, the struggle that got her killed, and what Berta’s daughters want us to know about the importance of coming together to defend human rights and the environment.  
If you haven’t already, please sign the e-action at the bottom of this page. Please encourage friends to sign too by sharing on social media. 
Remember that expressions of concern from Canada have already helped to press Honduran authorities to act. Berta’s family and organization are counting on us to keep up the pressure in order to bring to justice the masterminds behind the murder and stop the green light for more violence against earth defenders. 
Do you have connections at your library, a local school, place of worship or elsewhere in your community where you could set up a table and gather signatures on our post card action?

5. Use art to attract attention and support 
 
Do you believe in the power of art to bring about change? Are you interested in weaving words and images to convey a powerful message that will attract the attention of people around you? Would you like to work together with others and build a stonger community of concern? Do you enjoy creating social media photo stories?  
If you answered yes to any of these questions, you can organize an Art Build for Berta and Earth Defenders Under Attack. Groups in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, St. Mary’s, Stratford, Timmins and Regina have already done so. They’ve created powerful expressions of solidarity which they are sharing on social media and will use at upcoming community events to attract attention and signatures on our post cards.  
Don’t worry if you’ve never been part of an Art Build before. Invite friends with artistic talents in any media to join you. Think about where you could display your finished creation in your community or at a community event. 
Contact Elena Dumitru of our Activism Team via edumitru@amnesty.ca for instructions and support.  
 
 
 
A fabric banner Art Build in St Mary’s, Ontario. The finished banner will be displayed at community action events and carried at a march. 
PLEASE NOTE, any of these actions can be taken beyond March 2. The important thing is to get involved and create impact by adding your voice with those of courageous defenders in Honduras.

Their letter, excerpted below, is in response to the administration’s new landmine policy and can also be viewed in full here.
“In response to the January 31 announcement by the White House of the Department of Defense’s new landmine policy, we, the undersigned organizations, strongly condemn the Trump Administration’s decision to lift existing American prohibitions against the use of landmines. We urge the White House and Department of Defense (DOD) to reconsider and take steps to join the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. We urge Congress to take immediate measures to block the deployment of landmines and prohibit the development, production, or other acquisition of new antipersonnel landmines.
“Landmines are inherently indiscriminate weapons that maim and kill long after conflicts end. Over the past twenty years, the world has rejected antipersonnel landmines through the Mine Ban Treaty – to which 164 countries are states parties, including every other member of NATO. While still not a signatory, the U.S. has functionally adhered to several provisions of the Mine Ban Treaty – except those that would prohibit the use of landmines on the Korean peninsula. This new landmine policy starkly sets the U.S. apart from its allies and has drawn international condemnation, including from the European Union.
“The United States has not used antipersonnel landmines since 1991, excluding the use of a single munition in 2002; it has not exported them since 1992 and has not produced them since 1997. In the last five years, only the government forces of Syria, Myanmar, and North Korea, as well as non-state actors in conflict areas, have used landmines. Of the more than 50 countries that once produced landmines, 41 have ceased production. Under this new landmine policy, the U.S. will rejoin a small handful of mine-producing countries. This is not company the U.S. should keep.”

Espionage charges are chilling blow to publishers and journalists 
Authorities in the US must drop all espionage and other related charges that Julian Assange is facing as part of the US extradition request to allow for his prompt release, said Amnesty International ahead of his 24 February extradition hearing.
If these charges are not dropped, the UK authorities must ensure that Julian Assange is not extradited to the USA where he would face a real risk of serious human rights violations.
“The US government’s unrelenting pursuit of Julian Assange for having published disclosed documents that included possible war crimes committed by the US military is nothing short of a full-scale assault on the right to freedom of expression,” said Massimo Moratti, Amnesty International’s Deputy Europe Director.
“The potential chilling effect on journalists and others who expose official wrongdoing by publishing information disclosed to them by credible sources could have a profound impact on the public’s right to know what their government is up to. All charges against Assange for such activities must be dropped.”
According to an analysis by the organization, the charges against Julian Assange stem directly from the publication of disclosed documents as part of his work with Wikileaks. This activity, in and of itself, should not be punishable and mirrors conduct that investigative journalists undertake regularly in their professional capacity.
“All charges underpinning the US extradition request should be dropped to allow for Julian Assange’s prompt release. If the charges against him are not dropped, the UK authorities are under a clear and unequivocal obligation not to send him to the USA where he could suffer serious human rights violations,” said Massimo Moratti.
“Julian Assange could face detention conditions in the USA that amount to torture and other ill-treatment, including prolonged solitary confinement. The risk of an unfair trial is very real given the targeted public campaign against him undertaken by US officials at the highest levels, which has severely undermined his right to be presumed innocent.”

BACKGROUND 
Amnesty International has launched a global petition calling on the US authorities to drop the charges against Julian Assange that stem solely from his publishing activities with Wikileaks.
In addition, international human rights law and standards forbid the transfer of an individual to another country where there is a real risk they would face serious human rights violations. Were Julian Assange to be extradited or subjected to transfer in any other manner to the USA, the UK would be in breach of these obligations.

China is systematically harassing Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic groups even after they have left the country, according to new testimonies gathered by Amnesty International.
The case studies, published online today, reveal how China targets members of the Uyghur and other diaspora communities across the globe through pressure from its embassies abroad, as well as through messaging apps and threatening phone calls.
“These chilling accounts from Uyghurs living abroad illustrate how the far-reaching shadow of repression against Muslims from China extends far beyond its borders,” said Patrick Poon, Amnesty International’s China Researcher.
“Even when Uyghurs and members of other minorities flee persecution in Xinjiang, they are not safe. The Chinese government will find ways to reach them, to intimidate them and, ultimately, attempt to bring them back to face a grim fate – including by pressuring other governments to return them.”
Amnesty International collated information from approximately 400 Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Uzbeks and members of other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups living in 22 countries across five continents over the course of a year between September 2018 and September 2019. Their accounts reveal the harassment and fear being experienced by these communities on a daily basis.
Several Uyghur interviewees told Amnesty International that local authorities in Xinjiang had targeted their relatives back home as a way to suppress the activities of Uyghur communities living abroad. Others said the Chinese authorities had used social messaging apps to track, contact and intimidate them.
The testimonies illustrate the global scope of China’s campaign against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others originally from Xinjiang, with Chinese embassies and consulates tasked with collecting information about members of these ethnic groups residing in other countries.
Since 2017, China has pursued an unprecedented campaign of mass detention of Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in Xinjiang.
An estimated one million or more people have been held in so-called “transformation-through-education” or “vocational training” centres where they have endured a litany of human rights violations.
Earlier this week, a 137-page Chinese government document leaked to several international media outlets listed the personal details of people from Xinjiang, including their religious habits and personal relationships, as a means of determining whether they should be interned in “re-education” camps. The leaked details supported evidence of violations previously documented by Amnesty International.
“Despite China’s continued denial of the existence of internment camps, there is an ever-growing body of evidence that anyone deported back to Xinjiang is at real risk of being sent to the camps and thus being subjected to grave human rights violations,” said Patrick Poon.
“It is vital that all governments hosting the Xinjiang diaspora around the world take measures to protect them from intimidation by Chinese embassies and agents and stop their forced return to China.”
An estimated 1–1.6 million Uyghurs live outside China, according to the World Uyghur Congress. Significant diasporic communities of Uyghurs can be found in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Smaller communities live in other countries, including Afghanistan, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Norway, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United States.

“Although the government has taken some action on human rights issues, this action is still not enough to seriously address the crisis that the country has been facing for many years now. It is worrying to hear disparaging speeches from President López Obrador about the role of human rights defenders, or to see how the National Guard is used to thwart the passage of migrants and refugees, or that, faced with a wave of homicides and femicides, the government would maintain failed strategies of militarization of public security tasks of previous administrations,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
“Rather than evading responsibility and attacking the individuals and organizations working to highlight the crisis that Mexico is facing, we urge the President to approach civil society to find solutions to this grave situation and to position human rights as a central focus for the remainder of his presidential term.”
Amnesty International has reported on human rights violations in Mexico for more than four decades. Since the inauguration of the current government, the organization has recorded some specific progress on human rights issues, particularly acknowledging the efforts that have been made in relation to disappeared persons.
“This request for a meeting with the president is in response to an invitation that he himself extended to the organization when he was running for office, and we issue it with the intention of contributing to addressing the human rights crisis facing the country,” said Tania Reneaum Panszi, executive director at Amnesty International Mexico.
“It is important for the president to listen to our suggestions from civil society to put a stop to the human rights crisis in the country that sadly implies a high cost in terms of people’s lives and other grave human rights violations every day.”
The organization is increasingly concerned about the president’s statements against civil society and human rights defenders in Mexico, the role of the National Guard in issues related to migration and the violation of the right to asylum, the lack of results in terms of violence against women and femicides, and the need to protect human rights in the public security field.
In December 2019, Amnesty International published a review of the state of human rights during the first year of President López Obrador’s government in the report When words are not enough. To date, the government has not responded to the appeals made by the organization nor has it followed up on the recommendations in the report.

Governments across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) displayed a chilling determination to crush protests with ruthless force and trample over the rights of hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who took to the streets to call for social justice and political reform during 2019, said Amnesty International today, publishing its annual report on the human rights situation in the region.  
Human rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Review of 2019 describes how instead of listening to protesters’ grievances, governments have once again resorted to relentless repression to silence peaceful critics both on the streets and online. In Iraq and Iran alone, the authorities’ use of lethal force led to hundreds of deaths in protests; in Lebanon police used unlawful and excessive force to disperse protests; and in Algeria the authorities used mass arrests and prosecutions to crack down on protesters. Across the region, governments have arrested and prosecuted activists for comments posted online, as activists turned to social media channels to express their dissent.  
“In an inspiring display of defiance and determination, crowds from Algeria, to Iran, Iraq and Lebanon poured into the streets – in many cases risking their lives – to demand their human rights, dignity and social justice and an end to corruption. These protesters have proven that they will not be intimidated into silence by their governments,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Director for MENA.
“2019 was a year of defiance in MENA. It also was a year that showed that hope was still alive – and that despite the bloody aftermath of the 2011 uprisings in Syria, Yemen and Libya and the catastrophic human rights decline in Egypt – people’s faith in the collective power to mobilize for change was revived.”
The protests across MENA mirrored demonstrators taking to the streets to demand their rights from Hong Kong to Chile. In Sudan, mass protests were met with brutal crackdowns by security forces and eventually ended with a negotiated political agreement with associations who had led the protests.
Crackdown on protests on the streets
Across the MENA region authorities employed a range of tactics to repress the wave of protests – arbitrarily arresting thousands of protesters across the region and in some cases resorting to excessive or even lethal force. In Iraq and Iran alone hundreds were killed as security forces fired live ammunition at demonstrators and thousands more were injured.
In Iraq where at least 500 died in demonstrations in 2019, protesters showed tremendous resilience, defying live ammunition, deadly sniper attacks and military tear gas grenades deployed at short range causing gruesome injuries.
In Iran, credible reports indicated that security forces killed over 300 people and injured thousands within just four days between 15 and 18 November to quell protests initially sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Thousands were also arrested and many subjected to enforced disappearance and torture.
In September, Palestinian women in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories took to the streets to protest against gender-based violence and Israel’s military occupation. Israeli forces also killed dozens of Palestinians during demonstrations in Gaza and the West Bank.
“The shocking death tolls among protesters in Iraq and Iran illustrate the extreme lengths to which these governments were prepared to go in order to silence all forms of dissent,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Research and Advocacy Director for MENA. “Meanwhile, in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Israel’s policy of using excessive, including lethal, force against demonstrators there continued unabated.” 
In Algeria, where mass protests led to the fall of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika after 20 years in power, authorities sought to quash protests through mass arbitrary arrests and prosecutions of peaceful demonstrators.
While the mass protests in Lebanon since October, which led to the resignation of the government, began largely peacefully, on a number of occasions protests were met with unlawful and excessive force and security forces failed to intervene effectively to protect peaceful demonstrators from attacks by supporters of rival political groups.
In Egypt, a rare outbreak of protests in September which took the authorities by surprise was met with mass arbitrary arrests with more than 4,000 detained.
“Governments in MENA have displayed a total disregard for the rights of people to protest and express themselves peacefully,” said Heba Morayef. 
“Instead of launching deadly crackdowns and resorting to measures such as excessive use of force, torture, or arbitrary mass arrests and prosecutions, authorities should listen to and address demands for social and economic justice as well as political rights.”
Repression of dissent online
As well as lashing out against peaceful protesters on the streets, throughout 2019 governments across the region continued to crack down on people exercising their rights to freedom of expression online. Journalists, bloggers and activists who posted statements or videos deemed critical of the authorities on social media faced arrest, interrogation and prosecutions. 
According to Amnesty International’s figures, individuals were detained as prisoners of conscience in 12 countries in the region and 136 people were arrested solely for their peaceful expression online. Authorities also abused their powers to stop people accessing or sharing information online. During protests in Iran, the authorities implemented a near-total internet shutdown to stop people sharing videos and photos of security forces unlawfully killing and injuring protesters. In Egypt, authorities disrupted online messaging applications in an attempt to thwart further protests. Egyptian and Palestinian authorities also resorted to censoring websites including news websites. In Iran social media apps including Facebook, Telegram, Twitter and YouTube remained blocked.
Some governments also use more sophisticated techniques of online surveillance to target human rights defenders. Amnesty’s research highlighted how two Moroccan human rights defenders were targeted using spyware developed by the Israeli company NSO Group. The same company’s spyware had previously been used to target activists in Saudi Arabia and the UAE as well as an Amnesty International staff member. 
More broadly, Amnesty International recorded 367 human rights defenders subjected to detention (240 arbitrarily detained in Iran alone) and 118 prosecuted in 2019 – the true numbers are likely to be higher.
“The fact that governments across MENA have a zero-tolerance approach to peaceful online expression shows how they fear the power of ideas that challenge official narratives. Authorities must release all prisoners of conscience immediately and unconditionally and stop harassing peaceful critics and human rights defenders,” said Philip Luther.
Signs of hope
Despite ongoing and widespread impunity across MENA, some small but historic steps were taken towards accountability for longstanding human rights violations. The announcement by the International Criminal Court (ICC) that war crimes had been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and that an investigation should be opened as soon as the ICC’s territorial jurisdiction has been confirmed offered a crucial opportunity to end decades of impunity. The ICC indicated that the investigation could cover Israel’s killing of protesters in Gaza.  
Similarly, in Tunisia the Truth and Dignity Commission published its final report and 78 trials started before criminal courts offering a rare chance for security forces to be held accountable for past abuses.
The limited advances in women’s rights, won after years of campaigning by local women’s rights movements, were outweighed by the continuing repression of women’s rights defenders, particularly in Iran and Saudi Arabia, and a broader failure to eliminate widespread discrimination against women. Saudi Arabia introduced long-overdue reforms to its male guardianship system, but these were overshadowed by the fact that five women human rights defenders remained unjustly detained for their activism throughout 2019.  
A number of Gulf states also announced reforms to improve protection for migrant workers including promises from Qatar to abolish its kafala (sponsorship system) and improve migrants’ access to justice. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates also signalled plans to reform the kafala system. However, migrant workers continue to face widespread exploitation and abuse across the region.
“Governments across the region must learn that their repression of protests and imprisonment of peaceful critics and human rights defenders will not silence people’s demands for fundamental economic, social and political rights. Instead of ordering serious violations and crimes to stay in power, governments should ensure the political rights needed to allow people to express their socio-economic demands and to hold their governments to account,” said Heba Morayef.

“Today’s decision is hugely welcome and confirms what has been clear to the entire world for more than two years.
“The only just verdict in this baseless case, devoid of any substance, was always going to be the wholesale acquittal of those who stood trial, but in today’s Turkey this was far from guaranteed.
“After almost two and a half years in prison, it is wonderful that Osman Kavala will finally walk free. While the injustice of his lengthy incarceration cannot be erased, this remains a huge relief for civil society in Turkey.
“Today’s judgement was a touchstone for Turkish justice and we hope it signals a shift in political climate in the country and brings to an end these politically motivated prosecutions. We also hope this decision bodes well ahead of tomorrow’s critical verdict for 11 human rights activists, including former Amnesty leaders, who face sentences of up to 15 years.
“It is time for Turkey to end the relentless crackdown on dissenting voices and acquit all those facing trumped up political charges.”

Celebrities and politicians join two million people to demand justice
High-level Amnesty International delegation to hear verdict against their former Turkey chair and former director 
A verdict is expected tomorrow in the cases of 11 human rights defenders, including the former leadership and several members of Amnesty Turkey, who have spent more than two-and-a-half years fighting trumped-up charges and could face up to 15 years behind bars if found guilty. 
Ahead of the hearing, which resumes tomorrow in Istanbul, Amnesty International said only acquittal of all could deliver justice for the 11 activists arrested in the summer of 2017 on baseless terrorism charges. Amnesty Turkey’s former Chair, Taner Kılıç, former Director, Idil Eser, and several other members of Amnesty Turkey are among the human rights defenders on trial.
“The plight of these activists shows that Turkey has become a country where defending other people’s freedoms can cost you your own, and where standing up for human rights is being criminalized. This verdict is an acid test for Turkey’s justice system – we demand an end to this prolonged saga of injustice now,” said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International’s Europe Director.
“From the moment they were arrested, it was clear this was a politically motivated prosecution aimed at silencing independent civil society within Turkey. After months in jail and years before the courts, and with no credible evidence presented to substantiate the charges made against them, any verdict other than a full acquittal for all 11 activists would be an outrage.”
Over the course of ten hearings, the ‘terrorism’ allegations made against all 11 defendants have been repeatedly and categorically disproven, including by the state’s own evidence. The prosecution’s attempt to present legitimate human rights activities as unlawful acts has comprehensively failed. The verdict must reflect that reality.
Since 2017, more than two million people from around the world have joined the call for justice for the 11, including scores of renowned figures from the arts world, among them Ben Stiller, Whoopi Goldberg, Edward Snowden, Peter Gabriel, Sting, Ai Weiwei, Anish Kapoor, Catherine Deneuve and Angélique Kidjo.
Writing in an open letter in 2017 when the 11 were still behind bars, dozens of high-profile figures stated: “When human rights defenders are silenced, all our rights are put at risk. They are the ones that stand up for us. Now we must stand up for them.”
After more than 14 months in prison, Taner Kılıç was released on bail in August 2018. Eight of the others spent almost four months each behind bars before they were released in October 2017. But thousands of others caught up in Turkey’s deep and far reaching crackdown on dissent remain in jail.
The targeting of human rights defenders has escalated during the wave of repression that has gripped Turkey since the 2016 coup attempt. The post-coup crackdown by the government has seen an ongoing assault on civil society which has resulted in the closing of more than 1,300 NGOs and 180 media organizations, and the arbitrary dismissal of almost 130,000 public service workers.
“The significance of the verdict will reach far beyond this courtroom. The acquittal of these 11 human rights defenders should herald the beginning of the end of the crackdown on civil society and a restoration of respect for human rights in Turkey,” said Marie Struthers.
“The eyes of the world will be on the courtroom. Any verdict other that acquittal will be a chilling reminder that truth and justice have become strangers in Turkey.”

“The detention of Xu Zhiyong shows that the Chinese government’s battle against the coronavirus has in no way diverted it from its ongoing general campaign to crush all dissenting voices and its ruthless assault on freedom of expression.
“Xu has been in the authorities’ sights ever since he attended a meeting of human rights activists in Xiamen in December, and he has since criticized President Xi’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.
“He now joins the several others who have been targeted for investigation by the authorities for attending the Xiamen meeting and who currently languish in detention under constant risk of torture or other ill-treatment.
“Xu Zhiyong and his fellow detainees have committed no crime. They have been targeted merely for their peaceful activism, and the Chinese authorities must immediately and unconditionally release them.”
Background
Xu Zhiyong is a prominent Chinese legal scholar and rights activist known for his work on behalf of disadvantaged groups and his promotion of a “New Citizens’ Movement”, which he launched in 2012. He has previously been jailed for his peaceful activism, spending four years in prison on trumped-up public order charges. He was released in 2017.
His friends say he had been in hiding since December 2019, when the authorities cracked down on a meeting of human rights lawyers and activists he had attended in the southeastern city of Xiamen. More than 10 people who were at the meeting have since been summoned or detained.
Earlier this month, Xu had called on President Xi Jinping to resign and criticized his handling of the coronavirus crisis and the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests. His detention, however, appears to be related to his presence at the Xiamen meeting.
He was arrested on Saturday night while staying at the home of fellow activist Yang Bin, who had also spoken out against China’s censorship of debate on the virus.
Among those also detained for attending the Xiamen meeting are lawyers Dai Zhenya, Ding Jiaxi and Zhang Zhongshun, who have been held under “residential surveillance in a designated location”, a form of incommunicado detention that puts them at risk of torture and other ill-treatment. During their detention, they have been refused access to lawyers, as well as communication with their families.

Allegations range from complicity in unlawful executions to systemic pollution and environmental damage in the Niger Delta.
Amnesty International has been researching Shell’s activities in the Niger Delta for more than 20 years, compiling compelling evidence of the company’s role in human rights abuses. In a report released today, the organization highlights the various cases that are finally putting Shell’s harmful operations in Nigeria on trial.
“Shell began the year with another attempt to greenwash its role in the climate crisis, trying to present itself as the future of energy even as the planet burns. This expensive PR effort must not divert attention from the fact that Shell is facing a year of unprecedented legal scrutiny over its business in Nigeria,” said Mark Dummett, Amnesty International’s Head of Business, Security and Human Rights.
“Shell’s business model has allowed it to benefit from weaknesses in Nigeria’s justice and regulatory systems, wreaking havoc on Nigerian lives and livelihoods while profits continue to flow to its European headquarters. A just transition to clean energy also means holding polluters to account for the harm they have caused in the past.”
For the new report, Amnesty researchers interviewed people from several Niger Delta communities about the ongoing impact of pollution and oil spills.
King Okpabi, customary ruler of the Ogale community, expressed a widely-held frustration at Shell’s failure to take responsibility for its actions:
“Shell spoiled our water and destroyed our livelihoods. It is now spending millions to protect itself and tell the world that it has no responsibilities towards the people of Ogale, rather than addressing the wrong it did to us.”
The claims against Shell
Due to the difficulties of bringing legal claims in Nigeria, individuals and communities affected by Shell’s operations in Nigeria are bringing cases in the Netherlands and the UK where Shell is headquartered. These could set important precedents for holding polluting multinationals to account in future.
Kiobel v Shell: In the first of this year’s legal milestones, in March a court in The Hague will hear witness statements from four women who accuse Shell of complicity in the unlawful arrest, detention and execution of their husbands by the Nigerian military in 1995. The women are claiming compensation and a public apology from Shell. The executions were the culmination of a brutal campaign by Nigeria’s military to silence protests against Shell’s pollution.
Four Farmers Cases: In May 2020, a final hearing is expected in a case brought against Shell by four Nigerian farmers and Friends of the Earth in 2008. They are seeking compensation from both Netherlands and UK-based Royal Dutch Shell (RDS) and its Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), for alleged damage to fish ponds and land caused by oil spills.
This case is the first time that any Dutch company had been sued in a Dutch court for the operations of its subsidiaries overseas.
Okpabi and Others: In June 2020, the UK’s Supreme Court will hear an appeal brought against RDS and SPDC by two Niger Delta communities, Ogale and Bille. They claim that over several years they have suffered systematic and ongoing oil pollution because of Shell’s operations. The court will decide whether it can proceed on the critical issue of whether RDS is liable for the actions of SPDC.
This case is illustrative of the way that Shell’s corporate structure has shielded it from scrutiny and justice.
“Shell’s activities in Ogale have poisoned water and brought farming to a halt, but jurisdictional wrangling over whether RDS or SPDC is responsible for this damage means that Shell has never had to answer for this in a UK or Dutch court,” said Mark Dummett.
“Shell claims that RDS is not responsible for the actions of its subsidiary even though it owns 100 percent of SPDC and receives the profits that it makes.
Bodo: In 2008 there were two massive oil spills, caused by poorly maintained Shell pipelines, in a creek close to the Bodo community. Crude oil continuously leaked into the water for five weeks on each occasion. Shell settled with the community in 2014 but has yet to clean up Bodo’s devastated waterways. If the pollution is not cleared by mid-2020, the case will be referred back to the UK High Court.
Pastor Christian Kpandei, one of the community’s most vocal activists, says he lost everything when the oil spills killed the fish in his ponds. He told Amnesty: “The lack of clean-up has deeply affected us. The soil, the water and the air are all still contaminated.”
States are also scrutinising Shell’s operations.
The “OPL 245” bribery case: Prosecutors in Italy are bringing a criminal case over the alleged involvement of Shell, and the Italian oil multinational Eni, in a 1.3 billion US dollar bribery scheme connected to the transfer of a Nigerian oil licence. If found guilty, the individual defendants could go to jail.
Shell denies all claims.
“It shouldn’t require legal action to get Shell to fulfil its human rights responsibilities. Shell has an obligation to respect the human rights of people in the Niger Delta, including by taking all reasonable steps to prevent spills and then remediate contaminated land and water,” said Mark Dummett.
“It has consistently, over many decades and in some truly horrifying ways, failed to do this.”
Amnesty is calling on Shell to improve its operational practices in the Niger Delta, at a time when the role of Shell and other fossil fuel companies in the climate crisis is coming under increasing scrutiny.
Data from Shell’s own spill incident reports reveal that from 2011-18 the company reported 1,010 spills along the network of pipelines and wells that it operates in Nigeria. Spills have a variety of causes – from third-party tampering, to operational faults and corrosion of aged facilities. Shell blames most spills on theft and pipeline sabotage. But research by Amnesty and its partner organization the Centre for the Environment Human Rights and Development shows that the company’s facts and figures emerge from a flawed process for identifying the volume, cause and impact of oil spills. The research also shows that this process often lacks both independence and oversight, partly because the government regulators are so weak. As a result, Shell’s findings cannot be trusted.

“The case of Li Wenliang is a tragic reminder of how the Chinese authorities’ preoccupation with maintaining ‘stability’ drives it to suppress vital information about matters of public interest. 
“China must learn the lesson from Li’s case and adopt a rights-respecting approach to combating the epidemic. Nobody should face harassment or sanctions for speaking out about public dangers, just because it may cause embarrassment to the government.” 
Background 
Li Wenliang contracted the novel coronavirus while working at Wuhan Central Hospital.

In the early hours of Thursday, Feb. 6, RCMP officers conducted a raid on land defense camps in the Wet’suwet’en territory. They arrested six people in the course of enforcing a court injunction against blockades along access roads related to the construction of Coastal GasLink’s 670-kilometre pipeline from northeastern B.C. to the Kitimat area. 
RCMP officers also reportedly detained journalists, removed them from the territory, and instructed them not to film police in tactical gear.  
Following public backlash over this appalling affront to press freedom, a police spokesperson later issued a statement, declaring that the RCMP “respects the fundamental freedom of the press… Journalists can rest assured that the RCMP will make every reasonable effort to allow media personnel to get as close as possible to the enforcement area.” 
“These journalists had every right to be there, documenting the events in Wet’suwet’en territory without threat of arrest. In fact, at times of heightened tensions, concerns about human rights violations and the use of police force, the role of the media is essential,” said Alex Neve, Secretary General of Amnesty International Canada. “The RCMP now needs to determine why these unjustified and potentially unlawful threats were made in the first place and ensure that clear orders and proper training are in place to align policing operations with human rights obligations.” 
In a landmark ruling in March 2019, the Newfoundland Court of Appeal overturned charges against journalist Justin Brake, who had previously covered demonstrations against the Muskrat Falls Hydro project.  
The decision underscored that special considerations must apply to journalists reporting on demonstrations, even when an injunction order is in place. The considerations must include whether a journalist is engaged in good-faith reporting, aiding demonstrators or interfering with law enforcement, or whether the events being reported on are in the public interest. 
The decision also emphasized the importance of the media in advancing reconciliation and noted that “particular consideration should be given to protests involving aboriginal issues.” 
“The situation in Wet’suwet’en territory gives rise to a variety of serious human rights concerns, including that the recent RCMP actions directly contravene a December 2019 ruling from the UN’s highest anti-racism body, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,” said Alex Neve. “These are precisely the circumstances in which media scrutiny is an essential safeguard.”

Alongside the report, the organisation is also launching a campaign calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all human rights defenders detained for their peaceful expression.
In the report titled “Muzzling critical voices: Politicized trials before Saudi Arabia’s Specialized Criminal Court” the organization documents the chilling impact of the SCC’s prosecutions of human rights defenders, writers, economists, journalists, religious clerics, reformists and political activists, including of Saudi Arabia’s Shi’a Muslim minority who have suffered grossly unfair trials before the SCC and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty, under vague counter-terror and anti-cybercrime laws.
Extensive examination of court documents, government statements and national legislation, as well as interviews with activists, lawyers and individuals close to the cases documented were included in the report. Amnesty International wrote to the Saudi authorities on 12 December 2019 and received one response from the official Human Rights Commission summarizing relevant laws and procedures but failing to directly address the cases raised in the report.
“The Saudi Arabian government exploits the SCC to create a false aura of legality around its abuse of the counter-terror law to silence its critics. Every stage of the SCC’s judicial process is tainted with human rights abuses, from the denial of access to a lawyer, to incommunicado detention, to convictions based solely on so-called ‘confessions’ extracted through torture,” said Heba Morayef, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Regional Director.
“Our research gives lie to the shiny new reformist image Saudi Arabia is trying to cultivate, exposing how the government uses a court like the SCC in the ruthless suppression of those who are courageous enough to voice opposition, defend human rights or call for meaningful reforms.”
The government’s rhetoric about reforms, which increased after the appointment of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, stands in stark contrast to the reality of the human rights situation in the country. At the same time as they brought in a set of positive women’s rights reforms, the authorities unleashed an intense crackdown on some of the highest profile women human rights defenders who had for years fought for those reforms as well as other citizens promoting change.
The SCC was established in October 2008 to try individuals accused of terror-related crimes. Since 2011, it has been systematically used to prosecute individuals on vague charges which often equate peaceful political activities with terrorism-related crimes. The counter-terror law, which has overly broad and vague definitions of “terrorism” and of a “terrorist crime”, contains provisions which criminalize peaceful expression of views.
Amnesty International’s report documents the cases of 95 individuals, mostly men, who were tried, sentenced or remain on trial before the SCC between 2011 and 2019. The trials of at least 11 individuals detained for their peaceful expression and association continue before the SCC until this day. Some 52 are now serving lengthy prison sentences of between five and 30 years.
Several Saudi Arabian Shi’a Muslims, including young men tried for “crimes” they were accused of having committed when they were under the age of 18 are at imminent risk of execution following grossly unfair trials before the SCC. At least 28 Saudi Arabians from the Shi’a minority have been executed since 2016, many of whom were sentenced to death by the SCC based solely on torture-tainted ‘confessions.’
Grossly unfair trials
Amnesty International closely reviewed eight SCC trials of 68 Shi’a defendants, the majority of whom were prosecuted for their participation in anti-government protests, and of 27 individuals prosecuted for their peaceful expression and human rights activism. In all cases of the 95 individuals, the organization concluded that the trials were grossly unfair. Defendants were convicted and, in many cases sentenced to death, on vague charges that criminalize peaceful opposition or in relation to charges of violence.
The most common charges used in proceedings analyzed by Amnesty International include “disobeying the ruler”; “questioning the integrity of officials and the judicial system”; “inciting disorder by calling for demonstrations” and “forming an unlicensed organization” – all of which describe acts protected by the right to freedom of expression, assembly and association.
Every single defendant in the SCC trials reviewed by Amnesty International was denied access to a lawyer from their arrest and throughout their interrogation. Appeals against SCC judgements are conducted behind closed doors without the presence or participation of defendants or their lawyers.
One of the most striking failings of the SCC in the trials reviewed by Amnesty International is its unquestioning reliance on torture-tainted “confessions”. At least 20 Shi’a men tried by the SCC have been sentenced to death on the basis of such “confessions,” with 17 of them already executed.
Muzzling peaceful voices
Virtually all Saudi Arabian independent voices, including human rights defenders, writers and religious clerics are behind bars serving lengthy sentences handed down by the SCC and other courts since 2011 or remain on trial on charges related to their peaceful expression or activism.
Among those prosecuted by the SCC are founding members of independent human rights groups that the authorities shut down in 2013. For example, all 11 founding members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) have been tried and sentenced in recent years for their human rights work. Others include human rights defenders such as Mohammad al-Otaibi, a founding member of the Union for Human Rights, who was sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges related to his efforts to form an independent human rights organization. He is currently facing new charges for his communication with international organizations and his attempt to seek political asylum.
Others who remain on trial before the SCC include Salman al-Awda, a reformist religious cleric arrested in September 2017, who faces the death penalty for peacefully exercising his rights to freedom expression and of association. Amnesty International has documented the trials and sentencing of 27 such individuals by the SCC. It considers 22 of the 27 still unlawfully detained to be prisoners of conscience and calls for their immediate and unconditional release.
Crushing dissent in the Eastern Province
Since 2011, over 100 Saudi Arabian Shi’a Muslims have been brought before the SCC in relation to both peaceful criticism of the government in speeches or on social media and participation in anti-government protests. They have been tried on vague and varied charges ranging from organization or support for protests, to alleged involvement in violent attacks and espionage for Iran.
On 2 January 2016, the authorities announced that a Shi’a cleric, Nimr al-Nimr, known for his critical stance towards the government had been executed, sparking renewed protests in Eastern Province. In July 2017, Youssuf al-Muhsikhass, who was sentenced to death following a grossly unfair trial was executed with three other Shi’a men, and in April 2019 a mass execution of 37 men, the majority of them Shi’a, was carried out.
The SCC has also sentenced to death and executed several young men for crimes committed when they were below 18 years of age following “confessions” extracted through torture or coercion. Three juveniles – Ali al-Nimr, Abdullah al-Zaher and Dawood al-Marhoon – were arrested separately in 2012 aged 17, 16 and 17 respectively in relation to their participation in anti-government protests. The three are at imminent risk of execution after they were sentenced to death following grossly unfair trials before the SCC.
Urgent reform required
Amnesty International calls for the immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience as well as fundamental reform to the SCC to ensure it can conduct fair trials and protect defendants from arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-treatment. There must also be independent investigations into allegations of torture or other ill-treatment in custody and full reparation for all victims of torture and other human rights violations by state officials or those acting on their behalf.
“If the King and Crown Prince want to show they are serious about reforms, they should as a first step immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners of conscience, ensure their convictions and sentences are quashed, and declare an official moratorium on all executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty,” said Heba Morayef.
In March and September 2019, the UN Human Rights Council adopted unprecedented joint statements on Saudi Arabia setting out a number of benchmarks for urgent human rights reforms. None of these have been met and Council members must ensure sustained scrutiny at the Council by supporting the establishment of a monitoring and reporting mechanism over the human rights situation.

Venezuelan asylum-seekers trying to enter via Peru’s border with Ecuador are being turned away, despite appearing to fulfil all the criteria for international protection. Peru is denying entry even to Venezuelans in evidently vulnerable situations, including older people and unaccompanied children.
“In recent years, Peru has been an example of solidarity and safe refuge. Instead of resorting to restrictive policies, it should continue to demonstrate leadership and welcome Venezuelans, in line with its domestic and international obligations to guarantee the protection of people fleeing hunger and violence in Venezuela,” said Marina Navarro, executive director of Amnesty International Peru.
Since June 2019, Peru has introduced a series of measures with the deliberate aim of restricting entry to the country. The new “humanitarian visa” was effectively rendered obsolete only weeks after its introduction, because without entry and departure stamps from Ecuador, Venezuelans are not permitted to enter Peru, regardless of whether they have acquired the visa.
Amnesty International spoke to many Venezuelans who were stranded at the border after having their asylum claims or humanitarian visas rejected. One man said he left Venezuela in October 2019 because he could no longer afford to feed his family. Despite having a valid Peruvian humanitarian visa in his passport, the Peruvian officials did not allow him to enter. Left in limbo at the border, he began to cry when he described how he had accumulated debt and left his family behind on the understanding that they would later be reunited in Peru.
Years into an unprecedented crisis in Venezuela, millions are struggling to survive, unable to meet even their minimum needs for food, water and healthcare, while living under the threat of Nicolas Maduro’s policy of repression against those who express their discontent. Almost 4.8 million people have fled the country in recent years. Peru has the world’s largest population of Venezuelan asylum-seekers, at 377,047, and is home to over 800,000 Venezuelans in total. The majority of Venezuelans fleeing the country are refugees and entitled to international protection, either under the international Refugee Convention or regional Cartagena Declaration.
“As long as the serious deterioration in living conditions and the systematic violation of human rights in Venezuela continue, states should protect those fleeing the crisis in search of a safe place where they can rebuild their lives,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
Amnesty International’s report is based on dozens of interviews in Peru and at the Peru-Ecuador border. Despite fleeing persecution and massive violations of human rights – international protection criteria recognized in Peruvian law – most of the Venezuelans that Amnesty International interviewed had had their claims rejected or been denied entry despite having a humanitarian visa.
“Peru seems to be repudiating its previously humane approach to Venezuelan people seeking protection. Changes to asylum practices and procedures at the Ecuador border appear to amount to a deliberate and unlawful policy of rejecting new arrivals from Venezuela,” added Erika Guevara-Rosas.
Amnesty International calls on the Peruvian government to continue to show leadership and uphold the right to seek asylum in compliance with its domestic, regional and international human rights obligations. At the same time, other countries, including those beyond the region, must share responsibility for Venezuelan refugees by increasing their financial and technical assistance to Peru and other host countries.

My interest in Amnesty International and community involvement was inspired by my mother. She worked with the UNHCR for many years and would bring home stories about refugees and their path to finding safety. Those stories had a huge impact on my life, and I developed a desire to help those who are in need of justice and safety. 
I am currently a National Youth Organizer with Amnesty International Canada and have volunteered with Amnesty in the GTA for over three years now. With every event and meeting I attend at Amnesty, I learn a lot about global issues and also meet inspiring people. 
For the past 3 years, I raised awareness in my high school about what is happening in the world, inspiring them to learn and to help bring justice to those in need. Due to my involvement with Amnesty, I helped get my school involved in different campaigns. One of the biggest one was the Butterflies for Mexico Campaign in support of the families of over 40,000 missing people in Mexico. For this campaign, I had the school students and staff draw over a hundred butterflies with messages of support for the families affected. 
I have taken part in a number of Amnesty events and initiatives such as the Amnesty GTA Youth CAfe, Pride Toronto, Women’s Marches, street actions in Kensington Market and represented the organization at the annual Volunteer Youth Expo Toronto. As a first year student I recently joined the Amnesty Club at UofT St George campus.

Responding to reports that the Trump administration is expanding what has become known as the Muslim ban, which President Trump signed during his first week in office, Margaret Huang, Amnesty International USA’s executive director said:...","Spokespeople are available in New York and Washington, D.C.
Responding to reports that the Trump administration is expanding what has become known as the Muslim ban, which President Trump signed during his first week in office, Margaret Huang, Amnesty International USA’s executive director said:
“This chaos has become the new normal. The policies this administration has enacted towards people seeking safety have been cruel, inhumane, bigoted. Once again, we reject these policies and stand in support of all people this administration seeks to exclude because of their identity. Reviving this ban, and the anti-Muslim sentiment in which it originated, is a violation of the values of human rights and human dignity, and it must be overturned.”
“The Trump administration’s efforts to expand the ban are offensive and actually harmful to our national security. Our research has demonstrated how every version of this ban has shown itself to be deadly, dangerous, and disastrous. This policy is rooted in hate, white supremacy, and racism. 
“Since the ban was first implemented three years ago, we have seen families torn apart, a rise in anxiety in Muslim communities, and anti-Muslim hate crimes, and people who were supposed to be welcomed to safety have been stuck in limbo by a government that abandoned its own commitments. The ban has become a catastrophe, especially for all those to whom it is a question of life and death.
“One particular country jumps out from the list compiled – as Muslims and other ethnic minorities flee persecution in Myanmar, after being subjected to one atrocious crime after another with devastating results, including mass killings, rapes, and the burning of entire villages, the U.S. makes the unconscionable decision to deny them welcome.”
Background and context:
When President Trump signed what has become known as the Muslim ban during his first week in office, he set into motion a series of events that continue to leave families in uncertainty and danger to this day. 
Amnesty International USA has stood against the Muslim ban from its first iteration, calling on Congress to nullify it through passage of the NO BAN Act (H.R. 2214 / S. 1123), which has strong support in both bodies of Congress. Amnesty USA’s members from around the country mobilized against the ban in states across the country, participated in a protest march and rally in DC, delivered a nationwide petition to Congressional leadership, and galvanized communities in airports and conducted gatherings to inform people of their rights. 
In the aftermath of the ban, AIUSA created a dozen case studies of the harms caused to individuals and families from Yemen, Iran, Sudan and elsewhere and documented the ways lives had been upended by the ban, and in 2019, Amnesty International USA’s researchers traveled to Lebanon and Jordan to conduct nearly 50 interviews with refugees that as a result of the ban, have been stranded in countries where they face restrictive policies, increasingly hostile environments, and lack the same rights as permanent residents or citizens. AIUSA’s report, “The Mountain is in Front of Us and the Sea is Behind Us,” documented how Trump’s discriminatory policies have decimated refugee resettlement from Lebanon and Jordan, which host the highest number of refugees in the world relative to their populations.
Amnesty International has also detailed how returns of refugees from Lebanon to Syria is premature and, in late 2019, published a further report, Sent to a war zone: Turkey’s illegal deportations of Syrian refugees, detailing how Turkey has deported Syrian refugees to Syria where they are at grave risk.

If the reports are confirmed, it would make the United States one of only a handful of state forces worldwide, along with Myanmar, North Korea and Syria, to openly use antipersonnel landmines in recent years despite the weapons being banned by an international treaty in 1997.
The restriction on the production and use of landmines was based on research that showed the horrific human cost these weapons have caused over the years. Any action to ease restrictions on their use and availability is a massive step backwards. 
“There is a reason why the use of antipersonnel landmines is illegal: they can’t distinguish between fighters and ordinary people, and often continue to kill and maim for years after conflicts end,” said Adotei Akwei,  Amnesty International USA spokesperson. “This decision is consistent with an administration that has proven itself indifferent to human lives and suffering by withdrawing from the global Arms Trade Treaty and more recently by easing oversight of US arms exports. It shows that the Trump administration is either ignorant of or unconcerned with the consequences of driving the world towards more irresponsible arms exports and inhumane weapons like landmines.” 
Amnesty International, as a member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, urges all governments to ban the use, production, stockpiling, or transfer of anti-personnel landmines and to join and implement the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty.

What a difference a week makes! On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi government announced it will open up the prospect of going to school for hundreds of thousands of refugee children who have been denied that right for years.
It is tremendous news, and Canada is well-placed to work with Bangladesh to ensure that vital promise becomes reality.
The International Day of Education draws attention to the vital role that education plays in advancing peace and development in our world. It is grounded in recognition that access to education is an important human right, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and numerous other international treaties adopted over the decades. Recognition as well, though, that around the world it is a right far too frequently violated and ignored.
Our hearts and our solidarity are very much with Rohingya children and youth, living in crowded, sprawling refugee camps in Bangladesh, yearning for their right to education to be respected and upheld.
We have both had opportunities over the past year to meet with many children, of all ages, during visits to the camps in the southeast corner of Bangladesh, where close to one million Rohingya refugees have fled in the face of terrifying military attacks and massive human rights violations across the border in Myanmar.
Most escaped Myanmar after the military launched a devastating assault on Rohingya villages beginning in late August, 2017; while many others had fled to Bangladesh during earlier attacks and campaigns of violence as far back as 1992.
The human rights backdrop is as grave as it gets. Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya is currently the subject of a case, brought under the UN Convention against Genocide, at the International Court of Justice. Amnesty International has concluded that the systemic, widespread racism at the heart of this human rights crisis amounts to the international crime of apartheid.
Around one-half, or 500,000, of Rohingya refugees are under the age of 18; a significant number were in fact born in Bangladesh and have lived nowhere else. These children and youth marked the International Day of Education simply longing to learn; to be able to go to school and pursue a quality education, with a recognized curriculum that will open up a future for them.
Their dream? To pursue an education that will indeed help them advance peace and development, precisely as this International Day celebrates.
So what stands in the way? Why are their aspirations of learning being crushed?
Until now, the Bangladeshi government said it is concerned that if officially recognized, quality education is made available to Rohingya refugee children, they and their families will put down roots and will be less likely to eventually return to Myanmar. As a result, they have limited education in the camps to informal programs offering basic instruction and playtime and not following an official curriculum.
No human right should ever be held hostage or used as a bargaining chip in this way.
Fifteen-year old Bibi told Amnesty International that “she loves education and doesn’t want to be uneducated.” She wants to become a doctor to help her society, her country, and her people. Bibi asks, “Education for all, why not for refugees?”
Sixteen-year old Ali told us that he wants to help find the solutions to the problems faced by the Rohingya. He noted that education would help him do that, but that “there is no option for that right now.” Instead, he worries that he “doesn’t know what his future will be.”
For Bibi, for Ali and all Rohingya refugee children, the world cannot let the issue of education just slip by. It is time for Bangladesh to allow learning to flourish in the camps and for this precious right, to education, to be respected.
And it is time for Canada and other governments to ensure that Bangladesh has the resources and support needed to deliver that promise, and that quality education is available to Bangladeshi children as well.

‘Human Rights in Asia-Pacific: A review of 2019’, which includes a detailed analysis of human rights developments in 25 countries and territories, describes how a new generation of activists are fighting back against brutal crackdowns on dissent, poisonous social media operations and widespread political censorship.
“2019 was a year of repression in Asia, but also of resistance. As governments across the continent attempt to uproot fundamental freedoms, people are fighting back – and young people are at the forefront of the struggle,” said Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director for East and South-East Asia and the Pacific.
“From students in Hong Kong leading a mass movement against growing Chinese encroachment, to students in India protesting against anti-Muslim policies; from Thailand’s young voters flocking to a new opposition party to Taiwan’s pro LGBTI-equality demonstrators. Online and offline, youth-led popular protests are challenging the established order.” 
Hong Kong’s defiance echoes across the world
China and India, Asia’s two largest powers, set the tone for repression across the region with their overt rejection of human rights. Beijing’s backing of an Extradition Bill for Hong Kong, giving the local government the power to extradite suspects to the mainland, ignited mass protests in the territory on an unprecedented scale.
Since June, Hong Kongers have regularly taken to the streets to demand accountability in the face of abusive policing tactics that have included the wanton use of tear gas, arbitrary arrests, physical assaults and abuses in detention. This struggle against the established order has been repeated all over the continent.
In India, millions decried a new law that discriminates against Muslims in a swell of peaceful demonstrations. In Indonesia, people rallied against parliament’s enactment of several laws that threatened public freedoms. In Afghanistan, marchers risked their safety to demand an end to the country’s long-running conflict. In Pakistan, the non-violent Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement defied state repression to mobilize against enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions.
Dissent met with crackdown
Peaceful protests and dissent were frequently met with retribution by the authorities.
Protesters faced arrest and jail in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand as repressive governments across South-East Asia took severe steps to silence their opponents and muzzle the media.
In Indonesia, several people were killed as police clamped down on protests with excessive force. Yet few steps were taken to hold anyone to account for the deaths; no police were arrested nor were any suspects identified. 
In Pakistan and Bangladesh, activists and journalists alike were targeted by draconian laws that restrict freedom of expression and punish dissent online.
And in Hong Kong, police deployed reckless and indiscriminate tactics to quell peaceful protests, including torture in detention. Demands for a proper investigation into the conduct of the security forces have yet to be met.
“The authorities’ attempts to crush any form of criticism and suppress freedom of expression were as ruthless as they were predictable, with those daring to speak out against repressive governments often paying a high price,” said Biraj Patnaik, South Asia Director.
“Asians are told their aspirations for fairer societies are fantasies; that economic disparities can’t be addressed; that global warming is inexorable and natural catastrophes unavoidable. Most emphatically of all, they are told that challenging this narrative will not be tolerated,” said Biraj Patnaik.
Minorities feel the weight of intolerant nationalism
In India and China, the mere risk of insubordination in nominally autonomous areas has been enough to trigger the full force of the state, with minorities conveniently deemed a threat to “national security.”
In the Chinese province of Xinjiang, up to a million Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities have been forcibly detained in “de-radicalization” camps.  
Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, saw its special autonomous status revoked as authorities imposed a curfew, cut access to all communications and detained political leaders.
In Sri Lanka, where anti-Muslim violence erupted in the wake of the Easter Sunday bombings, the election of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dimmed hopes of human rights progress. Another self-styled strongman, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, continued his murderous “war on drugs.”
Governments have tried to justify repression by demonizing their critics as pawns of “foreign forces” and to bolster that repression through sophisticated social media operations. Neither ASEAN nor SAARC, the two main regional bodies, tried to hold their members to account, even in the case of gross human rights violations.
It has been left to the International Criminal Court to investigate crimes against humanity committed by the Myanmar military in Rakhine State against the Rohingya in 2017. The court is also looking into the thousands of killings carried out by police in the Philippines, and hearing an appeal on its decision not to authorize an investigation into war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Australia’s egregious offshore detention policies left refugees and asylum-seekers languishing in deteriorating physical and mental condition on the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus, Papua New Guinea.
Progress against the odds
People speaking out against these atrocities were routinely punished, but their standing up made a difference. There were many examples where efforts to achieve human rights progress in Asia paid off.
In Taiwan, same-sex marriage became legal following tireless campaigning by activists. In Sri Lanka, lawyers and activists successfully campaigned against the resumption of executions.
Brunei was forced to backtrack on enforcing laws to make adultery and sex between men punishable by stoning, while former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak took the stand on corruption charges for the first time.  
The Pakistani government pledged to tackle climate change and air pollution, and two women were appointed as judges on the Maldivian Supreme Court for the first time.
And in Hong Kong, the power of protest forced the government to withdraw the Extradition Bill. Yet, with no accountability for months of abuses against demonstrators, the fight goes on.
“Protesters across Asia in 2019 were bloodied, but not broken. They were stifled, but not silenced. And together, they sent a message of defiance to the governments who continue to violate human rights in pursuit of tightening their grip on power,” said Nicholas Bequelin.

The organization urged the international community to reject measures contravening international law that are set out in President Donald Trump’s so-called “deal of the century”. These include a formal extension of Israel’s sovereignty over the Jordan Valley and the vast majority of the illegal settlements in the rest of the occupied West Bank in exchange for land currently inside Israel.
“While the Trump administration has emphasized the principle of land swaps in its deal, we should make no mistake that it is proposing further annexation of Palestinian territory, which would flagrantly violate international humanitarian law. During more than half a century of occupation Israel has imposed a system of institutionalized discrimination against Palestinians under its rule, denying them basic rights and access to effective remedies for violations. The deal amounts to endorsement of these brutal, unlawful policies,” said Philip Luther, Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director.
The proposed land swaps include the potential transfer of areas of Israel with a high proportion of Palestinian residents to a future State of Palestine. This in itself raises concerns that Palestinian citizens of Israel in these areas might be disenfranchised.
Amnesty International is calling on the international community to reject annexation proposals, which violate international law, and reiterate the illegality of Israeli settlements in occupied territory. Such proposals will not change the legal obligations of Israel, as the occupying power, under international humanitarian law and international human rights law, nor deprive Palestinians of protections guaranteed under these legal frameworks.
The deal also includes proposals to create a “compensation mechanism” for Palestinian refugees, instead of granting them their right to return. With currently more than 5.2 million registered refugees, Palestinians are one of the world’s largest refugee populations. Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes in 1948, and their descendants, have a right to return under international law. This is an individual human right which cannot be given away as a political concession.
“Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees are trapped in overcrowded camps, more than 70 years after they, their parents or grandparents were first forced out of their homes. This proposal ignores refugees’ rights under international law and the decades of suffering they have endured,” said Philip Luther.
Finally, the deal seeks to undermine international justice shortly after the announcement last month of progress towards an investigation by the International Criminal Court into the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It insists that, during any negotiations, the Palestinian authorities must take “no action, and dismiss all pending actions, against the State of Israel, the United States and any of their citizens before the International Criminal Court, the International Court of Justice, and all other tribunals.”
In December 2019, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced that a preliminary examination into Palestine had concluded that war crimes had been committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories and that an investigation should be opened once the Court’s territorial jurisdiction had been confirmed.
The deal also demands that the Palestinian authorities take “no action against any Israeli or United States citizen before Interpol or any non-Israeli or United States (as applicable) legal system”. This is a blatant attempt to stop Palestinians seeking justice in national courts of third countries using universal jurisdiction, an essential tool of international justice.
“A just and sustainable peace requires a plan that prioritizes the human rights of Palestinians and Israelis, and must include justice and reparation for victims of war crimes and other grave violations. This plan not only fails this fundamental test; it seeks to torpedo efforts towards justice for both Palestinians and Israelis that are currently under way,” added Philip Luther.
Background
President Trump launched his “peace deal” today in the form of a 180-page proposal entitled Peace to prosperity, saying that it would be a “realistic two-state solution” that had already been agreed to by Israel as the basis for negotiations with the Palestinians. The plan was prepared without any input from Palestinian leaders.

Amnesty International and other human rights organizations have been campaigning for the nearly half a million Rohingya children in Bangladesh’s refugee camps to be allowed to enjoy their right to quality education, warning of the costs of a ‘lost generation’.
“This is an important and very positive commitment by the Bangladeshi government, allowing children to access schooling and chase their dreams for the future. They have lost two academic years already and cannot afford to lose any more time outside a classroom,” said Saad Hammadi, South Asia Campaigner at Amnesty International.
“It is important that access to appropriate, accredited and quality education be extended to all children in the Cox’s Bazar area, including Rohingya refugees and the host community. The international community has a key role to play here in ensuring the Bangladesh government has the resources it needs to realize this goal.”
Up to now, the Bangladesh government had resisted calls to grant Rohingya refugee children access to education, limiting learning opportunities to a few provisional learning centres that offer playtime and early primary school lessons scattered across the refugee camps in the Cox’s Bazar district. A few children who managed to gain access to local secondary schools were expelled on the government’s instructions.
Amid fears of either being forcibly returned to Myanmar or relocated offshore to the uninhabited silt isle of Bashan Char, these children have faced an uncertain future. Many were on the verge of completing their schooling when the Myanmar military attacked their villages, forcing them to flee to Bangladesh and throwing their lives into limbo.
Bangladesh’s Foreign Secretary, Masud bin Momen, told journalists today: “The government has felt the need to keep Rohingya childrens’ hope for the future alive with extending education and skills training to them.”
Under the government’s plans, Rohingya refugee children will get school education up to the age of 14, through the provision of the Myanmar curriculum, and children older than 14 will get skills training. The schools will need adequately trained teachers who can use the Myanmar curriculum and teach in Burmese.
A pilot project led by UNICEF and the Bangladesh government will start off with the involvement of 10,000 children. The scheme will then be extended to other children, including those from the host community, who will be taught separately according to Bangladesh’s national curriculum.
The Convention on the Rights of the Child, a binding treaty which Bangladesh has ratified, makes clear that education can and should ensure the development of the child’s personality, talents, mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential while enhancing respect for human rights and preparing them for a responsible life in a free society.
“The benefits of educating children cannot be underestimated, with the positive effects rippling through their communities and broader society. They can speak up for themselves, claim their rights, and lift themselves and others out of a difficult situation. But the costs of denying children education can be severe, including leaving them vulnerable to poverty and exploitation. We welcome this significant breakthrough and look forward to the government delivering on its commitments,” said Saad Hammadi.
Amnesty International’s campaign for the right to education 
On World Refugee Day last year, Amnesty International held an ‘art camp’ for children in the refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar. Working with a group of Bangladeshi artists, they spent two days drawing sketches depicting their aspirations for the future – some of whom wanted to become teachers, doctors, pilots and nurses. 
In collaboration with UNICEF, the works of art were exhibited in Dhaka and later made their way to Washington DC, London and other major world cities. 
In August 2019, Amnesty International published a briefing, “I don’t know what my future will be”: Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, detailing conditions in the camps, particularly for children who had not seen the inside of a class room since arriving in the camps in 2017.
Amnesty International also launched a global petition, calling on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to ensure children in the refugee camps and the host community are provided quality education:
Two of Bangladesh’s best-known YouTube stars developed a hip-hop music video in collaboration with Amnesty International, echoing the petition’s call

Ahead of tomorrow’s third hearing in the trial of civil society leader Osman Kavala and 15 others on trumped up charges of ‘attempting to overthrow the government’, Amnesty International’s Turkey Campaigner, Milena Buyum said:
“This prosecution is a shameful attempt to silence independent civil society and part of a wider ongoing crackdown on rights defenders.
Osman Kavala should not have spent a single minute behind bars let alone more than two years in pre-trial detention.
“He, and 15 others, are facing spurious accusations devoid of any evidence that they were involved in any criminal activity, let alone conspiring to overthrow the government.”
“He must be immediately and unconditionally released from jail and the charges against him and the 15 other civil society figures dropped.
“A month after the European Court of Human Rights called on Turkey to release Osman Kavala immediately, every passing day he spends behind bars further compounds the violation of his rights.
“His release must herald the beginning of the end of the crackdown on civil society over the last several years and a restoration for respect for human rights in Turkey.”

We are a collection of stories. As a writer, I try to capture narratives in a way that suspends time while still staying within its boundaries. Some have told me that it is difficult to create new stories, that the current ones have already been reused, and that they are tired of reading. But on a chilly December afternoon, I wove through the narrow streets of Toronto and joined a group of people who care, love, and treasure the numerous narratives still beating on this planet. 
I stumbled into the registration area, a few minutes shy of 1 pm. Strings of fairy lights and quiet bright lamps illuminated a set of posters on issues such as unjust sentences, unreasonable jail terms, and tragic deaths. Flash. A photo: Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Adopted by the United Nations on December 10, 1948. Flash. National Youth Organizers showing support for cases that resonate with them. Flash. Flash. Flash. These moments must be remembered. I vow to help people remember.   
 
Photo above: Abonti Ahmed, National Youth Organizer, holding the Yiliyasijiang Reheman case 
As I stood by with my notebook and pen in hand, I interviewed youth who were taking initiative at Toronto’s biggest Write for Rights event. The AI Canada National Youth Organizers were happy to respond to my questions about the importance of writing letters, and explained why they found themselves drawn to certain cases. To them, the moments of pens, papers, and reflection translated to more than writing for a greater cause, but also provided inspiration and motivation. 
Abonti Ahmed was exuberant about the energy that sparks when people stand in solidarity. She was darting in and out of the photo sessions as she was also responsible for covering the event on social media, and frowned thoughtfully when I approached her with my questions. “Seeing people all over the world fight for human rights is very inspiring,” she told me. “It’s time consuming, but this [connection] makes me love activism even more.” 
Hira Zulfiqar was conscious of her surroundings, but still desired to encourage others to become more familiar with human rights cases. As she was writing her second letter, she related: “I feel like a lot of these cases are to do with young people but there’s not a lot of us here. I think it’s important for me to learn more and share with my friends and family my passion for supporting human rights defenders.”

The inspiration that Abonti found in the event was also echoed by Shantel Watson after the latter read about Marinel Sumook. Marinel motivated Shantel with climate change activism, and according to Shantel, is “someone who experienced some of the worst effects of climate change… A lot of people don’t pay attention to the effects of climate change, and [her actions] force them to acknowledge this.” Shantel continued, smiling slightly, with her chin resting on her hand: “And I think she’s so amazing because she’s so young but she’s already positioned herself in the world.”

The responses of the youth organizers also induced me to reflect on which issue was particularly compelling to me, and what I found important about the Write for Rights event. 
Magai Matiop Ngong is 17 years old and on death row in South Sudan, after having been convicted of murder at 15. He had fired gunshots onto the ground as a warning when his cousin and his cousin’s neighbor had an argument, but one of the shots ricocheted off the terrain and fatally wounded his cousin. At the time, he did not have access to a lawyer and was sentenced to death by hanging. Reading these cases sometimes make me despair at the insensibility of the law. My brother is 14, and I cannot imagine the pain and torture both Magai and his friends and family have had to endure for the past two years. 
This is the reason why the Write for Rights Campaigns are so important to me. On December 7, 2019, for six hours, a group of passionate individuals read, wrote, and were willing to take a stand on these violations of human rights. They were and remain resilient, and they were and still are willing to fight back alongside individuals such as Magai, Marinel, Nasu, Yasaman, Sarah and Seán, Ibrahim, Yiliyasijiang, the youth in Grassy Narrows, and Emil.  
I’ve always admired the people who fight for what they believe in, who stand tall in front of adversity and are constantly compassionate to those who oppose them. The people who represent these ideals are the people who we were writing for in the Write for Rights event. 
To be human is to live, breathe, and act, to be filled to the brim with stories despite every divide, every crossing, every border. And this is the reason why we need to continue to write, and never stop fighting — so future generations can learn, can understand, and can remember the narratives that others have chosen to forget or ignore.

Since last January, close to 60,000 people who arrived at the Mexico-U.S. border have been forced to stay in Mexico for months in dangerous  conditions while they fight their asylum claims in the United States. As of January 23, 2020, there have been 816 public reports of kidnapping, extortion, rape, murder, torture and other violent assaults faced by asylum-seekers subject to the policy in Mexico. In multiple trips to the Mexico-U.S. border, Amnesty International USA heard first-hand stories of pregnant women, LGBTI people, children, and people with disabilities suffering abuses while they wait in Mexico. 
Remain in Mexico has also created a due process crisis, in which fewer than 5% of asylum-seekers are able to access legal representation, even though their proceedings are often times a matter of life or death. This week, Amnesty International is in south Texas investigating proceedings taking place in secretive tent courts along the Mexico-U.S. border, which have been the sites of assembly-line injustice. 
As the policy goes into its second year, Charanya Krishnaswami, the advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA said:
“From the start, this policy has been a human rights disaster, forcing people who seek safety into danger. The Trump administration’s cruel experiment has led to tens of thousands of people forced into conditions of danger, exposed to risks of murder, kidnapping, torture, and sexual assault.
“In the course of a year, this and other cruel and ill-advised policies have dismantled the asylum system as we know it, forcing people who seek safety into grave peril. This policy must be stopped before it inflicts more suffering, and the people already subjected to its cruelties must be treated appropriately.”
Background and context
People subject to Remain in Mexico are forced to stay in some of the most dangerous areas along the Mexico-U.S. border. The policy has constituted a dramatic shift in the U.S. asylum system, which has for decades provided for the right to seek asylum at the United States border, as required under international law. 
Amnesty International USA has called on Congress to defund Remain in Mexico and other anti-asylum border policies that violate the basic human right to seek asylum and protection from persecution. Amnesty International drew upon its extensive past research documenting the harms faced by asylum-seekers in Mexico to intervene in Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan, submitting an amicus brief describing the many grave dangers faced by returnees under the program. Amnesty International has previously documented the range of human rights violations committed by the U.S. government against people seeking asylum at the U.S-Mexico border. In 2018, Amnesty International concluded that Mexico is not a safe country for asylum-seekers and that people in need of protection are routinely subject to detention and deportation there.

The activist leaders are calling for every government and business leader attending Davos to declare a climate emergency within their sphere of influence and to end fossil fuel use and exploration. Governments must redistribute fossil fuel subsidies to social protection and responsibly produced renewable energy and put a meaningful price on emissions to make polluting industries pay.
“The climate emergency is the burning issue at Davos. Climate change threatens the rights of hundreds of millions of people to water, food, and health. Leaders at Davos can support human rights or they can support fossil fuels – they cannot do both,” said Clare Algar, Amnesty International’s Senior Director of Research Advocacy and Policy.
“There are still ways to avert the worst-case scenario, but this will require governments, businesses, investors and civil society to take rapid action.
“To limit global warming to 1.5°C we must halve global emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 but that goal is slipping out of reach. Davos brings together the most powerful people on the planet and we urgently need them to show they’re on humanity’s side, beginning with formal declarations of a climate emergency. True leaders don’t cover their eyes and ears – it’s time to face up to reality.”
The joint statement calls on governments to ensure the transition from fossil fuels is just and advances the rights of disadvantaged communities. It calls on companies to respect human rights and the environment, including by identifying, disclosing and addressing their negative impacts.  Both must respect the fundamental rights of activists working on these issues to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

Ioane Teitiota, a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, brought a case against the government of New Zealand at the UN Human Rights Committee (HRC) in February 2016 after authorities denied his claim of asylum as a ‘climate refugee.’ He was deported from New Zealand to Kiribati in September 2015. The HRC delivered its decision on the case earlier this month. 
“The decision sets a global precedent,” said Kate Schuetze, Pacific Researcher at Amnesty International. “It says a state will be in breach of its human rights obligations if it returns someone to a country where – due to the climate crisis – their life is at risk, or in danger of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment triggered.”    
Teitiota says he faced land disputes and difficulties accessing safe drinking water in his home country as the result of the climate crisis, and therefore was forced to migrate with his family to New Zealand where he applied for refugee status after his visa expired in 2010.
He was denied asylum by New Zealand’s Immigration and Protection Tribunal, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. He then took his case to the HRC on the grounds that New Zealand violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, by deporting him to Kiribati.   
While the Committee found that Teitiota’s deportation had not been unlawful because he didn’t face an immediate danger to his life in Kiribati, it recognised that climate change represented a serious threat to the right to life and therefore decision-makers need to take this into account when examining challenges to deportation.  
The Committee’s decision suggests that future claims might be successful where the evidence shows “the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights.” 
“The message is clear: Pacific Island states do not need to be under water before triggering human rights obligations to protect the right to life,” said Schuetze.  
All states have the human rights duty to protect people from the harmful effects of the climate crisis, including displacement. It is therefore imperative that urgent action is taken to keep the temperature rise as low as possible and no higher than 1.5°C.  
“The Pacific Islands are the canary in the coal mine for climate induced migrants. Low-lying island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu are only one or two metres above sea level. The people there are exposed to severe climate impacts today, including limited access to habitable land, clean drinking water and subsistence living. Governments must consider this dangerous reality and a heating planet’s imminent threat to Pacific peoples’ lives and livelihoods.” 
Background 
The full decision is available here. It stated that “Without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights under articles 6 or 7 of the Covenant, thereby triggering the non-refoulement obligations of sending states.”   
Two Committee members formally dissented from the finding, and supported Teitiota’s claim. Duncan Laki Muhumuza, of Uganda, stated that the “conditions of life laid out by the author – resulting from climate change in the Republic of Kiribati, are significantly grave, and pose a real, personal and reasonably foreseeable risk of a threat to his life under Article 6(1) of the [International Convention on Civil and Political Rights]. Moreover, the Committee needs to handle critical and significantly irreversible issues of climate change, with the approach that seeks to uphold the sanctity of human life.”

Any society, whether Canadian, British, or Wet’suwet’en, is made up of people who have shared territory, interaction, and culture; this doesn’t mean that members of a society will always agree with one another. A fundamental liberal democratic value is to honour and respect the right to disagree. The challenge in any society is how to reconcile differing opinions in order to live together well. Indigenous nations have historically been excluded from this social discussion in the Canadian state, and their traditional teachings and values have not merely been disregarded within social and political discourse but have been entirely supressed by the attempt to eradicate these other ways of being and thinking. 
At the same time, all humans have rights, recognized through the UN system, and by Canadian constitutional law. Rights have also been articulated by Indigenous legal traditions for millennia, now formally recognized in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This is a human rights instrument that no country in the world opposes, and which, provincially and federally, Canadian colonial governments are attempting to understand and respect. 
The Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs have maintained use of their lands and the traditional governance system in their territory. A Coastal GasLink pipeline has been approved by the federal and provincial governments despite lack of consent from the Peoples affected by the development project. The 670-kilometre pipeline would travel from the northeastern British Columbia gas fields to the Kitimat area, to supply the LNG Canada facility. Traditional legal systems and Canadian jurisprudence maintain that elected band councils only have legal jurisdiction over reserves created under the Indian Act — and not over traditional unceded territories.  
There are many examples of Indigenous communities that disagree on economic and social development projects; nonetheless, it is not for settler Canadians to decide which of those opinions or decisions are right or wrong. Settler Canadians must respect the right of self-determination, one of the core principles of the UN Declaration, other international human rights instruments and decades of Canadian jurisprudence, including repeated decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada. 
One important case that forms the base of the Canadian legal interpretation of title and consent is the Delgamuukw decision in 1997: a case brought to the Supreme Court by the Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs. In that decision, the court found that it was the authority of those hereditary chiefs to govern in their traditional territories. Individuals outside of a community may not understand traditional cultural, legal, and political practises, such as who holds hereditary leadership titles, how those are conferred, and why. However, the conflict in Wet’suwet’en territory is an opportunity to learn about those other ways of being that may seem new or strange. 
Regarding the current debate about land defense camps, the human rights position is clear: Indigenous Peoples have the right to free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) on any project that might affect their rights and the exercise of their rights. This process of consultation and consent cannot be only with a colonially imposed band governance system, nor can the consultation happen only with the traditional leadership. The UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) has been very clear in its most recent recommendations to Canada in December of last year: consultation must involve all members of a People. This is very important to consider in the Wet’suwet’en territory where the hereditary leadership have been recognized by Canada as the title holders. 
Furthermore, the UN CERD has called on Canada to freeze present and future approval of large-scale projects until FPIC has been obtained, to cease forced eviction from traditional territories, to guarantee that no force will be used, and to withdraw policing and security forces from traditional territories, and other requirements. 
Over the course of many years, the UN Committee has repeatedly and frequently highlighted serious shortcomings both with respect to specific decisions that have been reached in Canada without FPIC being obtained or in which consultations have been inadequate, and also as a matter requiring broad law and policy reform. These concerns have been consistently reflected in the UN CERD’s Concluding Observations, adopted in numerous reviews of Canada’s record of compliance with the country’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is imperative that Canadian governments act without delay to ensure full compliance with the Committee’s most recent ruling, deatling with Trans Mountain, Site C and Coast GasLink, in its entirety. 
It is crucial that Canada comply with this decision for two fundamental reasons. First and foremost, that action is urgently required because of the serious nature of the human rights violations at stake. Colonial governments across Canada have recognized that significant shifts are required to move forward with reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and show full regard for their rights in the Constitution and under international law. If promises to do so are not met with concrete action, including tough and challenging decisions such as those required here, then the words remain empty.  
Secondly, compliance is so important in this instance as a means of demonstrating the strong regard that Canadian governments and the Canadian people have for the international human rights system. At a time when an increasing number of countries are actively undermining and flouting their international human rights obligations, it is more important than ever for countries like Canada to demonstrate a strong commitment to international human rights norms and institutions such as the UN CERD that have been entrusted by governments with responsibility for overseeing compliance with those norms.  
Governments around the world often seek to justify their failure to live up to international human rights obligations by arguing that the cost of protecting rights is too high, insisting that there are already adequate national laws and processes in place to protect rights, or sacrificing the rights of one group (which in many countries is often Indigenous Peoples) because of the economic interests of others. Canada must not in any way echo those excuses, but instead demonstrate that we do indeed put human rights first and in doing so, expect other states to do similarly.

Any society, whether Canadian, British, or Wet’suwet’en, is made up of people who have shared territory, interaction, and culture; this doesn’t mean that members of a society will always agree with one another. A fundamental liberal democratic value is to honour and respect the right to disagree. The challenge in any society is how to reconcile differing opinions in order to live together well. Indigenous nations have historically been excluded from this social discussion in the Canadian state, and their traditional teachings and values have not merely been disregarded within social and political discourse but have been entirely supressed by the attempt to eradicate these other ways of being and thinking.

The two psychologists responsible for designing and implementing the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” will testify in pre-trial hearings in the September 11 case at Guantánamo Bay next week. Amnesty International experts will be there to observe their testimony.
The contract psychologists, James E. Mitchell and John “Bruce” Jessen, are responsible for developing interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, confinement in small boxes, beatings, and sleep deprivation, which amounted to torture. Many detainees suffered such abuse in secret sites around the globe, including in Europe, with the complicity of a number of European governments. Julia Hall, Amnesty International’s leading expert on counter-terrorism, who will be attending the hearings, said:
“The perverse ‘work’ of these psychologists has dramatically set back the global fight against torture. The interrogation methods they championed have had a rippling effect around the world.
“Rather than being held to account, the people responsible for the US torture program – including Mitchell and Jessen – have been protected and, in some cases, promoted. The fact that they are testifying at this high-profile hearing shows the CIA’s failure to root out the human rights abuses at the heart of its counter-terror program. Such impunity is a stain on US history. Torture is never justified and anyone who uses it must be held to account.”
WHAT:
Briefing during pre-trial hearings at Guantánamo Bay naval base
WHO:
Julia Hall is a human rights lawyer and Amnesty International’s expert on criminal justice, counter-terrorism and human rights
Zeke Johnson is senior director of programs at Amnesty International USA. He leads a team of issue experts working to end urgent human rights abuses in the U.S.
WHEN:
18 January – 1 February
HOW:
For further information, or to schedule an interview with Julia Hall or Zeke Johnson, contact Lucy Scholey, Media Relations, Amnesty International Canada, 613-744-7667 ext. 236, lscholey@amnesty.ca
Background
Mitchell and Jessen are expected to testify beginning on January 20 in the pre-trial hearings against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other men charged with helping to plan and assist in the 9/11 attacks.
Amnesty International is one of the few NGOs that have priority for The Gallery, where hearings that are not classified can be observed.
Julia Hall was one of the first persons to be granted permission by the United States Department of Defense to monitor military commissions proceedings. She observed the first trial at Guantánamo in 2008 in the case of Salim Hamdan, Osama bin Laden’s driver. She is an expert on European complicity in CIA secret sites, including those in Poland, Romania and Lithuania, and has been personally involved in the resettlement of three former detainees (to Ireland and Sweden).
Zeke Johnson has represented the organization before the United Nations Committee Against Torture and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights; testified before members of Congress about U.S. drone strikes; and served as a trial monitor of the military commissions at Guantánamo Bay.
Amnesty International has long advocated that government officials who were involved in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees in the course of the U.S.’s global “war on terror” be held accountable, and that detainees at Guantánamo should either be released or tried promptly in U.S. federal court.
Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the U.S. government to close the detention facility and put an end to years of human rights violations.
Amnesty has called attention to the fact that the government’s program of torture and ill-treatment – and repeated delays of fair trial of alleged suspects of the September 11 attacks – have directly contributed to the absence of real justice and remedy for the victims of September 11 and their family members.
Whether torture-tainted statements should be excluded from evidence in the September 11 trial is the question at the core of the hearings at Guantánamo Bay this January. All five co-defendants could face the death penalty if found guilty by the military commissions, whose proceedings do not meet international fair trial standards. The use of this punishment in these cases would be the ultimate denial of basic human rights.

For security teams trying to keep activists safe, it is a cat-and-mouse game as attackers rapidly adapt to developments aimed at protection. 
“When cyber-attackers see people are switching to using (messaging app) Signal, for example, then they will try to target Signal. If people start changing to VPN technology, they will start blocking VPN technology. If people are using Tor browser, they will target Tor traffic,” says Ramy Raoof, tactical technologist with Amnesty Tech. 
Raoof says one of the main focuses for 2020 will be tackling customized targeting of smartphones, which hit headlines in 2019. Last October, messaging app WhatsApp, owned by Facebook, launched a high-profile case against surveillance company NSO Group for spyware attacks on more than a thousand of its users. 
Malicious digital attacks will be in the spotlight this week, when a legal action brought by Amnesty and other rights groups comes to court in Tel Aviv. The activists are seeking to force Israel’s defence ministry to revoke the export licence of NSO, whose products have been used to target activists globally. 
More advanced techniques now no longer require a target to actively click on a link in order to infect a device, explains Amnesty Tech security researcher Etienne Maynier. An attack using NSO spyware on an activist in Morocco covertly intercepted the activist’s web browsing to infect their phone with spyware. “Instead of waiting for you to click on a link, they instead hijack your web browser’s traffic and redirect you to a malicious website which tries to secretly install spyware,” says Maynier. 
Successful targeting of well-protected phones is becoming more common and security teams are under added pressure from a burgeoning industry in so-called ‘zero-day’ exploits, in which unscrupulous hackers seek to find unknown vulnerabilities in software to sell. 
In May 2019, NSO Group exploited a zero-day vulnerability in WhatsApp that was used to target more than 100 human rights activists across the world with spyware. 
Amnesty Tech is also trying to combat less hi-tech attacks which are nonetheless effective and can hit large numbers of victims within minutes. 
Mass phishing via SMS or within applications on smartphones is a low-cost method that is more common and too often succeeds.   
Phishing looks to trick people into providing personal information such as passwords. The attacks often come in the form of a password reset request and link, which mimics a mobile phone operator or social media company as the sender. Other times, attackers pose as a friend or contact of the victim and will share a link to an app which is already embedded with malicious code. 
Maynier adds that attacks like these often use some kind of “social engineering”, pressurising the user to click on a link or open a document by, for example, pretending to represent a trusted organisation that purports to want to work with the target. 
“It’s very cheap and very efficient – and you can scale this type of attack very easily,” says Raoof, who predicts the new wave of phishing will be a threat to human rights defenders globally in 2020 as they become increasingly dependent on mobile phones. 
Here are some easy tips from Amnesty Tech’s tactical technologist Ramy Raoof   
Phone basics for iPhone or Android: Only download apps from the official app store to prevent your personal information from being accessed without your consent and to minimise the risk of attacks. Update your system and apps frequently to ensure they have the latest security patches. Enable ‘account recovery’ in case you lose access to your phone. Finally, choose a mobile screen lock that is not easily guessed, such as an 8-digit pin or an alphanumeric code. 
Password management: Using a password manager means you don’t have to worry about forgetting passwords and can avoid using the same ones. It’s a tool that creates and safely stores strong passwords for you, so you can use many different passwords on different sites and services. There are various password managers such as KeePassXC , 1Password or Lastpass. Remember to back up your password manager database. 
Messaging apps: When we advise human rights defenders about messaging apps, we assess each app on its policies (such as terms of service, privacy agreement), its technology (if it’s open source, available for review, has been audited, security) and finally the situation (if the app provides the features and functionality that fits the need and threat model). Generally speaking, Signal and Wire are two apps with strong privacy features.  Remember: Signal requires a SIM card to register, and for Wire you can sign up with a username/email. 
Using public Wi-Fi and VPNs: When you connect to Wi-Fi in a cafe or airport your internet activities are routed through that network. If attackers are on the network, they could capture your personal data. By using a VPN app on your devices, you protect your online activities when accessing public connections, preventing your internet activities from being seen by others on the same network. If you want to explore options, try NordVPN and TunnelBear.

“President Xi’s government has expressed its desire to help solve the situation in Rakhine State. While this is welcome in principle, the reality is that China’s engagement has failed to yield positive results for the people of Myanmar.
“China must stop using its position in the UN Security Council to shield Myanmar’s senior generals from accountability. This has only emboldened the military’s relentless campaign of human rights violations and war crimes against ethnic minorities across the country.
“Almost a million Rohingya languish in refugee camps in Bangladesh while 600,000 still in Myanmar continue to live under appalling conditions of apartheid. If it fails to pressure Myanmar to ensure justice and restore Rohingya’s rights, China’s efforts to resolve the situation will remain ineffective – and counter-productive.
“With major economic and infrastructure agreements expected to be signed during President Xi’s visit, the absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing. Investment in infrastructure can help raise living standards and realize human rights through improved access to basic services and employment. But these benefits are not delivered if those who bear the heaviest cost – the women, men, and children whose homes, health, livelihoods are be affected – are not adequately consulted before construction starts and protected from potential harm. Human rights, transparency, and consultation with communities should be at the heart of these projects.”
Background
On Friday 17 January 2020 Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China, will embark on a two-day visit to mark the 70th anniversary of China-Myanmar relations. It will be the first visit to Myanmar by a Chinese head of state in 19 years.
President Xi is expected to meet with State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de facto leader, as well as Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.

Lynn Maalouf, Amnesty International’s Middle East Director of Research, said:
“What we have witnessed in the past couple of days is an alarming attack on freedom of assembly and expression. Security forces brutally beat protesters, dragging them on the street into the police station, verbally and physically abusing them; they also fired significant amounts of tear gas in residential areas.
“Acts by a minority of protesters who vandalized banks or threw stones is never a justification for such excessive use of force and sweeping arrests by law enforcement. We are also alarmed that over the past two days security forces attacked at least eight photojournalists and cameramen, threatening and beating them, and also destroying their equipment.
“It has been over 90 days since the beginning of the overwhelmingly peaceful protests amidst the Lebanese authorities’ blatant failure to address protesters’ demands and their concerns about the impact of the economic crisis. We call on the authorities to immediately end the use of excessive force, release immediately anyone detained for peaceful protest, and hold those responsible for arbitrary or abusive force responsible in a transparent and impartial manner.”
Background
The Lawyers’ Committee to Defend Protesters in Lebanon estimates that security forces have arrested as many as 100 people across the country, including five children (under 18 years) since Tuesday night.
The Lebanese Red Cross reported that a total of 47 people were injured on Wednesday night, 37 of whom were taken to nearby hospitals.
The recent escalation took place as protesters called for a “Week of rage”, in reaction to the spiraling economic crisis and what they characterize as the authorities’ failure to take any meaningful measures to address this crisis.
A wave of nationwide protests erupted 17 October 2019 against a ruling class accused of steering Lebanon towards its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 armed conflict.

“Israel’s Ministry of Defence has once again sought to avoid the full glare of public scrutiny. NSO Group’s chilling spyware has put the lives of human rights activists around the world in danger. There remains a clear public interest for this case to be heard in open court and we remain hopeful that information about the hearing will be shared with the public.
“The cosy complicity between governments and the shadowy surveillance industry has to end.  We will continue to make every effort to ensure NSO Group’s invasive products can no longer be used to commit human rights abuses around the world.”
Gil Naveh, spokesperson for Amnesty International Israel, added:
“Unfortunately, this has become almost routine practice on cases linked to surveillance, but spyware firms must not be above scrutiny, including when there is widespread evidence of misuse. NSO’s practices have been covered globally and the public shouldn’t now be kept in the dark. We will carefully consider the court’s ruling on the case and consider our following steps.”
Background
On Thursday, a judge at Tel Aviv’s District Court begin hearing arguments as to why Israel’s Ministry of Defence (MoD) should revoke the export licence of NSO Group. The firm’s Pegasus software has been used to target journalists and activists across the globe – including in Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates. 
At the start of Thursday’s hearing the judge granted a request from the Ministry of Defence for a gag order on national security grounds.
The legal action seeking to force Israel’s Ministry of Defence to revoke NSO Group’s export licence is being brought by approximately 30 members and supporters of Amnesty International Israel and others from the human rights community. The action is supported by Amnesty International as part of a joint project with New York University School of Law’s Bernstein Institute for Human Rights and Global Justice Clinic.

Responding to the announcement that the Saudi Arabian human rights organization Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) is the 2020 recipient of the prestigious Dutch human rights award, the Geuzenpenning, Amnesty International Netherlands director Dagmar Oudshoorn said:
“This award recognizes the important work done by ACPRA members like Mohammed al-Qahtani, Abdullah al-Hamid and Mohammed al-Bajadi who have been in jail for years. This is a strong call from the Netherlands to release all of ACPRA’s founders and members from prison.”
“While Saudi Arabia has recently invested in expensive PR campaigns to improve its image, the continued detention of ACPRA members is one of the most telling examples of the true face of the Saudi authorities and its appalling human rights record.”
“This prestigious award is a reminder for the Dutch government and others to do everything within their power to ensure the release of all imprisoned human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia.”
ACPRA
The Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) is a Saudi Arabian human rights non-governmental organisation created in 2009. ACPRA campaigned for the rights of prisoners in Saudi Arabia until its closure in March 2013. The organization was forcibly shut down by Saudi Arabian authorities and all of its founding members have been detained and sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their work.
GEUZENPENNING
The Geuzenpenning (‘Beggar Medal’) is a Dutch award given to persons or organizations who have fought for democracy and against dictatorship, racism and discrimination. It has been awarded annually since 1987 in the city of Vlaardingen.

The evidence indicates that on 11 and 12 January security forces fired pointed pellets from airguns, usually used for hunting, at peaceful protesters causing bleeding and painful injuries. Security forces also used rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters as well as kicking and punching them, beating them with batons and carrying out arbitrary arrests. 
“It is appalling that Iran’s security forces have violently crushed peaceful vigils and protests by people demanding justice for the 176 passengers killed on the plane and expressing their anger at the Iranian authorities’ initial cover-up,” said Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.
“The use of unlawful force in the latest demonstrations is part of a long-standing pattern by Iranian security forces.”
Unlawful use of force
Testimonies and photographs obtained by Amnesty International indicate that security forces fired pointed pellets, causing painful wounds and requiring surgical treatment to remove the pellets, as well as injuries consistent with rubber bullet use. Such pellets are used for hunting small game and are completely inappropriate for use in any policing situation.
The organization’s Digital Verification Corps (DVC) also verified dozens of videos showing security forces firing tear gas into crowds of peaceful protesters.  
Security forces deployed on the streets, included the special forces of Iran’s police, paramilitary Basij and plain-clothes agents.
One of the videos verified by Amnesty International shows two women in Tehran lying injured and bleeding on the ground. In another video recorded nearby, a woman is seen lying on the ground in a pool of blood crying out in pain. The people helping them in the videos are heard saying they have been shot. Amnesty International has not been able to establish what type of ammunition was used to cause their injuries. 
Another video shows a man with a bleeding head wound. Two X-rays obtained by Amnesty International clearly show pellets lodged in the knee joint of one protester and the ankle of another.
Amnesty International has also verified images of security forces carrying shotguns, but it is unclear what type of ammunition was loaded in them.
The organization has received messages from several injured protesters who shared photographs showing their wounds and said they did not seek hospital treatment to remove the pointed pellets that remain painfully lodged in their bodies, fearing arrest.
Security and intelligence forces are maintaining a heavy presence in some hospitals raising fears they plan to arrest patients. Amnesty International has also received information that security forces have tried to
transfer some injured protesters to military hospitals. Some medical clinics and hospitals in Tehran have turned away injured people, telling them that, if the security and intelligence forces find out they were among the protesters, they will be arrested.
One man from Maali Abad in Shiraz, Fars province, who said he went to light a candle in solidarity with the plane crash victims on 12 January, said security forces outnumbered the crowd and created a “terrifying and intimidating atmosphere to frighten people away”.
“They were swearing at and beating everyone with batons all over their bodies, it didn’t matter if they were just passing by. It didn’t make any difference to them if they beat young or old, man or woman,” he said, adding that security forces also fired tear gas into the crowd. He was injured but did not seek hospital treatment for fear of arrest.
Another eyewitness, Mahsa from Tehran, described how security forces fired tear gas into the entrance hall of a metro station to stop people leaving to join the protest.
“There was so much tear gas… I was so mentally stressed and anxious that I initially didn’t even realize that I had been shot… The special forces of the police were firing pointed pellets at people. My coat is now
filled with holes and I have bruises on my body… The streets were filled with armed plain-clothes agents firing shots into the air and threating to shoot people… A member of the security forces chased me when they saw me filming the protest and that’s when I was shot in the leg with a pointed pellet… I’m in a lot of pain,” she said.
Mahsa added that the authorities had threatened doctors and that she had been turned away by three medical centres and even a veterinary clinic where she sought treatment. On 14 January, she was told by a doctor in a hospital in Tehran that she had to leave the hospital immediately because, if the intelligence department (Herasat) of the hospital found out that she was among the protesters, she would be arrested.
“The situation in Iran right now is even more painful than death. They are killing us slowly; they are torturing us to death,” she said.
In several videos taken inside Shademan metro station in Tehran, people are heard saying that security forces fired tear gas inside the station. Tear gas canisters are indiscriminate and can result in serious injury and even death, especially when used in an enclosed space. They should only ever be used in a targeted response to specific acts of violence and never to disperse peaceful protesters. They must also never be used in a confined space.
In many cases the actions by the security forces violated the absolute prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment under international law.
Arbitrary arrests
There are reports that scores of people, including university students, have been arrested in cities where protests have taken place, including Ahvaz in Khuzestan province; Esfahan, Esfahan province, Zanjan, Zanjan province; Amol and Babol, Mazandaran province; Bandar Abbas, Hormozgan province; Kermanshah, Kermanshah province; Sanandaj, Kurdistan province; Mashhad, Razavi Khorasan province; Shiraz, Fars province; Tabriz, East Azerbaijan province; and Tehran.
Amnesty International has received information that, in at least two cities, Amol and Tehran, the authorities are denying the families of some detainees information about their fate and whereabouts, amounting to the crime of enforced disappearance under international law.
The organization also received shocking allegations of sexual violence against at least one woman arbitrarily arrested by plain-clothes security agents and detained for several hours in a police station. According to an informed source, while in detention, the woman was taken to a room where she was questioned by a security official who forced her to perform oral sex on him and attempted to rape her.
“Iran’s security forces have once again carried out a reprehensible attack on the rights of Iranian people to peaceful expression and assembly and resorted to unlawful and brutal tactics,” said Philip Luther.
“The Iranian authorities must end the repression as a matter of urgency and ensure the security forces exercise maximum restraint and respect protesters’ rights to peaceful expression and assembly. Detainees must be protected from torture and other ill-treatment and all those who have been arbitrarily detained must be released.”
Background
The protests began on 11 January after the Iranian authorities admitted to having unintentionally shot down the Ukrainian plane, following three days of denials, at first attributing the plane crash to mechanical failure. The protests quickly expanded to include anti-establishment slogans and demands for transformation of the country’s political system, including a constitutional referendum and an end to the Islamic Republic system.  
These protests follow a bloody crackdown that saw more than 300 protesters killed and thousands arrested between 15 and 18 November 2019 when Iranian security forces resorted to lethal force. Amnesty International has called on member states of the UN Human Rights Council to hold a special session on Iran to mandate an inquiry into the unlawful killings of protesters, horrifying wave of arrests, enforced disappearances and torture of detainees, with a view to ensuring accountability.

Bill C-97, the Budget Implementation Act, 2019, No. 1, was tabled in the House of Commons in April 2019 as an omnibus Bill to implement budgetary provisions. It made amendments to various legislation including the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).  
Clause 306 of the Bill amends section 101(1) of the IRPA, which outlines the limited circumstances under which a claim for refugee protection in Canada is ineligible for referral to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). Clause 306 adds an additional ground of ineligibility: a claim will be ineligible for referral to the RPD if the claimant has made a claim for refugee protection to a country other than Canada before making a claim for refugee protection in Canada. This is in accordance with Canada’s information-sharing agreements with Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Any claimant in Canada who has made a previous claim in one of these countries would be ineligible to have their claims referred to the RPD, and the only possibility of refugee protection would be through a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA). 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSED LAW  
In our submissions to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, Amnesty International urged that clause 306 be withdrawn and not reintroduced. We also urged the Committee to withdraw the other IRPA amendment provisions. 
First, clause 306 is inconsistent with international refugee law. It runs counter to Canada’s obligations under the Refugee Convention by narrowing the scope of claims that are eligible to seek refugee protection. Automatic bars to considerations of asylum claims, such as the one introduced by Bill C-97, are not in conformity with the Convention. As well, failure to claim protection in another country is not grounds, within the Convention, to refuse to recognize refugee status. Article 3 of the Refugee Convention also prohibits discrimination among refugees on the grounds of race, religion, or country of origin. Bill C-97 discriminates between those claimants who have made a protection claim in a given category of states and those who have not. This is an analogous ground of discrimination contrary to the spirit of the Convention. 
Second, this provision of Bill C-97 creates a two-tier system of refugee protection: some claimants will have access to the IRB (an independent, quasi-judicial body) and others will have their claims decided by a PRRA officer (a system internal to the government). The UNHCR recommends there be a single central authority to determine refugee claims, and Bill C-97 erodes the status of the IRB as such an authority. There are also several substantive distinctions between the IRB and the PRRA. 
Third, Bill C-97 will have Canada rely on the refugee status determination procedures in countries with which Canada has information-sharing agreements, without any requirement concerning the quality of these procedures in those countries. Essentially, Canada would be shifting its sovereign, international legal obligations to the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. This is concerning given that refugee protections in these countries, with particular emphasis on Australia and the United States, are not uniformly consistent with international law. 
Rather than there being a class exemption against those who have made a prior claim, Amnesty International is of the view that each claim for refugee protection should be evaluated on an individual basis. 
STATUS OF BILL 
Bill C-97 was passed without the removal of clause 306 and received Royal Assent on 21 June 2019.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
A group of Innu claimed Aboriginal land rights to the Nitassinan territory, which overlaps both Quebec and Labrador. In an application to the Superior Court of Quebec, the Innu claimed that the activities of two corporations, the Iron Ore Company of Canada and the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway Company were causing social, cultural, spiritual, and economic damage to their communities, preventing them from practicing their traditional way of life, for which the companies were civilly liable. 
The Attorney General of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) then filed an application to remove Labrador from this proceeding, taking the position that the Superior Court of Quebec lacked jurisdiction over the aspects of the claim that concerned Labrador. The Court held that, per the Civil Code of Quebec, Quebec courts do have jurisdiction, since the companies had head offices in Quebec and since part of the injury was suffered in Quebec. The Attorney General of NL appealed the Court’s decision at the Quebec Court of Appeal, who dismissed the appeal on the grounds that the Superior Court of Quebec was in fact the court of competent jurisdiction given the substantial connection with Quebec and in light of the particular nature of Indigenous rights. The Court of Appeal also noted that it would be against the interests of access to justice and proportionality to sever Labrador from the claim of the Innu. That is, it would be too onerous to expect the Innu to bring forward the same claims in two different provinces, and so they should be able to bring their claim in full to the Superior Court of Quebec. The Court of Appeal also held that the doctrine of interprovincial jurisdictional immunity does not bar Quebec courts from having jurisdiction. 
Leave to appeal the Quebec Court of Appeal decision was granted to the Attorney General of NL by the Supreme Court of Canada in November 2018. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE 
Amnesty International’s submissions at the Supreme Court emphasized the importance of Canada’s international human rights obligations, particularly those surrounding Indigenous peoples and their land rights. We argued that the right to an effective remedy is guaranteed to Indigenous peoples under international law for violations of their rights to lands, territories and resources. The right to an effective remedy is codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international human rights instruments to which Canada is bound. 
The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) also protects Indigenous peoples’ right to redress, right to just and fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts, and right to effective remedies for the infringement of their land rights. We thus argued that Canada’s international legal obligation to guarantee an effective remedy to Indigenous peoples should inform the Court’s interpretations in this case. 
Ultimately, Canada’s international obligations require Canada to guarantee the Innu respondents the right to an effective remedy, taking into account the vulnerabilities of Indigenous claimants and their rights to just and fair procedures under UNDRIP. The Innu should be allowed to present a coherent body of evidence that is not restricted by provincial boundaries, as Indigenous peoples’ right to lands and territory derive from their prior ownership under their own systems of land and are therefore not subject to provincial borders. Disallowing allegations relating to Labrador territory would undermine their ability to obtain redress against the corporations in either Quebec or NL, thus inhibiting their ability to access an effective remedy, which would constitute a violation of international law. 
STATUS OF THE CASE  
The Supreme Court of Canada heard the appeal on 24 April 2019. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the lower courts, holding that Quebec courts do in fact have the jurisdiction to make a declaration about aboriginal rights and title over the Innu’s traditional territory even though part of that territory falls into Labrador. The Court focused their analysis of the issues, including the right to accessing an effective remedy, through the lens of reconciliation and the obligation of the Crown to act honourably within its relationship with Indigenous peoples.

January 13, 2020
Dear Prime Minister Trudeau and Premiers Horgan and Kenney,
We are writing this urgent Open Letter with respect to the Decision 1 (100) issued by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (UN CERD) on December 13, 2019 under its Early Warning and Urgent Action Procedure.  The decision calls for a halt to construction of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion, the Site C dam and the Coastal GasLink pipeline and cessation of forced evictions from related land defense camps, so as to ensure full respect for the rights of Indigenous peoples.  We are writing to the three of you collectively because aspects of the decision have significant implications for or require immediate decisions and actions by each of your governments. It is imperative that you all act without delay to ensure full compliance with this important United Nations human rights ruling in its entirety.
Specifically, the UN CERD has called on Canada to take the following urgent steps.  While the Committee directs the decision to Canada, some of the responsibility for compliance would of course rest at provincial level. 
Immediately cease construction of the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project and cancel all permits, until free, prior and informed consent is obtained from all the Secwepemc people.
Immediately suspend the construction of the Site C dam, until free, prior and informed consent is obtained from the West Moberly and Prophet River Nations.
Immediately halt the construction and suspend all permits and approvals of the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in the traditional and unceded lands and territories of the Wet’suwet’en people, until they grant their free, prior and informed consent.
Immediately cease forced eviction of Secwepemc and Wet’suwet’en peoples.
Guarantee that no force will be used against Secwepemc and Wet’suwet’en peoples and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and associated security and policing services will be withdrawn from their traditional lands.
Prohibit the use of lethal weapons, notably by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, against Indigenous Peoples.
In all instances, free, prior and informed consent should follow full and adequate discharge of the duty to consult. 
At the heart of the UN CERD decision is the Committee’s longstanding concern about the failure, across Canada, to uphold the important right of Indigenous Peoples to be meaningfully consulted and that important developments impacting their rights go forward on the basis of their free, prior and informed consent.  Over the course of many years, the Committee has repeatedly and frequently highlighted serious shortcomings both with respect to specific decisions that have been reached without FPIC being obtained or in which consultations have been inadequate, and also as a matter requiring broad law and policy reform.  These concerns have been consistently reflected in the UN CERD’s Concluding Observations, adopted in numerous reviews of Canada’s record of compliance with the country’s obligations under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.
Notably, therefore, in this recent Decision the Committee has also once again reiterated the importance of wider reforms, including: 
Establishing, in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, a legal and institutional framework to ensure adequate consultation with the view to obtain free, prior and informed consent regarding all legislation affecting Indigenous Peoples.
Taking necessary steps, in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, to incorporate free, prior and informed consent in domestic legislation.
Freezing present and future approval of largescale development projects that do not enjoy free, prior and informed consent from all Indigenous Peoples affected. 
At a minimum we look for assurance from your governments of an immediate suspension of construction of these three major projects, while consultations that meet international human rights requirements – such as free, prior and informed consent – go forward.
It is crucial that Canada comply with this decision for two fundamental reasons.  First and foremost, that action is urgently required because of the serious nature of the human rights violations at stake.  All of your governments have recognized that significant shifts are required to move forward with reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and show full regard for their rights in the Constitution and under international law.  If promises to do so are not met with concrete action, very much including tough and challenging decisions such as those required here, then the words remain empty.  That is the shameful history that Canada absolutely must leave behind. 
Secondly, compliance is so important in this instance as a means of demonstrating the strong regard that your three governments have for the international human rights system.  At a time when an increasing number of countries are actively undermining and flouting their international human rights obligations, it is more important than ever for countries like Canada to demonstrate a strong commitment to international human rights norms and institutions such as the UN CERD entrusted by governments with responsibility for overseeing compliance with those norms. 
Governments around the world often seek to justify their failure to live up to international human rights obligations by arguing that the cost of protecting rights is too high, insisting that there are already adequate national laws and processes in place to protect rights, or sacrificing the rights of one group (which in many countries is often Indigenous Peoples) because of the economic interests of others. 
Canada must not in any way echo those excuses; but instead demonstrate that we do indeed put human rights first and in doing so, expect other states to do similarly.
We look forward to assurances that you will immediately comply with the UN CERD’s decision with respect to the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion, Site C dam and Coastal GasLink pipeline, as well as the steps you will be taking to implement the full set of recommendations from the Committee.

Canada underwent the seventh review of its compliance to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in November 2018, for which Amnesty International provided written submissions. 
Amnesty International’s submissions primarily emphasized concerns about a variety of ways in which Canadian action or inaction risks complicity in torture or other ill-treatment. Our submissions highlighted key issues including Canada’s inadequate efforts to protect Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people from violence and forced sterilization, prisoner transfers and diplomatic assurances that would return individuals to countries where there are substantial grounds for believing that they would be subject to torture, the policing of indigenous protests resulting in the infliction of ill-treatment during protests such as the Indigenous land protest at Tyendinaga, the barriers faced by victims of torture inflicted outside Canada to obtaining civil redress and remedies due to the State Immunity Act, Canada’s failure to adopt the Article 3 universal prohibition against refoulement into its domestic law, and solitary confinement. Also of key concern was Canada’s approach to refugee protection and the complicity in torture or other ill-treatment arising from said approach, particularly in light of the Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States (for more information, see Amnesty International’s ongoing challenge against the federal government regarding the STCA), concerns with immigration detention, and immigration security certificates. 
 We also recommended that Canada reconfirm its intention to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, provide information on the progress of consultations with provincial and territorial governments, and accelerate said consultations. 
Amnesty International also put forward a supplementary submission on violence against Indigenous women and girls, where we took the position that such violence, when perpetrated by non-state actors, is inflicted with the consent and acquiescence of the state due to the state’s failure to take measures to prevent said violence and provide remedies, referring to articles 1 and 16 of the Convention against Torture.  
OUTCOMES OF THE REVIEW 
In its concluding observations, the Committee against Torture expressed a number of concerns regarding Canada’s failure to fulfill its international obligations with respect to torture and ill-treatment, including the following issues:  
CURRENT STATUS  
The Committee highlighted four urgent issues for Canada to report on within one year of the 2018 review: the forced sterilization of Indigenous women and girls, diplomatic assurances, security certificates, and adequate redress for the torture and ill-treatment of Canadians detained abroad.  
Amnesty International welcomed the Committee’s concluding observations. Concerned about Canada’s lack of progress in implementing the Committee’s recommendations, we currently await Canada’s interim response to the Committee’s review.

Canada underwent a review of its compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in August 2017. Amnesty International provided written submissions to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Our submissions drew attention to Amnesty International’s concerns with respect to the rights of Indigenous peoples and refugees and migrants. Amnesty International highlighted the following concerns: 
OUTCOMES OF THE REVIEW 
In its Concluding Observations, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination noted several concerns with Canada’s compliance with the Convention. These concerns include the absence of a national action plan against racism and the lack of adequate anti-racism framework legislation in all provinces and territories. Also of concern were racist hate crimes, racial profiling by police and border agents, and the disproportionate incarceration of indigenous peoples and African-Canadians, including in solitary confinement. Employment and education discrimination against racialized persons was also noted. The Committee raised concerns with the inadequate access to justice provided to victims of Canadian transnational corporations whose activities negatively impact the rights of persons outside Canada. 
Concerning Indigenous peoples, the Committee noted Canada’s failure to fully adopt the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Also of concern was Canada’s violation of the land rights of Indigenous peoples, the high rates of violence against Indigenous women and girls, and the lack of an independent mechanism to re-examine cases of violence against Indigenous women and girls with inadequate or biased investigations. 
Regarding migrants and refugees, the Committee raised concerns regarding the absence of a time limit on immigration detention, the detention of migrant children, the consequences of the Safe Third Country Agreement, the poor conditions faced by temporary migrant workers, and the lack of access to health care for undocumented migrants. 
CURRENT STATUS  
The Committee requested an interim report from Canada within one year on four issues of urgent concern, including the Site C dam, Mount Polley, immigration detention, and the Safe Third Country Agreement. On 4 March 2019, Canada submitted its interim report providing updates and information on these four areas. 
Amnesty International put forward a follow-up submission in response to this interim report to point out ongoing areas of concern. These include Canada’s decision to not respond to the Committee’s recommendation about Site C in the interim report and the failure of Canada’s governments to withdraw approval for the Site C project. As well, we noted failures on the part of government officials to regulate the Mount Polley Mining Corporation, which did not result in an independent analysis of the health impacts of the disaster on Indigenous peoples. Amnesty called for mitigation of the effects of the Mount Polley disaster on Indigenous peoples. We noted that the current immigration detention regime, which Canada claimed is constitutional, subjects individuals to the risk of arbitrary, indefinite, and unlawful detention. We also challenged Canada’s position that the U.S. is a safe country for asylum-seekers and refugees under the Safe Third Country Agreement.

Canada underwent its second Universal Periodic Review (UPR) before the UN Human Rights Council in May 2018. Amnesty International provided submissions highlighting our concerns about Canada’s ongoing flawed implementation of human rights obligations. In our submissions, Amnesty International noted Canada’s piecemeal rather than systemic approach to implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), as well as the delay in implementing an ombudsperson to regulate the human rights impact of Canadian extractive companies abroad and to provide accountability for their activities. We also commented on the lack of effective enforcement, and the denial of judicial protection, for economic, social, and cultural rights. 
Also of concern are human rights violations against Indigenous peoples, including land rights and methylmercury contamination affecting Indigenous rights and communities; the prevalence of gender-based violence, particularly against Indigenous women, girls, and two-spirit people; the arbitrary and unlawful detention of immigrants, denial of health care for undocumented migrants, and the exposure of refugee claimants to human rights violations due to the Safe Third Country Agreement; and concerns regarding torture, the deportation of persons to places that would put them at risk of torture or ill-treatment (refoulement), and solitary confinement. 
We made several recommendations to Canada based on these concerns in our submissions. 
OUTCOMES OF THE REVIEW 
107 states participated in Canada’s UPR and asked questions regarding the country’s human rights record, resulting in 275 recommendations set out in the report of the UPR Working Group. The recommendations reflected concerns about the ratification of international human rights instruments (including Optional Protocols) to which Canada is not yet a party; the coordination and mechanisms of implementing human rights obligations across all levels of government; discrimination and human rights violations against racial minorities and Indigenous people; the protection of the rights and languages of Indigenous peoples, including addressing access to health, water, food security, education, and employment; violence and other discrimination against women, particularly Indigenous women and girls (including forced sterilization); racial profiling and hate crimes; human rights impacts of transnational Canadian companies operating overseas; excessive force by law enforcement and disproportionate incarceration of minority groups; employment disparities; rights for persons with disabilities; and the conditions of immigrants and refugees, particularly immigration detention and refoulement. 
Canada responded to the UPR in August 2018 and accepted 208 out of 275 recommendations. Amnesty International is disappointed in Canada’s response, because these acceptances primarily confirm initiatives that are already underway and do not substantially advance the state of human rights in Canada. The lack of concrete plans and timelines to coordinate implementation of international human rights across federal, provincial, and territorial governments is concerning. 
Of notable concern to Amnesty is Canada’s refusal to address concerns about inadequate protection of economic, social and cultural rights; continued inaction regarding a national action plan to address violence against Indigenous women and girls; and Canada’s continuing approval of major resource projects without the consent or partnership of Indigenous peoples.

But we face enormous challenges in the decade ahead. Here are eight ways that Canada can champion human rights in the 2020s. 
First step is to adopt overdue legislation making the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Canada’s framework for rights and reconciliation. And to show we truly mean it: address mercury poisoning at Grassy Narrows First Nation, halt construction of the Site C dam in NE British Columbia and redress years of discrimination against First Nations children. 
Second, the final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls has been released. Now is time to create a National Action Plan to End Violence Against Indigenous Women, Girls and Two-Spirit People, harmonized with a wider National Action Plan to Prevent and Address Gender-Based Violence. 
Third, across the globe, refugees face increasing hostility when they seek safety. Disgracefully, Canada restricts access to protection in Canada for refugees who fear the perils of Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of refugees and migrants. Lifting the Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement would show the world that we embrace the fundamentals of refugee protection. 
Fourth, we are beginning to shake off the smug denial that racism is a concern in Canada. We need to move from anguished hand-wringing to meaningful action. Governments across the country should work to address racism in policing, beginning with consistent laws to ban carding and random street checks. 
Fifth, naming the first Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise last April may help address human rights abuses by Canadian mining and other companies when they operate abroad. But that will remain an empty gesture unless the federal government grants her office the powers to conduct effective investigations. 
Sixth, Canada has been legally bound to uphold the UN Arms Trade Treaty since September. That means it is more essential than ever to cancel the deal to sell $15 billion worth of armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia, at a time when that country’s military is responsible for extensive war crimes in Yemen. 
Seventh, one vital way for Canada to show genuine human rights commitment is consistency in how we respond to concerns around the world. It is of course vital to speak out about Iran, Venezuela and North Korea. But there must be the same resolve with respect to grave concerns in Israel, Colombia and China. 
And finally, what of the global climate crisis, likely the most serious human rights challenge the world faces? Are we doing enough? Not even close. This decade must begin by prioritizing more ambitious nation-wide action to reduce Canada’s carbon emissions. Without it, all other human rights struggles are for naught. 
The bottom line? Canada cannot afford to be casual about human rights in the 2020s. This is the decade for human rights to come out on top.

0,UK GOVERNMENT ‘DELIBERATELY AND DESTRUCTIVELY’ PREVENTING CHILD REFUGEES FROM REUNITING WITH THEIR FAMILIES – NEW REPORT,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/news/uk-government-deliberately-and-destructively-preventing-child-refugees-reuniting-their/,"The UK Government is deliberately and destructively preventing child refugees from being with their families, Amnesty International UK, Refugee Council and Save the Children said in a new report today.

The 38-page report – Without My Family – shows how the UK Government’s refugee family reunion rules – which block child refugees in the UK from being reunited with their families – are at odds with national law and a flagrant breach of international law, causing irreversible harm to children in this country.
Current UK law allows adult refugees rebuilding their lives in the country to sponsor their immediate family members to join them. Child refugees, however, are deprived of this right. The UK is one of the only countries in Europe to prevent child refugees from sponsoring their family members to join them.
Based on first-hand testimonies from children and young people aged 15-25 (all of whom arrived in the UK whilst under 18) the report details the devastating effects of family separation on children who have sought safety in this country, including constant anxiety, fear for their families’ safety, and in some cases serious mental health consequences.
Habib*, 17, fled Sudan after being tortured and imprisoned at just 15 years old. He travelled to Libya, leaving behind his mother and younger siblings. In Libya he remained unsafe, treated so badly he still spoke of his flashbacks several years later. He finally found safety in the UK but remains separated from his family. He said:
“I haven’t seen my family for nearly three years now. It is a long time and I miss my mum. It is really hard. It is something that you cannot forget about. You can cover it, but you can’t forget…Being without your family, it is like you have a body without a soul.”
Social workers and other professionals spoke of their distress at witnessing the children they care for having to cope without family. The report also points to the consistent criticism the Government’s policy has been subject to, from senior judges to specialist Committees of parliamentarians and the Committee on the Rights of the Child.
In 2018, MPs from across the political spectrum voted with an overwhelming majority to change to these harmful rules. Despite this, the Government has continuously delayed and blocked the changes from happening. Amnesty International, Refugee Council and Save the Children are calling for urgent action to ensure child refugees are given equal opportunities to be with their families.
Kate Allen, Amnesty International UK’s Director, said:
“The UK Government is deliberately and destructively preventing child refugees from being reunited with their families. A simple change to the UK Government’s policy would transform the lives of these children and help ensure they grow up safe and secure with the people they most need and love. “
Maurice Wren, Chief Executive of the Refugee Council, said:
“The UK’s rules on refugee family reunion are a flagrant breach of the Government’s legal obligations to act at all times in the best interests of the child. For many separated children, being reunited with family members is indisputably in their best interests, yet in the UK we choose to keep them apart for the inhumane reason that this might deter others from seeking safety and protection. Faced with the clear evidence in this report of the harm that enforced separation causes children, the Home Secretary should see reason and change these rules immediately.”
Daniela Reale, Lead Child Protection and Children on the Move – Save the Children UK, said:
“There is clear evidence that keeping children separated from their families causes long-lasting psychological, health, social and developmental damage for children of any age. Children have a right to be with their families, and governments have an obligation to protect children. The UK must change the rules so child refugees can be reunited with their loved ones.”

Harmful rules
Only 1,070 children – less than three a day – have been recognised as refugees in the UK this year. Having fled conflict, persecution and human rights abuses, the UK Government itself has recognised their refugee status and stated that it would be unsafe for them to return to the country they escaped. Yet it blocks these children from being reunited with their family members.
The research in this report by Amnesty, Refugee Council and Save the Children details how the UK Government’s policy on refugee family reunion currently: 
prevents child refugees who have sought safety in the UK from being joined by their parents, brothers, or sisters;
leaves the UK as one of the only countries in Europe that refuses to grant child refugees the right to be reunited with even their closest family; and
is directly at odds with national and international law, contravening the principle of the best interests of the child 
Running for their lives
Children interviewed for this report spoke of how they were seeking safety in the UK having been forced to flee their home country after seeing their homes destroyed, loved ones killed, or following torture or persecution.
Many of the young people we interviewed had been directly targeted, either for forced conscription or for interrogation and torture by their home country’s security forces.
Rifat, aged 17, said his parents had always told him he would stay with them in Syria:
“But then [the military] came to my home and said, ‘You are going to join us to fight and that time I was hiding myself for one month at home and then my father told me that they had got our neighbour’s child, he was 15, he was my age, and then I run away from home. They didn’t want me to go but it was for my safety. They take any young children.”
Impact of life without their families
The report interviewed a range of professionals – social workers, caseworkers, lawyers – who spoke of the deep levels of distress they’ve witnessed amongst children who have sought sanctuary in the UK but then been separated from their parents. All highlighted the crucial role of family in terms of keeping children physically safe, as well as for other developmental needs and outcomes such as education, social integration, wellbeing and identity.
Diana, a social worker who supported Hemin, a 16-year old from Iraq, said:
“Hemin shakes a lot – he is a child of war – and his mum would always make sure that when he was scared and shaking that she would sleep next to him. He always says to me that it is the little things that make the big things, when he is talking about his mum.”
Evidence shows that child refugees experience multiple traumatic events, in addition to the cumulative stress of displacement, and are much more vulnerable to psychological distress than non-refugee children.
Binar, 17-years-old from Iraq, said:
“I was taken to the hospital because I was mentally in a very bad state. I had a bad experience. They prescribed me very strong tablets. They prescribed me tablets and injections… My life changed after I went to hospital. I became a different person… I had such a tough experience… it was because I got separated from my family and I was thinking about them all of the time.”
The current law on child family reunion
The UK’s policies on child family reunion are at odds with their legal obligations under national, international and regional human rights law as well as international humanitarian and refugee law.
In the UK, the immigration rules allow adult refugees in the UK to sponsor their partners, or their children provided they are under 18. However, child refugees are explicitly excluded from this provision.
The failure to provide family reunion for children to be reunited with their adult family members does not include full consideration of a child’s best interests.
The best interests of a child require consideration of a durable solution, which includes reunion with parents and siblings. As a result of this rule child refugees in the UK are condemned to live apart from their family, often growing up instead in the UK care system. This puts at risk their safety and wellbeing in the UK.
Being reunited with close family is often critical to a refugee’s chances of integration and recovery. Being separated from immediate family is clearly not generally in the child’s best interests and is potentially damaging to their welfare and development.
UK Government argument unfounded and indefensible
The report exposes how there is no evidence to support the Government’s argument that the prospect of family reunification could encourage families to send children into Europe unaccompanied in order to act as an ‘anchor’ for other family members. It covers comparable evidence from other countries and shows the increasing criticism from the United Nations, UK immigration courts and parliamentarians.
The Home Office Select Affairs Committee recently called the refugee family reunion rules ‘perverse’.
Recommendations:
Amnesty, Refugee Council and Save the Children, and the Families Together coalition are calling for an urgent change to the refugee family reunion rules: 
Child refugees in the UK to have the right to sponsor their close family so they can rebuild their lives together and help them integrate in their new community.  
The definition of who qualifies as family to be expanded so that young people who have turned 18 and elderly parents can live in safety with their families in the UK.  
The reintroduction of legal aid so refugees who have lost everything have the support they need to afford and navigate the complicated process of being reunited with their families.

The organization has released a joint statement, along with Transparency International and Civicus, explaining why it will not be engaging in this year’s C20 process, a cycle of preparatory meetings leading up to the annual G20 summit, which started yesterday with a three-day “kick-off meeting”.
“The C20 is supposed to provide a platform for civil society voices from around the world to influence the G20 agenda. Since Saudi Arabia has locked up most of its own independent activists, the only domestic organizations present will be aligned with the government – which makes a mockery of the whole process,” said Netsanet Belay, Research and Advocacy Director at Amnesty International.
“The C20 in Riyadh is a sham. We cannot participate in a process which is being abused by a state which censors all free speech, criminalizes activism for women’s and minority rights, as well as homosexuality, and tortures and executes critics.”
Saudi Arabia took over the G20 presidency in December 2019. It has recently invested in expensive PR campaigns to improve its image, and hosted several high-profile sporting events which draw international visitors. But behind this carefully cultivated façade, Saudi Arabia’s human rights record is as appalling as ever.
Saudi Arabia is responsible for the extrajudicial execution of the journalist and peaceful critic Jamal Khashoggi. More than a year after his murder in October 2018, there has been no justice or accountability for his death.
The country’s leading women’s rights activists remain behind bars and on trial for their promotion of women’s rights in the country. Scores of other individuals, including human rights defenders, have been serving lengthy prison terms for their peaceful activism or have been arbitrarily detained for up to a year and a half without charges. The Saudi Arabian authorities have also carried out executions following unfair trials and routine torture and other ill-treatment in custody.
Background
The Saudi-led C20 process has already failed to guarantee the C20’s fundamental principles. The appointment of the Chairs of working groups and various committees was opaque and non-consultative, while arbitrary decisions have excluded experienced international groups. The C20 process is led by the King Khalid Foundation, which is connected to the Saudi Royal Family, and cannot be considered as transparent, inclusive and participatory. Since the Saudi authorities ban political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups, there is no way the C20 meetings can be the free and open discussions they are designed to be.

WHAT IS THIS CASE ABOUT? 
On 21 June 2018, the federal government of Canada passed the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which implemented the federal carbon emissions pricing system by imposing minimum national prices on carbon emissions to encourage the reduction of emissions. The GGPPA is a “backstop,” meaning that if a provincial or territorial government does not enact an adequate system that meets the national minimum price of carbon, the federal pricing system will be implemented. 
The constitutionality of the GGPPA was challenged by the provincial governments of Saskatchewan and Ontario. Both provinces argued that the GGPPA is not a valid exercise of the “national concern” branch of the federal government’s POGG (Peace, Order, and Good Government) powers, because such an exercise would severely limit provincial jurisdiction and autonomy by infringing on matters that fall within provincial powers. 
Saskatchewan argued that the GGPPA’s selective taxation is also unconstitutional, as it runs counter to the constitutional principle of federalism and s.53 of the Constitution Act (1867). Similarly, Ontario argued that the GGPPA contravenes s.91 and s.53 of the Constitution Act.  
The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan rejected both lines of argument to conclude that the GGPPA is not unconstitutional on these bases. The Court of Appeal for Ontario also rejected both arguments. The Ontario Court concluded that the environment is an area of shared constitutional responsibility, and that the GGPPA is not an unconstitutional exercise of the POGG power by the federal government. Both provincial appeal court decisions are being challenged by the provinces before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL’S LEGAL CHALLENGE 
Amnesty International, as an intervenor on this case at the Supreme Court, argued that ambiguities in the interpretation of Canada’s constitution should be resolved in a way that maximizes Canada’s compliance with its international human rights and environmental obligations, both at the federal and provincial level. 
In this case, Canada is obligated to international environmental treaties, including the Paris Agreement, as well as broader human rights obligations, including the obligation to uphold the rights to life, liberty, security of the person, adequate standards of living, health, food and water, and the rights of Indigenous peoples (as codified in ICCPR, ICESCR, and UNDRIP), all of which are threatened by climate change. Constitutional interpretation of the division of powers must be informed by these obligations as they apply to climate change. Thus, the federal government does in fact have the constitutional authority to enact minimum standards to prevent and reduce the effects of climate change, as a way to uphold Canada’s obligations to the international community. 
STATUS OF THE CASE  
In May 2019, the Saskatchewan provincial government filed an appeal of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In August 2019, the Ontario provincial government did the same for the Ontario Court of Appeal decision. The appeals are tentatively scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court in June 2020, after being postponed from their original March 2020 dates due to public health concerns.

Following the lower house’s vote in favour of repealing discriminatory sections of the penal code last June, the bill proposing amendments will be presented to the National Council, the upper house of parliament, this month.
“If the amendment bill is passed by the upper house, this will be an important step in recognizing that Bhutan supports the equality of all citizens regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. For a country that prides itself on the happiness of its people, Bhutan must without any delay rid itself of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relationships,” said Babu Ram Pant, South Asia Campaigner at Amnesty International.
Although no one is believed to have been convicted or prosecuted under these provisions until now, the mere existence of such discriminatory laws creates a chilling effect, and exacerbates discrimination and stigma against LGBTI people – subjecting them to harassment, blackmail and violence.
Activists say many LGBTI individuals—especially those from marginalized backgrounds—face discrimination and harassment in their everyday lives including at their workplaces, schools, homes and hospitals.
“LGBTI people in Bhutan as well as other allies around the world look forward to welcoming this historic decision championing equality for all citizens. The amendment will be the first step towards removing discrimination, harassment, bullying and violence that many LGBTI people or those perceived to be LGBTI continue to face in Bhutan,” said Babu Ram Pant.
Background
Under the penal code of Bhutan (2004), Section 213 currently criminalizes same-sex sexual activities as “unnatural sex”, defined as “sodomy” or any other sexual conduct that is against “the order of nature”, while section 214 states that “the offence of unnatural sex shall be petty misdemeanour”.
In June 2019, the Bhutanese Minister of Finance, Lyonpo Namgay Tshering, proposed the motion in the National Assembly to remove section 213 of the penal code as part of the penal code amendment bill, which was passed with an overwhelming majority. The amendment proposal needs to be endorsed by the National Council before being officially sent for royal assent.
In July 2017, the Committee on the Rights of the Child in its concluding observations on the combined third to fifth periodic reports, recommended the government of Bhutan develop and implement initiatives to combat violence, sexual harassment and bullying among school children, including LGBTI children.

“The authorities under Nicolás Maduro have made repeated and sustained attempts to dismantle any form of political dissent in the country, committing serious human rights violations including the use of torture, enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International.
The organization has learned of what could amount to the forced disappearance of the congressmen Gilber Caro and Victor Ugas, who were arrested by alleged state agents on 20 December 2019. Although both were brought before a judge, the authorities have denied their families any information about where they are being held.
Furthermore, the campaigns of stigmatization and threats against members of the opposition, such as the attacks against the congresswoman Delsa Solórzano, add to the many examples of the persistent harassment and intimidation of opposition legislators and workers of the National Assembly who have been arbitrarily detained. In recent years, dozens of opposition members have been forced to flee the country and seek asylum due to the threats they have received from the Maduro government.
“Amnesty International will continue to be vigilant in the face of this new political crisis around the National Assembly and the risk of more arbitrary arrests or other aggressions, which may include attacks on legislators and journalists, stigmatization campaigns, restrictions on freedom of movement, threats of physical violence, torture, arbitrary arrests and illegal searches,” said Erika-Guevara Rosas.
“The UN Fact-Finding Mission charged with investigating those responsible for crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations occurring in Venezuela must pay attention to this new wave of repression. The Venezuelan authorities must remember that these human rights violations may constitute crimes under international law that will not go unpunished.”
Additional information:
In last year’s report, Hunger for Justice: Crimes against Humanity in Venezuela, Amnesty International concluded that the selective extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detentions, and deaths and injuries caused by the excessive use of force by Nicolás Maduro’s government as part of a systematic and widespread policy of repression since at least 2017 may constitute crimes against humanity.

“The violence unleashed on the students inside the JNU campus is shocking. For the Delhi police to tolerate such a violent attack that has resulted in grave injuries is even worse and shows a shameful disregard for the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. It is alarming to note the ease with which the mob entered a ‘secured’ university space and were able to mete out such violence. Various media reports and students have alleged that the police stood witness to the attack and refused to control and arrest the mob. They have also alleged that ambulances were blocked from entering the campus.”
“Whether it be JNU or Jamia Millia University, the Delhi police have repeatedly failed to protect the students peacefully protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The authorities have failed in their duty to ensure the safety of the students, signalling a shameful complicity of the state machinery. Moreover, the constant demonization of the students by the Government of India continues to increase their vulnerability to such attacks and awards impunity to the attackers. It is not an isolated incident and must be seen amidst the larger pattern of pushback as massive protests continue unabated across the country. It is imperative that the government listens to its citizens.”
BACKGROUND:
 On the evening of 5 January, a masked mob lay siege to the central university for more than two hours, injuring over two dozen students, and Prof Sucharita Sen along with other teachers from the university. The attack took place after a peace march was conducted by the Teachers Association at the university. Among those grievously injured include JNU Students Union President Aishe Ghosh, who was left bleeding. The mob was allegedly armed with rods and sledgehammers as they intimidated the students by destroying campus property, entering hostel rooms and chanting slogans such as “Kill the leftists”, “Kill the Anti-Nationals” and “Desh ke Gaddaron ko, goli maaron saalon ko” (The traitors must be shot dead). While an FIR has been registered against the attackers, no arrests have been made by the Delhi police so far.

“Vice President Robredo gave a damning insider account of the government’s murderous approach to the drug problem. This is yet more proof that the Duterte administration should address the problem through drug rehabilitation programs rooted in communities – not through a brutal policy of extrajudicial killings.
“Robredo’s assessment gives credence to what Amnesty International and others have said time and again: the government’s ‘war on drugs’ is a war on the poor, marked by human rights violations and rampant impunity for the police and other high ranking officials. Another approach is possible, one based on respect for human rights, human life and human dignity, which addresses the social conditions that give rise to illegal drug use and trade.
“President Duterte must end Oplan Tokhang – his violent drug war policy – and initiate credible and independent investigations into past deadly operations, to obtain justice for countless victims of extrajudicial killings over the last four years.”
Background
On 6 January 2020, Vice President Leni Robredo publicly discussed her office’s findings during her 18-day stint as co-chair of the Inter-agency Committee on Anti-illegal Drugs (ICAD). She said that the government has only been going after small-time drug pushers, and that treatment and rehabilitation programs are inadequate. She called on the government to end the deadly Oplan Tokhang (‘Operation Knock and Plead’), bring proceedings against high-value targets and improve its collection and interpretation of drug-related data.
Robredo was appointed to the committee on 6 November 2019. In the weeks that she held the position, she demanded transparency and access to documents and intelligence reports. She also called on the government to address the policy of abusive drug watchlists and recommended the adoption of a health-based approach. On 24 November 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte fired her from her role.
Thousands of people have been killed in a wave of state-sanctioned violence since the start of President Duterte’s presidency in 2016, many of which are extrajudicial executions.
In July 2019, Amnesty International published a report, “They just kill”: Ongoing extrajudicial executions and other human rights violations in the Philippines ‘war on drugs,’ which documented how police commanders who previously supervised abusive operations in Manila were later transferred to Central Luzon and have continued to oversee brutal operations there. Amnesty International is concerned that the killings reach the threshold of crimes against humanity.

If ever there was a need for a resolution for a new decade, this is it: put human rights first. 
A tumultuous decade of widespread conflict and demonizing politics is wrapping up; far too much war, alongside the rise of politicians everywhere peddling bigotry and fear. 
These past 10 years have witnessed the unforgivable and unending agony of Syria, Yemen, South Sudan, Gaza, Venezuela, Libya, Ukraine, the Rohingya crisis, the mass incarceration of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in China, and so many other corners of our world racked by turmoil and violence. 
It has also been the decade of Donald Trump, Viktor Orban, Vladimir Putin, Narendra Modi, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jair Bolsonaro, Matteo Salvini, Rodrigo Duterte, Xi Jinping and an increasing cadre of world leaders who have deliberately set out to undermine human rights. They unapologetically stoke hate, racism and misogyny, rising to and wielding power on the backs of women, refugees, racial and religious minorities, Indigenous peoples, LGBTQ people and human-rights defenders. 
We have faced those disturbing currents in Canada as well, be it Quebec’s Bill 21, the “war room” campaign against environmentalists and Indigenous-rights activists in Alberta or the toxic anti-refugee messages brought into last year’s federal election by the People’s Party of Canada. 
Yet, it has also been an incredible decade of inspiring choruses of resistance demanding rights and justice; propelled by unprecedented waves of protest, determination, indignation and courage, literally all over the world. Resistance so often led by youth and by women. 
This decade has been a breathless time of mass mobilization, as staggering numbers of people have spilled out into public squares, streets and alleyways in communities large and small: The “Arab Spring” protests across the Middle East and North Africa, Idle No More, Black Lives Matter, FridaysForFuture climate strikes, the #MeToo movement and Women’s Marches and the March for Our Lives against gun violence in the United States. 
Protesters who refused to give up have toppled cruel leaders, stopped unjust laws and catalyzed struggles against deep inequities in Sudan, Hong Kong, Chile, Haiti, Algeria and Lebanon; and have been met with terrifying violence from security forces leading to hundreds of deaths in Iran and Iraq. 
The decade has also been marked by the tension of technology’s wonders and threats. The digital world has opened up exciting new platforms of communication and means of accessing and sharing information, often to considerable benefit for human-rights movements. However, we have also witnessed an explosion of hate, racism and sexism on social media; growing awareness that the rise of artificial intelligence brings unimagined human-rights worries; and new tools of state surveillance and intrusion into our privacy that pose some of the most insidious and chilling threats to human rights that we have ever seen. 
Above it all – as we move into the 2020s – the urgency of responding to the gravest human-rights challenge of our time, the global climate crisis, deepens daily. And the outright refusal of governments and businesses, including in Canada, to pursue climate action and deliver climate justice that is truly and ambitiously serious, stands out as perhaps the most unforgivable human-rights failing of the decade. 
The decade behind us reminds us that the threats to human-rights protection run deep and demand vigilance; the power of the people is, ultimately, unstoppable; there is great risk in embracing all that technology offers without addressing its many perils; and that if we do not safeguard our one and only shared global climate, all of our human-rights effort will ultimately be for naught. 
And therefore with deep resolve it is imperative and it is incumbent upon us all to make the 2020s a very different decade. 
A decade in which women’s equality, women’s leadership and women’s power is consistently at the fore. 
A decade in which we at long last deliver the commitment – an empty one for far too long – of a world that will “never again” witness mass atrocities. 
A decade in which we all live up to our shared, personal responsibility to say no to racism, bigotry and hate. 
A decade that tackles the climate crisis; finally embracing the catastrophic reality that without a stable climate, all human-rights struggles inevitably mean nothing. 
Quite simply, a decade that – no matter the cost, the inconvenience, the controversy or the opposing interests – puts human rights first.

Over the past year AIC(ES) has taken steps to begin a full and proper implementation of our National Youth Strategy. Part of this includes changing our four-month youth internship into a two-year full-time fellowship position. 
As the first ever Youth Fellow at Amnesty my role is dedicated to advancing the diverse perspectives, ideas and concerns of young people across the movement. I am eager and excited to advocate for radical change and ensure young people are at the centre of Amnesty’s work while approaching human rights through intersectional and decolonized lenses. 
I graduated from McGill University in 2017 with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and minor in World Religions. In October 2019 I joined Amnesty in Ottawa after having spent time at three other non-profit organizations and bringing experience in government relations, public policy and lobbying. 
As the Founder and Executive Director of Leading in Colour I regularly provide young racialized activists with the necessary tools to conduct their advocacy efficiently. This is a skill set I hope to bring to Amnesty’s continued lobbying efforts. 
As the fellowship is developed I hope to create additional programming for young people to engage with at Amnesty.

The ATT is now legally binding on 105 countries, a represents a great advancement in international law. 
On the very same day that Canada became officially bound by the ATT, Global Affairs Canada officials signed off on a memorandum to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, providing an “update” on the situation of Saudi export permit.  The officials could not “identify any existing permits or pending applications that would be of concern.” 
This assessment is very troubling. There are 48 Saudi weapons permits pending, and government officials have given them a green light without providing much of an explanation about why they are convinced that these weapons do not risk being used by Saudi Arabia to commit human rights violations, in spite of the ongoing conflict in Yemen. Before Foreign Affairs Minster Francois Philippe Champagne makes the final decision on these permits, it will be crucial for him to have a complete picture of the risks involved in exporting weapons to Saudi Arabia, in order to make sure that Canada is fully meeting its new legal obligations under the ATT.

Our work around the rights of Indigenous Peoples has grown from 6 cases in 2007 to 38 cases in 2018. Although, we still tend to prioritize work on individual civil and political rights cases, there is a clear ongoing effort to respond to the complexity of the problems and agendas Indigenous Peoples face. This evolution of our work has benefited enormously from long-term relationships with Indigenous communities and people. 
The complexity and historical depth of human rights violations, and the dynamics of the communities and organizations of Indigenous Peoples, require careful relationship building and the implementation of long-term strategies to create real change in the face of ongoing colonization.

They were intended to provoke questions and recentre Indigenous ways of being and thinking. 
Why is this important? 
Indigenous Peoples have been clear that all Indigenous economic, social, cultural, political and civil rights derive from their connection to and use of lands, waters and territories. This means that unlike settler Canadian understandings of land rights as being merely connected to individual freedoms and economic production or assets, Indigenous understandings of land rights relate territory to self-determination, identity, spirituality and religion, language, culture and collective responsibilities. 
Once this difference of perspective is recognized it is easy to see why displacement, forced relocation, the Indian Residential Schools, the reserve system, and so many other policies of the Canadian government have devastated Indigenous communities and yet settler Canadians do not always see how they have contributed to the genocide perpetrated against Indigenous Peoples. 
As part of organizing and activism, an evolving practice of acknowledgment can contribute to addressing settler colonialism and build better relationships with Indigenous Peoples creating a more just society. 
Acknowledging territory is the process of deliberately naming that this is Indigenous land and water and specific Indigenous Peoples have inherent rights in the territory. It provides an opportunity for all of us to reflect on our relationship with the land and our contributions to the ongoing process of colonization that deeply roots activist work. 
Why acknowledge territory in the first place? As this practice generally happens in only urban settings, it is worth asking, “who are we thinking of?” Is there inclusion of urban Indigenous populations? Or are rural and remote First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities the only understanding held? Have we reached out to and included our Indigenous neighbours and community members to build meaningful reciprocal relationships? 
Take the time to think about why it is important for you or your group to acknowledge the land and waters and what your relationship is with the territory you are on (are you Indigenous, are you settlers, have you come here as a refugee?). Explain why you believe it is important to acknowledge the land. This is a powerful moment that could be used to elevate Indigenous society, governance, and jurisdiction and reaffirm that territory was never given over to the Canadian State. If we think of territorial acknowledgments as sites of potential disruption, they can be transformative acts that could be used to recentre Indigenous ways of being. 
It is important to recognize that territorial acknowledgments are not always clear, particularly when there are competing Indigenous claims to a specific area. This is due to the history of colonization. In some locations, settlers prioritizing one single nation can contribute to silencing local Indigenous communities who are addressing historical grievances (mostly caused by the imposition of colonial boundaries and dispossession) and their own knowledge of connection to place. 
It is important for you to do your own searching and learning. Merely repeating the names of local Indigenous nations in a sort of before-event check list right after indicating where the toilets are and pointing out the snack table, does not automatically mean that you, your group or your audience understand. Best practices must evolve over time through relationship building, listening and learning, and a commitment to deeper engagement with the purpose and impact of territorial acknowledgments. 
We urge you to take some time and learn more about the territories you are living, working and organizing on. Talking to your Indigenous friends, coworkers, and neighbours is the best way to understand the history of the land you are on. These websites can also get you started:

>>>Territorial acknowledgements organized by province 
Even if we are organizing on issues that are seemingly separate, the struggle for Indigenous rights is deeply connected to all human rights work and residents in Indigenous territories. Take the time to reflect on these systemic connections. If you find it hard to capture the relationship between the issues you are working on in words, you can also speak to how you and your group will continue to support Indigenous rights in your ongoing activist work. 
Moving the work we do and our lives beyond simple territorial acknowledgments means asking hard questions about what needs to be done once we are aware of Indigenous presence. We must remain uncomfortable, and make concrete, disruptive change. How can you be in good relationship with Indigenous Peoples, with non-human entities, and with the land and water? Indigenous legal systems, language, culture and other ways of being address all those questions. Building deeply meaningful and reciprocal relationships with your Indigenous neighbours and community members will help you and your group to work towards justice. 
Example: “I acknowledge the traditional, ancestral, unceded territory of the Musqueam, Tsleil-Waututh and Squamish First Nations on which we are learning, working and organizing today. I believe it is important to acknowledge the land because growing up as a settler, I never heard the traditional names of the territories. Indigenous people were talked about in the past tense and all the struggles they faced were in the past tense as well. It is easier to deny Indigenous people their rights if we historicize their struggles and simply pretend they do not exist. As an activist I would like to take this opportunity to commit myself to the struggle against the systems of oppression that have dispossessed Indigenous people of their lands and denied their rights to self-determination, work that is essential to human rights work across the world.”

They were intended to provoke questions and recentre Indigenous ways of being and thinking. 
Why is this important? 
Indigenous Peoples have been clear that all Indigenous economic, social, cultural, political and civil rights derive from their connection to and use of lands, waters and territories. This means that unlike settler Canadian understandings of land rights as being merely connected to individual freedoms and economic production or assets, Indigenous understandings of land rights relate territory to self-determination, identity, spirituality and religion, language, culture and collective responsibilities. 
Once this difference of perspective is recognized it is easy to see why displacement, forced relocation, the Indian Residential Schools, the reserve system, and so many other policies of the Canadian government have devastated Indigenous communities and yet settler Canadians do not always see how they have contributed to the genocide perpetrated against Indigenous Peoples. 
As part of organizing and activism, an evolving practice of acknowledgment can contribute to addressing settler colonialism and build better relationships with Indigenous Peoples creating a more just society. 
Acknowledging territory is the process of deliberately naming that this is Indigenous land and water and specific Indigenous Peoples have inherent rights in the territory. It provides an opportunity for all of us to reflect on our relationship with the land and our contributions to the ongoing process of colonization that deeply roots activist work. 
Why acknowledge territory in the first place? As this practice generally happens in only urban settings, it is worth asking, “who are we thinking of?” Is there inclusion of urban Indigenous populations? Or are rural and remote First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities the only understanding held? Have we reached out to and included our Indigenous neighbours and community members to build meaningful reciprocal relationships? 
Take the time to think about why it is important for you or your group to acknowledge the land and waters and what your relationship is with the territory you are on (are you Indigenous, are you settlers, have you come here as a refugee?). Explain why you believe it is important to acknowledge the land. This is a powerful moment that could be used to elevate Indigenous society, governance, and jurisdiction and reaffirm that territory was never given over to the Canadian State. If we think of territorial acknowledgments as sites of potential disruption, they can be transformative acts that could be used to recentre Indigenous ways of being.

To substantially reduce global greenhouse gas emissions, a rapid shift toward cleaner technologies is essential. And it is of critical importance that these new technologies do not negatively impact human rights. Electric vehicles, for example, can help reduce pollution from fossil fuels. But these vehicles require lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, and every stage of the battery lifecycle, from mineral extraction to disposal, carries human rights and environmental risks. 
To address this issue, Amnesty International is challenging electric vehicle industry leaders to make the world’s first completely ethical battery within five years. In collaboration with the environmental organization Greenpeace, we are calling for industry to produce a rechargeable battery that is mined, manufactured, designed, reused and recovered without human rights abuse or environmental damage. 
 Why do we need ethical batteries? 
Cobalt and lithium are two of the key minerals required to make lithium-ion batteries that power our electronics and charge our electric vehicles. The demand for both is projected to grow exponentially within the next decade in order to meet demand.  Over 125 million electric vehicles are estimated to be on the road by 2030 – a 40% increase over the current number of EVs on the road. With demand for batteries to power these vehicles soaring, now is the time for a radical overhaul of our energy sources. This source of power must prioritize the protection of human rights and the environment. 
Electric vehicles are currently not as ethical as some retailers would like us to believe. Years of unregulated industry practices have led to detrimental human rights and environmental impacts. 
Amnesty’s 2016 investigation, in collaboration with the Congolese NGO, Afrewatch, resulted in the report, “This is What We Die For” which found children and adults in southern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are mining cobalt by hand in hazardous conditions, working long hours for little pay and without proper safety equipment. Amnesty’s research linked these mines to the supply chains of many of the world’s leading electronics brands and electric vehicle companies. As a result of this report, and a petition signed by over 100,000 Amnesty supporters, companies such as Apple, Samsung and BMW have mapped out their cobalt supply chains. However, while there are some signs of progress, people continue to mine without basic protection, including masks, and in unstable shafts. They work for long hours with low pay. This is profoundly unjust.  
Despite projections that the demand for cobalt will reach 200,0000 tons per year by 2020, no country legally requires companies to publicly report on their cobalt supply chains. With more than half of the world’s cobalt originating in southern DRC, the chance that the batteries powering electric vehicles are tainted with child labour and other abuses is unacceptably high. 
 
Other human rights and environmental risks associated with lithium-ion batteries are emerging. Companies need to change course now. 
In addition to the problems surrounding cobalt mining, there are human rights risks associated with lithium mining as well. The process of mining lithium is water intensive and pollutes the environment. Indigenous communities in Argentina have not been adequately consulted about lithium mining projects, nor is their right to self-determination being upheld. Extraction of lithium from the salt flats within their territories could pollute their already scarce water. As lithium demand soars, harm to Indigenous peoples could increase, unless human rights are protected. 
The human rights and environmental risks associated with lithium-ion rechargeable batteries do not stop at mining, unfortunately. Most of the current manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries is concentrated in China, South Korea and Japan, where electricity generation remains dependent on coal and other polluting sources of power. And, there is already significant evidence, for example, that battery waste from electronics, which contains various hazardous materials, has been irresponsibly disposed of, contaminating soil, water and air.  
 
  
How will Amnesty and Greenpeace meet this ambitious goal of creating an ethical battery within the next 5 years?  
Therefore Amnesty International and Greenpeace will also be calling for: batteries to be designed in a way that optimizes their potential for re-use; the illegal or dangerous exportation and dumping of batteries to be prevented; the rights of everyone involved in the battery manufacturing industry be legally protected and enforced; greenhouse gas emissions from the battery manufacturing industry to be minimized and offset; and companies to conduct human rights due diligence throughout their global supply chains. Our goal is for governments to make it a legal requirement for batteries to be ethically sourced and produced. 
There is nothing stopping governments from reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also safeguarding human rights. It is not an either/or choice. 
Now, we are inviting our members to join the next exciting phase of our ethical battery campaign  
This March, Amnesty will launch a new human rights education series and briefing paper on lithium mining in Argentina. We invite you to join this initiative to demand that corporations (some of which are Canadian), governments and investors respect the right to self-determination of the Indigenous peoples in Argentina of the Salinas Grandes who stand to be affected by the soaring global demand for lithium to power electric vehicle batteries. 
Amnesty believes that clean energy does not require a trade-off between people and the environment. Together with our allies, we will produce a blueprint for an ethical battery. We hope you will join us. 
For more information and to get involved in the launch of our new human rights education series on March, please email us: bhr@amnesty.ca  
If you are between the ages of 16-25, drive or ride transit, and are interested in joining a focus group on Amnesty’s ethical battery campaign, please send an email to Amnesty’s Youth Fellow, Serisha Iyar: siyar@amnesty.ca.

To help amplify their urgent call, the youth-led campaign for mercury justice was one of the focal cases of last month’s global Write for Rights campaign, marking the beginning of a year-long campaign to mobilize Amnesty members and supporters in Canada and around the world. Grassy Narrows youth were one of ten global cases focused on young human rights defenders leading the charge for change in their communities. 
Highlights from the Write for Rights 2019 campaign: 
We launched the campaign with a press conference in Winnipeg on November 4, 2019, featuring Grassy youth Paris Meekis, Darwin Fobister, and RJ Bruce. You can check out the incredible coverage of the event via APTN, CTV, CBC, the Winnipeg Sun, and the Winnipeg Free Press. 
Today youth from Grassy Narrows First Nation officially launched Write for Rights with a press conference at Thunderbird House in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The northerwestern Anishinaabe Ontario community the youth come from has been exposed to mercury poisoning for 50 years. The community’s vital waterways are still contaminated, and people are still living with the aftermath, including health problems, loss of jobs and the erosion of their cultural traditions.

“This verdict is a whitewash which brings neither justice nor the truth for Jamal Khashoggi and his loved ones. The trial has been closed to the public and to independent monitors, with no information available as to how the investigation was carried out.
“The verdict fails to address the Saudi authorities’ involvement in this devastating crime or clarify the location of Jamal Khashoggi’s remains.
“Saudi Arabia’s courts routinely deny defendants access to lawyers and condemn people to death following grossly unfair trials. Given the lack of transparency from the Saudi authorities, and in the absence of an independent judiciary, only an international, independent and impartial investigation can serve justice for Jamal Khashoggi.”
Background
The  Public Prosecution’s findings into the murder of Jamal Khashoggi on 2 October 2018  were published by the Saudi Press Agency today. The trial involved 31 individuals, 11 of whom were charged and eight were convicted today. Five were sentenced to death and three were sentenced to prison terms. They were tried and sentenced before the Criminal Court in Riyadh. The verdict is subject to an appeal.
A UN report released by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Agnes Callamard, in June 2019 concluded that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of “an extrajudicial killing for which the state of Saudi Arabia is responsible under human rights law”. Saudi Arabia failed to cooperate with Special Rapporteur Callamard during her investigation.

Thank you for helping to make these wins possible! Here are some highlights… 
 
Legal abortion services were finally available to women in Ireland, following an historic referendum in May 2018 that marked a huge victory for women’s rights. It was the result of years of dedicated work by activists, including Amnesty International, to encourage a powerful conversation that helped catalyse the abortion debate in Ireland. This ultimately led to greater protection for those people who need an abortion there, and paved the way for the same inspiring progress in Northern Ireland later in the year. 
As a tribute to Julián Carrillo, an environmental rights defender killed in October 2018, we launched Caught between bullets and neglect, a digest on Mexico’s failure to protect environmental human rights defenders. Just a few hours after the launch, two suspects in Julián’s murder were arrested, showing the immediate impact Amnesty’s work can have on justice. 
The Angolan Parliament approved a revision of the Criminal Code to remove a provision widely interpreted as criminalizing same-sex relationships. They even took a step further, by criminalizing discrimination against people based on sexual orientation – the first country in 2019 to make this move, and a hearteningly radical move for an African nation. 
After spending 76 days in detention in Thailand, refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi was able to return to his home in Melbourne on 12 February. The Bahrain-born footballer had been detained upon arrival in Bangkok on 27 November 2018, due to an erroneous Interpol red notice, and faced the threat of extradition to Bahrain. A campaign launched by Amnesty and other groups to free the footballer, who is a peaceful and outspoken critic of the Bahraini authorities, grew into the #SaveHakeem movement. The campaign spanned three continents, engaging footballers, Olympians and celebrities, and drawing the support of more than 165,000 people. 
Following international attention and campaigning by Amnesty, Saudi authorities overturned a call by the Public Prosecution to execute Saudi woman activist Israa al-Ghomgham for charges related to her peaceful participation in protests. Israa al-Ghomgham still faces a prison term, and Amnesty continues to campaign for her immediate and unconditional release.   
Ukrainian human rights defender Vitalina Koval 
In Ukraine, an International Women’s Day rally organized by human rights defender Vitalina Koval in Uzhgorod, western Ukraine, went ahead peacefully, with participants protected by police. The event marked a major change for the region, after similar rallies organised by Koval in previous years had been targeted by far-right groups, with police singularly failing to protect participants from violence. 
AFRICOM admitted for the first time that its air strikes have killed or injured civilians in Somalia, after the release of Amnesty’s investigation The Hidden US War in Somalia: Civilian Casualties from Air Strikes in Lower Shabelle. Following this report, US military documents came to light confirming that the US authorities knew of further allegations of civilian casualties resulting from many of their air strikes in Somalia. 
Gulzar Duishenova with her sons in the courtyard of her house 
Gulzar Duishenova had been championing disability rights in her country Kyrgyzstan for years. In March 2019, her persistence paid off when Kyrgyzstan finally signed up to the Disability Rights Convention. Amnesty supporters wrote nearly a quarter of a million messages backing her. 
And in Iraq, just days after Amnesty and other NGOs raised the alarm about a draft cybercrime law that would seriously undermine freedom of expression there, the Iraqi parliament chose to withdraw the bill, confirming to Amnesty that its “concerns have been heard”. 
 
In April, love triumphed when a ban on all LGBTI events in Ankara, Turkey, was lifted by the administrative appeals court. “This is a momentous day for LGBTI people in Turkey, and a huge victory for the LGBTI rights activists – love has won once again,” said Fotis Filippou, Campaigns Director for Europe at Amnesty International. 
The District Court of The Hague issued an interim ruling in favour of Esther Kiobel and three other women who took on one of the world’s biggest oil companies, Shell, in a fight for justice. Esther has pursued the company for more than 20 years over the role she says it played in the arbitrary execution of her husband in Nigeria. Amnesty has shared over 30,000 solidarity messages with Esther Kiobel, and is supporting her Kiobel vs Shell case in The Hague. As a result of this hearing, the court in October 2019 heard for the first time the accounts of individuals who accuse Shell of offering them bribes to give fake testimonies that led to the ‘Ogoni Nine’ – who included Esther Kiobel’s husband – being sentenced to death and executed.   
President of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema, announced that his government would introduce legislation to abolish the death penalty.

Together with LGBTI rights groups from Taiwan, Amnesty had campaigned for this outcome for many years. We are now working to end all discrimination against LGBTI people in Taiwan. 
Qatar promised more reforms to its labour laws ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Human rights pressure also played a role in FIFA’s decision to abandon plans to expand the 2022 Qatar World Cup to 48 teams, which would have involved adding new host countries in the region. Amnesty worked together with a coalition of NGOs, trade unions, fans and player groups, calling attention to the human rights risks of the expansion, including the plight of migrant workers building new infrastructure. 
Climate change activist Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement of schoolchildren accept their Ambassador of Conscience Award 
Climate change activist Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement of schoolchildren were honoured with Amnesty International’s Ambassador of Conscience Award 2019. The Fridays for Future movement was started by Greta, a teenager from Sweden who in August 2018 decided to miss school every Friday and instead protest outside the Swedish parliament, until it took more serious action to tackle climate change. 
In a long overdue move, Greece passed legislation to recognize that sex without consent is rape, and Denmark’s government committed to doing the same. This development is testament to the persistence and bravery of survivors and campaigners for many years, and creates real momentum across Europe following 2018 Amnesty’s review of outdated legislation in 31 European countries and other barriers to accessing justice for rape survivors. 
From 1 June 2019, contraceptives and family planning clinic consultations became free of charge in Burkina Faso. The change was seen as a response to our 2015 My Body My Rights petition and human rights manifesto calling for these measures to be put in place. With financial barriers removed, women in Burkina Faso now have better access to birth control, and more choice over what happens to their bodies. 
March for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland 
In a momentous and inspiring day for human rights campaigners, the UK parliament voted through a landmark bill on 22 July to legalize same sex marriage in Northern Ireland. The bill also forced the UK government to legislate for abortion reform in Northern Ireland, including decriminalization on the basis that a Northern Ireland Executive (government of NI) did not return in three months. 
Also in July, in a US Congressional hearing, a senior Google executive gave the clearest confirmation yet that the company has “terminated” Project Dragonfly, its secretive programme to develop a search engine that would facilitate the Chinese government’s repressive surveillance and censorship of the internet. This followed Amnesty’s #DropDragonfly campaign, and hundreds of Google staff speaking out. 
On 22 July, 70-year-old human rights defender and prominent Palestinian Bedouin leader Sheikh Sayyah Abu Mdeighim al-Turi was released from prison in Israel, after spending seven months in detention for his role in advocating for the protection of Bedouins’ rights and land. Sheikh Sayyah thanked Amnesty International and all those who took action on his behalf: “I thank you all very much for standing up for the right of my people and the protection of our land. While I was in prison, I felt and heard your support loud and clear, and it meant the world to me.” 
 
Mauritanian blogger Mohamed Mkhaïtir, who was sentenced to death and held in arbitrary detention for more than five years after publishing a blog on caste discrimination, finally walked free. 
In August, Saudi Arabia announced major reforms easing some of the major restrictions imposed on women under its repressive male guardianship system, including allowing them the right to obtain a passport which should make it possible for them to travel without permission from a male guardian. The changes also grant women in Saudi Arabia the right to register marriages, divorces, births and deaths and to obtain family records. While we welcome these changes, people campaigning for women’s rights remain in prison, and we must do all we can to fight for their freedom. 
An Ahmed H stunt in Budapest 
Syrian national Ahmed H. was finally allowed to return home, after being imprisoned and then held in immigration detention in Hungary for more than four years. He had been arrested on terrorism charges after being caught up in clashes on the Hungarian border. At the time he was helping his elderly parents, who were escaping Syria and were crossing into Hungary as refugees. An amazing 24,000 people joined the #BringAhmedHome campaign, calling on Cyprus to allow Ahmed to return to his family. 
A court in Tunis acquitted 18-year-old activist Maissa al-Oueslati, after she faced trumped-up charges that could have resulted in her imprisonment for up to four years. Maissa and her 16-year-old brother had been arbitrarily detained by police earlier in the month for filming a protester threatening to set himself on fire in front of a police station. 
 
At midnight on Tuesday 22 October 2019, after a last-minute effort by the DUP to overturn the bill, same sex marriage became legal in Northern Ireland, while abortion was decriminalised. All criminal proceedings were dropped, including those against a mother who faced prosecution for buying her 15 year-old daughter abortion pills online. 
Grainne Teggart, Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland Campaign Manager, said it was the beginning of a new era for Northern Ireland, in which the nation was freed from oppressive laws that police people’s bodies and healthcare. “Finally, our human rights are being brought into the 21st century. This will end the suffering of so many people. We can now look forward to a more equal and compassionate future with our choices respected.” 
 
Kurdish-Iranian award-winning journalist and refugee Behrouz Boochani arrived in New Zealand to attend a special WORD Christchurch event on a visitor’s visa sponsored by Amnesty International. It was the first time Boochani, known for his work reporting on human rights abuses from within the Australian government’s refugee detention centres, had set foot outside Papua New Guinea since he was detained on the country’s Manus Island in 2014. 
 
Humanitarian volunteer Dr Scott Warren was found not guilty by a court in Arizona of charges linked to helping migrants on the US-Mexico border. In a similar case, Pierre Mumber, a French mountain guide who gave hot tea and warm clothes to four West African asylum seekers in the Alps, and was acquitted of “facilitating irregular entry”. 
Alberto Fernández is inaugurated as President of Argentina on 10 December. As president-elect, Fernández announced he would push for the legalization of abortion as soon as he took office, saying: “It is a public health issue that we must solve.” 
The Philippines’ Commission on Human Rights said that 47 major fossil fuel and carbon-polluting companies could be held accountable for violating the rights of its citizens for the damage caused by climate change. The landmark decision paves the way for further litigation, and even criminal investigations, that could see fossil fuel companies and other major polluters either forced to pay damages, or their officials sent to jail for harms linked to climate change. 
The regional Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) Court of Justice rejected a 2015 ban imposed by the government of Sierra Leone preventing pregnant girls from sitting exams and attending mainstream school – and ordered the policy to be revoked with immediate effect.

Scenes of protesters wading through clouds of tear gas or clashing with riot police have become sadly familiar in Hong Kong. But battles in the streets aren’t the only thing spreading fear among protesters. 
Allegations of the sexual harassment and assault of protesters have been circulating since Hong Kong’s current protest movement began. There have been reports of assault in police stations, footage of police exposing women’s underwear during arrest and allegations of humiliating and unnecessary strip searches. 
The few women who have spoken out about the issue have faced a massive backlash. Some have had their personal details leaked online; others have been targeted with fake sex tapes or received harassing phone calls. Although much of this abuse comes from anonymous trolls, the Hong Kong authorities have created a climate where such abuse thrives by smearing protesters and failing to establish an independent investigation into police misconduct. 
How widespread is this problem? 
Social stigma and fear of reporting make it difficult to paint an accurate picture of the prevalence of sexual violence – this is true anywhere. In Hong Kong, things are complicated further by the fact that many people do not want their families or employers to know they are involved in protests. 
In October, Hong Kong’s equal opportunities watchdog reported it had received more than 300 “inquiries” since mid-June regarding allegations of police sexual harassment, but no complaints from alleged victims. 
However, statements and research from local organizations suggest the problem is systematic. According to an online survey carried out by Rainlily, an organization that provides support to survivors, 67 respondents (58 women and nine men) reported experiencing sexual violence in relation to protests. This ranges from being subjected to sexually explicit language to “unlawful sexual intercourse out of threat or intimidation”, and both police officers and counter-protesters were identified as perpetrators. 
Some protesters have spoken out anonymously, including at a 30,000-strong #ProtestToo rally over the summer. 
But the issue has made it into global headlines largely thanks to allegations made by two brave young women, “Ms X” and Sonia Ng. Both have faced backlash and public criticism, illustrating the pitfalls of speaking out about sexual violence. 
Ms X and Sonia Ng 
On 9 November, Hong Kong police confirmed that a woman had filed a complaint on 22 October alleging that she had been raped by several officers in the Tsuen Wan Police Station. The 18-year-old woman, known only as Ms X, said she had an abortion after the incident and police, with her consent, took a DNA sample from the aborted foetus to help identify one of her assailants. 
Disturbingly, following Ms X’s report, the police took out a search warrant to obtain Ms X’s medical records from her private doctor’s clinic, without her consent, including those long pre-dating the allegations,. 
When Ms X found out what had happened, she challenged the search warrant in court and the magistrate  cancelled the warrant after reassessing the case. 
Details of her case were leaked onto the internet in an apparent attempt to discredit her. Media reports also allege that Tse Chun-chung, the Chief Superintendent of the Public Relations Division of the Hong Kong Police, told select media that, Ms X was “a little bit mental”, although Tse has denied these claims. 
According to Ms X’s solicitor, she “has formed the view that the Hong Kong police force cannot be trusted to impartially investigate her allegations or indeed any criminal complaints relating to police officers.” 
Sonia Ng, a student at Chinese University, is the only Hong Kong protester who has accused the police of sexual violence using her own name. She says police officers hit her breasts while she was in detention. Her decision came at a price. 
“People say things like, ‘Oh, she is promiscuous’,” says Sonia. 
“Others have questioned whether I’m telling the truth, and they’ve said things about my family background and my mental health. People don’t want to acknowledge the issues I raised – they’d rather take out the person who raises them.” 
Smear campaigns 
Throughout the anti-Extradition Bill protests, Hong Kong authorities have written off protesters as “rioters” and “enemies of the people”. This kind of smear campaign, picked up by pro-government media and online forums, takes on a particular sexual element when women are involved. 
In September, Executive Councillor Fanny Law claimed in a radio interview that women were offering “free sex” to protesters. Around the same time, a series of photos were circulating online showing naked women wearing face masks and purporting to be offering sex to protesters. The photo was later found to be a screenshot from a porn video, but the rumour continued to proliferate across social media. 
In one example, a photo of a woman holding a sign saying “HK police, rape and murder” was photoshopped to read “HK comfort woman, free for sex with cockroaches”. (Cockroaches is a derogatory term used by some to describe protesters.) 
Amy Ip, a journalist, told Amnesty about the campaign of online abuse that began when she spoke out against police. Amy interrupted a police press conference to criticize violent treatment of reporters by police at protests, reading out a statement alleging the media were being prevented from doing their jobs.   
Shortly after, Amy’s name, photo and other personal details, including her phone number, were published on social media and pro-government news outlets. Significantly, the photo circulated was of Amy’s press pass, which she had got just that day and which the police had taken a photo of.   
Then internet trolls started circulating a sex tape featuring a woman they claimed to be Amy, along with claims that she was “offering free sex” to protesters. 
“For a few days I received anonymous phone calls at night. My whole family was so worried,” Amy says. “I was under the spotlight accidentally. My mum considered leaving the country.”  
Lack of effective investigation 
Amnesty International has repeatedly called for an independent and impartial investigation into the behaviour of the Hong Kong police. The government points to an existing mechanism, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC), as adequate. But a panel of overseas experts appointed by the government said the IPCC lacks “the powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary to match the scale of the recent protests and the standards internationally required of a police watchdog operating in a city that values freedoms and rights.” 
According to Ms X’s lawyer, she filed her report through proper channels, put up with invasive questioning and underwent medical examination as requested by the police, only to be subjected to an apparent smear campaign.  
Ms X now believes that the police are incapable of investigating themselves and she is not alone. Only two respondents told Rainlily they had reported what happened to the police. The most common reason for not reporting was a lack of confidence in the ability of the police to handle the complaint. The organisation is now urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women to look into the issue.    
Allegations of sexual violence are one more pressing reason for establishing an independent, impartial investigation into the conduct of the Hong Kong police. The abuse of protesters has to stop.

Mesut Ozil’s social media post about the political situation in Xinjiang has prompted an angry response from the Chinese authorities. The Arsenal footballer’s accusation that China is persecuting the predominantly Muslim Uyghur minority has been dismissed by Beijing as “fake news”. Meanwhile, a Gunners match was pulled from the state TV schedule and Chinese football fans have reportedly burned Arsenal shirts in protest at the player’s comments. 
Amnesty International has extensively documented the situation in Xinjiang over the past several years. We have interviewed more than 400 people outside of China whose relatives in Xinjiang are still missing, as well as individuals who said they were tortured while in detention camps there. We also collected satellite photos of the camps and analysed official Chinese documents that detail the mass-internment programme. This is what is really happening: 
1 Mass internment campsAn estimated one million predominantly Muslim people, such as Uyghurs and Kazakhs, have been held in internment camps in Xinjiang, northwest China. The government has repeatedly denied the existence of the camps – describing them instead as voluntary “transformation-through-education” centres. But those sent there have no right to challenge the decision. 
2 Harsh conditionsKairat Samarkan was among those sent to a detention camp in October 2017, after he returned to Xinjiang from Kazakhstan. He told Amnesty he was hooded, made to wear shackles on his arms and legs and forced to stand in a fixed position for 12 hours when first detained. He said detainees are also forced to sing political songs and chant “Long live Xi Jinping” (the Chinese president) before meals or face harsh punishment. 
3 Detainees driven to the brinkThe authorities decide when detainees have been “transformed”. Those who resist or fail to show enough progress face punishments ranging from verbal abuse to food deprivation, solitary confinement and beatings. There have been reports of deaths inside the facilities, including suicides of those unable to bear the mistreatment. 
4 Information blackoutThe Chinese authorities have invited Mesut Ozil to come to Xinjiang and “have a look” at the situation for himself. This is a trap: the government has organized dozens of Potemkin-style propaganda tours for unwitting foreigners while preventing independent UN experts from visiting the region, harassing foreign journalists and instructing local officials to keep the mass detention programme secret. 
5 China’s ‘anti-terror’ argumentThe Chinese government has justified its extreme measures as necessary to prevent religious “extremism” and what they claim are “terrorist activities”. Their stance on Xinjiang’s ethnic minorities has hardened since a series of violent incidents in the capital Urumqi in 2009 and the knife attacks at Kunming railway station in southwest China in 2014. This hardly justifies the arbitrary detention of hundreds of thousands of people. In fact, UN experts concluded last month that China’s policies in Xinjiang were actually likely to “worsen any security risk”. 
6 Arrested for growing a beardThe persecution of Xinjiang’s Muslims has intensified since a regulation passed in 2017 meant people could be labelled “extremist” for reasons such as refusing to watch public TV programmes or having an “abnormal” beard. Wearing a veil or headscarf, regular prayer, fasting or avoidance of alcohol can also be considered “extremist” under the regulation. 
7 Surveillance stateEveryone in Xinjiang is at risk of being detained. The region is blanketed with facial-recognition surveillance cameras, backed by the use of artificial intelligence and mass DNA collection. Ubiquitous security checks are a part of daily life, with the authorities searching mobile phones for suspicious content. 
People might also come under suspicion through routine monitoring of messages sent on social media apps such as WeChat. Syrlas Kalimkhan said he installed WhatsApp on his father’s phone and tested it by texting, “Hi, Dad.” Later, the police asked his father why he had WhatsApp on his phone. He was later sent to a “re-education camp”. 
8 Relatives scared to speak outMost of the detainees’ families have been kept in the dark about their fate, while those who speak out risk being detained themselves. To avoid arousing such suspicion, Uyghurs, Kazakhs and others inside Xinjiang have been cutting ties with friends and family living outside China. They warn acquaintances not to call and delete outside contacts from social media applications. 
9 A dark echo of the pastThe camps are places of brainwashing, torture and punishment that hark back to the darkest hours of the Mao era, when anyone suspected of not being loyal enough to the state or the Chinese Communist Party could end up in China’s notorious labour camps. Muslim ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang are living in permanent fear for themselves and their detained relatives. 
10 An important standWhile Arsenal have been criticized for not speaking out in support of Ozil, companies do not technically have a responsibility to denounce human rights violations. They only have to ensure they do not cause, contribute to or profit from such abuses. 
Yet China’s attempts to impose its powerful censorship abroad must be resisted. Ozil has taken an important stand in speaking out in support of those facing brutal persecution in Xinjiang – and his intervention has raised global awareness of one of the gravest human rights crises of our time. Arsenal are entitled to remain silent, but Ozil’s right to freedom of expression must be preserved.

Politics of demonisation 
 
One of the most disturbing trends of the past decade has been the rise of rhetoric and policies that demonise some of the most marginalised groups in society, including refugees and asylum seekers, religious and ethnic minorities, women and LGBTI people. 
It’s the common thread that links the persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar, mass internment of Uighurs in China and the proposed introduction of the death penalty for people who engage in same-sex sexual activity in Uganda. It has also fuelled xenophobic attacks against migrants in South Africa and been the driving force behind U.S. policy to forcibly separate families seeking safety. Meanwhile, it has contributed to the increasing criminalisation of those helping refugees in Europe. 
Instead of addressing real problems like inequality, corruption, unemployment and economic hardship, political leaders on every continent are using minority groups as scapegoats for social and economic ills, spreading fake news about them and inciting discrimination, hostility and violence against them. 
Social media platforms have allowed these hateful views to flourish largely unchecked. However, such hatred has galvanised activists the world over. Fighting for our human rights has never seemed more important. 
The climate emergency 
 
This decade is likely to be the hottest on record – another alarming sign of the climate emergency which is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our age. 
Millions of people are already suffering from the catastrophic effects of climate change – from prolonged drought in Africa to devastating tropical storms across South-east Asia and the Caribbean, and heatwaves that have set record temperatures in Europe. 
Climate change threatens to exacerbate inequalities between developed and developing countries; between different ethnicities and classes; between genders, generations and communities – with the most disadvantaged groups hardest hit. It is already having harmful impacts on our rights to life, health, food, water, housing and livelihoods. 
All the science suggests that extreme weather will only get worse, unless governments take urgent action to slash carbon emissions within the shortest possible timeframe, through a transition that protects the human rights of disadvantaged groups. However, virtually all governments are failing to put in place effective plans, and there is still resistance from some of the biggest emitters; notably the USA, which under President Trump has started the process to formally exit from the Paris Agreement. 
More than ever, we need to stand together to hold our political leaders to account. The Fridays for Future movement, started in 2018 by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg and her colleagues, shows us that change is possible. We cannot afford to fail. 
Violence against women 
 
The struggle to protect women and girls, and others from all forms of gender-based violence, was as hard-fought as ever. Sexual violence continued to be used as a weapon of war, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in one case out of many, more than 300 people were raped in four days by armed men in Walikale, North Kivu. Amnesty International also documented the horrific impact of rape in other conflict zones such as Iraq, Somalia, Darfur, Nigeria and South Sudan. 
In many places, the very people meant to keep society safe are the ones attacking women and girls. In Mexico, women reported torture and other forms of violence such as electric shocks to the genitals, groping of breasts and rape with objects – during arrest and interrogation by police and armed forces as part of the country’s ‘war on drugs’. Homicide rates for women have risen sharply throughout the decade, with Mexican authorities failing to take effective action to solve gender-based violence. 
In a breakthrough, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted the landmark Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence – which Amnesty International was involved in drafting – on 7 April 2011. Recently, Sweden and Greece became some of the few European countries who changed their laws to recognise that sex without consent is rape. 
One of the most iconic online movements of the decade, #MeToo, brought millions of women together to stand up to sexual violence, harassment and assault. #MeToo has spurred change everywhere from Hollywood studios to remote villages in Nepal and northern Nigeria. 
Sexual and reproductive rights 
 
Although some 50 countries have changed their laws to allow greater access to abortion over the last 25 years, sexual and reproductive rights remain contested. One thing that unites all successful campaigns to reform abortion laws has been the bravery of women who speak out and demand the right to decide what happens to their own bodies. 
Reproductive rights have come under threat elsewhere. Attempts to further restrict access to abortion sparked nationwide protests in Poland. Near-total bans or laws further restricting access to abortion have been introduced in several US states. President Trump’s reinstatement of the ‘global gag’ rule, which blocks US federal international funding for NGOs that provide abortion counselling or referrals, or that advocate for decriminalising abortion, was a massive blow to women’s rights globally. So were the US administration’s attempts to remove references to ‘sexual and reproductive health’ from high-level UN policy documents endorsed by Members States, 
From Ireland to South Korea, activists have helped dispel the stigma and secrecy surrounding abortion by sharing their stories. In Argentina and Poland, over a million women have marched to demand that their voices be heard. In the last year alone, legal abortion services opened up in Ireland and is on its way to becoming a reality in Northern Ireland too, after years of campaigning by groups, including Amnesty International. There was more good news in Argentina, where president-elect Alberto Fernández promised he would move to legalise abortion after taking office in December 2019. 
LGBTI rights 
 
No doubt the LGBTI rights movement is more visible than ever before, but progress has been mixed in the past decade. In many countries, LGBTI people are still harassed in the streets, beaten up, arrested and sometimes killed simply because of who they are or who they love. 
Consensual same-sex sexual activity is a crime in 70 countries, and the death penalty is imposed as a punishment in a number of countries, including in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Sometimes, hostility directed at LGBTI people is stoked by their own governments. In Chechnya for example, a state-sponsored campaign led to the abduction, torture and even killing of people believed to be gay or lesbian 
There have been a few momentous steps taken this past year. A landmark ruling in India decriminalised consensual same-sex relations, marking a critical milestone in the three-decades-old struggle by LGBTI activists and their allies in India. Taiwan became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage after passing a historic law on 17 May 2019. And Pakistan passed one of the most progressive legislations in the world on transgender rights, becoming the first Asian country and one of the few in the world to legally recognise self-perceived gender identity. 
But for many LGBTI people around the globe who have been persecuted, maimed, killed, shamed, set on fire, refused entry into hospitals, shunned, raped and marginalised, there is still a long way to go. Governments must ensure that their rights are protected, and that discrimination on the grounds of real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity is abolished.  
Big Tech and data privacy 
 
The decade took an Orwellian turn with the rise of Big Tech companies, such as Facebook and Google harvesting and monetising our personal data, and the consequent omnipresent surveillance of billions of people posing a systemic threat to our human rights. 
While, at the beginning of the decade, we were all lulled into a false sense of security, believing we were simply sharing photos with a few friends, it became increasingly clear  that our shared information could be exploited as both a weapon of influence and a means of spreading dangerous disinformation and online abuse. A decade later, the so-called ‘influence industry’ in the form of social media platforms, internet search engines, data brokers and tech companies analysing our personal data and trading in predictions about people’s interests, characteristics, and ultimately behaviour for marketing and advertising, has become one of the biggest and most sinister societal threats of our time. 
We now live in a world where insidious control of our digital lives has far-reaching consequences that go even beyond our privacy – disinformation and information manipulation is a continual battleground, with serious implications on our freedom of opinion, expression and thought. In polls, huge numbers of individuals say they are worried about the influence Big Tech has on their lives, concerned both about data revealing too much about them, and about data being used by state authorities to target them. 
It took time for the human rights risks posed by Big Tech to become clear, partly because civil society and tech companies have traditionally worked together to keep the Internet free from state meddling, and by extension from regulation. A classic example is the defence of end-to-end encryption. This work is important. But by seeing the human rights threat as stemming from government surveillance and censorship, we have somehow failed to fully realise the magnitude of the threat caused by Big Tech’s ubiquitous presence. 
As we move into a new decade, it will be governments’ responsibility to take action to protect us from corporate human rights abuses, including enforcing robust data protection laws and effective regulation of Big Tech, in line with international human rights law.

One year after protests broke out in Sudan leading to the ouster President Omar al Bashir on 11 April 2019, the new transitional authorities must to live up to the hopes and expectations of the Sudanese people, Amnesty International said today.
“A year after the Sudanese people took to the streets to protest a spike in food prices ultimately ending three decades of the Al-Bashir regime, they can celebrate that their collective action brought an end to suffocating repression and revived hopes for a better Sudan,” said Seif Magango, Amnesty International’s Deputy Director for East Africa, the Horn and the Great Lakes.
“The transitional authorities must honour the commitments they made to restore the rule of law and protect human rights. The Sudanese people deserve nothing less.”
The Sudanese people’s hopes now lie squarely with the transitional authorities headed by Prime Minister Abdullah Hamdok, and backed by the Transitional Constitutional Charter, which enshrines the country’s most comprehensive Bill of Rights yet. 
In a positive step, the government in November 2019 repealed the public order laws and brought to an end the era of egregious violations particularly targeting women’s rights and freedoms.
“The responsibility on Prime Minister Hamdok’s shoulders is as large as the aspirations of the Sudanese people who suffered decades of serious human rights violations, and crimes under international law including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. The victims have the right to truth, justice and reparations under international law,” said Seif Magango.
The government must proactively address accountability for these crimes by among other things, rebuilding the credibility and capacity of the justice system to thoroughly and effectively investigate and prosecute the crimes.
The government is also required under international law to transfer Omar al Bashir to the International Criminal Court, in compliance with arrest warrants pending against him for crimes committed in Darfur between 2003 and 2010.
While the recent appointment of a new Attorney General and Chief Justice offers hope that accountability will be a priority for the transitional authorities, successful prosecution of those found responsible for grave human rights violations would greatly bolster confidence in the national judicial system.
Out of 185 people killed during anti-government protests in September 2013, Sudan’s prosecution office has only investigated and tried one case to date. In this single case, the accused was eventually acquitted for lack of sufficient evidence.
Between December 2018 and 11 April 2019, at least 77 protestors were killed, and hundreds injured across Sudan by security forces. On 3 June, the security forces, notably the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), brutally dispersed the massive sit-in in Khartoum with live ammunition and teargas, killing more than 100 people and injuring at least 700 others.
“The new Sudan authorities must ensure that members of the security forces who committed horrific crimes or used excessive force against protestors are held accountable in fair trials without recourse to the death penalty,” said Seif Magango.
“The people of Sudan braved live bullets, tear gas, brutal beatings and degrading treatment for months because they believed a better future was possible; it is now time for the interim authorities to make these hopes a reality.”

Grassy teaches me so much: it teaches me about the land, animals, and our Anishinaabe culture. But being from Grassy Narrows has also taught me that life can be unfair at times. 
From 1962 until 1970, a pulp mill dumped 10 tonnes of mercury into the Wabigoon-English river upstream from my community. That mercury still sits in the river to this day and it has come with many health effects like numbness, difficulties breathing and standing, inability to feel in areas in the body, muscle weakness. The list goes on and on. Most often it affects people physically, but it also affects people emotionally and mentally. I myself suffer from migraines, depression, anxiety, and other things that come with the effects of the poisoning. 
Because of mercury, I grew up with a lot of fear in my life, and this fear only grew as I got older and learned more about the impacts of mercury. 
One of my biggest fears is about having children. The generations to come still have a high risk of being affected by mercury. They could still be taken from us by mercury. Mercury causes many complications for children. They can be born without something needed to live. They can be born weaker than normal, or born with disorders from birth. All of these are still very real risks for us. 
I’ve seen a cousin pass away from the impacts of mercury, I’ve seen the hurt it caused and the pain that was felt by the community. It’s a pain I never want to feel, but it’s still a risk for those who, like me, want to have a family in the future. 
I am working hard to overcome this fear like many people in my community, which is why I want to be a journalist and a midwife. It all ties back to my home. 
Being a journalist to me is a dream. I’ve seen many journalists come and go in Grassy, and I’ve told the story of Grassy plenty of times to others. I’ve seen how journalists can help bring problems to light. I want to be able to help bring my community’s story to light and be the one to share it directly. It’s something I want to do for as long as I live, because I know what it feels like to be from a small place and how it feels like to have a problem that seems like it’s never going to be fixed.  I know what it’s like to feel that darkness. 
Midwifery is something I knew I wanted to do since I was small, because of my fear but also just because I love children. Since I don’t think I’ll ever have children, I would want to work with them. Pregnancy seems like a beautiful thing and it sucks that I most likely won’t experience it because the fear really does take over your mind. 
Grassy having its rivers and fish poisoned was a life changer. Telling us not to drink the water, to not eat the fish, to not be out on the land because of our contaminated rivers is like telling a person not to talk, not to walk, not to dream. Our life was taken from us, and it all happened so fast. We still need to figure out living in some ways, but my home is also home to many strong people, so we’ll manage. Water is the heartbeat of Grassy and it always will be forever.

0,Showing Up for Human Rights in 2019,Amnesty Canada (English),https://amnesty.ca/blog/blog-showing-human-rights-2019/,"  “This is one of those times; one of those moments in history.  You either show up or you prepare to face your conscience.” That was how an over-stretched immigration lawyer — who moved to Brownsville, Texas to join volunteers responding to Donald Trump’s assault on the...","That was how an over-stretched immigration lawyer — who moved to Brownsville, Texas to join volunteers responding to Donald Trump’s assault on the rights of refugees and migrants — described to me why she was there.  
Her words powerfully capture the vital human rights struggle playing out at the US/Mexico border. I’ve been along that border two times this year with other Amnesty International leaders from around the world. Show up, we must! There is and could be no other choice.   
Her words also profoundly frame the wider challenge and responsibility of defending human rights in our world today. A world that is overflowing with harrowing levels of conflict, division and inequality; while also witnessing an unstoppable tide of resistance, protest, compassion and courage. 
As we look back on 2019 and ahead to the considerable challenges we know we will face in 2020, I believe it is more imperative than ever that Amnesty International continues to show up — to bring the light of our research, the collective force of our activism, and the sustaining power of our solidarity to the pressing human rights struggles of our time. 
In September the UN’s High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, spoke about the rapidly worsening global climate crisis, starkly noting that, “the world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope.”  So true. This is by no means an environmental issue alone. The causes, the impact and the solutions are all about human rights. 
Amnesty International has shown up, across Canada and around the world, insisting on urgent action to protect human rights as the climate crisis mounts. That is why we honoured Greta Thunberg and the #FridaysforFuture movement with our highest global honour, the Ambassadors of Conscience Award. And that is why we are bringing our human rights demands for climate action to the streets, to companies and governments, to courtrooms and to UN conferences.   
Too many corners of our world face the grim toll of war, conflict and mass abuses of human rights. The unending agony of Syria, the world’s gaze shamefully averted from Yemen, the chaos of Libya, entrenched suffering in the open-air prison that is Gaza, the betrayed promise of freedom in South Sudan, abuses that have provoked a staggering refugee exodus from Venezuela and the disgraceful abandonment of the Rohingya people.  
With your support we have showed up to expose the truth of human rights abuse amidst conflict and turmoil. Our research and activism pushes for justice, arms control, safety for civilians and refugee protection. At every turn we show our solidarity and make it clear that no one, in any of these corners of our world, is or will be forgotten. 
Whether it is violence against women, discrimination against Indigenous peoples, or confronting anti-Black racism, Islamophobia and anti-Semitism, we show up. 
We have pressed for an end to the chilling mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang, China, forced and coerced sterilization of Indigenous women in Canada, and practices such as carding, which fuel racial profiling in policing. And we have actively supported efforts to end decades of discrimination against Indigenous children in Canada.  
Everywhere, hate, fear and racism have increasingly been normalized in politics, fueled by the toxic and dramatically under-regulated world of social media. Leaders in the United States, Brazil, Hungary, Turkey, India, the Philippines and far too many other countries now openly inflame bigotry and demonize marginalized groups. It has steadily crept into Canadian political discourse as well. 
Around the world and in Canada, we have shown up to reject the politics of hate and intolerance. Our Amnesty Canada francophone colleagues are challenging Bill 21 in Quebec and we worked closely with partners to bring positive messages about refugee protection into our recent federal election. 
Sadly, in 2019 it is increasingly perilous to defend human rights. Governments bring absurd charges of terrorism and espionage against human rights defenders and turn their back when defenders are threatened, attacked and even killed. Those at greatest risk include women human rights defenders and defenders concerned about land and the environment.   
We show up to bring solidarity and protection in the face of these mounting threats against human rights defenders. That includes being vigilant here at home, where we have highlighted growing attacks on environmentalists and Indigenous rights defenders campaigning for climate action in Alberta. 
What a remarkable year of courageous street protest.  Hong Kong. Chile. Lebanon. Algeria. Ecuador. Sudan. In the face of unrelenting public pressure, cruel leaders have been toppled and officials have abandoned plans for law reform and other measures that undermine rights.   
But governments have also responded with brutal force, leading to hundreds of deaths of protesters and many hundreds more seriously injured in Iran and in Iraq. 
Amnesty has, in some instances, literally showed up and joined protesters. We have amplified their demands for reform. We have documented and campaigned for an end to security force abuses. And we will continue to show up, everywhere.   
Around the world we have amplified the calls for freedom, for individuals locked up because of who they are, what they believe or because they dare to defend human rights. This year Canadian permanent resident Saeed Malekpour was freed after 11 years of unjust imprisonment in Iran and Maryam Mombeini returned home to her family in Vancouver after more than 18 months of being refused permission to leave Iran.   
Those moments of celebration remind us how crucial it is to persevere in our efforts to win freedom for others, including Canadian citizen Huseyin Celil, a Uighur leader locked up in China since 2006; and for Loujain al-Hathloul and other imprisoned women’s human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia. 
In a world full of leaders enthusiastically sacrificing human rights to further their own agendas, it is more important than ever that Canada show up and lead. We have been clear that leadership begins at home and that there is still much to be done on that front. 
We joined Indigenous and civil society partners this year in a concerted push to have Parliament pass landmark legislation, establishing a framework for implementing the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in Canada. We came so close, only to have final adoption blocked by a handful of Senators. The government has promised to bring new legislation forward in 2020. We will once again show up; to push for its passage. 
The historic final report from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls was released in June. We now move on to ensure that the Inquiry’s 231 Calls to Justice are taken seriously, with a well-resourced implementation plan. 
With the launch of this year’s Write for Rights, we worked with the formidable youth of Grassy Narrows First Nation to take their 50 year fight for mercury justice global. Over the next year we’ll continue to mobilize Amnesty activists in Canada and around the world to help pressure the federal government to finally turn promises into concrete actions.” 
As Donald Trump strips away rights protection for refugees, we have demanded an end to the Canada/US Safe Third Country Agreement, which turns refugee claimants away from protection in Canada. The Agreement maintains the appalling fiction that the US meets international standards of refugee protection. And thus, the Canadian government stays silent, no matter how egregious the measures adopted by the Trump Administration. We showed up in Federal Court, challenging the STCA, and will continue to show up, anywhere and everywhere, until this shameful agreement is scrapped. 
Canada joined the Arms Trade Treaty this year, something Amnesty has been calling for since the treaty was adopted by the UN in 2013. That commitment must now be matched by ending the reprehensible deal to sell $15billion worth of light armoured vehicles to Saudi Arabia at a time when Saudi military forces are responsible for extensive war crimes in Yemen. 
We welcomed the long-awaited announcement in April of the first-ever Canadian Ombudsperson for Responsible Enterprise, to ensure the accountability of Canadian mining and other companies for human rights abuses abroad. But there is more work ahead, to ensure that the Ombudsperson will be granted the powers needed to effectively investigate alleged abuses. 
We showed up for human rights in 2019, even though the going was tough.   
We showed up for human rights in 2019, because the going was tough.   
We showed up for human rights in 2019, because you showed up.   
And with your determination and passion behind us we will most certainly show up in 2020.   
As 2019 comes to an end and we look ahead to 2020 I hope that you will be able to provide generous support to our human rights work. “This is one of those times.”

The Lenca leader was recognized internationally with a prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize for her efforts to stop construction of the Agua Zarca dam on a river considered sacred and vital to the rights of her people. Back home, Berta got death threats. Then gunmen entered her home on March 2, 2016 and shot her to death. 
 
In a country where impunity for such crimes is the norm – and a green light for more deadly violence – at long last there has been a breakthrough. 
On December 2, seven men were sentenced to between 30 and 50 years in jail for their roles in the killing of Berta.  
 
The convicted include four paid hitmen – Henry Javier Hernández, Edilson Duarte Meza, Elvin Rapalo and Óscar Torres. Each of them was sentenced to 34 years for the murder of Berta, together with 16 years and four months for the attempted murder of Gustavo Castro, an environmentalist who happened to be at Berta’s house when the hit squad burst in. He was shot but survived by pretending to be dead. 
In addition to the hitmen, Sergio Ramón Rodríguez, a manager for Desarrollos Energéticos (DESA), the company building the Agua Zarca dam, and Douglas Geovanny Bustillo, a former security chief of the company, were sentenced to 30 years and six months for their role in the assassination. The seventh man, Mariano Díaz Chávez, an army major at the time, was sentenced to 30 years. Prosecutors submitted evidence that Díaz participated in reconnaissance missions with Bustillo. He had also provided a gun and logistical support for a 2015 plan to kill Berta that was called off. 
Outside the court, Berta’s family and her organization, COPINH, called the prison sentences “the first cracks in the wall of impunity”. 
 
During a vigil ominously watched by police in riot gear, other COPINH members lit candles for Berta. During its broadcast of the vigil via Facebook Live, COPINH recognized the support of Amnesty Canada activists who have signed more than 60,000 petitions and postcards sent to Honduran authorities in the past three years. 
According to COPINH, it is international solidarity from around the world, together with the tenacious efforts of Berta’s family and community in Honduras, that has ensured progress on this emblematic case of such importance to all who seek to protect Indigenous rights and the environment. 
  
But Berta’s daughter Berthita Zúñiga Cáceres reminded everyone that the struggle is far from over. 
“Real justice requires ensuring that the masterminds who conspired, gave the orders and financed the assassination of my mother are also brought to justice,” she said. “Prosecutors must stop making excuses for not acting on evidence in their possession.” 
 
DESA executive David Castillo was charged in March 2018 as an “intellectual author” of the murder of Berta. He has also been charged with corruption linked to the Agua Zarca dam concession. Almost two years later, Castillo has yet to be put on trial.  
According to reporting in The Guardian by journalist Nina Lakhani, Berta’s family has applied to a US federal court to subpoena bank records linked to a $1.4 million luxury house in Texas purchased by David Castillo eight months after the killing, arguing the documents could help identify yet unknown individuals involved in the crime. 
 
In 2017, an independent panel of international investigators issued a report that alleged the involvement of “Honduran state agents, senior executives of DESA and parallel structures to State security forces”. 
Amnesty International continues to press the Attorney General of Honduras to ensure that EVERYONE responsible for the assassination of Berta Cáceres is identified and brought to justice.

Iran’s authorities are carrying out a vicious crackdown following the outbreak of nationwide protests on 15 November, arresting thousands of protesters as well as journalists, human rights defenders and students to stop them from speaking out about Iran’s ruthless repression, said Amnesty International today.
The organization has carried out interviews with dozens of people inside Iran who described how, in the days and weeks during and following the protests, the Iranian authorities have held detainees incommunicado and subjected them to enforced disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment.
At least 304 people were killed and thousands were injured between 15 and 18 November as authorities crushed protests using lethal force, according to credible reports compiled by the organization. The Iranian authorities have refused to announce a figure for those killed.
“Harrowing testimony from eyewitnesses suggests that, almost immediately after the Iranian authorities massacred hundreds of those participating in nationwide protests, they went on to orchestrate a wide-scale clampdown designed to instil fear and prevent anyone from speaking out about what happened,” said Philip Luther, Middle East and North Africa Research Director at Amnesty International.
Video footage verified by Amnesty’s Digital Verification Corps, backed up by witness testimony, shows Iranian security forces opening fire on unarmed protesters who did not pose any imminent risk. The majority of the deaths that the organization has recorded occurred as a result of gunshots to the head, heart, neck and other vital organs indicating that the security forces were shooting to kill.
The UN has stated that it has information suggesting that at least 12 children are among those killed. According to Amnesty International’s research, they include 15-year-old Mohammad Dastankhah, who was shot in the heart in Shiraz, Fars province, as he passed by the protests on his way home from school, and 17-year-old Alireza Nouri, who was killed in Shahriar, Tehran province.
“Instead of continuing with this brutal campaign of repression, the Iranian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all those who have been arbitrarily detained,” said Philip Luther.
“The international community must take urgent action, including through the UN Human Rights Council holding a special session on Iran to mandate an inquiry into the unlawful killings of protesters, horrifying wave of arrests, enforced disappearances and torture of detainees, with a view to ensuring accountability.”
Wave of mass arrests
On 17 November, the third day of protests, state media reported that more than 1,000 protesters had been arrested. On 26 November, Hossein Naghavi Hosseini, a spokesperson for Iran’s parliamentary committee for national security and foreign policy, said 7,000 people had been arrested. The authorities have yet to provide an official figure.
Several sources independently told Amnesty International that security forces are still carrying out raids across the country to arrest people in their homes and places of work.
Children as young as 15 have been detained alongside adults, including in Fashafouyeh prison, Tehran province, which is notorious for torture and other ill-treatment. Other places where detainees have been held are military barracks and schools.
Various government officials, including the Supreme Leader and the head of the judiciary, have labelled protesters as “villains” and “rioters” and associated protesters with foreign powers. State media has called for the death penalty to be used against protest “leaders”.
Also being targeted for arbitrary arrest and detention are journalists, students and human rights defenders, including minority rights and labour rights activists, and people from ethnic minority groups.
Journalist Mohammad Massa’ed was arrested on 23 November after posting a tweet about the near-total internet shutdown imposed by the authorities between 16 November and around 24 November. He was released on bail several days later.
Activist Soha Mortezaei was one of dozens of students arrested during a protest at Tehran University on 18 November. She has been detained without access to her lawyer or family since. Security officials based in the university had previously threatened to torture her with electric shocks and detain her in a mental hospital.
Minority rights activists arrested include Akbar Mohajeri, Ayoub Shiri, Davoud Shiri, Babak Hosseini Moghadam, Mohammad Mahmoudi, Shahin Barzegar and Yashar Piri who were all arrested in their places of work in Tabriz, East Azerbaijan province.
Some prisons and detention centres are now reported to be experiencing severe overcrowding. On 25 November, the head of the city council of Rey in Tehran province expressed concern to reporters that Fashafouyeh prison is extremely overcrowded and has neither the capacity nor the facilities to accommodate such large numbers of detainees.
At least two people who participated in the protests told Amnesty International they are in hiding fearing for their lives and said many others are in a similar situation.
One person said: “I have been in hiding since I was seen and filmed by the security forces at the protests. They beat me with a baton before I escaped. I am now in hiding with a serious leg injury. I am not safe because they have gone to my house to arrest me. My situation right now is no different to being in prison.”
While some of those arrested have been released, many remain detained incommunicado, denied access to their families and lawyers. A number of families told Amnesty International they are deeply concerned about loved ones who require access to medical treatment, given the authorities’ appalling track record of denying medical care to people in prisons.
Torture and other ill-treatment
Eyewitness accounts and video evidence indicate that some detainees have been subjected to torture and other ill-treatment, including through beatings and floggings. One person said that a family member who was released on bail emerged with bruises and cuts to his face and head and is so traumatized from his experience that he refuses to leave the house.
One video verified and geolocated by the Digital Verification Corps shows handcuffed detainees being taken into the grounds of Mali Abad police station in Shiraz, Fars province, and then beaten, punched and kicked by security forces.
Credible sources have informed Amnesty International that in Raja’i Shahr prison in Karaj, Alborz province, hundreds of detainees, including children, were brought in trucks to the prison. They say that handcuffed and blindfolded detainees have been punched, kicked, flogged and beaten with batons by security forces on a daily basis.
Victims and eyewitnesses have also told Amnesty International that Iranian security forces have raided hospitals and medical centres across the country, arresting injured protesters and transferring them to detention centres, thereby denying them access to potentially life-saving medical care.
One source said that intelligence officials forced managers of a hospital in Khuzestan province to provide them with a list of names of newly admitted patients.
Another man described how he was arrested by plain-clothes officers as he was about to be discharged from a hospital in Alborz province after being treated for a gunshot wound to the stomach. He said he saw “many other people with gunshot wounds and other injuries” at the detention centre.
“The authorities have an obligation to protect all detainees from torture and other ill-treatment. Given the systematic use of torture in Iran, it is crucial that the authorities provide UN officials, mandate holders, and other relevant experts immediate access to detention centres and prisons to conduct fact-finding investigations,” said Philip Luther.
“Without urgent international pressure thousands will remain at risk of torture and other ill-treatment.”
Enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention
In dozens of cases reported to Amnesty International, detainees have had little or no contact with their families since their arrest and some have been held in conditions amounting to enforced disappearance, which is a crime under international law.
Relatives have told the organization they have visited police stations, prosecution offices, Revolutionary Courts, prisons and other detention centres to search for loved ones who have been forcibly disappeared but the authorities are refusing to provide them with information.
The mothers of a group of minority rights activists who were arrested during raids in East Azerbaijan province and West Azerbaijan province said the authorities said they had “no intention” to provide them with information. “We can do whatever we want with your children. We can detain them for however long we want, even for 10 years… We will execute them and you will not be able to do anything about it,” he said.
Those subjected to enforced disappearance include Kurdish labour rights activist Bakhtiar Rahimi, who was arrested at his place of work in Marivan, Kurdistan province, on 27 November. There has been no news of his fate or whereabouts since. This is especially worrying since he suffers from kidney and heart problems and needs daily medication and specialist health care.
“The world must not stand by in silence as the Iranian authorities continue to commit widespread human rights violations in their ruthless bid to crush dissent,” said Philip Luther.

“From Mozambique to Philippines, people have lost their lives, their homes and their livelihoods to disasters caused or exacerbated by the climate crisis, despite their countries’ minimal contributions to it. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialized countries that have benefitted economically for over a century from growing emissions – while suffering far less from its ill-effects – are content to be global freeloaders, with the costs being borne by developing countries.
“It is not too late for industrialised countries to do the decent thing and contribute their fair share to upholding the rights to life, to food and other human rights of people most affected by climate impacts.  They must agree to the establishment of an effective and fair international finance mechanism to provide new and additional funding to affected people in developing countries.
“Negotiators are also poised to agree on rules for carbon trading that would not adequately protect against projects that violate human rights. These could allow, for example, climate mitigation projects on the territories of Indigenous Peoples against their wishes. Adopting rules that could harm people and don’t result in ambitious emissions reductions would be a failure worse than not reaching any agreement at all.”
Background
Amnesty calls for the final conference decision to ask countries to update their national climate plans in 2020 and ensure that these are ambitious and keep the global average temperature rise below 1.5°C. The conference decision must ask states to develop and implement these plans in a participatory way that advances human rights rather than harming them. The climate emergency is one of the greatest threats to human rights of our age – its effects wreaking famine, poverty and homelessness on great swathes of the globe. Amnesty International is calling on states to make 2020 the year in which they swerve away from this catastrophe.
 At COP 25, Amnesty has been calling on governments to: 
Commit to ambitious climate action to keep us under a global 1.5C global temperature rise;
Ensure that rules for climate trading being discussed do not allow for harm human rights, for example by not evicting Indigenous peoples from their lands in the name of forest protection;
Work together to fairly share the burden of climate change – richer countries must help others make the transition and pay for damages in poorer countries.
Ensure that gender equality and the rights of marginalised groups are part of mainstream climate policies and that people can participate in decisions affecting them.

“Today’s ruling is a landmark moment for the thousands of girls who have been excluded from school, and whose right to access education without discrimination has been violated for the past four years because of this inherently discriminatory ban. 
“It is also a glimmer of hope for all those girls who if pregnant in the future will not be punished by being forced to leave school and not being able to sit exams.
“This also delivers a clear message to other African governments who have similar bans, such as Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea, or may be contemplating them, that they should follow this ground-breaking ruling and take steps to allow pregnant girls access to education in line with their own human rights obligations.
“Authorities in Sierra Leone must now implement this judgment without delay.”

Background
Today, the regional Economic Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) Court of Justice sitting in Abuja (Nigeria) has rejected the 2015 government of Sierra Leone’s ban on pregnant girls from sitting exams and attending mainstream school.
 The Court found that the policy barring pregnant school girls from attending mainstream schools amounted to discrimination against pregnant school girls in Sierra Leone, and breached provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ rights and other international law instruments to which Sierra Leone is a party. It ordered the policy to be revoked with immediate effect.
On 17 May 2017, a Sierra Leonean NGO (WAVES) in partnership with Equality Now and IHRDA, filed a case before the ECOWAS Court to challenge the ban.  In June 2019, Amnesty International intervened as an amicus curiae (“friend of the court”).
The organisation has documented how the ban, imposed in 2015 by the then Minister of Education following the Ebola crisis, put the rights of thousands of girls under threat. It is not clear how many girls are affected by the ban. Official figures suggest three thousand, but experts mapping the situation indicate that the true figure is far higher.
Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea should follow the lead of a growing number of African governments which have adopted laws and policies that protect adolescent girls’ right to stay in school during pregnancy, demonstrating that an alternative approach is possible.

If they fail to do so, they will set the stage for decades of human rights abuses for which they will be responsible.
COMMIT TO urgent and human rights compliant climate action
It is vital that the COP25 final decision acknowledges the need for urgent climate action and for all countries to prepare or update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reflect the highest possible ambition to keep the global average temperature rise below 1.5°C. The decision must also require NDCs to be developed and implemented in a participatory manner, engaging local communities, obtaining the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous peoples, and taking into account gender considerations and human rights obligations. If states do not present new climate plans next year or if these are not ambitious enough, human rights violations will ensue from the devastating climate impacts of a world at 3 or more degrees higher than pre-industrial times.
DON’T accept RULES that will allow human rights abuses
In negotiations on carbon markets, commitments to human rights safeguards must be included. Such guarantees are necessary to ensure that negative human rights impacts are assessed prior to adopting such projects and that people directly impacted by carbon market projects have a say in shaping such measures. Not including these safeguards and an independent grievance mechanism will condemn local communities and Indigenous peoples to further human rights violations, as previous “clean” projects have done. What is at stake is the life, the health, and often the cultural survival of entire peoples who have been subject to discrimination and marginalization for hundreds of years. Adopting rules that do not result in climate ambition and can harm people would be a worse failure than not reaching any agreement at all.
Wealthiest countries must stop freeloading on developing countries
In negotiations on “loss and damage”, wealthiest countries must accept their human rights obligations to support and provide remedy, including financial compensation, to people whose rights have been negatively affected by climate impacts. Wealthy countries are responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions and should not expect developing countries to bear the full costs. Wealthy countries that refuse to pay their fair share are in practice turning their back to the almost four million people who have lost everything but their lives in the two cyclones in Mozambique earlier this year, or to residents of Pacific islands in urgent need of relocation due to sea-level rise.
Amnesty International reminds negotiators that the above demands are not minor issues promoted by a few organizations. They represent the calls for climate action and climate justice that are uniting people from around the world, bringing together Indigenous peoples, children and youth, women, people with disabilities, trade unions, LGBTI people, minority communities, people living in poverty and all those who suffers the most from the impacts of the climate crisis. Should these clear voices go unheeded, the resultant disconnect of climate negotiations from the needs and rights of people will lead to ever more climate related human rights catastrophes.

Investigations facilitated by the pioneering Citizen Evidence Lab website have already helped expose human rights violations Cameroon, war crimes in Syria and chemical weapons attacks in Sudan.
The upgraded site provides a space for human rights researchers, investigators, students and journalists to explore and share investigative techniques in human rights. It enables them to take better advantage of the digital data-streams critical for modern fact-finding, while also leading the fight against mis- and disinformation campaigns.
“Human rights investigations in the digital age are constantly evolving, and the Citizen Evidence Lab was originally created as a space to keep on top of innovations by sharing tips, tools and best practices on disciplines such as video verification, remote sensing and weapons analysis,” said Sam Dubberley, acting head of the Crisis Response Programme’s Evidence Lab at Amnesty International.
“Amnesty International pioneered the use of many of these cutting-edge techniques in the human rights sphere. With today’s re-launch of the Citizen Evidence Lab, we’re aiming to build on past successes and renew our commitment to the burgeoning open source community of human rights investigators we helped to foster.”
Why ‘citizen evidence’?
“Citizen evidence” includes images, videos, satellite imagery, large data sets and other material showing a potential human rights violation that has been collected by someone other than an official human rights investigator.
Frequently shared publicly through social media networks like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, this sort of documentation often exposes in great detail crimes that might have otherwise gone unnoticed. Although access and technology for gathering citizen evidence are constantly improving, there is also more disinformation that requires multiple data sources or tools to debunk.
Go-to resource for digital human rights investigations
Since its creation in 2014, the Citizen Evidence Lab has become a go-to resource for the thriving community of open-source human rights investigators involved in or inspired by the type of work pioneered by the Crisis Response Programme’s Evidence Lab.
It includes guides on tools and techniques to verify open source videos and images, and highlights Amnesty International case studies showing how methodologies such as remote sensing imagery and weapons analysis can expose human rights abuses. It also details and builds on innovative projects that engage thousands of volunteers to sift through data on a massive scale.
There are tutorials on techniques such as performing reverse image searches, preserving evidence from social media to avoid losing it, and using other data sources – such as satellite imagery – to verify when and where events took place.
Blogs and tutorials are authored by senior advisors in Amnesty International’s Crisis Evidence Lab, researchers as well as the community of students, partner organizations and other volunteers involved in its projects.
The site also includes practical tips and advice on how to minimize vicarious trauma from exposure to graphic and disturbing images.
“The rise of the smartphone and social media networks, alongside the lowering cost of satellite imagery has given us unprecedented access – often in near real-time – to evidence of atrocities committed a world away,” said Sam Dubberley. 
“For human rights researchers, this brings immense opportunities to investigate and expose abuses that might otherwise go unreported, but equally it brings great responsibility to adhere to best practices and operate ethically. As we sift through the noise and propaganda to get to the truth, we must also ensure we do no harm – either by putting individuals at further risk or exposing our staff and volunteers to vicarious trauma.”
Background on the Evidence Lab
The website is overseen by the Crisis Response Programme’s Evidence Lab at Amnesty International. The Evidence Lab brings together investigators, engineers, developers and others to pilot new and expanding tools such as artificial intelligence, remote sensing, weapons identification and big-data analytics.
Evidence Lab initiatives feed into dozens of Amnesty International research reports, press releases and other outputs each year. It also creates large-scale, standalone collaborative projects involving volunteers around the world, including:
•        Amnesty Decoders: a crowd-source network of tens of thousands of activists to process large volumes of data such as satellite imagery, documents, pictures or social media messages. Decoders projects aim to go beyond “clicktivism,” enabling volunteers to generate meaningful data for Amnesty International’s human rights investigations.
•        The Digital Verification Corps (DVC), a network of more than 100 multidisciplinary students at six partner universities who authenticate videos and images found on social media to support human rights research in a more complicated world of mis- and dis-information. The programme recently won the prestigious 2019 Times Higher Education award for International Collaboration.
The Evidence Lab has contributed to high-profile, impactful human rights investigations, building on Amnesty International’s legacy of pioneering citizen evidence and remote sensing, dating back to the ground-breaking Eyes on Darfur project in 2007. Just a few examples include: 
building the world’s largest crowdsourced dataset of online abuse against women in the Troll Patrol study;
exposing the Sudan armed forces’ use of chemical weapons in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur;
mapping out the extent of destruction and civilian casualties from the US-led Coalition’s air war in Raqqa, Syria;
and identifying how Cameroonian soldiers extrajudicially executed women and children, resulting in the soldiers’ prosecution – and a Peabody Award-winning documentary.

Today Yasser’s family was joined by the International Civil Liberties Monitoring Group (ICLMG), Amnesty International and the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM) to call for Minister François-Philippe Champagne to secure Yasser’s release and reunite him with his family during his trip and bring Yasser home with him.
Minister Champagne will be in Egypt to attend the inaugural Aswan Forum for Sustainable Peace and Development in Africa on December 11 and 12, 2019.
Amal Albaz, Yasser’s eldest daughter, said “for the last 295 days, my father has been asking every single day what Canada is doing to get him out and bring him home. For 10 months thousands of Canadians have been advocating for government intervention to secure his release. Emails, postcards and letters have been sent and phone calls have been made to members of parliament and Global Affairs Canada calling for urgent action. We have garnered almost 40,000 signatures from across Canada for a petition through change.org asking our Minister to intervene. On Monday we learnt our Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne is on his way to Egypt for a summit. We are appealing to him to not only raise the case, but to use all means necessary to secure my father’s release and his safe return home.”
Justin Mohammed, Amnesty Canada’s Human Rights Law and Policy Campaigner, expressed that “Amnesty International is deeply concerned with Yasser’s ongoing detention without trial in Egypt, which we consider to be arbitrary based on the information we received from the family and his lawyer. Yasser’s ongoing detention without trial is unacceptable, and Minister Champagne’s visit to Egypt provides a clear opportunity to press the Egyptian authorities to put an immediate end to the human rights abuses that Yasser is suffering.”
Tim McSorley, the National Coordinator of the ICLMG, also added that “the ICLMG continues to be deeply concerned for Mr. Albaz’s welfare. We know the terrible conditions at Tora prison, and we have received report upon report from Mr. Albaz’s family of the serious impact his imprisonment has had on his health. The lack of charge or trial also shows the complete disregard for Mr. Albaz’s fundamental rights. It appears more and more clear that he will not be released without outside intervention. This is why we are joining the Albaz family today to ask Minister Champagne to do all that is necessary on his current trip to Egypt to secure the release of Mr. Albaz and bring him home to his family and friends in Oakville, Ontario. He should not spend one minute more in an Egyptian jail. ”
Mustafa Farooq, the Executive Director of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, expressed “Canadians expect that Canada will protect people like Yasser Elbaz. We are calling on the Minister, during his visit to Egypt, to bring Yasser home with him.”
Over the last several months, Canadians have been raising concern about Yasser Albaz’s conditions, his right to an immediate release and the Canadian government’s responsibility to intervene. In the last couple of weeks, hundreds of Canadians have called their MPs, specifically asking for the Minister to go to Egypt and bring Yasser home.

In fact,...","Responding to the statement made by Aung San Suu Kyi at the International Court of Justice in The Hague today, Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director, said:
“Aung San Suu Kyi tried to downplay the severity of the crimes committed against the Rohingya population. In fact, she wouldn’t even refer to them by name or acknowledge the scale of the abuses. Such denials are deliberate,  deceitful and dangerous.
“The exodus of more than three quarters of a million people from their homes and country was nothing but the result of an orchestrated campaign of murder, rape and terror. To suggest that the military ‘did not distinguish clearly enough between fighters and civilians’ defies belief. Likewise, the suggestion that Myanmar authorities can currently and independently investigate and prosecute those suspected of crimes under international law is nothing but a fantasy, in particular in the case of senior military perpetrators who have enjoyed decades of total impunity.
“While attention is focussed on Aung San Suu Kyi today, let’s recall that this case is really about justice for the Rohingya community, including the 600,000 still in Rakhine State who are at risk of further crimes and urgently need protection. It’s also about the hundreds of thousands of refugees who can’t return to Myanmar. Despite what Suu Kyi has said today, it is not safe to do so.
“The Court and international community should move swiftly to protect Rohingya and prevent further atrocities. This includes ordering Myanmar to lift discriminatory restrictions, ensure humanitarian access, and cooperate fully with any international investigation.”
Background
Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s State Counsellor and de facto head of state, is leading Myanmar’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, to respond to a case alleging that Myanmar has breached its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention. The case was filed by The Gambia on 11 November 2019.
Today, Myanmar responded to The Gambia’s allegations in court for the first time. The Gambia has asked the ICJ to order Myanmar to take ‘provisional measures’ ‘to protect the rights of the Rohingya group’ and prevent all acts that may amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide against the community, pending formal hearings on the case.
Amnesty International’s own investigation has identified 13 senior officials – including Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military Senior General Min Aung Hlaing – as warranting investigation and prosecution for crimes against the Rohingya.

Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s State Counsellor and de facto head of state, is leading Myanmar’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands, to respond to a case alleging that Myanmar has breached its obligations under the UN Genocide Convention. The case was filed by The Gambia on 11 November 2019.
On Wednesday, 11 December 2019, Myanmar will respond to The Gambia’s allegations in court for the first time.
The first public hearings will take place between 10-12 December. The Gambia has asked the ICJ to order Myanmar to take ‘provisional measures’ ‘to protect the rights of the Rohingya group’ and prevent all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide against the community, pending formal hearings on the case.
Nicholas Bequelin, Amnesty International’s Regional Director, said:
“There is a mountain of evidence that the Myanmar military has committed crimes under international law and grave human rights violations against the Rohingya population. Yet the government of Myanmar – including Aung San Suu Kyi – has continued to dismiss, downplay or otherwise deny these accusations.
“So far, the military have evaded justice for their crimes against the Rohingya, while continuing to commit new abuses against other ethnic minorities in the country.
“If Aung San Suu Kyi is serious about serving the people of Myanmar, she should be standing side by side with victims and survivors in the pursuit of justice, truth and reparation. She should not be covering up for those suspected of criminal responsibility.”
Following the oral presentations at the ICJ, Amnesty International and a coalition of rights groups will support an event at which members of the Rohingya community will respond to the first two days of proceedings.
The “Rohingya Right of Reply” will be held from 15:00 to 17:30 (light refreshments from 14:00) at the Nutshuis, Commissarissen Room, Riviervismarkt 5, Den Haag 2513 AM.

Young people living inside a “failed system”, warns Amnesty International
Leaders will face a “growing legitimacy crisis” unless they protect rights of young people 
Climate change is one of the most important issues facing the world, according to a major new survey of young people from around the world, including Canada, published by Amnesty International today to mark Human Rights Day.
With the findings published as governments meet in Spain for the UN Climate Change Conference, the organization warns that world leaders’ failure to address the climate change crisis has left them out of step with young people.
“In this year when young people mobilised in huge numbers for the climate, it can be no surprise that many of those surveyed saw it as one of the most important issues facing the world,” said Kumi Naidoo, Secretary General of Amnesty International. 
“For Generation Z the climate crisis is one of the defining challenges of their age. This is a wake-up call to world leaders that they must take far more decisive action to tackle the climate emergency or risk the further anger of young people.”
Ipsos MORI, on behalf of Amnesty International, questioned more than 10,000 people aged 18-25 years old—also known as Generation Z—in 22 countries for the “Future of humanity” survey.
They were asked for their opinions on the current state of human rights in their country and the world, which issues they feel are most important and who they feel is responsible for addressing human rights abuses.
Respondents were asked to pick up to five issues from a list of 23 major issues facing their country and the world. Among Canadian youth surveyed, 40% said climate change was one of the most important issues facing their country, ahead of lack of housing (31%) and income inequality (30%). In total (41%) of respondents said climate change was one of the most important issues facing the world, making it the most commonly cited globally, followed by 36% who chose pollution and 31% who selected terrorism.
When asked to choose among 10 specific environmental issues, 44% of Canadian respondents selected global warming as one of the most important environmental issues facing the country, making it the most commonly selected issue, with deforestation placing second (33%) and wildfires placing a close third (32%).
Global warming was also the most commonly cited as one of the most important environmental issues facing the world (57%) out of 10 environmental issues such as ocean pollution, air pollution and deforestation.
“As we mark Human Rights Day, we need to recognize that the climate crisis will arguably be the defining issue for this generation of young people. The right to a healthy environment, including a safe climate, is essential for the enjoyment of so many other rights. It is a right that young people today have been forced to take the lead in asserting,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Generation Z “living inside a failed system”
However, the survey’s findings extend well beyond the climate crisis, reflecting the everyday struggles and concerns facing Generation Z in their own countries.
At a national level corruption was most commonly cited as one of the most important issues (36%), followed by economic instability (26%), pollution (26%), income inequality (25%), climate change (22%) and violence against women (21%).
“This generation lives in a world of widening inequality, economic instability and austerity where vast numbers of people have been left behind,” said Kumi Naidoo.
“Faced with all this, the message from young people is clear. We are living inside a failed system. The climate crisis, pollution, corruption and lack of decent work opportunities and living standards are all windows on an alarming truth about how the powerful have exploited their power for selfish and often short-term gain.”
The survey’s findings come at a time of widespread mass protests around the world, from Algeria to Chile, Lebanon, Iraq, Hong Kong and Sudan.  Many of these movements have been largely led by young people and students, who have angrily called out corruption, inequality, and abuse of power and faced violent repression for doing so.
“Amnesty International believes that young people want to see a system transformation. They want a reckoning with the climate emergency, with abuse of power, and with the system that has foisted these crises upon us. They want to see a completely different future blossoming instead of the wreckage that we are heading towards,” said Kumi Naidoo.
Call for system change built on human rights
Alongside climate change, a clear majority of young people value human rights in general and want to see their governments take most responsibility to protect them, according to the findings of the “Future of humanity” survey.
Across the countries surveyed, the majority of survey respondents agreed that: 
the protection of human rights is fundamental to the future of the countries tested (73% agree vs 11% disagree);
governments should take the wellbeing of their citizens more seriously than economic growth (63% agree vs 13% disagree); and
human rights must be protected, even if it has a negative impact on the economy (60% agree vs 15% disagree). 
Coupled with the results that show that most young people believe voting in elections is an effective method for initiating human rights change, over and above going on strike or attending a protest, the results were not all bad news for leaders who are “willing to listen”.   
“If the leaders of the world are willing to listen carefully, they will notice that Generation Z are not asking for small tweaks. Young people are looking for fundamental changes in the way the world works. If leaders fail to take that seriously, they will face a growing legitimacy crisis,” said Kumi Naidoo.  
“Above all, they must begin the new decade with a serious commitment and meaningful action to address the climate emergency, reduce inequality and put in place meaningful reforms to end abuses of power. We need systemic human rights-based changes to the economic and political systems that have brought us to the brink.”
BACKGROUND
In September 2019 Amnesty commissioned Ipsos MORI to conduct an online poll of young people aged 18-25 in 22 countries about their opinions on human rights and the state of the world. Fieldwork took place 6 September to 2 October 2019.
The countries covered span all six inhabited continents: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Hungary, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, UK, Ukraine and USA.
Interviewing was done online using panels owned by Ipsos MORI and other panel providers.  In most countries, c.500 respondents were interviewed, apart from Tunisia (395).  Quotas were applied on gender and age and where panel size allowed, region to ensure a spread of interviews.  No quotas were imposed in Tunisia.  Data was post weighted by age, gender and region to known offline proportions.  Region was excluded from Nigeria weights.  Online samples in Argentina, Brazil, India, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, South Africa, Tunisia, Ukraine are more urban, more educated and/or more affluent than the general population and the results should be viewed as reflecting the views of a more “connected” population.  Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole percentage.
The full list of questions asked were:
Q1. Which, if any, of the following do you see as the most important issues facing your country? Please select up to 5 (from a list of 23)

The two cases will be heard jointly on March 24-25, 2020.  The human rights organization was granted leave to intervene on December 4.
This case marks the first time that governmental climate action is challenged before the Supreme Court, as the legitimacy of Canada’s carbon pricing regime is called into question by several provincial governments challenging the federal government’s constitutional authority to regulate Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions in such a manner.
Amnesty International underscores that the climate crisis poses a number of threats to human rights, including the rights to life, liberty and security of the person, the right to adequate standards of living, the right to health, the rights to food and water, and the rights of Indigenous peoples. Without robust climate action at all levels of government, the climate crisis will continue to negatively impact a range of civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and disproportionately impact marginalized and vulnerable communities and groups.
Amnesty International’s intervention will underline the fundamental importance of Canada’s international human rights obligations and the need for these commitments to guide Canada’s climate action. Amnesty International will argue before the Supreme Court that constitutional debates or ambiguities with respect to division of powers between provincial and federal governments should be resolved in a way that both maximizes Canadian compliance with international obligations and facilitates provincial adherence to our obligations. Amnesty International firmly believes that Canada’s constitutional division of powers and principles of federalism must be reconciled with Canada’s international human rights obligations, which are clearly engaged by the consequences of the climate crisis.
The outcome of this case could have significant, long-lasting consequences for Canada’s present and future climate action. Amnesty International is adamant that the climate crisis is the most pressing and urgent human rights issue of our time. Consequently, climate action at all levels of government must be consistent with and adhere to international human rights obligations.

“The Philippines Human Rights Commission has today created a beacon of hope for the victims of the climate crisis.  This is the first time ever that a human rights body has said that fossil fuel corporations can be been found legally responsible for human rights harms linked to climate change. 
“While the Commission’s decision has no immediate penalties for the companies in question, their landmark announcement creates a major legal precedent. It opens the door for further litigation, and even criminal investigations, that could see fossil fuel companies and other major polluters either forced to pay damages, or their officials sent to jail for harms linked to climate change. The decision also affirms that fossil fuel companies have to respect human rights and invest in clean energy.
“We in the human rights community need to seize on the momentum created by this judgement to hold polluters and governments to account.”

“While this may sound like progress, it’s more likely just the Chinese propaganda machine’s latest attempt to shift the narrative on its horrendous human rights violations in Xinjiang in the face of growing international condemnation.
“If Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities are really being released from these repressive detention camps, then the onus is on the Chinese government to prove it.
“Otherwise the claim that former ‘trainees’ are now in ‘stable employment’ leaves them at an extremely high risk of being subjected to forced labour.
“The government should at the very least allow independent UN experts to assess the situation and allow Uyghurs and members of other ethnic minorities to freely communicate with their relatives overseas. Until now, this is something the authorities have repeatedly refused to do.
“As ever, it’s almost impossible to independently verify the Chinese government’s claims given the extreme constraints to reporting in the region and the authorities’ attempts to cut it off from the outside world.”
Background
Chinese state media reported on Monday that “trainees” participating in education and training programs in Xinjiang had “all graduated”. A government official was quoted as saying that detainees had “achieved stable employment, improved their quality of life and been living a happy life, with the help of the government”.
Amnesty International has documented an intensifying government campaign of mass internment, intrusive surveillance, political indoctrination and forced cultural assimilation against Uyghurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups living in Xinjiang. The authorities have justified the extreme measures as necessary to counter what they claim to be “terrorism” and to ensure national security. 
Compelling people placed in “re-education centres” to carry out work would be considered forced labour under international law and International Labour Organization conventions.
